               Cabinet, and at the republican sentiments to 
               <br />
               which they gave utterance. I, however,

               believe that the annexationists who are most 
               <br />
               to be feared are not those of whom he speaks, 
               <br />
               those who holdly and openly express their 
               <br />
               opinion on the questions which now agitate 
               <br />
               the country, but those rather who endeavor 
               <br />
               by all possible means, to sow the seeds of 
               <br />
               discord between us and our neighbors in the 
               <br />
               United States, and to plunge us into war. 
               <br />
               Surely those who boldly proclaim their 
               <br />
               opinions to the whole country, cannot be 
               <br />
               accused of disloyalty when they do it with 
               <br />
               the view of serving their country. I do not 
               <br />
               believe that there is a single member in this 
               <br />
               House who would wish to see our country 
               <br />
               annexed to the United States. I think, on 
               <br />
               the other hand, that all are striving to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               the means of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">establishing</span> a government and 
               <br />
               a political condition that shall bear equitably 
               <br />
               on all sections of the population without 
               <br />
               distinction of race or creed—a system which 
               <br />
               will secure the stability of our institutions 
               <br />
               and the general welfare of the country. ’I he 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has also referred to the 
               <br />
               dangers of the elective system as applied to 
               <br />
               this House, because scheming politicians 
               <br />
               without a stake in the country might acquire 
               <br />
               popularity, and work their way into the 
               <br />
               House. Let that hon. gentleman read the 
               <br />
               history of his country, and he will ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the principal men who have occupied the 
               <br />
               leading political positions were children of 
               <br />
               the people, who, thanks to their education, 
               <br />
               their talents and their perseverance, have 
               <br />
               attained to the control of the business of the 
               <br />
               country. Let him call to mind the history 
               <br />
               of the past, and he will remember that there 
               <br />
               was a time when the Legislative Council had 
               <br />
               become an obstacle to all reform and to all 
               <br />
               progress. But thanks to our energy and to 
               <br />
               our perseverance, a liberal ministry has been 
               <br />
               enabled toobtain the long-sought-for reforms. 
               <br />
               The LAFONTAINE—BALDWIN Administration, 
               <br />
               seeing that there was no possibility of obtain- 
               <br />
               ing reforms on account of the obstacles raised 
               <br />
               by the Legislative Council as then constitu- 
               <br />
               ted, had recourse to the appointment of new 
               <br />
               liberal councillors; and by the adhesion of 
               <br />
               the older ones, they succeeded in carrying 
               <br />
               their measures. The times at which these 
               <br />
               appointments were made, were as follows :— 
               <br />
               In 1848, the SHERWOOD-BADGLEY Admin- 
               <br />
               . istratiou appointed the Hon. D. B. VIGER. 
               <br />
               In this case we had a Liberal nominated by 
               <br />
               a Tory Ministry. Afterwards, on the accession 
               <br />

               Had it not been for the nomination of these 
               <br />
               members, and the adhesion given by some 
               <br />
               others, it would have been impossible ‘to 
               <br />
               reform the Legislative Council. But what 
               <br />
               results may be anticipated from the preposed 
               <br />
               constitution of the Federal Legislative Coun— 
               <br />
               cil ? By limiting the number of the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House, the prerogative of the 
               <br />
               Crown is, in fact, restricted, and a system is 
               <br />
               adopted, exactly the reverse of that which 
               <br />
               exists in England. And in the event of 
               <br />
               serious diﬁculties arising between the House 
               <br />
               of Commons and the Upper House, what 
               <br />
               would happen ? The same thing would 
               <br />
               happen which has already occurred before, 
               <br />
               but with this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference,</span> that the Crown 
               <br />
               would not have the power of infusing new 
               <br />
               elements, and legislation would thus be at a 
               <br />
               stand-still. The only course to be pursued 
               <br />
               under those circumstances will be to ask the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government to amend the consti— 
               <br />
               tution of the Council, as the pe0ple will be 
               <br />
               powerless from our having deprived them of 
               <br />
               the right of electin councillors. For my 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ed</span> that this new system 
               <br />
               will not be productive of beneﬁcial results. 
               <br />
               I do nat propose to repeat here all the argu- 
               <br />
               ments which have been already urged 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> the projected changes; but I must 
               <br />
               say, asholding my authority from the people, 
               <br />
               that the question of Confederation has 
               <br />
               never been adverted to during the two elec- 
               <br />
               tions which I have passed through, and that, 
               <br />
               therefore, I do not think that my constitu- 
               <br />
               ents expressed their opinion on this question 
               <br />
               when they elected me, or that they conferred 
               <br />
               upon me the right of changing the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of the Legislative Council, without con- 
               <br />
               sulting them in the matter. I am aware that 
               <br />
               in 1859 Confederation was referred to in a 
               <br />
               paragraph of the Speech from the Throne, 
               <br />
               but I also remember that at that time I 
               <br />
               combated the idea of Confederation, because 
               <br />
               the carrying out of tho views expressed in 
               <br />
               that paragraph would have resulted in giving 
               <br />
               all the inﬂuence to one section of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince at the expense of the other section. 
               <br />
               At that period it was not the question of 
               <br />
               Confederation which was discussed, but the 
               <br />
               question of representation based upon popu- 
               <br />
               lation, and the Upper Canada Separate 
               <br />
               School question. I stated at the time, as 
               <br />
               regarded those separate schools, that the
