               <br />
               has rolled on, I have become more capable 
               <br />
               of appreciating the course then taken, and 
               <br />
               I am now prepared to admit that it was but 
               <br />
               just and reasonable that that law should be 
               <br />
               enacted. (Hear, hear.) Ithen sympathised 
               <br />
               with those who burned the Parliament House 
               <br />
               in Montreal, and am willing to admit, that 
               <br />
               if I had been there, I would probably have 
               <br />
               been one of the ﬁrst to apply the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">torch</span> to 
               <br />
               that building, while under the inﬂuence of 
               <br />
               the feelings which inspired me at that time. 
               <br />
               But experience and reﬂection have since 
               <br />
               taught me to regard things from a very 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁ‘crent</span> point of view. We were then 
               <br />
               taught practically to feel that we really did 
               <br />
               govern ourselves; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.We</span> were made to taste 
               <br />
               the cons uences <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[of</span> self-government. We 
               <br />
               ' were tang t that questions like these must 
               <br />
               be decided by_the will of the majority of the

               <br />
               representatives in Parliament. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               There was no mistake in that case as to 
               <br />
               what the will of that majority was; and I 
               <br />
               am free to admit that the rebellious spirit 
               <br />
               then indulged in, on account of the passage 
               <br />
               of that bill, was in some respects more 
               <br />
               worthy of condemnation than the conduct 
               <br />
               of those who resorted to arms to redress the 
               <br />
               real grievances which caused the rebellion; 
               <br />
               and, in course of time, many of those who 
               <br />
               were most incensed at the passage of this 
               <br />
               measure, began to realize the fact that it was 
               <br />
               only one of the natural consequences of the 
               <br />
               new state of things ; and, step by step, the 
               <br />
               people of Canada have come to understand 
               <br />
               and appreciate the advantages of self- 
               <br />
               government. They have come now to 
               <br />
               understand that whatever is deliberately 
               <br />
               expressed as the will of the majority of the 
               <br />
               people, ought to be submitted to by the 
               <br />
               minority. (Hear, hear.) And I h0pe we 
               <br />
               have arrived at that stage in our political 
               <br />
               education, that there is no man in Canada 
               <br />
               who would‘now justify a resort to violence 
               <br />
               to resist any enactment by this Legislature,

               no matter how unpalatable it might be to 
               <br />
               the minority, and no matter how important 
               <br />
               that minority might be. Mr. SPEAKER, 
               <br />
               we are now invited to direct our attention 
               <br />
               to another union of adiﬂ‘erent kind, and on 
               <br />
               a larger scale: Of that union I have long 
               <br />
               been an advocate. I have looked forward to 
               <br />
               it for years, as a desirable event; and in 
               <br />
               proof that I have done so, I may be per- 
               <br />
               mitted to read two or three lines from the 
               <br />
               Votes and Proceedings of this House, so far 
               <br />
               back as the year 1856. I do not desire to 
               <br />
               claim for myself any special credit in the 
               <br />
               matter, but merely wish to establish my 
               <br />
               consistency, in being now, as I am, the 
               <br />
               uncompromising advocate of this measure— 
               <br />
               in being prepared to go so far, as I declared 
               <br />
               was my intention the other day, as to vote for 
               <br />
               the motion submitted by the Hon. Attorney 
               <br />
               General West for the previous question, 
               <br />
               which, under ordinary circumstances, I 
               <br />
               should look upon as a very high-handed 
               <br />
               and objectionable proposal. Sir, in 1856 I 
               <br />
               called the attention of the Hon. Attorney 
               <br />
               General <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">West—who,</span> if in his place, would 
               <br />
               readily recollect the fact—to a scheme such 
               <br />
               as that now under consideration. I urged it 
               <br />
               upon him, and prayed him to bring his great 
               <br />
               abilities to bear upon the attainment of an 
               <br />
               end of suﬂicient importance to be worthy of 
               <br />
               his continued exertions. I endeavored to 
               <br />
               convince him that, 'by identifying his name 
               <br />
               with the attainment of some great and im- 
               <br />
               portant end, he would establish for himself a 
               <br />
               reputation worthy of his talents. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">failed,</span> 
               <br />
               however, to enlist the sympathies of that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman with my views. His idea 
               <br />
               was, that it was premature to entertain any 
               <br />
               such project—that it might be well enough, 
               <br />
               perhaps, at some future period, but that it 
               <br />
               was then quite out of the question ; I never- 
               <br />
               theless proceeded to draft a series of resolu- 
               <br />
               tions, and gave notice of them two or_ three 
               <br />
               weeks in advance of the day I intended 
               <br />
               to move them. During the intervening 
               <br />
               period, I addressed myself to honorable 
               <br />
               members of the House, but, I regret to say, 
               <br />
               met with no encouragement from any nar- 
               <br />
               ter, with one single exception—the late on. 
               <br />
               Mr. MERRITT cordially approving of the 
               <br />
               idea. Finding that sufﬁcient support could 
               <br />
               not be obtained in the House to commend 
               <br />
               the idea to the country, I felt it to be pru— 
               <br />
               dent-—as even leaders of parties sometimes 
               <br />
               do under similar circumstances—not to make 
               <br />
               an exhibition of my own weakness; I came to 
               <br />
               the conclusion that the resolutions would not
