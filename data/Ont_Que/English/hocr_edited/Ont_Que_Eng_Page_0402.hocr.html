in whose legislative halls we had not a single <br />
member to represent us. We are now, on the <br />
contrary, asking to transfer the rich and prized <br />
deposit to a place which will be a part only of our <br />
common country, where our voice must be heard, <br />
and where we will have a fuller and fairer repre- <br />
sentation than the city of London or Liverpool, <br />
or Bristol, can boast of in their English House of <br />
Commons ; and this is the great difference between <br />
obtaining from England what we had not, and <br />
transferring what we now have, in order to make <br />
it more valuable and more available for our own <br />
purposes, and by far more secure. Confeder- <br />
ation, therefore, instead of depriving us of the <br />
privileges of self-government, is the only practical <br />
and reliable guarantee for its continuance. We <br />
are too small to be warranted in the hope of being <br />
able to hold it always on the strength of our own <br />
resources ; and England, if not too weak, is cer- <br />
tainly too prudent and too cautious to risk her <br />
last shilling and her last man in a country where, <br />
instead of a population of four millions, she will <br />
have scarcely one-tenth of that number to help her <br />
against the united power of a whole continent. <br />
To deny, therefore, the obvious advantages of <br />
Confederation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> must ﬁrst

not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strength —</span> at England under

were greater and stronger and happier than they <br />
now are as the two greatest nations of the <br />
world. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MY <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DEAR</span>
SIR,—In reply to your communication <br />
of this date, I beg to state that I took no notes of <br />
the observations I made at the last examination <br />
of the youth of St. Bonaventure’s College. I <br />
distinctly remember, however, that among other <br />
arguments I used to impress on parents and <br />
scholars the necessity of education, one was, that <br />
according to the tendency of the age, a union of all <br />
the British North American Provinces would take <br />
place, if not immediately, by the force of circum- <br />
stances in a few years ; and that such a union <br />
would have an extraordinary inﬂuence on the <br />
rising generation in Newfoundland. People were <br />
in the habit of saying that education of a high <br />
class was useless in this country, as the field was <br />
too limited. I repudiated that idea altogether. <br />
Newfoundlanders were not conﬁned to this island, <br />
the British Empire and the States were open to <br />
them. Wherever the English language was <br />
spoken, there was an opening for an educated<br />
Newfoundlander. But independently of that,
the <br />
Confederation of the Provinces would open <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up</span> a <br />
home-market for education and talent—a market <br />
increasing every year, and of which at present we <br />
can form no conception. The bar, for example, <br />
would be open to all ; the Central Legislature <br />
would open up a great ﬁeld for political ability ; <br />
the highest offices of the law and the government <br />
would be open to Newfoundlanders as well as to <br />
Canadians or Nova Scotians ; and I hope that they <br />
would be found perfectly qualiﬁed by education to <br />
take their places, side by side, with their fellow-<br />
confederates, and compete for the prizes the <br />
Confederation would hold out to them, on terms <br />
of perfect equality. I sincerely believe that they <br />
could do so, as, from my experience, I considered <br />
that the youth of this country have as ﬁne talents, <br />
