the <br />
commerce and sea-board towns of any foreign <br />
foe. It has been said, honorable gentlemen, <br />
that this measure is being hurried through <br />
the House, and complaint has been made <br />
that it has not been referred to the country <br />
for arbitrament. But, look at the conse- <br />
quences of so referring it to the country. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Look</span> at the consequences of
delay. You <br />
have read the telegram <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span>
which gives <br />
the news of the assembling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
the British <br />
Parliament, and I am glad to see a statement <br />
in Her Majesty’s Speech, that She has <br />
approved of the measure which is now under <br />
our consideration. Well, gentlemen, the <br />
Parliament of Great Britain will not sit for <br />
an unlimited time. Its session, this year, <br />
may be shorter than usual, for the natural <br />
dissolution of this and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assembling</span>
of a <br />
new Parliament are drawing near, and con- <br />
tending parties generally make an effort, <br />
towards the close of a Parliament, to make a <br />
change in the Administration. Any one who <br />
reads the English papers and political docu- <br />
ments will see that a change of Ministry is <br />
conﬁdently expected by some people; and if <br />
a defeat of the present Ministry takes place, <br />
and Parliament is dissolved, their own affairs <br />
will occupy the minds of British statesmen, <br />
so that when again called together, for a short <br />
time in summer, it may be merely to legis- <br />
late on local matters, and our Confederation <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">project</span> may thus be indeﬁnitely
delayed. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MB. RYAN—I think any man with <br />
his eyes open will see that events are march- <br />
ing on upon this continent with great strides. <br />
Event follows event in such rapid succession <br />
that we can hardly tell whither the tide will <br />
ﬂow next. Already we hear the great anti- <br />
cipated successes of the North. If the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">news</span>
<br />
be true that Charleston has been evacuated, <br />
it will be a severe blow to the cause of the <br />
South; and if the South be conquered, we <br />
know what have been the sentiments towards <br />
Canada expressed in the United States for <br />
the last three years. They will, perhaps, <br />
turn north for further conquests, and try to <br />
humble a power which has not in every way <br />
met their wishes. We should, at all events, <br />
be prepared to meet such a contingency, <br />
prepared to repel attack, prepared to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defend</span>
<br />
our homes and the free Constitution under <br />
which we live. I will conclude by saying <br />
that if the citizens of Montreal have been <br />
accused in former times of energy in a wrong <br />

I speak <br />
it advisedly, to use that energy for the de- <br />
fence of the province. For the people of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nationality</span> to which I belong, I
will further <br />
say they have come to this country to ﬁnd a <br />
home and they have found one, where they are <br />
not oppressed by any wrongs, where there is <br />
no invidious distinction between races and <br />
creeds. They appreciate the blessing and <br />
value of the institutions under which they <br />
live, they are ready to defend them, and <br />
they look on the union ot the British <br />
North American Provinces as the surest <br />
means of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preserving</span> and
perpetuating them. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. PRICE—Honorable gentlemen, <br />
being one of the newly elected members of <br />
this House, I would like to say a few words, <br />
by way of defining my position, before the <br />
vote is taken. Although I have said that I <br />
was in favor of Confederation as the only <br />
means by which we could make proper pro- <br />
vision for our defence, yet, until I understood <br />
the details more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clearly</span> than
what I could <br />
learn from the resolutions, I could not make <br />
up my mind to vote for it. Previous to the <br />
declaration at the election in my division, the <br />
press had circulated the views of the Confer- <br />
ence, and I went over the details so far as I <br />
was in possession of them, and the verdict of <br />
the people at the hustings was unanimously <br />
in favor of the scheme. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span>
I <br />
would like to enter into a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion</span>
of the <br />
details, clause by clause, but it is impossible <br />
to do so at the present time. It is not sur- <br />
prising that almost every member of the <br />
House is opposed to one or more of the reso- <br />
lutions; it is impossible for us, even when we <br />
go into committee on almost any subject, to <br />
unanimously agree on all the clauses. Before <br />
going further wish to thank my honorable <br />
friend the gallant knight at the head of the <br />
Government, for his kind remarks with refer- <br />
ence to my father and myself, at the opening <br />
of this debate. For the last twenty years I <br />
have been known and resided in the consti- <br />
tuency which sent me here, and if I have been <br />
elected without much opposition, it was from <br />
friendship towards me on the part of my con- <br />
stituents. Although I represent people<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
hav- <br />
ing different religious views, yet I believe <br />
only twenty-six Protestant votes were given <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> me. I have had a great deal
of personal <br />
friendship and intercourse with the Roman <br />
Catholic clergy of Lower Canada, and must <br />
say I have always found them liberal and <br />
loyal in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views,</span> and, as a
body, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">almost</span> <br />
