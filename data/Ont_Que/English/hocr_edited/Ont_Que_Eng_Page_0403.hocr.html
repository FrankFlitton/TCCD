great an adaptability for learning, as I have <br />
seen in any part of the world ; and that I never <br />
saw, in any part of Europe, boys acquitting them- <br />
selves better (and in many cases not so well) than <br />
they did at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preparatory</span>
examinations and the <br />

was the substance of the remarks I made on the <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Thus, whilst some honorable members seek <br />
to alarm Lower Canada by asserting that our <br />
religion and our nationality are in danger, <br />
here we have an Archbishop and a Bishop <br />
declaring themselves strongly in favor of <br />
Confederation, and who do not see in it any <br />
danger for their ﬂocks. And it is well <br />
known, even here, that the whole of the <br />
estimable and most respected body of the <br />
clergy, from those of the highest rank down to <br />
the very humblest of their followers, are in <br />
favor of Confederation. But the honorable <br />
member for Hochelaga, for the purpose of <br />
frightening Lower Canada, has told us that <br />
we should very soon have a legislative union, <br />
and that in that case the ﬁfty French- <br />
Canadian members from Lower Canada <br />
would coalesce with the minority of the <br />
Federal Parliament, with the view of <br />
obstructing the working of the Government. <br />
Well, what better proof could we have that <br />
we have nothing to fear, and that we shall <br />
not be exposed to danger under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confedera-</span>
<br />
tion ? History is before us to prove that <br />
there will always be an opposition, and <br />
that if an attempt is made to oppress <br />
any one section of the Confederation, <br />
its representatives would unite in a body <br />
with the minority, and having thereby con- <br />
stituted a majority, would prevent any injus- <br />
tice on the part of the Federal Government. <br />
I beg to thank the hon. member for having, <br />
against his will, furnished me with so strong <br />
an argument in favor of Confederation. The <br />
hon. member then appealed to the national <br />
passions and the prejudices of race. He told <br />
us that the Protestant minority in Lower <br />
Canada would have to seek protection <br />
against the majority of that section. I re- <br />
peat it, he made that assertion in English, <br />
and would not repeat it in French. But <br />
what treatment did the minority receive in <br />
Lower Canada when she had a separate Par- <br />
liament? Did not the French-Canadian <br />
majority always exercise liberality towards <br />
our fellow-countrymen whose origin and re- <br />
ligion was different from ours ? Thank <br />
God, our race is not a persecuting race ; it <br />
has ever been liberal and tolerant. The hon. <br />

I have not found fault with his having <br />

him whilst he spoke, and consequently I do <br />
not choose to be interrupted myself. I do <br />
not wish to put words into his mouth which <br />
he has not uttered, but I wish to have it <br />
understood that he made an appeal to the <br />
English of Lower Canada, calling upon them <br />
to reﬂect on the fate of their race and their re- <br />
ligion,when he read an extract from the report <br />
of Lord DURHAM, the hon. gentleman took <br />
very good care to read it in English only— <br />
