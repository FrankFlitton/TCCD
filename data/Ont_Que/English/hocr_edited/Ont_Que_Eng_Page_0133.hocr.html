<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> merits, when, in one day, such a
startling poli- <br />
tical revolution was brought about ? Was it, <br />
think you, a doubtful consideration that could <br />
have induced the Upper Canada Opposition, <br />
almost as one man, to cast down their party <br />
intrenchments and make common cause with <br />
their opponents? Could there have been the <br />
slightest doubt as to the sentiments of our <br />
people and the imperative necessity of imme- <br />
diate action, when such men as now sit on <br />
the treasury benches, were forced, by their <br />
supporters, to unite for the settlement of this <br />
question? And could there be a more con- <br />
clusive proof of the ripeness of public opinion <br />
than the unanimous and cordial manner in <br />
which our so uniting has been sustained <br />
by the press of all parties, and by the elec- <br />
tors at the polls? (Hear, hear.) Never, <br />
I venture to assert, was any great measure so <br />
thoroughly understood, and so cordially en- <br />
dorsed by the people of Canada, as this measure <br />
now under consideration. (Hear, hear.)— <br />
The British Government approves of it—the<br />
Legislative Council approves of it—this <br />
House almost unanimously approves of it— <br />
the press of all parties approves of it— <br />
and though the scheme has already been di- <br />
rectly submitted to ﬁfty out of the one hun- <br />
dred constituencies into which Canada is di- <br />
vided, only four candidates ventured to appear <br />
at the hustings in opposition to it—all of <br />
them in Lower Canada—and but two of them <br />
were elected. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And</span> yet, sir, we are <br />
to be told that we are stealing a march upon <br />
the country; that it is not understood b the <br />
people; and that we must dissolve the ease <br />
upon it, at a vast cost to the exchequer, and <br />
at the risk of allowing political partisanship <br />
to dash the fruit from our hands at the very <br />
moment we are about to grasp it! (Hear, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span> Sir, I have no fears
whatever of an <br />
appeal to the people. I cannot pretend to <br />
speak as to the popular feeling in Lower Can- <br />
ada, but I think thoroughly understand the <br />
popular mind of the western province, and <br />
hesitate not to say that there are not five <br />
gentlemen in this chamber (if so many) who <br />
could go before their constituents in Upper <br />
Canada in opposition to this scheme, with the <br />
slightest chance of being returned. (Hear, <br />
hear.) It is because I thoroughly compre- <br />
hend the feelings of the people upon it, that <br />
I urge the adoption of this measure at the <br />
earliest possible moment. The most gross <br />
injustice is to be rectified by it; the tax-payer <br />
is to be clothed with his rightful inﬂuence by <br />
it; new commercial relations are to be opened <br />
up by it; a new impulse to the industrial <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> pursuits of the country will be given by
it— <br />
and I for one would feel myself false to the <br />
cause I have so long sustained, and false to <br />
the best interests of my constituents, if I <br />
permitted one hour unnecessarily to pass with- <br />
out bringing it to a ﬁnal issue. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span>
It <br />
was only by the concurrence of most propiti- <br />
ous circumstances that the wonderful <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">progress</span>
<br />
this movement has made could have ac- <br />
complished. Most peuliar were the circum- <br />
stances that enable such a coalition to be <br />
formed as that now existing for the settlement <br />
of this question—and who shall say at what <br />
hour it may not be rent asunder? And yet, <br />
who will venture to affirm that if party spirit <br />
in all its fiereeness were once more to be let <br />
loose amongst us, there would be the slightest <br />
hope that this great question could be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ap-</span>
<br />
proached with that candor and harmony neces- <br />
sary to its satisfactory solution? (Hear, hear.) <br />
Then, sir, at the very moment we resolved to <br />
deal with this question of constitutional change, <br />
the Maritime Provinces were about to assem- <br />
ble in joint conference to consider whether <br />
they ought not to form a union among them- <br />
selves—and the way was thus most propitiously <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opened</span> up for the consideration
of a union <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of?</span> <br />
a British America. The civil war too, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span>
<br />
the neighboring republic; the possibility of <br />
war between Great Britain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> <br />
States; the threatened repeal of the Recipro- <br />
city Treaty; the threatened abolition of the <br />
American bonding system for goods in <br />
transitu to and from these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provin</span>ces; the un- <br />
settled position of the Hudson’s Bay Company; <br />
and the changed feeling of England as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
<br />
the relations of great colonies to the parent <br />
state;—all combine at this moment to arrest <br />
earnest attention to the gravity of the situa- <br />
tion, and unite us all in one vigorous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effort</span>
to <br />
meet the emergency like men. (Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.)</span>
<br />
The interests to be affected by this scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <br />
union are very large and varied—but the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pres-</span>
<br />
sure of circumstances upon all the colonies is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so</span> <br />
serious at this moment, that if we cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now</span> <br />
banish partisanship and sectionalism and <br />
petty objections, and look at the matter on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> <br />
broad intrinsic merits, what hope is there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <br />
our ever being able to do so? An appeal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
<br />
the people of Canada on this measure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">simply</span>
<br />
means postponement of the question for a <br />
year—and who can tell how changed ere then <br />
may be the circumstances surrounding us? <br />
Sir, the man who strives for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">postponement</span>
<br />
of this measure on any ground, is doing what <br />
he can to kill it almost as effectually as if he <br />
voted against it. (Hear, hear.) Let there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> <br />
no mistake as to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manner</span> in
