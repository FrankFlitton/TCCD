owning the same alle- <br />
giance, and being, for the most part, of the <br />
same blood and lineage : if we wish to be able <br />
to afford to each other the means of mutual <br />
defence and support against aggression and <br />
attack—this can only be obtained by a union <br />
of some kind between the scattered and weak <br />
boundaries composing the British North <br />
American Provinces. (Cheers). The very <br />
mention of the scheme is ﬁtted to bring with it <br />
its own approbation. &nbsp; Supposing that in the <br />
spring of the year 1865, half a million of people <br />
were coming from the United Kingdom to <br />
make Canada their home, although they <br />
brought only their strong arms and willing <br />
hearts ; though they brought neither skill nor <br />
experience nor wealth, would we not receive <br />
them with open arms, and hail their presence <br />
in Canada as an important addition to our <br />
strength ? &nbsp; Butwhen , by the proposed union, <br />
we not only get nearly a million of people to <br />
join us—when they contribute not only their <br />
numbers, their physical strength, and their <br />
desire to beneﬁt their position, but when we <br />
know that they consist of old-established com- <br />
munities, having a large amount of realised <br />
wealth, — composed of people possessed of <br />
skill, education and experience in the ways <br />
of the New World — people who are as <br />
much Canadians, I may say, as we are— <br />
people who are imbued with the same feelings <br />
of loyalty to the Queen, and the same desire <br />
for the continuance of the connection with <br />
the Mother Country as we are, and at the <br />
same time, have a like feeling of ardent at- <br />
tachment for this, our common country, for <br />
which they and we would alike ﬁght and <br />
shed our blood, if necessary. &nbsp; When all this <br />
is considered, argument is needless to prove <br />
the advantage of such a union. (Hear, hear.) <br />
There were only three modes,—if I may re- <br />
turn for a moment to the difficulties with <br />
which Canada was surrounded,—only three <br />
modes that were at all suggested, by which <br />
the dead lock in our affairs, the anarchy we <br />
dreaded, and the evils which retarded our <br />
prosperity, could be met or averted. &nbsp; One <br />
was the dissolution of the union between <br />
Upper and Lower Canada, leaving them <br />
as they were before the union of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1841.</span>
<br />
I believe that that proposition, by itself <br />
had no supporters. &nbsp; It was felt by every <br />
one that, although it was a course that <br />
would do away with the sectional difficulties <br />
which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existed,—though</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> would
remove the&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">pressure&nbsp;on
the part of the people of Upper&nbsp;</p>

representation based upon<br />

population,—and the jealousy of the people <br />
of Lower Canada lest their institutions should <br />
be attacked and prejudiced by that principle <br />
in our representation ; yet it was felt by <br />
every thinking man in the province that it <br />
would be a retrograde step, which would&nbsp; <br />
throw back the country to nearly the same <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">position as it
occupied before the union,— <br />
that it would lower the credit enjoyed by <br />
United Canada,—that it would be the break- <br />
ing up of the connection which had existed <br />
for nearly a quarter of a century, and, under <br />
which, although it had not been completely <br />
successful, and had not allayed altogether the <br />
local jealousies that had their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">root</span>
in circum- <br />
stances which arose before the union, our <br />
province, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span>
whole, had nevertheless pros- <br />
pered and increased. &nbsp; It was felt that a dis- <br />
solution of the union would have destroyed <br />
all the credit that we had gained by being a <br />
united province, and would have left us two <br />
weak and ineffective governments, instead of <br />
one powerful and united peeple. (Hear, <br />
hear.) &nbsp; The next mode suggested, was the <br />
granting of representation by population. <br />
Now, we all know the manner in which that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> was
and is regarded by Lower <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> ; that while in
Upper Canada the <br />
desire and cry for it was daily augmenting, <br />
the resistance to it in Lower Canada was pro- <br />
portionably increasing in strength. &nbsp; Still, if <br />
some such means of relieving us from the <br />
sectional jealousies which existed between the <br />
two Canadas, if some such solution of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulties</span>
as Confederation had not been <br />
found, the representation by population must <br />
eventually have been carried ; no matter <br />
though it might have been felt in Lower <br />
Canada, as being a breach of the Treaty of <br />
Union, no matter how much it might have <br />
been felt by the Lower Canadians that it <br />
would sacriﬁce their local interests, it is cer- <br />
tain that in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">progross</span>
of events represen- <br />
tation by population would have been car- <br />
ried ; and, had it been carried — I speak <br />
here my own individual sentiments—I do <br />
not think it would have been for the inter- <br />
est of Upper Canada. &nbsp; For though Upper <br />
Canada would have felt that it had received <br />
what it claimed as a right, and had succeed <br />
in establishing its ight, yet it would have <br />
left the Lower Province with a sullen feel- <br />
ing of injury and injustice. &nbsp; The Lower <br />
Canadians would not have worked cheer- <br />
fully under such a change of system, but <br />
would have ceased to be what they are <br />
now— a nationality, with representatives <br />
