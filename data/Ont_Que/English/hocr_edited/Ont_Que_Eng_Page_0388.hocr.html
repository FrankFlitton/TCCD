<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">would have abandoned the control of our <br />
public lands to the British element, of which <br />
he now pretends to stand in mortal fear. I <br />
repeat the declaration that it is impossible <br />
for us to continue in our present position ; that <br />
annexation to the United States would be <br />
the greatest disaster that could befal us ; and <br />
that it is impossible, that it would be dis- <br />
astrous to think of the independence of the <br />
country ; that the project for the Confeder- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ation</span> of the two Canadas as
proposed by the <br />
honorable member for Hochelaga is not de-<br />
sirable, and would not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> any
guarantee <br />
for the institutions of Lower Canada, but <br />
that the Confederation of all the Provinces of <br />
British North America would be preferable, <br />
and is our only remedy. The Confederation <br />
would have the effect of giving us more <br />
strength than we now possess ; we should <br />
form but one nation, one country, for all <br />
general matters <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affecting</span> our
interests as a <br />
people. But when I speak of a great and <br />
powerful nation, far be it from me to wish <br />
that we should form an independent nation, <br />
and that we should abandon the protection <br />
of the British ﬂag ; on the contrary, I ear- <br />
nestly hope that we shall long remain under <br />
the protection of that ﬂag. What I would <br />
say is, that with Confederation we shall be <br />
in a better position for self-defence, and to <br />
aid the Mother Country under certain exi- <br />
gencies, than we are at the present time. <br />
Having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> the
Central Govern- <br />
ment will be in a position to have its orders <br />
carried out over its whole territory ; and when <br />
the question of defence comes up, it will not <br />
be obliged to consult four or ﬁve different <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislatures,</span> but it will be able
to organize <br />
our defences immediately and without ob- <br />
struction. Besides, we shall have acquired <br />
a standing which we have not hitherto <br />
attained in our relations with other countries <br />
with which we have dealings. It is of no <br />
small importance for the inhabitants of <br />
a country to have a standing in foreign <br />
countries, and not to be treated as men <br />
of inferior position. When Canadians go <br />
to London or elsewhere out of their own <br />
country, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> have no recognized
posi- <br />
tion, because we are only a simple colony. <br />
But under the Confederation we shall be <br />
protected by England, and besides we shall <br />
have a position in foreign lands, the position <br />
which every man enjoys who belongs to a <br />
great nation. On this very point a public <br />
writer wrote some few years ago in a London <br />
newspaper an article from which I will <br />

House. The matter under consideration was <br />
the cession of the right of ﬁshery on the <br />
Banks of Newfoundland by England <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
<br />
France. He says :— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now, see the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of this want of association <br />
and representation here. The basis of a treaty is <br />
agreed upon between Great Britain and France, <br />
by which Great Britain agreed<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> to
give to <br />
France the exclusive right of fishing upon a great<br />
portion of the coast of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland</span>,
a thing <br />
unjustiﬁed by any former treaty. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundlan</span>d
<br />
no sooner heard of it than she remonstrated, and <br />
denied the right of Great Britain to sign away to <br />
a foreign nation the property of the people of <br />
Newfoundland ; and, in fact, set at defiance the <br />
action of the Imperial Government. Now, this is <br />
not only derogatory to us as a nation, but it illus- <br />
trates the danger which may arise to the colonies <br />
from the Imperial Government not being properly <br />
informed on such subjects. For, from a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">careful</span>
<br />
perusal of all the treaties on the subject in <br />
question, we cannot but believe that Newfound-<br />
land was right. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It is evident that, if the Confederation had <br />
existed at that period, England would not <br />
have acted without consulting us ; but in those <br />
days they used to say, “ They are Canadians, <br />
mere colonists, &amp;c.;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”</span> and as we
were then <br />
separated, of course we had to submit ; our <br />
rights were not protected as they will be <br />
when we are united. Under Confederation, <br />
England will consult us in all matters which <br />
affect our interests, and we shall be able to <br />
make ourselves effectually heard in London. <br />
In proof of this I cite from the same <br />
writer :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Here is another question which especially affects<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
Canada. In the course of last year, the subsidy <br />
of £176,340 per annum, paid to the Cunard <br />
vessels plying between Liverpool and the United <br />
States. was renewed for a period of six years by <br />
the Imperial Government. Another postal subsidy <br />
of £78,000 was just being granted by the Imperial <br />
Government to a new line of steamers between <br />
Galway and the United States, in this case also <br />
without consulting the interests of British North <br />
America. This is a great injustice, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particularly</span>
<br />
to Canada, for that province has expended large <br />
sums in the opening of water communication in <br />
the valley of the River St. Lawrence, canals which <br />
have become valueless from having to compete <br />
with the United States routes, encouraged by a <br />
subsidy from the Imperial Government of nearly <br />
£300, 00 per annum , while Canada on the other <br />
hand receives no aid whatever from the Imperial <br />
Government, but is compelled to subsidize a line <br />
of its own (to attract a feeble share of the trade) <br />
to the extent of £50,000 per annum.” <br />
