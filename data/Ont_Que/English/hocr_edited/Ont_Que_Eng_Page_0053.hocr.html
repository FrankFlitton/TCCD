England would deeply regret <br />
the loss of these provinces—yet, if the peo- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> le of British North
America after full de- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liberation</span> had
stated that they considered it <br />
was for their interest, for the advantage of <br />
the future of British North America to sever <br />
the tie, such is the generosity of the people <br />
of England, that, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whatever</span>
their desire to <br />
keep these colonies, they would not seek to <br />
compel us to remain unwilling subjects of the <br />
British Crown. &nbsp; If therefore, at the Confer- <br />
ence, we had arrived at the conclusion, that <br />
it was for the interest of these provinces that a <br />
severance should take place,I am sure that Her <br />
Majesty and the Imperial Parliament would <br />
have sanctioned that severance. We accord- <br />
ingly felt that there was a propriety in giving <br />
a distinct declaration of opinion on that point, <br />
and that, in framing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution,</span>
its ﬁrst <br />
sentence should declare, that “ The Execu- <br />
tive authority or government shall be vested <br />
in the Sovereign of the United Kingdom of <br />
Great Britain and Ireland, and be adminis- <br />
tered according to the well understood prin- <br />
ciples of the British Constitution, by the <br />
Sovereign personally, or by the Representa- <br />
tive of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sovereign</span>
duly authorised.” That <br />
resolution met with the unanimous assent of <br />
the Conference. &nbsp; The desire to remain con- <br />
nected with Great Britain and to retain our <br />
allegiance to Her Majesty was unanimous. <br />
Not a single suggestion was made, that it <br />
could, by any possibility, be for the interest <br />
of the colonies, or of any section or portion of <br />
them, that there should be a severance <br />
of our connection. &nbsp; Although we knew it to <br />
be possible that Canada, from her position, <br />
might be exposed to all the horrors of war, <br />
by reason of causes of hostility arising <br />
between Great Britain and the United States <br />
—causes over which we had no control, and <br />
which we had no hand in bringing about— <br />
yet there was a unanimous feeling of <br />
willingness to run all the hazards of war, if <br />
war must come, rather than lose the con- <br />
nection between the Mother Country and <br />
these colonies. &nbsp; (Cheers) &nbsp; We provide that <br />
“ the Executive authority shall be ad- <br />
ministered by the Sovereign personally, or <br />
by the Representative of the Sovereign duly <br />
authorized.” &nbsp; It is too much to expect <br />
that the Queen should vouchsafe us her <br />
personal governance or presence, except to <br />
pay us, as the heir apparent of the Throne, <br />
our future Sovereign has already paid us,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">the graceful
compliment of a visit. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&nbsp;

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ministered by Her
Majesty’s Represen- <br />
tative. &nbsp; We place no restriction on Her <br />
Majesty’s prerogative in the selection of <br />
her representative. &nbsp; As it is now, so <br />
it will be if this Constitution is adopt- <br />
ed. The Sovereign has unrestricted free- <br />
dom of choice. &nbsp; Whether in making her <br />
selection she may send us one of her own <br />
family, a Royal Prince, as a Viceroy to rule <br />over us, or one of
the great statesmen of <br />
England to represent her, we know not <br />
We leave that to Her Majesty in all conﬁ- <br />
dence. &nbsp; But we may be permitted to <br />
hope, that when the union takes place, <br />
and we become the great country which <br />
British North America is certain to be, <br />
it will be an object worthy the ambition <br />
of the statesmen of England to be charged <br />
with presiding over our destinies. &nbsp; (Hear, <br />
hear.) &nbsp; Let me now invite the atten- <br />
tion of the House to the provisions in <br />
the Constitution respecting the legisla- <br />
tive power. The sixth resolution says, <br />
“ There shall be a general legislature or parlia- <br />
ment for the federated provinces, composed of <br />
a Legislative Council and a House of Com- <br />
mons.” &nbsp; This resolution has been cavilled <br />
at in the English press as if it excluded the <br />
Sovereign as a portion of the legislature. <br />
In one sense, that stricture was just—be- <br />
cause in strict constitutional language, the <br />
legislature of England consists of King, <br />
Lords and Commons. But, on the other <br />
hand, in ordinary parlance we speak of <br />
“ the King and his Parliament,” or “the <br />
King summoning his Parliament," &nbsp; the <br />
three estates—Lords spiritual, temporal <br />
Lords, and the House of Commons, and I <br />
observe that such a writer as Hallam occa- <br />
sionally uses the word Parliament in that <br />
restricted sense. &nbsp; At best it is merely a <br />
verbal criticism. &nbsp; The legislature of British <br />
North America will be composed of <br />
King, Lords, and Commons. &nbsp; The Legi- <br />
slative Council will stand in the same <br />
relation to the Lower House, as the <br />
House of Lords to the House of Commons <br />
in England, having the same power of <br />
initiating all matters of legislation, except the <br />granting of money.
&nbsp; As regards the Lower <br />case, it may not
appear to matter much, <br />
whether it is called the House of Commons <br />
or House of Assembly. &nbsp; It will hear what- <br />
ever name the Parliament of England may <br />
choose to give it, but “The House of Com- <br />
mons” is the name we should prefer, as <br />
showing that it represents the Commons of <br />
