<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ly after the union as before, it will cost
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2,170,000</span> or $1,054,000 more
than the <br />
amount of the local subsidy. I am sure no <br />
hon. gentleman will believe that we are going <br />
to be more saving of the public money in <br />
the future than we were in those early days <br />
of our history. Hon. gentlemen, it is said <br />
that the people of the country have had those <br />
resolutions before them, that they perfectly <br />
understand them, and that they are pre- <br />
pared to a dispassionate judgment in <br />
the matter. It ill becomes the members of <br />
the Government to make such a statement. <br />
Why, what has been witnessed on the ﬂoor <br />
of this House ? A simple question was put <br />
to the Hon. Commissioner of Crown Lands <br />
as to the manner in which the members of <br />
the Legislative Councils of the various pro- <br />
vinces were to be appointed. The Hon. <br />
Commissioner informed us that the appoint- <br />
ments were to be made by the local govern- <br />
ments, and he was conﬁrmed in that view by <br />
the hon. and gallant Premier, who had the <br />
dignity conferred upon him of presiding over <br />
the Conference of delegates held in this <br />
city. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON.</span>
MR. CAMPBELL—I do not think <br />
that my hon. colleague said anything on the <br />
subject. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—I understood him <br />
to conﬁrm the statement of the Hon. Com- <br />
missioner of Crown Lands. But at all <br />
events, he heard the statement and did not <br />
object to it. But what did you ﬁnd? After <br />
the absurdity of that position was pointed <br />
out, my hon. friend, the Commissioner of <br />
Crown Lands, asks a day to give an answer <br />
to the question, and he comes down next <br />
day and gives a totally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span>
reply. A <br />
few days later, the question of the export <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty</span> on the minerals of Nova
Scotia came <br />
under consideration, and I understood the <br />
Hon. Commissioner of Crown Lands as <br />
saying that in his opinion only the coal and <br />
minerals exported to foreign countries would <br />
be liable to duty. But according to the <br />
explanations given by the hon. gentleman <br />
afterwards, I understand that the export <br />
duty will apply to all coal and minerals <br />
exported from Nova Scotia. My hon. friend <br />
went on to explain the meaning of this <br />
export duty. And what is his explanation ? <br />
He tells us that it is nothing more than a <br />
royalty. The export duty is imposed simply <br />
upon the coal which leave the country. In <br />
Nova Scotia they now impose a royalty, and <br />
that royalty they intend to change for an <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> export duty, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> <br />
favor will he this—that on the coal they <br />
consume <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves</span> there will be
no duty, <br />
but on the coal they send to Canada there <br />
will be this barrier of an export duty. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. ROSS—My hon. friend will <br />
see this, that had all the Crown lands in the <br />
different colonies been placed in the hands <br />
of the General Government, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span>
<br />
Government would have received all the <br />
proceeds therefrom. But those have been <br />
given to the local governments, and as in <br />
Upper Canada we will have timber dues, so <br />
in Nova Scotia they are entitled to a revenue <br />
from their coal. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—Any one not <span class="unclear" title="“Letters" are="" unclear,="" possibly="" ac="" but="" don="" t="" know="" word”="">?</span>- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quanted</span> with the subject would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">naturally</span> <br />fancy from the language of my hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend</span>
<br />
that under Federation we are to have some- <br />
thing which we did not possess before. But <br />
the Crown lands are the property of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Upper</span>
<br />
and Lower Canada now, and we are entitled <br />
to the revenue from them. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. ROSS—And so is Nova Scotia <br />
entitled to a revenue from their coal. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE —But you give them <br />
a privilege not accorded to the other pro- <br />
vinces of imposing export duties. Hon. <br />
gentlemen, I would now desire to allude to <br />
another matter which I think the people do <br />
not thoroughly understand, and that is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
<br />
apportionment of the public debt. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stated</span>
<br />
before and I again assert that revenue is the <br />
only true basis on which the people should <br />
go into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> as regards
their debt ; <br />
and I think my hon. friend from the <br />
Saugeen Division (Hon. Mr. MACPHERSON<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">)</span><br />
saw the matter in the same light. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MACPHERSON—</span>Not in this<br />
case, because we have not the revenue to <br />
base it upon. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CURRIE—Why have we not<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
the revenue to base it upon ? Hon. gentle- <br />
men, the Trade Returns of Nova Scotia, <br />
New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, <br />
are in the Library below, and twenty-four <br />
hours’ work of a competent accountant would <br />
shew what each province would contribute <br />
to the general revenue from her trade under <br />
our present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CAMPBELL—But does not <br />
the hon. gentleman see that when the tariffs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
<br />
are assimilated, they will not bring in the <br />
future what the have brought in the past? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CURRIE—This</span>
I can see, that <br />
you are giving to the Lower Provinces pri- <br />
vileges which we do not enjoy&nbsp; Hon. gen. <br />
