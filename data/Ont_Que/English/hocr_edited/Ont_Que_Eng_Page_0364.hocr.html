<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> prior to the Federal union? I replied “
Yes, <br />
the General Government would be liable <br />
for all the debts contracted before this <br />
date.” “But,” says he, “ there are certain <br />
sums above the sixty-two and a half mil- <br />
lions of dollars which will have to be settled <br />
as between Upper and Lower Canada. And <br />
what will become of the amount due to the <br />
seigniors? It may be that Lower Canada <br />
will repudiate that portion of the debt so <br />
allotted her.” Well, I reply, Lower Canada <br />
cannot do that, if she were 'disposed to do so; <br />
but I do not believe that Lower Canada would <br />
be disposed to repudiate a debt which she has <br />
herself contracted—a debt of honor—a debt <br />
which is, as it were, sacred. But even if <br />
Lower Canada were disposed to do so, the <br />
General Government are liable for the amount <br />
of that debt, and as the General Government <br />
has to give to Lower Canada a subsidy of 80 <br />
cents per head, it would, of course, take very <br />
good care to substract from the amount allotted <br />
to Lower Canada the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest</span>
which is to be <br />
paid to the seigniors. (Hear, hear.) So that <br />
on that score—I do not know if the hon. <br />
gentleman is himself a seignior or not, but <br />
he seems to take a great interest in the seig- <br />
niors—the hon. member need not be uneasy <br />
at all. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BUREAU—What I stated was, <br />
that under the authority of a public act, <br />
special appropriations have been made for the <br />
redemption of the debt due to the seigniors, <br />
and that the putting aside of that act I consider <br />
an act of repudiation. Then, for the sake of <br />
argument I stated this, that you are shewing <br />
an example of repudiation. But I added that <br />
if you were going to pay to Lower Canada <br />
what you state, or her Local Government; <br />
in the event of her refusing to pay the seig- <br />
niors, probably the General Government would <br />
retain sufficient from the 80 cents <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per</span>
head <br />
apportionment for that purpose. I do not <br />
wish to push the argument further; and I <br />
may state that it was only for the sake of <br />
argument that I advanced the proposition. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON.</span>
SIR E. P. TACHÉ— No law has <br />
been repealed—no repudiation taken place. <br />
The seignors, as it appears to me—I may not <br />
have understood the law, for I am no lawyer <br />
—will have additional security. That, it <br />
seems to me, is a plain fact. (Hear, hear.) <br />
Then the hon. member from DeLorimier found <br />
a great deal of fault with the manner—I must <br />
say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the able manner in which the
gallant <br />
Knight (Hon. Sir N. F. BELLEAU) explained <br />
the action of responsible government in this <br />
country. The honorable Knight<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> showed

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> responsible government protected the
French <br />
Catholics in Lower Canada under Confeder- <br />
ation, saying that if ever an act of ﬂagrant <br />
injustice was to be attempted in the Federal <br />
Government, the whole of the Lower Canadians <br />
would join as one man, and by uniting with <br />
the minority against the Government—be- <br />
cause honorable gentlemen must know that <br />
there always will be minorities—by means of <br />
thus strengthening the minority any Admin- <br />
istration could be ousted out of their places in <br />
twenty-four hours. My honorable friend <br />
stated this, and be state it justly; he said <br />
so, well aware of what he was saying . But <br />
the honorable gentleman from DeLorimier <br />
comes forward and says: “ Don’t you recol- <br />
lect that at one time the Upper Canadians <br />
with the minority from Lower Canada, united <br />
to impose upon Lower Canada their will?” I <br />
tell you, honorable gentlemen, that they never <br />
did harm to Lower Canada, and that they <br />
never could do harm to Lower Canada had <br />
the so chosen. And why? The French <br />
had the use of their own language conceded <br />
to them in order to bring them to support the <br />
Government, and much more would have been <br />
done to accomplish the same end. I am re- <br />
ferring now to the Government of the day <br />
from 1844 to 1848. That Government would <br />
have given you, what was passed afterwards, <br />
an act to secure to the sufferers the payment <br />
of their losses, the Rebellion Losses Bill.— <br />
They would have given every shilling of those <br />
losses, and they would have given you more <br />
if you would have consented to become their <br />
followers. The honorable gentleman made <br />
out no case at all, and he could not have <br />
studied parliamentary history since 1841 cor- <br />
rectly. Had he done so, he would have found <br />
that at that period what was called responsi- <br />
ble government was not worked out. Sir <br />
CHARLES <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BAGOT,</span> it is true, had
lent himself <br />
to the views of his advisers, and responsible <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> had been going on
perfectly un- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> er him; but then he died here, and
honora- <br />
ble gentlemen must understand that Lord <br />
METCALF was opposed to responsible gov- <br />
ernment. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BUREAU—Still we had re- <br />
sponsible government. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. SIR E. P. TACHÉ—You had it in <br />
name only, but not in practice; otherwise Hon. <br />
Mr. BALDWIN and on. Mr. LAFONTAINE <br />
would never have left the Cabinet. They re- <br />
signed their seats in Council because they held <br />
themselves responsible to Parliament, while <br />
Lord <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">METCALF</span> chose to appoint
persons to office <br />
without consulting them, as his constitutional <br />
