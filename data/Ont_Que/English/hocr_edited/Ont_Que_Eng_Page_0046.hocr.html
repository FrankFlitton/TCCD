<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ican Colonies were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great—so</span>
great as almost, <br />
in the opinion of many, to make it hopeless. <br />
And with that view it was the policy of the <br />
Government,if they could not succeed in pro- <br />
curing a union between all the British North <br />
American Colonies, to attempt to free the <br />
country from the dead-lock in which we were <br />
placed in Upper and Lower Canada, in conse- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quence</span> of the
difference of opinion between <br />
the two sections, by having a severance to a <br />
certain extent of the present union between <br />
the two provinces of Upper and Lower Can- <br />
ada, and the substitution of a Federal Union <br />
between them. &nbsp; Most of us, however, I may <br />
say, all of us,were agreed—and I believe every <br />
thinking man will agree—as to the expedi- <br />
ency of effecting a union between all the pro- <br />
vinces, and the superiority of such a design, <br />
if it were only practicable, over the smaller <br />
scheme of having a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federal</span>
Union between <br />
Upper and Lower Canada alone. &nbsp;By a happy <br />
concurrence of events, the time came when <br />
that proposition could be made with a hope of <br />
success. &nbsp; By a fortunate coincidence the de— <br />
sire for union existed in the Lower Provinces, <br />
and a feeling of the necessity of strengthening <br />
themselves by collecting together the scat- <br />
tered colonies on the sea-board, had induced <br />
them to form a convention of their own for <br />
the purpose of effecting a union of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mari-</span> <br />
time Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Bruns- <br />
wick, and Prince Edward Island, the legisla- <br />
tures of those colonies having formally autho- <br />
rized their respective governments to send a <br />
delegation to Prince Edward Island for the <br />
purpose of attempting to form a union of some <br />
kind. &nbsp; Whether the union should be federal <br />
or legislative was not then indicated, but a <br />
union of some kind was sought for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pur-</span>
<br />
pose of making of themselves one people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span> <br />
stead of three. &nbsp; We, ascertaining that they <br />
were about to take such a step, and knowing <br />
that if we allowed the occasion to pass, if they <br />
did indeed break up all their present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span><br />
organizations and form a new one, it could <br />
not be expected that they would again readily <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">destroy</span> the
new organization which they had <br />
formed,—the union of the three provinces on <br />
the sea-board,—and form another with Can- <br />
ada. &nbsp; Knowing this, we availed ourselves of <br />
the opportunity, and asked if they would&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re-</span> <br />
ceive a deputation from Canada, who would <br />
go to meet them at Charlottetown, for the <br />
purpose of laying before them the advantages <br />
of a larger and more extensive union, by the <br />
junction of all the provinces in one great gov- <br />
ernment under our common Sovereign. They <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> at once kindly
consented to receive and hear <br />
us.&nbsp; They did receive us cordially and gener- <br />
ously, and asked us to lay our views before <br />
them. We did so at some length, and so sat- <br />
isfactory to them were the reasons we gave ; so <br />
clearly, in their opinion, did we shew the ad- <br />
vantages of the greater union over the lesser, <br />
that they at once set aside their own project, <br />
and joined heart and hand with us in entering <br />
into the larger scheme, and trying to form, as <br />
far as they and we could, a great nation and a <br />
strong government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&nbsp;(Cheers.)</span>
&nbsp;Encouraged <br />
by this arrangement, which, however, was al- <br />
together unofﬁcial and unauthorised, we re- <br />
turned to Quebec, and then the Government <br />
of Canada invited the several governments of <br />
the sister colonies to send a deputation here <br />
from each of them for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
purpose of consid- <br />
ering the question, with something like au- <br />
thority from their respective governments. <br />
The result was, that when we met here on the <br />
10th of October, on the ﬁrst day on which we <br />
assembled, after the full and free discussions <br />
which had taken place at Charlottetown, the <br />
ﬁrst resolution now before this House was <br />
passed unanimously, being received with ac-&nbsp;</p><p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">clamation as, in the opinion of every one who<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> heard it, a
proposition which ought to receive, <br />
and would receive, the sanction of each gov- <br />
ernment and each people. The resolution is, <br />
“ That the best interests and present and fu- <br />
ture prosperity of British North America <br />
will be promoted by a Federal Union under <br />
the Crown of Great Britain, provided such <br />
union can be effected on principles just to <br />
the several provinces.” &nbsp; It seemed to all the <br />
statesmen assembled—and there are great <br />
statesmen in the Lower Provinces, men who <br />
would do honor to any government and to any <br />
legislature of any free country enjoying re- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">presentative institut<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ions—it</span> was
clear to them <br />
all that the best interests and present and fu- <br />
ture prosperity of British North America <br />
would be promoted by a Federal Union under <br />
the Crown of Great Britain. &nbsp; And it seems to <br />
me, as to them, and I think it will so appear to <br />
the people of this country, that, if we wish to <br />
be a great peeple ; if we wish to form—using <br />
the expression which was sneered at the other <br />
evening—a great nationality, commanding <br />
the respect of the world, able to hold our own <br />
against all opponents, and to defend those <br />
institutions we prize : if we wish to have one <br />
system of government, and to establish a com- <br />
mercial union, &nbsp;with unrestricted free trade, <br />
between people of the ﬁve provinces, belong- <br />
ing, as they do, to the same nation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obeying</span>
