Because, just so surely as <br />
this scheme is defeated, will be revived the <br />
original proposition for a union of the Mari- <br />
time Provinces, irrespective of Canada ; they <br />
will not remain as they are now, powerless, <br />
scattered, helpless communities ; they will <br />
form themselves into a power, which, though <br />
not so strong as if united with Canada, will, <br />
nevertheless, be a powerful and considerable <br />
community, and it will be then too late for <br />
us to attempt to strengthen ourselves by this <br />
scheme, which, in the words of the resolution, <br />
“is for the best interests, and present and <br />
future prosperity of British North America.’’ <br />
If we are not blind to our present position, <br />
we must see the hazardous situation in <br />
which all the great interests of Canada stand <br />
in respect to the United States. &nbsp; I am no <br />
alarmist. &nbsp; I do not believe in the prospect of <br />
immediate war. &nbsp; I believe that the common <br />
sense of the two nations will prevent a war ; <br />
still we cannot trust to probabilities. &nbsp; The <br />
Government and Legislature would be want- <br />
ing in their duty to the people if they ran <br />
any risk. &nbsp; We know that the United States <br />
at this moment are engaged in a war of <br />
enormous dimensions—that the occasion of a <br />
war with Great Britain has again and again <br />
arisen, and may at any time in the future <br />
again arise. &nbsp; We cannot foresee what may <br />
be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">result</span>
; we cannot say but that the <br />
two nations may drift into a war as other <br />
nations have done before. &nbsp; It would then <br />
be too late when war had commenced to think <br />
of measures for strengthening ourselves, or <br />
to begin negociations for a union with the <br />
sister provinces. &nbsp; At this moment, in con- <br />
sequence of the ill-feeling which has arisen <br />
between England and the United States— <br />
a feeling of which Canada was not the cause <br />
—in consequence of the irritation which now <br />
exists, owing to the unhappy state of affairs <br />
on this continent, the Reciprocity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Treaty,</span>
<br />
it seems probable, is about to be brought <br />
to an end—our trade is hampered by the <br />
passport system, and at any moment we may <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be deprived</span> of
permission to carry our goods <br />
through United States channels—the bonded <br />
goods system may be done away with, and the <br />
winter trade through the United States put <br />
an end to. &nbsp; Our merchants may be obliged <br />
to return to the old system of bringing in <br />
during the summer months the supplies for <br />
the whole year. &nbsp; Ourselves already threat- <br />
ened, our trade interrupted, our intercourse, <br />
political and commercial, destroyed, if we do <br />
not take warning now when we have the op- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> portunity, and while
one avenue is threat- <br />
ened to be closed, open another by taking ad- <br />
vantage of the present arrangement and the <br />
desire of the Lower Provinces to draw closer <br />
the alliance between us, we may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffer</span>
com- <br />
mercial and political disadvantgaes it may <br />
take long for us to overcome. &nbsp; The Confer- <br />
ence having come to the conclusion that a <br />
legislative union, pure and simple, was im- <br />
practicable, our next attempt was to form a <br />
government upon federal principles, which <br />
would&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span>
to the General Government the <br />
strength of a legislative and administrative <br />
union, while at the same time it preserved <br />
that liberty of action for the different sec- <br />
tions which is allowed by a Federal Union. <br />
And I am strong in the belief—that we <br />
have hit upon the happy medium in those <br />
resolutions, and that we have formed a scheme <br />
of government which unites the advantages <br />
of both, giving us the strength of a legisla- <br />
tive union and the sectional freedom of a <br />
federal union, with protection to local inter- <br />
ests. &nbsp; In doing so we had the advantage of <br />
the experience of the United States. &nbsp;It is <br />
the fashion now to enlarge on the defects of <br />
the Constitution of the United States, but I <br />
am not one of those who look upon it as a <br />
failure. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span>
hear.) &nbsp; I think and believe <br />
that it is one of the most skillful works <br />
which human intelligence ever created ; is <br />
one of the most perfect organizations that <br />
ever governed a free people. &nbsp; To say that it <br />
has some defects is but to say that it is not <br />
the work of Omniscience, but of human in- <br />
tellects. &nbsp; We are happily situated in having <br />
had the opportunity of watching its ope- <br />
ration, seeing its working from its infancy <br />
till now. &nbsp; It was in the main formed on the <br />
model of the Constitution of Great Britain, <br />
adapted to the circumstances of a new coun- <br />
try, and was perhaps the only practicable sys- <br />
tem that could have been adopted under the <br />
circumstances existing at the time of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span>
<br />
formation. &nbsp; We can now take advantage of <br />
the experience of the last seventy-eight years, <br />
during which that Constitution has existed, <br />
and I am strongly of the belief that we have, <br />
in a great measure, avoided in this system <br />
which we propose for the adoption of the <br />
people of Canada, the defects which time <br />
and events have shown to exist in theAmer- <br />
ican Constitution. &nbsp; In the ﬁrst place, by a <br />
resolution which meets with the universal <br />
approval of the peeple of this country, we <br />
have provided that for all time to come, so <br />
far as we can legislate for the future, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> <br />
