<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> possessions. And well, Mr. SPEAKER, may
the <br />
work we have unitedly proposed rouse the <br />
ambition and energy of every true man in <br />
British America. Look, sir, at the map of <br />
the continent of America, and mark that <br />
island (Newfoundland) commanding the mouth <br />
of the noble river that almost cuts our conti- <br />
nent in twain. Well, sir, that island is equal <br />
in extent to the kingdom of Portugal. Cross <br />
the straits to the main land, and you touch <br />
the hospitable shores of Nova Scotia, a <br />
country as large as the kingdom of Greece. <br />
Then mark the sister province of New <br />
Brunswick—equal in extent to Denmark and <br />
Switzerland combined. Pass up the river St. <br />
Lawrence to Lower Canada—a country as <br />
large as France. Pass on to Upper Canada, <br />
—twenty thousand square miles larger than <br />
Great Britain and Ireland put together. <br />
Cross over the continent to the shores of the <br />
Pacific, and you are in British Columbia, the <br />
land of golden promise,—equal in extent to <br />
the Austrian Empire. I speak not now of <br />
the vast Indian Territories that lie between— <br />
greater in extent than the whole soil of Russia <br />
—and that will ere long, I trust, be opened up <br />
to civilization under the auspices of the British <br />
American Confederation. (Cheers.) Well, <br />
sir, the bold scheme in your hands is nothing <br />
less <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> to gather all these
countries into one <br />
—to organize them all under one government, <br />
with the protection of the British ﬂag, and in <br />
heartiest sympathy and affection with our <br />
fellow-subjects in the land that gave us birth. <br />
(Cheers.) Our scheme is to establish a gov- <br />
ernment that will seek to turn the tide of <br />
European emigration into this northern half <br />
of the American continent—that will strive to <br />
develope its great natural resources—and that <br />
will endeavor to maintain liberty, and justice, <br />
and christianity throughout the land. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. T. C. WALLBRIDGE—When? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. CARTIER—Very soon! <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—The hon. member for <br />
North Hastings asks when all this can be <br />
done? Sir, the whole great ends of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con-</span>
<br />
federation may not be realized in the lifetime <br />
of many who now hear me. We imagine not <br />
that such a structure can be built in a month <br />
or in a year. What we propose now is but to <br />
lay the foundations of the structure—to set in <br />
motion the governmental machine that will <br />
one day, we trust, extend from the Atlantic to <br />
the Pacific. And we take especial credit to <br />
ourselves that the system we have devised, <br />
while admirably adapted to our present situa- <br />
tion, is capable of gradual and efficient expan- <br />
sion in future years to meet all the great pur- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">poses</span>
contemplated by our scheme. But if the <br />honorable gentleman will only recall to mind <br />
that when the United States seceded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span>
the <br />
Mother Country, and for many years after- <br />
wards their population was not nearly equal <br />
to ours at this moment; that their internal <br />
improvements did not then approach to what <br />
we have already attained; and that their trade <br />
and commerce was not then a third of what <br />
ours has already reached; I think he will see <br />
that the fulfilment of our hopes may not be so <br />
very remote as at first sight might be imagined <br />
—(hear, hear.) And he will be strengthened <br />
in that conviction if he remembers that what <br />
we propose to do is to be done with the cordial <br />
sympathy and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assistance</span> of that
great Power <br />
of which it is our happiness to form a part. <br />
(Hear, hear.) Such, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span>
are the <br />
objects of attainment to which the British <br />
American Conference pledged itself in Octo- <br />
ber. And said I not rightly that such a scheme <br />
is well fitted to fire the ambition and rouse the <br />
energies of every member of this House? <br />
Does it not lift us above the petty politics of <br />
the past, and present to us high purposes <br />
and great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests</span> that may
well call forth all <br />
the intellectual ability and all the energy and <br />
enterprise to be found among us ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers.)</span>
<br />
I readily admit all the gravity of the question <br />
—and that it ought to be considered cautiously <br />
and thoroughly before adoption. Far be it <br />
from me to deprecate the closest criticism, or <br />
to doubt for a moment the sincerity or patriot- <br />
ism of those who feel it their duty to oppose <br />
the measure. But in considering a question <br />
on which hangs the future destiny of half a <br />
continent, ought not the spirit of mere fault- <br />
finding to be hushed ?—ought not the voice of <br />
partisanship to be banished from our debates? <br />
—ought we not to sit down and discuss the <br />
arguments presented in the earnest and candid <br />
spirit of men, bound by the same interests, <br />
seeking a common end, and loving the same <br />
country? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear, and
cheers.) Some <br />
honorable gentlemen seem to imagine that the <br />
members of Government have a deeper interest <br />
in this scheme than others—but what possible <br />
interest can any of us have except that which <br />
we share with every citizen of the land ? What <br />
risk does any one run from this measure in <br />
which all of us do not fully participate ? What <br />
possible inducement could we have to urge this <br />
scheme, except our earnest and heartfelt con- <br />
viction that it will inure to the solid and <br />
lasting advantage of our country ? (Hear, <br />
hear.) There is one consideration, Mr. SPEAK- <br />
ER, that cannot be banished from this discus- <br />
sion, and that ought, I think, to be remembered <br />
