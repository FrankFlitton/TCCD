<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> they will soon be dispensed with,just as
in a <br />
machine we do away with useless and expen- <br />
sive wheelwork. Nothing will then be left to <br />
us but the legislative union which the honor-<br />
able members have not ventured to propose,<br />
because they are compelled to admit it would <br />
be an act of crying injustice to Lower Can- <br />
ada. But we are told to rely on article 42, <br />
which gives to the local legislatures the right <br />
of amending or changing their Constitutions <br />
from time to time, and it is said that when <br />
Lower Canada is separated from Upper Can- <br />
ada, she may alter her Constitution if she <br />
pleases, and adapt it to her own views. It <br />
<span style="background-color: white;"> must not be forgotten, however,
that the </span><br style="background-color: white;" />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lieutenant-Governor,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>who will enjoy the <br />
right of reserving the bills of the Local Par- <br />
liament for the sanction of the Governor Gen- <br />
eral, will be appointed by the Governor Gen- <br />
eral in Council, that is to say, by the Federal <br />
Government, and, as a matter of course, it <br />
must be expected that he will act in conform- <br />
ity with the views of the Federal Govern- <br />
ment. Any bill reserved by him will require <br />
to be sanctioned by the Federal Government, <br />
which may refuse such sanction if they think <br />
proper, as they undoubtedly will as regards <br />
any bill the object of which might be to give <br />
responsible government to Lower Canada, <br />
whilst all the other provinces would only have <br />
governments which were not responsible. And <br />
the militia,—it will be exclusively under the <br />
control of the Federal Government. Have <br />
the honorable the French-Canadian members, <br />
to whom I more particularly address myself <br />
at this moment, reﬂected on the danger to us <br />
that is contained in this provision ? It is with <br />
reluctance that I once more allude to the dif- <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁculties</span><span style="background-color: white;"> which may arise between the </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
sections of the Confederacy, but it would be <br />
wrong to shut our eyes to the future for fear <br />
that it may appear too threatening. Did we <br />
not, a few days ago, hear one of the honorable <br />
members, who most warmly supports the Gov- <br />
ernment, complain in this House that Upper <br />
Canada was going to have four military <br />
schools, whilst Lower Canada would <span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span>have <br />
two ? Why should we vest in the Federal <br />
Government the right of giving instruction in <br />
the military art and of arming the other <br />
provinces at the expense of Lower Canada ? <br />
<span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Why,</span><span style="background-color: white;"> w</span>hile there is yet time,
should we ne- <br />
glect to take those salutary precautions on <br />
which our existence as French-Canadians de- <br />

the same active part in the organization, in- <br />
struction and equipment of our militia which <br />

getting that this is to be a model Confeder- <br />

in favor of Confederation, to which I have <br />
referred on more than one occasion, page 25, <br />
as follows: “With them we offer protection <br />
to your religion, to your institutions, and to <br />
your civil laws,” &amp;c., &amp;c. They offer to protect <br />
the French-Canadia<span style="background-color: white;">ns ; but when, under the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
present Constitution, they can protect them- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
selves, why should </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="background-color: white;">they abdicate the
right of so </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
doing ? Now they are strongly entrenched in </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
their citadel, and they are advised to raze the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
walls in order to secure their safety. The </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
French Canadians, at the present day, are in a </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
better position than they were at the time of </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the union. They are at the same time both </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
judges and suitors. They are asked to adopt </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
a new form of government ; it is not imposed </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
upon them ; and, to induce them to do so, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
the hon. Minister of Agriculture tells them that </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
this new form of government was recommended </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
successively by Chief Justice SEWELL, Judge </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ROBINSON, and Lord DURHAM. The names </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
alone of these three men ought to suffice to </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
open our eyes ; their avowed object always </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
was to obliterate French-Canadian nationality, </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
to blend the races into one only, and that the </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

told us, the system of government now sub- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">English-Canadians of Lower Canada, “ Re- <br />
member that we, too, are inhabitants of Lower <br />
Canada, and that we, too, aspire to other and <br />
nobler destinies.” I asked of myself, with <br />
all seriousness, what then are the aspirations <br />
of the French-Canadians ? I have always <br />
imagined, indeed I still imagine, that they all <br />
centre in one point, the maintenance of their <br />
nationality as a shield destined for the protec- <br />
tion of the institutions they hold most dear. <br />
For a whole century this has ever been the <br />
aim of the French-Canadians ; in the long <br />
years of adversity they have never for a mo- <br />
ment lost sight of it ; surmounting all obstacles, <br />
they have advanced step by step towards its <br />
attainment, and what progress have they not <br />
made ? What is their position to-day ? They <br />
