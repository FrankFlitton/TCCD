enormous revenue to the country, and will <br />
largely contribute to increase the sum of our <br />
population, by keeping in Canada many <br />
men who would have gone in search <br />
of fortune elsewhere, and it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inspires</span>
me <br />
with still greater conﬁdence that Provid- <br />
ence has been pleased to ioin to His other <br />
blessings conferred upon us, the possession <br />
of mines the richest and perhaps the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">most</span> abundant in the world. As
regards <br />
our ﬁsheries, they were hardly opened up at <br />
the time of the union ; and now, although <br />
much more may be done with them, it is. <br />
nevertheless, undeniable that every year they <br />
are more and more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">developed,</span> and
that they <br />
are destined, at no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distant</span>
period, to be a <br />
source of immense revenue to the country. <br />
(Hear, hear.) There are many other points <br />
of view, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPEAKER,</span> from which
we might <br />
examine the advantages we have derived <br />
from the union of the Canadas, in return <br />
for the sacriﬁce we have imposed upon our- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selves.</span> We might look at the
political <br />
position we occupied at that period. We <br />
should see that we had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">just come out
of a <br />
terrible crisis, during which blood had been <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spilt</span> on battle-ﬁelds and
elsewhere ; our Con- <br />
stitution had been suspended, and the whole <br />
country had witnessed scenes such as its <br />
inhabitants, hitherto happy and prosperous, <br />
had never seen before. Now we enjoy <br />
responsible government, one of the most <br />
glorious of England’s institutions, and one <br />
that has stood the test <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of ages.</span>
This great <br />
constitutional guarantee we take with us into <br />
the Confederation, into which we are about <br />
to enter in a state of peace and prosperity, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> happiness in our midst, and
with the <br />
conviction that this peace, this prosperity <br />
and this happiness will be made more lasting <br />
than ever. We enter it with the legitimate <br />
and patriotic aim of placing our country in <br />
a position more worthy of our population <br />
and of greater importance, and meriting <br />
higher consideration from foreign nations. <br />
The hon. member for Hochelaga, not content <br />
with calling up past events, has also <br />
alluded to the constitution of the courts <br />
of law in Lower Canada under the Con- <br />
federacy. He declared that he did not under- <br />
stand the meaning of that article of the <br />
resolutions which leaves to the Central Gov- <br />
ernment the appointment of the judges, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whilst</span> by another article it is
provided that the <br />
constitution and maintenance of the courts <br />
was entrusted to the Local Parliament. The <br />
honorable member should have observed that <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> by the powers conferr<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ed</span> on the local govern- <br />
ments, Lower Canada retains all her civil <br />
rights, as prescribed by the 17th paragraph of <br />
article 43, as follows :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The administration of justice, including
the <br />
constitution, maintenance and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">organization</span>
of the <br />
courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and <br />
including also the procedure in civil matters. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
This is a privilege which has been granted to us <br />
and which we shall retain, because our civil laws <br />
differ from those of the other provinces of <br />
the Confederation. This exception, like many <br />
others, has been expressly made for the pro- <br />
tection of us Lower Canadians. It was our <br />
desire, as the representatives of Lower Can- <br />
ada at the Conference, that we should have <br />
under the control of our Local Legislature the <br />
constitution and organization of our courts of <br />justice, both civil and criminal, so that our <br />
legislature might possess full power over our <br />
courts, and the right to establish or modify <br />
them if it thought expedient. But, on the <br />
other hand, the appointment of the judges of <br />
these courts had to be given, as it has been,<br />
to the Central Government, and the reason of <br />
this provision is at once simple, natural and <br />
just. In the Confederacy we shall have a <br />
Central Parliament and local legislatures.— <br />
Well, I ask any reasonable man, any man of <br />
experience, does he think that, with the am- <br />
bition which must naturally stimulate men of <br />
mark and talent to display their powers on <br />
the theatre most worthy of their talents, <br />
these men will consent to enter the local legis- <br />
latures rather than the Federal Parliament ? <br />
Is it not more likely and more reasonable to <br />
suppose that they would rather appear and <br />
shine on the largest stage, on that in which <br />
they can render the greatest service to their <br />
country, and where the rewards of their ser- <br />
vices will be the highest? Yes, these men <br />
will prefer to go to the Central Parliament, <br />
and among them there will be doubtless many <br />
of our most distinguished members of the <br />
legal profession. The members of this pro- <br />
fession are often accused of going into Parlia- <br />
ment for the purpose of monopolizing the <br />
representation. If this be the case at the pres- <br />
ent time, is it not to be supposed that they will <br />
do the same thing under Confederation ? <br />
Were the appointment of the judges left to <br />
the local legislatures, the local governments <br />
would be subjected to a pressure which might <br />
be brought to bear upon them by the ﬁrst ad- <br />
vocate who would attain inﬂuence in the Local  <br />
Legislature. To get rid of an inconvenient <br />
member who might have three or four follow- <br />
ers, the Local Government would have to take <br />
