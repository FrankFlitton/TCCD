Not <br />
because of any change of opinion on the part <br />
of the Government on the question, nor be- <br />
cause the House of Lords was opposed to the <br />
principle, but because it was found on exam- <br />
ination that they were liable to practical ob- <br />
jections, to obviate which amendments would <br />
have to be introduced which there were no <br />
means of arranging without further commu- <br />
nications with the colonies. The Imperial <br />
Government would not make these changes <br />
in the measure without the consent of the <br />
colonies, but Earl GREY by no means changed <br />
his mind in regard to the advantages to be <br />
derived from the plan proposed, as the follow- <br />
ing extract from one of his despatches, writ- <br />
ten in 1850, to the Governor of New South <br />
Wales, will show :— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I am not, however, the less persuaded
that <br />
the want of some such central authority to <br />
regulate matters of common importance to <br />
the Australian colonies will be felt, and <br />
probably at a very early period ; but when this <br />
want is so felt, it will of itself suggest the means <br />
by which it may be met. The several legislatures <br />
will, it is true, be unable at once to give the <br />
necessary<span style="background-color: white;"> </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">authority</span><span style="background-color: white;"> to a General
Assembly, be- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
cause the legislative power of each is conﬁned of </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
necessity within its territorial limits ; but if two </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
or more of these legislatures should ﬁnd that </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
there are objects of common interest for which it </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
is expedient to create such an authority, they will </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
have it in their power, if they can settle the terms </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
of an arrangement for the purpose, to pass acts </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
for giving effect to it, with clauses suspending </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
their operation until Parliament shall have </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">supplied</span><span style="background-color: white;"> </span><br />
the authority that is wanting. By such acts the <br />
extent and objects of the powers which they are <br />
prepared to delegate to such a body might be <br />
deﬁned and limited with precision, and there can <br />
be little doubt that Parliament, when applied to <br />
in order to give effect to an arrangement so <br />
agreed upon, would readily consent to do so. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Some may say, Mr. SPEAKER, that this is <br />
very true, but that the British Government <br />
dropped the plan and did not proceed with it. <br />
I think I shall be prepared to meet that argu- <br />

to learn the wishes of the people of the colo-<br />
nies ; for you ﬁnd it following the very same <br />
principle, reported upon favorably by the Com- <br />
mittee on Trade and Foreign Plantations, in <br />
the Constitution which was subsequently <br />
granted to the New Zealand provinces. In <br />
1852, the plan suggested by that committee, <br />
in regard to Australia, was carried int<span style="background-color: white;">o </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span><span style="background-color: white;">

in New Zealand, and it must be remembered </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

at the present day ; but the statesmen of</span> <br />
Great Britain looked into the future of the <br />
colony, and they decided that it would be <br />
advisable to confer on it powers analogous to <br />
those now sought for by us. The New Zea- <br />
land Constitutional Act created six provinces, <br />
with superintendents, provincial councils of <br />
nine appointed by the governor, and a general <br />
government of three estates. In the debate <br />
on that bill, Earl GREY said that this was the <br />
only form of government which could be con- <br />
ferred on a colony situated as that one was. <br />

of the same debate, speaking of the import- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ance of this arrangement, said : —“ There </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
were some subjects on which extensive incon- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
venience would arise, if uniformity of legisla- </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">

sured, which could only be accomplished by a </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
General Legislature.” And that, sir, is what </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
this Government now asks us to adopt. They </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
ask us to invite the Imperial Parliament to </span><br style="background-color: white;" /><span style="background-color: white;">
create for us provincial </span><span style="background-color: white;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislatures,</span><span style="background-color: white;">

the provincial legislatures. And I say, sir, that <br />
ﬁnding as we do that this is no new question, <br />
we can, therefore, understand why this measure <br />

Her Majesty by her advisers. (Hear, hear.) <br />
But, Mr. SPEAKER, I will now pass from the <br />
consideration of the history of this important <br />
movement—and I assure you that I feel the <br />
difﬁculty of addressing the House on this sub- <br />

of the gravity of the question itself and the <br />
momentous character of the issues it involves. <br />
The subject, sir, is one of the very highest <br />
