<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. POWELL—Who wrote that docu- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—I cannot exactly say <br />
who did the composition; but will not my <br />
honorable friend from Chateauguay (Hon. Mr. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HOLTON)</span> permit me to ask if his
hand is not <br />
discoverable in it? (Hear, hear, and laughter.) <br />
If so, he well may be proud of it, for it is a <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—I come now to the <br />
great meeting of the Reformers of Upper <br />
Canada, known as the Toronto Convention of <br />
1859, and at which 570 delegates were present <br />
from all parts of the western province. Here <br />
are the two chief resolutions:— <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 5. Resolved<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,—That</span>
in the opinion of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as-</span> <br />
sembly, the best practicable remedy for the evils <br />
now encountered in the Government of Canada is <br />
to be found in the formation of two or more local <br />
governments, to which shall be committed the <br />
control of all matters of a local or sectional <br />
character, and some joint authority charged with <br />
such matters as are necessarily common to both <br />
sections of the province. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 6. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolved,—That</span>
while the details of the <br />
changes proposed in the last resolution are neces- <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assembly</span> deems it imperative to
declare that no <br />
Government would be satisfactory to the people <br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Upper</span> Canada which is not
based on the prin- <br />

sure now before us for adoption—deliberately <br />
approved of by the largest body of representa- <br />
tive men ever assembled in Upper Canada for <br />
a political purpose; and yet we are to be told <br />
that our people do not understand the ques- <br />
tion, and we must go to them and explain it, <br />
letter by letter, at an immense cost to the <br />
country, and at the risk of losing the whole <br />
scheme! (Hear, hear.) But let us see what <br />
followed. A general election was ordered in <br />
1861—there was a ﬁerce contest at the polls <br />
—and the main question at every hustings, <br />
was the demand for constitutional changes. <br />
The result of that contest was the overthrow <br />
of the CARTIER<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-MACDONALD</span> Ministry
and <br />
the formation of the MACDONALD-SICOTTE <br />
Administration in its room. But so bitter had <br />
been the struggle for and against constitu- <br />

impos- <br />

distinct pledge that it would resist every <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. HOLTON—Did you recognize <br />
the propriety of that course ? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—No, indeed, I did <br />
not. I but cite the fact to show how thor- <br />
oughly the whole question has been agitated, <br />
and how perfectly its bearings have, for <br />
years past, been understood. Well, sir, mark <br />
what followed. One short year had not passed <br />
over the heads of the MACDONALD-SICOTTE
<br />
Ministry before they tattered to their fall— <br />
and so repugnant to the House and to the <br />
country was their conduct on the constitutional <br />
question, that they dared not appeal to the <br />
country until they had changed their avowed <br />
policy upon it, and replaced the men <br />
who had forced upon them the narrow <br />
policy of the year before, by gentlemen <br />
understood to be more in favor of con- <br />
stitutional changes. The Government (MAC- <br />
DONALD-DORION), so reconstructed, went to <br />
the country in 1863, but in the year follow- <br />
ing it, too, fell in its turn, simply because it <br />
did not deal boldly with the constitutional <br />
question—
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. DORION—We had the support <br />
of all who were in favor of the question. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—Indeed, you had not. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. HOLTON—We should have <br />
fallen if we had attempted to deal with it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—I entirely deny that; <br />
had you pursued a bold policy upon it you <br />
might have been in office up to this hour. <br />
(Hear, hear.) Well, sir, the MACDONALD<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span>
<br />DORION made way for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TACHÉ-MACDON-</span>
<br />
ALD Administration—but it, too, soon fell by <br />
a majority of two, simply because it did not <br />
deal with the constitutional question— <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> A VOICE—Oh, oh ! <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. MR. BROWN—My honorable friend <br />
cries “oh, oh," and I am perfectly amazed at <br />
his doing so. I am about to offer my honor- <br />
able friend the most complete proof of the cor- <br />
rectness of my statement—proof so conclusive <br />
that if he does not accept of it as such, I do <br />
not know how he can be convinced of anything. <br />
In one single day the&nbsp;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TACHÉ</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-MACDONALD</span>

Administration, by taking up the constitu- <br />
tional question boldly, turned their minority <br />
of two into a majority of seventy. (Loud cries <br />
of hear, hear.) Could anything prove more <br />
unanswerably than this the deep hold this <br />
question has on the public mind, and the as- <br />

that their constituents understand its whole <br />
