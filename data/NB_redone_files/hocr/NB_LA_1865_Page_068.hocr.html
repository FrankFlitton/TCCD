               rejected a scheme which would certainly.

               <br />
               One very singular feature in this scheme 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was,</span> that every colony had got the 
               <br />
               best of the bargain. Mr. Tilloy hud

               <br />
               ln Upper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> the politicians had made 
               <br />
               so good a bargain, that they could ﬂﬂ'ortl 
               <br />
               to build several lntercoloninl Railroads 
               <br />

               <br />
               wonderful good trade; how all could 
               <br />
               have got the best ol the arrangement and 
               <br />
               no party the worst, I cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understand.</span> 
               <br />
               lt might be considered <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">smart</span> to get the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beat</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bargain.</span> but. if it were done 
               <br />
               knowingly, it could badly beainsidsred 
               <br />
               honest, and it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discovered,</span> not calculated 
               <br />
               to add much to the harmony of the Union. 
               <br />
               One great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument,</span> and one which was 
               <br />
               used to good eﬂ'oot, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> the Railroad. 
               <br />
               Now, I am free to admit. that the chances 
               <br />
               were that the n ad <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> built
