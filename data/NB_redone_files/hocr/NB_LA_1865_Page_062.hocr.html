               been handled politically, commercially. 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing into minute details. bpt shall express 
               <br />
               my views brieﬂy and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gener’slly</span> against the 
               <br />
               Scheme. In the ﬁrst place it is said that 
               <br />
               there is no need of a delegation, because 
               <br />
               the people of England are aware that the 
               <br />
               rand scheme of Confederationhsa been 
               <br />
               efested. lt might be sufﬁcient that the 
               <br />
               British Government in the exercise of 
               <br />
               their powers will have a consideration for 
               <br />
               the constitutional rights which we have. 
               <br />
               But this is a matter on which discretion 
               <br />
               is to be exercised. it is said the appoint- 
               <br />
               ment of this delegation is a concesston to 
               <br />
               Confederation; in like manner the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">build.</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> ol <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Penitentiarics</span> is a concession to 
               <br />
               criminals. We have a law in this land to 
               <br />
               prevent the commission of crime; but 
               <br />
               would a man, if he thought his house 
               <br />
               was going to be destroyed. if he did not 
               <br />
               take a reasonable means of defence, lie 
               <br />
               down on his bed satisfied as if the law was 
               <br />
               going to protect him? I feel that where 
               <br />
               the constituency of this country has been 
               <br />

               <br />
               and in which we live. It haa been said 
               <br />
               by several hon. gentlemen that those who 
               <br />
