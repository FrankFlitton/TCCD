               laid and cemented In an open and manly 
               <br />
               way. He would now speak of some ofthe 
               <br />
               alterations the delegates should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">demand.</span> 
               <br />
               He would, if he could, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secure</span> some 
               <br />
               modiﬁcation to the provision for repro- 
               <br />
               sentation by population. He feared 
               <br />
               that this could not be done, but 
               <br />
               still he would claim it as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> 
               <br />
               and a beneﬁt to all the Colonies.

               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Qu'chec</span> Scheme was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">started</span> at. the 
               <br />
               time of the war in the United States. 
               <br />

               <br />
               Sherman had \nnde his grand march 
               <br />
               through _Georgin to the ocean, when 
               <br />
               they thought that the Republic was in 
               <br />
               the throes of dissolution, and conse- 
               <br />
               qucutly it was the negation of all that 
               <br />
               was found in the American Constitution. 
               <br />
               There the States have the power, und 
               <br />
               thnt power they II'cild for the general 
               <br />
               good. But in the Quebec Scheme the 
               <br />
               General Government take all the power 
               <br />
               and dribble it out to the separate States. 
               <br />
               This was \\ l'entorein the Scheme he had 
               <br />
               always been opposed to. if the dele-

               neither did the people desire \\ new ﬂag
