               this dissolution? It was the duty of His 
               <br />
               Excellency's advisers to see that the 
               <br />
               majority'o'f the people were properly 
               <br />
               represented, and to do that they must 
               <br />
               dissolvethe House. The people had 
               <br />
               been hastily called upon to express an 
               <br />
               opinion upon a great question, and they 
               <br />
               did so; but they had since changed their 
               <br />
               views, and au opportunity was given 
               <br />
               them to send men here to represent their 
               <br />
               changed views. This was not endanger- 
               <br />
               ing the rights of the people. Could any 
               <br />
               Government be justified in saying, we 
               <br />
               will keep yqp here for three years longer.

               In regard to the fourth paragraph he

               (Mr. Botaford) says we are called upon
