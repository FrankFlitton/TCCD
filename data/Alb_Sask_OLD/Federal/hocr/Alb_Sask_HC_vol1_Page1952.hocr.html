               keep in mind this line between the north

               and south that I have given, it will be found

               that twenty-six seats are given by this Bill

               to this moment has been unorganized ter- 
               <br />
               ritory. I may not be able to make that 
               <br />
               as an absolute statement. If we split hairs 
               <br />
               we may ﬁnd a slightly different result. 
               <br />
               I will take the calculation made the other 
               <br />
               evening by my hon. friend from Qu’Appelle 
               <br />
               (Mr. Lake) who stated that the three south 
               <br />
               ridings in Saskatchewan are given thirteen 
               <br />
               and one-half seats as against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eleven</span> and 
               <br />
               one-half to the three north ridings. It seems 
               <br />
               to me that if the federal division of three 
               <br />
               to three was a fair division two years ago, 
               <br />
               and is a fair division now, and likely to be 
               <br />
               fair up to the end of this parliament, it can- 
               <br />
               not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">une</span> contended that there is unfairness 
               <br />
               to the south in the present proposed distri- 
               <br />
               bution of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11a</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">134}.</span> And as a mat- 
               <br />
               ter of fact the map has been amend— 
               <br />
               ed taking one seat from the north and 
               <br />
               giving it to the south. We have then, ac- 
               <br />
               cording to my hon. friend’s calculation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">141;</span> 
               <br />
               seats given to the three federal ridings south 
               <br />
               of the dividing line as against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">101;</span> for the 
               <br />
               three north of that line. I might call to 
               <br />
               the attention of the committee the fact 
               <br />
               that a portion of one of the south ridings is 
               <br />
               taken away and put into the province of 
               <br />
               Alberta, the Medicine Hat constituency. 
               <br />
               Thus really the proper calculation would 
               <br />
               show <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">15;</span> to 'the south three ridings as 
               <br />
               against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">10;</span> to the north three. So really 
               <br />
               without splitting hairs it may be stated 
               <br />
               that the south country, the old Assinlboia 
               <br />
               district, is getting 16 seats while only 9 are 
               <br />
               given to the north or Saskatchewan dis- 
               <br />
               trict. 1 ask any fair-minded person where 
               <br />
               he can ﬁnd unfairness in this new redis-

               <br />
               to the advantage of the south country. It 
               <br />
               seems to me it is impossible for any person 
               <br />

               so often, Monseigneur Sbarretti. I say that 
               <br />
               no cry has ever been uttered in this country 
               <br />

               <br />
               regard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> these plans of redistribution. I 
               <br />
               had a brief dispute with the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition one evening with regard to the 
               <br />
               question whether or not any parliamentary 
               <br />
               body had ever considered the question of 
               <br />
               area together with the matter of population 
               <br />
               in making a redistribution. I asked my hon. 
               <br />
               friend how he explained the disparity that 
               <br />
               was permitted by this parliament when 
               <br />
               Manitoba was ﬁrst given representation. in 
               <br />
               the year 1870. Manitoba was at that time 
               <br />
               given four members, when the population of 
               <br />
               the province did not entitle it to one member. 
               <br />
               A few years later the Northwest Territor- 
               <br />
               ies were given representation in this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment and although their population would 
               <br />
               not have entitled them to one member, par- 
               <br />
               liament made provision for four members. 
               <br />
               and in like manner when British Columbia 
               <br />
               was brought in provision was made for six 
               <br />
               members when the population would not 
               <br />
               have entitled that province to one third of 
               <br />
               that number. My hon. friend took very 
               <br />
               strong grounds ; he declared absolutely that 
               <br />
               area was never made a basis of representa- 
               <br />
               tion in a redistribution and be challenged 
               <br />
               me to produce the contrary evidence. I 
               <br />
               have gone to ‘Hansard’ of the year 1886, 
               <br />
               and at page 1205. I ﬁnd that in the case of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories when the late Sir 
               <br />

               <br />
               uttered these words:
