               <br />
               believe that we have the power; and if we 
               <br />

               policy for this parliament to assume that it 
               <br />
               possesses the wisdom of all time and all

               Now it has been urged that if we apply

               <br />

               <br />
               Permit me to say that I dissent from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               view. I dissent from it because I think, 
               <br />
               with all deference to those who differ, that 
               <br />
               were the educational clauses of the British

               <br />
               new provinces as their charter in this re- 
               <br />
               gard, subsection 1 would not apply -to them, 
               <br />
               while subsection 3 would apply. And what 
               <br />
               would be the effect of it? Clearly the ef- 
               <br />
               fect would be that these new provinces 
               <br />
               would start with full power to deal with 
               <br />
               all matters relating to education; but if 
               <br />
               the minority, by agitation or by any other 
               <br />
               means, obtained separate schobls, then the 
               <br />
               new provinces would be bound to maintain 
               <br />
               that system or else become subject to re-

               provided that every section of the people

               ple in this country, and that all classes

               <br />
               ing of kindness and generosity. I for one 
               <br />
               most strongly object to this new country 
               <br />
               having forced upon it, or placed upon it, by 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada, at this distance 
               <br />
               and at this time, a system of education 
               <br />
               which its people will not be able to change, 
               <br />
               except by imperial legislation. so long as 
               <br />
               the centuries last. Why, Sir. what has 
               <br />
               been the experience of legislation of this 
               <br />
               kind in the past? Take the effect of pro- 
               <br />
               hibition laws in this country. There is no 
               <br />
               more unsuccessful way of inducing a man 
               <br />
               to do right than to endeavour to coerce 
               <br />
               him to do right. There is this further ar- 
               <br />
               gument that I have seen advanced with 
               <br />
               respect to this matter, and that is that we 
               <br />
               cannot trust the-people of these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces to do what is fair. Sir, I for one 
               <br />
               am entirely out of sympathy with such an 
               <br />
               argument. The people of the great west 
               <br />
               have gone in there from all of our great 
               <br />
               provinces, they have certainly shown them- 
               <br />
               selves up—to-date, intelligent, and very able. 
               <br />
               If the school <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"system,</span> which so far they 
               <br />
               have been permitted to enact and to carry 
               <br />
               out, if such legislation as they have been 
               <br />
               permitted to pass during their tutelage, is 
               <br />
               a sample of what they can do, then I think 
               <br />
               we may safely entrust to the people of 
               <br />
               those new provinces full power to deal 
               <br />
               with their educational affairs, such powers 
               <br />
