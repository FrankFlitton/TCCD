               <br />
               greatest acts of cowardice that had ever been 
               <br />
               perpetrated upon this country was the ap— 
               <br />
               appointment of the present Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior because he had had a large 
               <br />
               majority in the last election. I never 
               <br />
               knew that it was a crime to have a 
               <br />
               large _.majority in this country; I never 
               <br />
               knew that a man had to sit on the back 
               <br />
               benches all his life because he had a 
               <br />
               large majority, and I believe that no fairer 
               <br />
               and no wiser act could have been done under 
               <br />
               the circumstances than the premier-’s action 
               <br />
               in appointing as Minister of the Interior the 
               <br />
               Hon. 'Mr. Oliver. The hon. member also 
               <br />
               stated that he does not believe there is a 
               <br />
               more clever man in this Dominion than Pre- 
               <br />
               mier Haultain. I believe he is correct, I 
               <br />
               presume he is. But I notice in an interview 
               <br />
               with the Toronto ‘ News ’ that Premier Haul— 
               <br />
               tain when interviewed at Winnipeg spoke on 
               <br />
               this subject. The interview appears under 
               <br />
               the heading ‘No <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Significance</span> in Mr. Oliver’s 
               <br />
               Election.’ Mr. Haultain believed there was 
               <br />
               no signiﬁcance, but. the hon. member for 
               <br />
               l-Ialdiinand believes there was a great deal 
               <br />
               ot‘ signiﬁcance. In Mr. Haultain’s interview 
               <br />
               he was asked it‘ there was any probability 
               <br />
               ot‘ the Northwest legislature being called to- 
               <br />
               gether to pass a resolution on the question. 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain replied in the negative. I be— 
               <br />
               lieve Mr. Haultain is a clever man, but I 
               <br />
               say that when the hou. member for South 
               <br />
               York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) was challenging- 
               <br />
               the Postmaster General to throw up his seat 
               <br />
               and run an election he might have gone one 
               <br />
               further and challenged Premier Haultain to 
               <br />
               call his council together and see what they

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               would say on the question. I believe Pre- 
               <br />
               mier Haultain knows to-day that he dare not 
               <br />
               call his council together, I believe that if he 
               <br />
               called that council together he would be de— 
               <br />
               feated in an attempt to pass any resolution 
               <br />
               or any measure that would be in any Way 
               <br />
               against the Bill that we have now before us. 
               <br />
               I believe that there is no greater coward, - 
               <br />
               that no man has shown himself the coward 
               <br />
               so much as Mr. Haultain. Mr. Haultain has 
               <br />
               written a letter to the premier, a letter 
               <br />
               which I have in my hand, and in it you can 
               <br />
               easily see that if it were possible that he 
               <br />
               could make any political capital <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out</span> of 
               <br />
               calling his legislature together, he would do 
               <br />
               so and have a resolution passed opposing 
               <br />
               this measure. He has not been able to do so. 
               <br />
               he has been afraid to attempt to do so. 
               <br />
               Therefore I fall back upon what I said in 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place that it was rather amusing 
               <br />
               when we listened to the remarks of the 
               <br />
               speakers last night how they all skated 
               <br />
               around the question, how they were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trying</span> 
               <br />
               to get some way <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to’crawl</span> out the back door, 
               <br />
               stating in their arguments it you can call 
               <br />
               them arguments, as the member for Haldi—
