               that subject now. I anticipated a long

               discussion on the previous clauses of the

               with that particular clause <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span>

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. Of course, we really 
               <br />
               have never had up to the present time any 
               <br />
               statement on behalf of the government, 
               <br />
               beyond a very general statement made by 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister on the second reading 
               <br />
               of the Bill, which did not go into particu- 
               <br />
               lars and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seemed</span> to me to be remarkalbly 
               <br />
               indeﬁnite, as to what the diﬂerence be- 
               <br />
               tween the two sections is. We had a very 
               <br />
               full and elaborate statement from the ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mir.</span> Sifton) with 
               <br />
               regard to the diﬂerence, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'I</span> am not at all 
               <br />
               clear as to whether the view he took is 
               <br />
               the one which still commends itself to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the Minister of Justice, and for 
               <br />
               that reason I would have been glad to have 
               <br />
               his views on that subject to-day. However, 
               <br />
               I am entirely willing to consult his conven- 
               <br />
               ience, except that I would suggest to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend that after he has made his state- 
               <br />
               ment, we might possibly after some dis- 
               <br />
               cussion ask the clause to stand for a little 
               <br />
               consideration of any views which might be 
               <br />
               put forward in case they should prove to 
               <br />
               be very divergent from those of the ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior.
