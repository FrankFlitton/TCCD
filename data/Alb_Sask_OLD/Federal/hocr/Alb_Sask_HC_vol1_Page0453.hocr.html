               right, but if we cannot let us have them 
               <br />
               any way. What is the use of Protestants

               <br />
               should we hold out for a thing that Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics cannot and will not accept? Is

               I was talking about this amendment. A 
               <br />
               great deal of fault is found because we have 
               <br />
               this amendment. I submit that this amend- 
               <br />
               ment is not legislation of this House. It is 
               <br />
               legislation that was passed by the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture of the Northwest Territories. They 
               <br />
               are just as fully represented in their local 
               <br />
               House as the province of Manitoba. Accord— 
               <br />
               ing to their size and population they have 
               <br />
               just as many representatives in the local 
               <br />
               legislature of the Northwest Territories as 
               <br />
               any local parliament of Canada. They have 
               <br />
               a government, they have a premier, they 
               <br />
               have all the powers that a local legislature 
               <br />
               has except that they cannot borrow money 
               <br />
               and the longer that power is kept from them, 
               <br />
               I think, the better. This is an Act they 
               <br />
               have passed themselves. The Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories have passed this legislation and 
               <br />
               they appear to be perfectly satisﬁed with it 
               <br />
               and we have some evidence in its favour.

               When we see what the provisions of this

               came to the conclusion that this Act was

               In the province of Nova Scotia we have 
               <br />
               a public free school system, the law govern- 
               <br />
               ing which has been on the statute-books 
               <br />
               since 1864, but since then it has been several 
               <br />
               times amended. I have had something to 
               <br />
               do with the school legislation of Nova

               <br />
               I must say that so far as I know the Nova

               the Northwest Territories Education Act,

               I am inclined to believe that the latter is

               more full in its provisions, and, taking it
