               appeal to them on the plea that the people

               The Minister of Justice this afternoon 
               <br />
               went a long way to eulogize and pay great 
               <br />
               tribute to the people of the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec and to the Roman Catholic Clinch. 
               <br />
               To all that he said, I have no objection to 
               <br />
               make. I join with him heartily in those en— 
               <br />
               comiums Which he paid. But surely there are 
               <br />
               others in this country besides French Can- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Roman Catholic. Surely when he paid such 
               <br />
               a tribute to the French Canadians who 
               <br />
               are identiﬁed with the early settlement of 
               <br />
               this country, when he paid the tribute he 
               <br />
               did to the Jesuit martyrs,why did he forget 
               <br />
               the names of Samuel Champlain and Count 
               <br />
               Frontenac, two distinguished statesmen of

               <br />
               ed the Jesuit martyrs, is there to be no

               Canadian race did for the establishment of 
               <br />

               far as I could gather from the remarks 
               <br />
               of the Minister of Justice, there is nothing 
               <br />
               we have in this country of Canada worth 
               <br />
               boasting of, which is not due to the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec ; and that when we come to 
               <br />
               speak of the ecclesiastical institutions of 
               <br />
               the country. there is only one we should re- 
               <br />
               cognize, and that is the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               Church. Now, I happen to come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> 
               <br />
               that province of Ontario which has been so 
               <br />
               much maligned in this debate, which has 
               <br />
               been described here as illiberal, intolerant 
               <br />
               and incendiary, and I still further have the 
               <br />
               misfortune to come from the city of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">T01</span> 
               <br />
               ronto which is supposed to be the hot-bed of 
               <br />
               all this intolerance and illiberality. I hap- 
               <br />
               pen also to be identiﬁed with one of those 
               <br />
               ﬁve intolerant and incendiary newspapers 
               <br />
               published in the city of Toronto. We have 
               <br />
               been denounced and my province has been 
               <br />
               denounced, and yet the Postmaster General 
               <br />
               who comes from that province and my own 
               <br />
               county, has never had a word to say in de— 
               <br />
               fence of its people or of the city of Toronto. 
               <br />
               Let me, Mr. Speaker, tell you something 
               <br />
               about the people who come from the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario. They have certain char— 
               <br />
               acteristics, and if there is anything that 
               <br />
               marks those people with regard to their 
               <br />
               political and religious views, it is this, that 
               <br />
               next to the birth of our Saviour they regard, 
               <br />
               as the greatest thing in the history <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">otthe</span> 
               <br />
               world, the reformation which marked the 
               <br />
               fourteenth, ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries 
               <br />
               of Europe. Next to that they are proud of 
               <br />
               the Protestant churches of Germany, the 
               <br />
               Protestant Church of England, and the Pro- 
               <br />
               testant Church of France that came out of 
               <br />
               that great reformation; and after the re— 
               <br />
               formation in England, if they are proud of 
               <br />
               anything it is of this, that after the estab-

               <br />
               revolution and civil war and any amount 
               <br />
               of parliamentary strife and trouble, there 
               <br />
               came out of all that revolution and strife 
               <br />
               and struggle and all that civil war those 
               <br />
               great free institutions of constitutional gov- 
               <br />
               ernment which England gave to the world 
               <br />
               and made her the mother of parliaments. 
               <br />
               The people of Ontario are proud of these 
               <br />
               things, when we have to legislate and make 
               <br />
               the laws of this country. More than that, 
               <br />
               Professor Goldwin Smith has said that the 
               <br />
               greatest glory of England is the United 
               <br />
               States. Concurrent with the development 
               <br />
               of all these things in the way of constitu- 
               <br />
               tional government, concurrent with the rise 
               <br />
               of free principles in England, there was 
               <br />
               that settlement of British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">institutions</span> in the 
               <br />
               United States and portions of what is now 
               <br />
               our country of Canada, and notwithstand-

               mother-country and her American colony, 
               <br />
               these great English institution: were trans-
