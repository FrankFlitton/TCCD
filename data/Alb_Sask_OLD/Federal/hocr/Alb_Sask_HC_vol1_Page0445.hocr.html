               mentioned by the hon. gentleman with re-

               Now, Mr. Speaker, I will proceed to deal 
               <br />
               with the constitutional question that is in- 
               <br />
               volved in this discussion though I will not 
               <br />
               presume that I can deal with it satisfactorily 
               <br />
               to everybody. I propose to deal with this 
               <br />
               subject under three diiÏerent phases. First, 
               <br />
               I would ask what power have we in res- 
               <br />
               pect to this question '? What should we do 
               <br />
               with that power or how should we exercise 
               <br />
               it if we have any power in this matter ‘? 
               <br />
               Now the ﬁrst thing I ﬁnd in this constitution 
               <br />
               of ours states that the Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               shall be united with a constitution similar 
               <br />
               to that and based upon the constitution of 
               <br />
               Great Britain and Ireland. We start out 
               <br />
               with that declaration in our constitution, it 
               <br />
               is not a hard and fast constitution that is 
               <br />
               unbending, that we cannot change one way 
               <br />
               or the other; it is a constitution similar in 
               <br />
               principle to that of the United Kingdom of 
               <br />
               Great Britain and Ireland. Those of us who 
               <br />
               know anything about the constitution of 
               <br />
               Great Britain know how elastic it is. how 
               <br />
               it is made to suit various conditions, how it 
               <br />
               can be capable of taking under its folds all 
               <br />
               conditons of men. When we remember that 
               <br />
               we are attracting into our Northwest the 
               <br />
               very classes of people that go to make up 
               <br />
               the British empire we will realize at once 
               <br />
               that we need just such &amp; constitution as 
               <br />
               that of the United Kingdom to enable us to 
               <br />
               deal with all these people as successfully as 
               <br />
               Great Britain deals With them. Now, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, we have a constitution in our hands 
               <br />
               that is not a hard and fast instrument. we

               In order to understand this question aright
