               testant I believe it would be the worst 
               <br />
               thing that could happen to that great North- 
               <br />
               west if the system of separate schools 
               <br />
               which existed from 1875 to 1891 were re- 
               <br />
               established.

               .Mr. SPROULE. What about the last 
               <br />
               clause of the amendment which says that 
               <br />
               they shall exclusively make laws in regard 
               <br />
               to education ?

               Mr. CAMPBELL. I thought I had dealt 
               <br />
               very fully With that. If the hon. member 
               <br />
               has not read it. he had better read it. That 
               <br />
               is my objection to the amendment proposed 
               <br />
               by the leader of the opposition. I take it 
               <br />
               that every legal gentleman in this House 
               <br />
               will admit that when we have once passed 
               <br />
               this Act and granted the new provinces 
               <br />
               a constitution, our powers are exhausted. 
               <br />
               Whatever system we give them shall re— 
               <br />
               main; and my objection to the amendment 
               <br />
               of the leader of the opposition is that im- 
               <br />
               mediately you adopt it, you fasten for all 
               <br />
               time on the people of the great Northwest 
               <br />
               a system of separate schools that they do 
               <br />
               not want, that they abolished fourteen years 
               <br />
               ago. The Act now before the House is as 
               <br />
               plain as the English language can make it— 
               <br />
               that 'we are simply legalizing the law that 
               <br />
               they now have in force, and that they have 
               <br />
               had in force for fourteen years ; a law that 
               <br />
               every man from the Northwest says is an
