               Now. Sir, the claim has been made in this

               House and out of it that the Liberal party 
               <br />
               has trampled upon provincial rights and 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy, that it has abandoned 
               <br />
               its principles of 1896, and that now the Lib-

               <br />
               provincial autonomy. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               let me refer for a moment to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whatrtook</span> place 
               <br />

               hon. the Prime Minister in 1896, when he

               moved the six months hoist of the Remedial

               right to interfere ; the remedy lies with us,

               but I think that remedy should not be

               applied until all conciliatory methods have 
               <br />

               whether the land should be left with the

               minute ago. that it would perhaps interfere

               We, of the province of Quebec. we, the 
               <br />
               Catholic minority of this Dominion, are 
               <br />
               bound to change our mind as to the hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L Borden). 
               <br />
               We had always thought that he was a broad 
               <br />
               minded Englishman, we had always thought 
               <br />
               that he was animated by that spirit of fair 
               <br />
               dealing and kindly forbearance that have 
               <br />
               distinguished English institutions for the 
               <br />
               last ﬁfty years. The other day he pro- 
               <br />
               nounced upon us a beautiful eulogy. He 
               <br />
               said that he had traversed the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec from one end to the other and that 
               <br />
               every man he had met there was well read, 
               <br />
               intelligent and sociable and a moment after- 
               <br />
               wards <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lhe</span> moved the amendment which is 
               <br />
               now before the House. The hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               I am afraid, has missed his vocation. He 
               <br />
               has missed his Profession. He should have 
               <br />
               been a surgeon because he would have made 
               <br />
               a very skilful one. When I listened to him 
               <br />
               I could not refrain from thinking that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">When</span> 
               <br />
               he pronounced that eulogy, when he uttered
