               ter Was not included in the correspondence 
               <br />
               that has been brought down. The answer 
               <br />
               is, that I have not received that letter. It 
               <br />
               is not of very great consequence in view of 
               <br />
               the facts. It is simply a letter of protest; 
               <br />
               it adds nothing at all to the facts; but I 
               <br />
               did not receive it. This morning I asked

               my secretary to search and see whether or 
               <br />

               I have only two observations to make on 
               <br />
               this. I do not know to what Mr. Rogers 
               <br />
               refers when he says that I signed an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂiicial</span> 
               <br />
               statement declaring myself to be entitled

               <br />
               sequence, but I do not know what Mr. 
               <br />
               Rogers means when he says that. In the 
               <br />
               statement immediately following, the im— 
               <br />
               pression is conveyed that the Canadian gov- 
               <br />
               ernment brought down correspondence be— 
               <br />
               tween the government of Canada and Cardi— 
               <br />
               nal Ram-polls. There is no such thing in 
               <br />
               fact. The government of Canada never had 
               <br />
               any correspondence with Cardinal Rampolla 
               <br />
               and never brought down any correspon- 
               <br />
               dence, because there was none to bring 
               <br />
               down. What is true is that in 1896 my 
               <br />
               self and several of my co-religionists, hav-

               pealed to the authorities of our own church 
               <br />
               to settle them. There was nothing more 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> that. We did it, not as a government, 
               <br />
               but simply as men belonging to the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic church. We had trouble over mat- 
               <br />
               ters of ecclesiastical policy, and we ap- 
               <br />
               pealed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> supreme arbiter in our church 
               <br />
               to determine these matters. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span> was 
               <br />
               nothing more or less. On this occasion I 
               <br />
               have nothing more to say, but I thought that 
               <br />
               under the circumstances I owed it to myself 
               <br />
               and the House simply to make a statement 
               <br />
               of the facts as they are.

               Sir WILLIAM MULOGK. I simply wish 
               <br />
               to supplement brieﬂy some of the remarks 
               <br />
               that have fallen from my right hon. leader. 
               <br />
               The communication from Mr. Rogers con- 
               <br />
               tains a statement to the eiïect that at the 
               <br />
               invitation of His Excellency Monseigneur 
               <br />
               Sbarretti, he waited upon him, and that on 
               <br />
               that occasion the Papal ablegate said that 
               <br />
               if they would make some concessions, the 
               <br />
               mission of the Manitoba representatives 
               <br />
               would likely be successful. That mission 
               <br />
               was for the purpose of having the bound- 
               <br />
               aries of that province extended to the shores 
               <br />
               of Hudson bay. It was suggested that the 
               <br />
               difﬁculty in the way of Manitoba securing 
               <br />
               the extension could, in some way or other he 
               <br />
               removed if some concessions were made by 
               <br />
