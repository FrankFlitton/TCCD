               ment for a moment in one or two aspects ; 
               <br />
               but before doing so let me remark that the 
               <br />
               Minister of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior</span> yesterday was very 
               <br />
               free with a challenge to have the territorial 
               <br />
               legislature called and to accept their verdict 
               <br />
               as to what the delimitations should be. The 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of the Interior need not have 
               <br />
               asked for the calling of the legislature nor 
               <br />
               need he have professed his willingness to 
               <br />
               :accept what they should say on the subject 
               <br />
               because this legislature only two years ago 
               <br />
               “made a. certain delimitation both of this pro— 
               <br />
               vince and of the adjoining province of Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan, and the only answer to the argu— 
               <br />
               ment based upon that delimitation is the 
               <br />
               suggestion that the delimitation then made 
               <br />
               was absolutely unfair. As far as I have 
               <br />
               heard of any proceedings with regard 
               <br />
               thereto, claims of unfairness came par- 
               <br />
               ticularly from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a,</span> portion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Territo- 
               <br />
               ries which is not included in these un— 
               <br />
               organized districts, and could not be so 
               <br />
               included. They came from a portion of the 
               <br />
               riding which I think is to the south rather 
               <br />
               than to the north. If we are to go by the 
               <br />
               opinion and views of the legislature of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> latest 
               <br />
               pronouncement in a delimitation of those 
               <br />
               constituencies which is absolutely out of 
               <br />
               agreement with that proposed by the admini- 
               <br />
               stration to-day. When we come down to 
               <br />
               the action of our own parliament in 1903, 
               <br />
               ‘four constituencies were established which 
               <br />
               are p 'acticnlly in the new province of Al- 
               <br />
               berta. I shall point out in a moment to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“what</span> extent thatis not correct. They are the 
               <br />
               electoral districts of Alberta. Calgary, Strait- 
               <br />
               cona and Edmonton. The division then made 
               <br />
               was made with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> assent of the members 
               <br />
               _'Of the Northwest Territories representing the 
               <br />
               administration. It was one which they them- 
               <br />
               selves proposed. It was submitted to the 
               <br />
               senators for the Territories, as I think 
               <br />
               there were no members from the Territories 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'on</span> the Conservative side. The senators from 
               <br />
               the Territories had some knowledge of local 
               <br />
               conditions and they regarded the division 
               <br />
               as fairly satisfactory on both sides. At all 
               <br />
               events the delimitation was proposed by the 
               <br />
               administration and its supporters. and we 
               <br />
               must. assume they were fair divisions. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘I</span> have not heard any evidence or

               <br />
               in the others. I shall assume until I hear evi-

               made by some of my hon. friends on this 
               <br />

               the northern riding, but I am content to 
               <br />
               regard the progress as approximately the
