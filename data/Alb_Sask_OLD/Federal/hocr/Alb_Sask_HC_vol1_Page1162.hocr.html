               most noise are ignorant of it. Well, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, we know Whaft it is. Our system 
               <br />
               of primary schools does not sufferfrom a 
               <br />
               comparison with that of several European 
               <br />
               countries, and is greatly superior to that 
               <br />
               which exists in any other province of the 
               <br />
               Dominion. I shall give evidence of that pre- 
               <br />
               sently. But a system, however good, will 
               <br />
               not be efﬁcient unless properly applied ; and 
               <br />
               I must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acknowledge</span> that in some of our

               of the province of Quebec, however, the sys- 
               <br />
               tem has been properly enforced, and the re- 
               <br />
               sults have been such as to surprise the world 
               <br />
               at the universal expositions at Paris in 1871. 
               <br />
               of London in 1885, of Chicago in 1893 and 
               <br />
