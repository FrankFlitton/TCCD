               that notice and knowing what the conditions

               What right have a portion of the people of

               their fellow-citizens there? The position, 
               <br />
               it appears to me, is not tenable; it is not 
               <br />
               one that can be fairly argued. Both parties, 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics and Protestants, start in 
               <br />
               there upon a fair footing, upon an even foot— 
               <br />
               ing, knowing exactly what the conditions 
               <br />
               are and what the conditions will be. But. 
               <br />
               there is this to be said about it, and it bears 
               <br />
               upon the discussion which has taken place 
               <br />
               upon this particular point that in the inter- 
               <br />
               val between the time at which these people 
               <br />
               go into the Territories and the time-when 
               <br />
               they are created into provinces some pro~ 
               <br />
               vision must be made for their government 
               <br />
               and that provision that has to be made in 
               <br />
               the interval must be made by the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion parliament. It has sole jurisdiction as 
               <br />
               to the subject, but limited jurisdiction as 
               <br />
               to the time. These people have notice that 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada can Only legislate 
               <br />
               during the interval. This parliament, by the 
               <br />
               constitution which has been adopted, agree 
               <br />
               With these people that they Will only legis- 
               <br />
               late during that interval.

               Now then, that being the position, this

               They establish a system of administration

               people to allow them to enjoy that position

               than for this parliament to impose any 
               <br />
               obligation upon them. Take the Protest- 
               <br />
               ant denominations going into these new 
               <br />
               Territories. They knew perfectly well, and 
               <br />
               they had the constitution of Canada as se- 
               <br />
               curity for it, that separate schools would 
               <br />
               not and could not be imposed upon that 
               <br />
               portion of the country after it was erected 
               <br />
               into a province unless the legislature of 
               <br />
               that province said so. Catholics going into 
               <br />
               that country knew, and they had the con- 
               <br />
               stitution as security for it, that separate 
               <br />
               schools could be and would be established 
               <br />
               in these new provinces just as soon as the 
               <br />
               local legislatures of these provinces saw 
               <br />
               ﬁt to so enact. There was no uncertainty 
               <br />
               as to the power of this parliament; there 
               <br />
               was no uncertainty as to the power of the 
               <br />
               local legislature; there was no uncertainty 
               <br />
               as to the rights of the people; the only 
               <br />
               uncertainty there was, was as to what the 
               <br />
               legislatures of these new provinces would 
               <br />
               do when they had the authority placed in 
               <br />
               their hands. And to guard against any 
               <br />
               injustice being done by that uncertainty, a 
               <br />
               clause was put into the constitution pro- 
               <br />
