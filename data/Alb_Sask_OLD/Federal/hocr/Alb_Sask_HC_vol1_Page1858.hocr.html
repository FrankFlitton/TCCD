               Woodstock, June <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1'0.—The</span> Liberals succeeded 
               <br />
               in capturing a Conservative meeting at Brae- 
               <br />
               mar, North Oxford, last night, and the pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings at times were unusually lively. The 
               <br />
               Tory speakers were Dr. Weltord, of Woodstock, 
               <br />
               and E. Gus Porter. M.P.. while Mr. D. D. Mc— 
               <br />
               kenzie, M.P., of Cape Breton, and Mr. J. S. 
               <br />
               Mackay, of Woodstock, went out on behalf of the 
               <br />
               opposition. There was some quibbling at the 
               <br />
               outset as to the order of speaking. and the time 
               <br />
               to be occupied. Ultimately Dr. Weltord spoke 
               <br />
               for about ten minutes. Messrs. Mackay and 
               <br />
               McKenzie occupied <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">three—quarters</span> of an hour 
               <br />
               between them, and Mr. Porter addressed the 
               <br />
               meeting for an hour and a halt. Mr. McKenzie 
               <br />
               made a very forcible speech and quite carried 
               <br />
               the audience with him, and after Mr. Porter 
               <br />
               had spoken asked for two minutes in which to 
               <br />
               answer him. The Conservatives objected, but 
               <br />
               a Liberal stalwart named John Mackay said 
               <br />
               the audience wanted to hear the matter out, 
               <br />
               even if they had to remain till morning. The 
               <br />
               Liberals obtained the upper hand, and Mr. 
               <br />

               There were some warm passages in the course

               <br />
               explained that when Mr. Porter said that he 
               <br />
               said what he knew was untrue, and he added: 
               <br />
               I brand as a slanderer and a coward the man 
               <br />

               Mr. Porter challenged Mr. McKenzie by say-

               <br />
               made by the hon. member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster) on April 6 and reported in 
               <br />

               member for North Toronto said:

               There were certain things that my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend, however, did not say and they are quite 
               <br />
               as remarkable as the things that he did say. 
               <br />
               He has been told times Without number to his 
               <br />
               face in this House and he hasnot once risen 
               <br />
               to deny it, it has been very courteously brought 
               <br />
               to his attention to-day and he has thoroughly 
               <br />
               ignored it, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> he brought down his 
               <br />
               educational clause on February 21. 1905, there 
               <br />
               had been numerous conferences between himself 
               <br />
               and Monseigneur Sbarretti with reference to the 
               <br />
               provisions of that Bill. There is no denial yet.

               Mr. Speaker, I ask you, I ask this House. I ask 
               <br />
               the people of this country if it has come to this 
               <br />
