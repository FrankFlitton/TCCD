               Another argument in favour of entrusting 
               <br />
               these lands to the people is that the lands 
               <br />
               can be better administered and controlled 
               <br />
               in the province than at Ottawa. They can 
               <br />
               be better administered and controlled by 
               <br />
               ofﬁcers of the provincial government in 
               <br />

               near at hand than by the otﬁcers of the

               <br />
               there. as I have said before, why a citizen 
               <br />

               <br />
               the citizen ot‘ the Northwest must be obliged, 
               <br />
               for the same purpose. to write or send to

               <br />
               extended argument on this subject. The 
               <br />
               matter has been dealt with in detail by my 
               <br />

               The arguments of the government on this 
               <br />
               subject are threefold. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) bases his main con- 
               <br />
               tention on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the"</span> necessity of controlling the 
               <br />
               lands- that they may be used as a means of 
               <br />
               promoting immigration. He says there 
               <br />
               must be free homestead entries, and there- 
               <br />
               fore there Inust be control of the lands at 
               <br />
               Ottawa. This consideration seems entitled 
               <br />
               to no great weight. I dealt with it on a 
               <br />
               previous occasion. Another hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               seemed to be under the impression 
               <br />
               that there would be less corruption 
               <br />
               it‘ the administration of the lands were 
               <br />
               in the hands of the central govern- 
               <br />
               ment than if they were administered 
               <br />
               by the provinces. The Prime Minister ad- 
               <br />
               duces on this subject the example of the 
               <br />
               United States, where the federal government 
               <br />
               has retained the control of the public lands 
               <br />
               —although he took good care not to follow 
               <br />
               the United States with respect to certain 
               <br />
               other features of the Bill to which public 
               <br />
               attention has been called. The example of 
               <br />
               the United States has not-been a happy one, 
               <br />
               if we test this question by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possibility</span> of

               corruption. Those who have. investigated

               <br />
               been in connection with the public lands.

               The additional reasons which inﬂuenced the

               administration are those which they do not

               openly state—the desire for preserving pat-

               provisions of clause 12 of the Bill and of the

               schedule which forms part of that clause. 
               <br />
               These matters have been discussed very

               lesson in this distribution which seems to 
               <br />

               <br />
               250,000. The number of members in the 
               <br />

               those people should be represented in par—

               <br />
               not heard a murmur ot‘ protest, either in this

               breeds, or a total population of 941 among 
               <br />
               whom electOrs might be found. In addition 
               <br />
               to this, the Peace River district contained 
               <br />
