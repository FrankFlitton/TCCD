               the poliCy of the government, acting con- 
               <br />
               jointly with the Canadian Paclﬁc Railway

               rights over that line from Peterborough to 
               <br />

               gentleman may recall the fact that the

               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway runs directly from 
               <br />
               Montreal, passing Peterborough on to T0-

               ronto. Any grain that may be carried by 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway to their port 
               <br />
               at Owen Sound, is thus carried to Toronto, 
               <br />
               then to Peterborough and on eastward to 
               <br />
               Montreal. The Grand Trunk has several 
               <br />
               towns on the Georgian bay which are fed 
               <br />
               by the grain trade, namely, Meaford, Col— 
               <br />
               lingwood and Midland, and lines run- 
               <br />
               ning through those points carry grain to 
               <br />
               Peterborough and thence on to the main 
               <br />
               line of the Grand Trunk. Now, the min— 
               <br />
               ister has not stated, and of course it is not 
               <br />
               fair that the House should expect him to 
               <br />
               state, what remuneration or proﬁt he ex-

               running rights over these lines commonly 
               <br />

               a large amount of money will have to be 
               <br />
               spent by the Grand Trunk, acting conjointly 
               <br />
               with the government, in order to bring 
               <br />
               this road up to the standard. 
               <br />

               That mileage will be 263 miles and a large 
               <br />
               amount of money would have of necessity 
               <br />
               to be expended in that behalf. If the gov-

               ernment—and I am only throwing this out 
               <br />
               at the present time asasuggestion for their 
               <br />
               consideration—would acquire running rights 
               <br />
               over the branch of the Grand Trunk Rail- 
               <br />
               way from Midland to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Peter-borough</span> they 
               <br />
               would then have to pay a portion of the 
               <br />
               cost of improving that road. The mileage 
               <br />
               of that road, I think, is somewhere near 
               <br />
               100 miles, so that only 100 miles of railway 
               <br />
               would have to be improved at the cost of 
               <br />
               the Grand Trunk and the Dominion as 
               <br />

               Minister of Railways and Canals that be- 
               <br />
               tween Ottawa and Parry Sound there is 
               <br />
               practically an unbroken waste of country. 
               <br />
               There is not a town on the whole system, 
               <br />
               although there are villages of considerable 
               <br />
               importance, whereas, between Midland and 
               <br />
               Peterborough there are large towns. There 
               <br />
               are the towns of Orillia, Peterborough and 
               <br />
