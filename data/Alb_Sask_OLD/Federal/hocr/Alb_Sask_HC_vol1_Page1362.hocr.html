               that the minister was not here last fall at- 
               <br />
               tending to the duties of his ofﬁce. It is 
               <br />
               a matter that almost every member of the 
               <br />
               House was acquainted with. The next point 
               <br />
               is that tenders were not invited for this 
               <br />
               work which was an open violation of the 
               <br />
               Order in Council which provides that all 
               <br />
               public works involving an expenditure of 
               <br />
               more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5,000</span> shall be let by tender. This 
               <br />
               could not be let by tender. Why was it 
               <br />
               not let by tender ? Why was there an open 
               <br />
               and ﬂagrant violation of the law ? I would 
               <br />
               like to ask that question of the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister who is responsible for carry- 
               <br />
               ing out the law as we understand it. It 
               <br />
               was for a good purpose that such a law was 
               <br />
               made. The next question I wish to direct 
               <br />
               attention to is, that, from all the informa- 
               <br />
               tion we can gather from those who profess 
               <br />
               to be familiar with this class of work. it 
               <br />
               was let for a much larger sum than it could 
               <br />
               be done for, that it cost at least 95 cents 
               <br />
               per square yard over and above What it 
               <br />
               should have cost. Then, if we remember 
               <br />
               that the contract was given to a company 
               <br />
               which holds the patent for this work, that 
               <br />
               no others could tender for it and that there 
               <br />
               was no competition, it must be evident that 
               <br />
               it was given to them at their own ﬁgure. The 
               <br />
               hon. acting minister says that they paid no 
               <br />
               more than the city paid for the same work. 
               <br />
               I assume that the city got the work done 
               <br />
               by the same company and that there was no 
               <br />
               competition. There was no person to com- 
               <br />
               pete with the company. they holding the 
               <br />
               patent of this invention. or whatever you 
               <br />
               call it. Therefore, there could be no compe- 
               <br />
               tition and I have no doubt they got the work 
               <br />
               at a ﬁgure which gave them a very good 
               <br />
               return in the way of proﬁts and otherwise. 
               <br />
               Then, it was given to a very old friend of 
               <br />
               the government, to a ﬁrm that has been very 
               <br />
               useful to the government, one of the impor- 
               <br />
               tant members of which is a handy man 
               <br />
               ready to run for them when they cannot get 
               <br />
               a candidate anywhere else. He is ready to 
               <br />
               stump the country in favour of the Liberals 
               <br />
               anywhere; he was in my riding stumping 
               <br />
               against me; he was in several other ridings, 
               <br />
               he was around the city of Toronto ; he was 
               <br />
               always the handy man available when no- 
               <br />
               body else could be got to take the stump 
               <br />
               or to run as a candidate when they were 
               <br />
               hard up for a candidate. Mr. Robinette 
               <br />
               never deserted the government until a few 
               <br />
               months ago when he refused to run for 
               <br />
               Centre Toronto, and then the government 
               <br />
               had become so unpopular that he dared not 
               <br />
               take chances. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Ve</span> do not know whether or 
               <br />
               not he is likely to get this other contract, 
               <br />
               but at least we do hope that the publicity 
               <br />
               which has been given to this transaction 
               <br />
               may induce the government to let the next 
               <br />
               contract according to the provisions of the 
               <br />
               law. Let them give the contract by public 
               <br />
               tender and by public competition, let them 
               <br />
               keep themselves within the law, and see 
               <br />
               that the country gets a fair return for every 
               <br />
               dollar that is spent.
