               the Liberal candidate in Centre Toronto. 
               <br />
               They hand over this contract to this com— 
               <br />
               pany at $10,000. I do not think any one 
               <br />
               will challenge the statement that if this 
               <br />
               work in the area in front of this building is 
               <br />
               to be called a complete work, it is a very poor 
               <br />
               class of work and if you go to Sparks street 
               <br />
               or to Toronto or to any other city where 
               <br />
               pavements are laid you will ﬁnd no pave- 
               <br />
               ment like this which has such an irregular 
               <br />
               surface that you are almost blinded by the 
               <br />
               dust from it. We have seen men empIOyed 
               <br />
               in this class of work and we know what is 
               <br />
               done ; it is either hand ti'owelled or trowel- 
               <br />
               led by machinery, and yet this imperfect 
               <br />
               work is paid for at the rate of $2.25 per 
               <br />
               yard. I have it on good information that 
               <br />
               asphalt pavements are laid in towns and 
               <br />
               cities in his province and in Quebec at 
               <br />
               from $2.25 to $2.50 per square yard, and 
               <br />
               yet here We are paying for a miserable work 
               <br />
               no less than $2.25. Here is the complaint 
               <br />
               and it is a well—founded complaint, that the 
               <br />
               department had no right or business to give 
               <br />
               this contract at $2.25 or any other price 
               <br />
               without asking for tenders. The depart- 
               <br />
               ment cannot shelter itself with the state- 
               <br />
               ment that they had no knowledge of what 
               <br />
               it would cost. Surely the department is 
               <br />
               well equipped with oﬂicials, and surely 
               <br />
               these oﬂ‘icials could estimate what the area 
               <br />
               and cost of the work would be, and yet 
               <br />
               in the face of that fact the department 
               <br />
               hands over this contract, between $9,000 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$10,000,</span> to a company which is certainly 
               <br />
               not unfriendly to the government, hav-

               <br />
               dates, Mr. Robinette. I supose that to-

               morrow the Toronto ‘Globe’ will come to 
               <br />
               the rescue of Mr. Robinette and it will be 
               <br />
               the old story, that this company was being 
               <br />
               formed and to make up the company his 
               <br />
               name was used. That was the excuse in the 
               <br />
               case of the Owen Sound Dredging Company. 
               <br />
               There you ﬁnd that the plant owned by 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               in the hands of a joint-stock company and

               a power behind the throne in this case and

               time of an election, a political leverage can 
               <br />
               be exercised and used by a party follower 
               <br />

               <br />

               to the nature of the work that is performed 
               <br />
               on Wellington street, but in the meantime 
               <br />
               any person who has ever seen these pave-

               <br />
               the work in front of the building is of the 
               <br />
               most inferior nature. I do not believe it 
               <br />

               <br />
               that has been performed worse than that, 
               <br />
               and the department, fearing that it mlght

               Mr. SPROULE. There are two or three 
               <br />
               things about this transaction that attract 
               <br />
               one’s attention. The excuse to-day is not 
               <br />
               the chapter of accidents we hadyesterday, 
               <br />
               and it was wonderful how they worked in 
               <br />
               all these accidents to the advantage of One 
               <br />
               side, of course, as an evidence of the busi-

               ness acumen and ability they have dis-

               played. In this case the ﬁrst thing that 
               <br />
               attracts my attention is the excuse given 
               <br />
               by the hon. acting Minister of Public Works 
               <br />
               (Mr. Hyman) why they Were prepared to 
               <br />
               lay down a certain kind of pavement on Wel-

               lington street. Every resident on Wel— 
               <br />
               lington street asked for it. All the residents 
               <br />
               on the street joined in the representation

               that that was the kind of pavement that 
               <br />
               was required. Would it not be apparent to 
               <br />
               any one having to do with it that some one 
               <br />
               must have gone around and invited their 
               <br />
               signatures to a petition for that purpose ?
