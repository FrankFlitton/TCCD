               to the bargain knows the Dominion power 
               <br />
               can continue that protection. But then there 
               <br />
               is another way of looking at it. We are 
               <br />
               here as trustees dealing with the people’s 
               <br />

               <br />
               as provinces. For my part, I would not be 
               <br />
               worried about the-other contracting party. 
               <br />
               except so far as it would cause him to con— 
               <br />
               sider a claim. I am not admitting it, but to 
               <br />
               make myself understood, I would say that 
               <br />
               the government of this country might be 
               <br />
               liable for any action for damages for breach 
               <br />
               of contract for having undertaken to deliver 
               <br />
               goods that it could not deliver. But that 
               <br />
               would not be a reason for passing legislation 
               <br />
               that would be ultra vires. If we did make 
               <br />
               a bargain in order <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\to</span> get some one to do

               something else, in order to get a beneﬁt for 
               <br />
               ourselves. and if we found out afterwards 
               <br />
               that what we agreed to do we had no right 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do,</span> it might follow that the King would 
               <br />
               be liable to an action for damages if we 
               <br />
               carried out what we agreed to do, and 
               <br />
               thereby disappointed the person we were 
               <br />
               contracting with. It would not make it right 
               <br />
               for us. for the sake of getting out of an 
               <br />
               action for damages, to do something that 
               <br />
               might be entirely beyond our power.

               land by an individual in that section of the

               the province the power of eminent domain, 
               <br />

               bodying them in this Act of parliament. I 
               <br />
               have stated that in granting autonomy to 
               <br />
               the province, the exclusive control over 
               <br />
               property and civil rights is given to the 
               <br />
               province. But you are making admittedly 
               <br />
               a curtailment of those rights, because, hav- 
               <br />
               ing made a bargain in the acquisition of 
               <br />
               that province by which the Hudson Bay
