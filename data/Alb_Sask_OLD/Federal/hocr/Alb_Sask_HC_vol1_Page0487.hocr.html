               against these things in Ontario and we were 
               <br />

               <br />
               this : There is a clause in the Ontario Act, 
               <br />
               and it is a good one, which allows a Pro— 
               <br />
               testant tenant of Catholic property to deter- 
               <br />

               property to determine that his taxes shall 
               <br />

               to the separate schools you will see that 
               <br />
               there was a necessity for a change in the
