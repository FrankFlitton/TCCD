               Here is a gentleman who takes the view,

               Mr. PATERSON. I will speak loud 
               <br />
               enough. I am not like the hon. gentleman ; 
               <br />

               <br />
               to speak it out. There are men in the Lib-

               eral party, grand men, excellent men, who 
               <br />
               have my esteem, and who will have my

               esteem even if they leave the party and 
               <br />
               feel that they cannot continue longer with 
               <br />
               us, because they think that we are wrong 
               <br />
               in this matter. I think when they thoroughly 
               <br />
               understand this Bill, when the past is past, 
               <br />
               when we enjoy that peace and unity that 
               <br />
               will prevail, and that progress and pros— 
               <br />
               perity which will result, as we be- 
               <br />
               lieve they will revise their opinions. 
               <br />
               But, whether they are able to do so 
               <br />
               or not, their views will be respected 
               <br />
               by me. I will give them credit for con- 
               <br />
               scientiousness ; but I do think this, that if 
               <br />
               they had calmly considered the question, 
               <br />
               some of them, limited in their number, 
               <br />
               grand men, who, in the heat of their feel- 
               <br />
               ings on this question and viewing it from 
               <br />
               their standpoint, have uttered certain 
               <br />
               things against the right hon. Prime Minister 
               <br />
               of this Dominion, will regret themselves 
               <br />
               having said, for instance, that he has de- 
               <br />
               parted from the principles that he advocat- 
               <br />
               ed in days gone by, that he has sacriﬁced 
               <br />
               the principles that he declared to be good 
               <br />
               and that he would ever stand by. While 
               <br />
               I regret that it is the case that such state-

               because there is something in the tone of

               my hon. friend, even when he gives utter—

               notice that my good friend the Min-

               <br />
               in a very deep voice, spoke somewnat 
               <br />
               low when he assured the House that this

               <br />
               nothing which would in any way trench 
               <br />
               upon the rights of the majority, and that 
               <br />
               the importance of that enactment had been 
               <br />
               very much exaggerated, because it contain- 
               <br />
               ed very little. My hon. friend’s voice was 
               <br />
               very deep, but it was hardly lower 
               <br />
               than that of the hon. Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               (Mr. Fielding) last night when he made the 
               <br />
               startling announcement that so triﬂing were 
               <br />
               the concessions we gave that the schools 
               <br />
               which this Bill was intended to create would 
               <br />
               almost infallibly disappear before long. My 
               <br />
               attention has been drawn, Mr. Speaker, to 
               <br />
               a caricature in to—day’s Montreal ‘Herald.’ 
               <br />
               at which I feel very much offended. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend the leader of the opposition (Mr. 
               <br />
               R. L. Borden) is represented as sitting on a 
               <br />
               wharf with a ﬁsh basket. At one side of 
               <br />
               him is the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule) with a ﬁsh on the end of his line, 
               <br />
               and on the other side myself with another 
               <br />
               ﬁsh. We are both supposed to be ﬁshing 
               <br />
               on each side of the wharf different kinds 
               <br />
               of ﬁsh that are called petitions, in order to 
               <br />
               put them into the basket held by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the leader of the opposition. The 
               <br />
               only difference between myself and my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from East Grey is that I have a tall 
               <br />
               hat on and he has a Christy stiff. It will be 
               <br />
               for the hon. member for East Grey to clear 
               <br />
               himself of this imputation, but for my part 
               <br />
               I can say positively that during the course 
               <br />
               of the present discussion I have ﬁshed for 
               <br />
