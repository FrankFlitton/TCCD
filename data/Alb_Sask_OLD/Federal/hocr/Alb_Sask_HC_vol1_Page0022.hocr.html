               question in the light of experience, in the

               <br />
               modiﬁed the provisions of this Bill, and 
               <br />
               might very well have entrusted to the

               people of the Northwest Territories exact-

               enjoyed by the people of the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. I venture to say further that if 
               <br />
               he was not willing to trust the people, as 
               <br />
               I would be willing to trust the people, in 
               <br />
               this regard—if he regarded them as pos- 
               <br />
               sibly improvident, as was suggested by the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior last session or the 
               <br />
               session before—if he feared the result, he 
               <br />
               might at least have given them the control 
               <br />
               of the public lands within their respective 
               <br />
               provinces, subject to some such restriction 
               <br />
               as that which he has proposed in regard to 
               <br />
               education. If the principle is good in the 
               <br />
               one case, I do not see why it should not 
               <br />
               work out fairly well in the other case. 
               <br />
               There are other features of the Bill which 
               <br />
               will undoubtedly invite discussion. The 
               <br />
               subject which the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               mentioned last, on which he spoke with 
               <br />
               great eloquence, and in a spirit of forbear- 
               <br />
               ance and moderation, viii undoubtedly in— 
               <br />
               vite discussion. I do not propose to dis— 
               <br />
               cuss it this afternoon. There is just one 
               <br />
               thing, however, that I would like to say 
               <br />
               about it, and that is that I understand that 
               <br />
               up tothe present time there has been really 
               <br />
               no school question, to use the common ex-

               Brown regarded this matter as having been

               speak in an absolutely legal sense. I do
