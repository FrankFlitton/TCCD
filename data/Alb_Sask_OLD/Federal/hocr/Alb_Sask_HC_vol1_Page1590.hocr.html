               <br />
               were obliged by reason of an order issued 
               <br />
               by the government to absent themselves 
               <br />
               from the polling divisions at which they 
               <br />
               would have a right to vote and by reason of 
               <br />
               this thus absenting themselves the number 
               <br />
               of votes polled in the south was less than 
               <br />
               it ought to have been or otherwise would 
               <br />
               have been. had it not been for the order

               hand, in the north we have the statement

               made that more votes were polled than 
               <br />
               were on the voters’ lists. Therefore the

               than there were names on the voters’ lists

               in the north while the percentage of votes

               cast in relation to the number on the list 
               <br />
               in the south was less than it should be, as I 
               <br />
               have said by reason of the men having to 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment or lose their cattle. Is th t a correct 
               <br />
               statement of fact? If it is then if you 
               <br />
               take the number of votes polled you are 
               <br />
               not doing a proper thing for the south as 
               <br />
               against the north. That is unfair if that

               <br />

               in the south as alleged some ranchers did 
               <br />
               not record their votes. That could not be 
               <br />
               a large number, I do not know the reason

               but I am prepared to look into the question 
               <br />
               from a broader point of view than that. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that is a small way ot looking 
               <br />

               <br />
               tleman the beneﬁt of everything there is in 
               <br />
               those ﬁgures which I have quoted. I have 
               <br />
               taken these ﬁgures and they tell against us 
               <br />
               in some instances and against the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman in some instances; we have to take 
               <br />
               them as they are and to come to the best 
               <br />
               conclusion with such information as we 
               <br />
               have. I stated yesterday at the opening of 
               <br />
               the discussion that we took as the basis of 
               <br />
               the distribution which we made, the condi- 
               <br />
               tion of things existing at the present time, 
               <br />
               the number of seats assigned to the 
               <br />
               province of Alberta in the present legisla- 
               <br />
               ture of the Territory which amounts to 16. 
               <br />
               First of all we had to increase that by 10, 
               <br />
               We had to give to Alberta 10 more seats 
               <br />
               than there are to-day in the legislature of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories within the limits 
               <br />
               of Alberta. How are we to come to that 
               <br />
               conclusion? We come to that conclusion 
               <br />
               upon information derived from three sources 
               <br />
               which we submit to the House to be chal- 
               <br />
               lenged. We take ﬁrst the number of votes 
               <br />
               recorded. We do not say to the House that 
               <br />
               this is the only thing we should take into 
               <br />
               consideration; we say that is one thing 
               <br />
               which. ought to be taken into consideration 
               <br />
               but not alone. We take next the number of 
               <br />
               votes registered; we do not say that is the 
               <br />
               only thing to be taken, that is only one of 
               <br />
               many things on which we should form our 
               <br />
               judgment. Then we take the census of 1901. 
               <br />
               That is the best thing of all. If we had a 
               <br />
               census for 1905 we would not have to con- 
               <br />
               sider the number of recorded votes nor the 
               <br />
               number of registered votes, nor the number 
               <br />
               of post ofﬁces, school districts or improve- 
               <br />
               ment districts ; we would take only the cen- 
               <br />
               sus for 1905. But we have no census of 
               <br />
               1905 and therefore we have to make up our 
               <br />
               minds as to what is the actual population at 
               <br />
               the present time. We know that the popu- 
               <br />
               lation at the present time is double what 
               <br />
               it was in 1901, and we have to make our 
               <br />
               calculation accordingly. But though the 
               <br />
               population has doubled, I think it is only a 
               <br />
               fair suggestion that we must ﬁnd a wealth 
               <br />
               of information in the census of 1901. We 
               <br />
               say moreover that we think this is some- 
               <br />
               thing to go on, not the number of 
               <br />
               post oﬂices, school districts and im-
