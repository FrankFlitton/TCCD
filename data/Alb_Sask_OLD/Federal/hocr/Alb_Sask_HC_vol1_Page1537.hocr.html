               night. As to section 16, No. 2. it deprives

               hon. gentleman (Mr. Armand Lavergne) a 
               <br />
               question. Does he concede that under the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amended</span> clause 16, the Catholics are de- 
               <br />
               prived of any rights to denominational 
               <br />
               schools other than the right to religious in- 
               <br />
               struction? Under section 41, chapter 29, 
               <br />
               the minority of the ratepayers in a district 
               <br />
               whether Protestant or. Catholic have the 
               <br />
               right to establish separate schools. Under 
               <br />
               section 45, that school must be established 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(subject</span> to the privileges and according to 
               <br />
               the method the government has provided 
               <br />
               in chapter 29. Now. under that, are the 
               <br />
               schools separate and public, placed upon 
               <br />
               the same footing except in regard to re- 
               <br />
               ligious instruction ?

               Mr. A. LAVERGNE. That is my opin- 
               <br />
               ion. And that has been corroborated by 
               <br />
               a Conservative paper in Quebec called 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"</span> L’Evenement.’ That paper says that to-

               day denominational schools in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories have ceased to exist since 
               <br />
               the ordinances were passed. I may say in
