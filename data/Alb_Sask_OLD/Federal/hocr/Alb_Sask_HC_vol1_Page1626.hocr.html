               Mr. LAKE. The letter that I received 
               <br />
               from Mr. Haultain invited me to meet 
               <br />
               other members of parliament and senators 
               <br />
               from the Northwest in conference during 
               <br />
               the progress of. the Autonomy Bill discus- 
               <br />
               ‘sion. That is the only letter I have had 
               <br />
               from Mr. Haultain on the subject. He did 
               <br />
               not mention the subject of constituencies— 
               <br />
               in fact, speaking from memory, he did not 
               <br />
               go into any details, but merely suggested 
               <br />
               that we should meet and discuss mat- 
               <br />
               ters in general. I have always understood 
               <br />
               that, so far as the distribution of consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies is concerned, it was only the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) who held 
               <br />
               out against this matter being submitted to 
               <br />
               the judges. That is the elTect of rumours 
               <br />
               that I have heard from Conservatives, 
               <br />
               not from rLiberals. The Norhhwest mem- 
               <br />
               bers, I understood, were in favour of this 
               <br />
               course, and there was simply the member 
               <br />
               for Edmonton who was opposed to it. An- 
               <br />
               other matter discussed at the conference 
               <br />
               was the matter of one or two provinces. 
               <br />
               But, after all, these questions are apart 
               <br />
               from the question we ought to be dis- 
               <br />
               cussing at the present moment. As the 
               <br />
               hon. members for Strathcona (Mr. Peter

               <br />

               and the population which was to be allow- 
               <br />
               ed to each was figured out'. It was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.ﬁgured</span> 
               <br />
               out that, working on these lines, the consti- 
               <br />
               tuency of Alberta would get one' member 
               <br />
               to every 4,700 population; the district of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assiniiboia</span> one member to 4,492; the dis- 
               <br />
               trict of Saskatchewan, one to 4,279. It will 
               <br />
               be noticed that the distribution, looked at 
               <br />
               from that point of view, was a fair one. 
               <br />
               There" was only a margin of less than 5 per 
               <br />
               ce‘nt as between the amounts allowed to 
               <br />
               these three dist-riots from the average of the 
               <br />
               whole. It was decided to interfere as 
               <br />
               little as possible with existing local 
               <br />
               constituencies, and that may account for 
               <br />
               a certain discrepancy in the total votes 
               <br />
               cast, but I do not think it is necessary to 
               <br />
               go into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> ﬁgures, and the ﬁgures given 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Strathcona (Mr. P. 
               <br />
               Talbot) are different in many respects from 
               <br />
               those I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have,</span> which were made out by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               Northwest 'government. At the time of 
               <br />
               the redistribution we had a very lively op- 
               <br />
               position in the legislative assembly, who 
               <br />
               were ready to ﬁnd fault on eve‘ry pretext. 
               <br />
               It was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">just</span> on the evel of an election; and 
               <br />
               surely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jf</span> there had been any attempt at a 
               <br />
               gerrymander that would have been brought 
               <br />
               up in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the;</span> House. But what do we .ﬁnd? 
               <br />
               Looking over the reports, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[ﬁnd</span> for instance 
               <br />
               two objections were made by Mr. Patrick, of 
               <br />
               the district of Yorkton. The ﬁrst was that 
               <br />
               there should be another representative up 
               <br />
               there, because he had an additional popula- 
               <br />
               tion of 5,000 Doukhobors, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hel</span> did not 
               <br />
               press that very hard. And it“ was shown 
               <br />
               him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> his total population was a very 
               <br />
               fair one under the circumstances. He also 
               <br />
               thought there should be one more mem- 
               <br />
               ber in the House. It was found necessary 
               <br />
               to reduce the representation in the district 
               <br />
               of Saskatchewan by one. Mr. Mackay, of 
               <br />
               Prince Albert, also objected to losing one 
               <br />
               member from one of the constituencies of 
               <br />
               Prince Albert, which was cut off. Mr. Ben- 
               <br />
               nett simply objected to the! Liberal execu-
