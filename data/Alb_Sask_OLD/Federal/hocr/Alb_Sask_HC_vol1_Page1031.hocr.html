               Mr. JOHN BARR (Dufferin). I would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">like,</span> 
               <br />
               to ask if the Postmaster General has taken 
               <br />
               into consideration the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> under 
               <br />
               which members labour in connection with 
               <br />
               the franking of the papers which they send 
               <br />
               out. By the last decision they have been 
               <br />
               deprived of the use of a stamp. I am aware 
               <br />
               that it was decided some time ago that mem- 
               <br />
               bers should put their frank on every docu- 
               <br />
               ment they sent out, but I do not think that 
               <br />
               the members fully considered the great in— 
               <br />
               convenience that would entail. Many of us 
               <br />
               have several thousand documents to send 
               <br />
               out, and we are not permitted to employ any 
               <br />
               one else to do the work. If we were re- 
               <br />
               quired only to frank our letters, that would 
               <br />
               not be much of a hardship, but when we 
               <br />
               have to frank all the papers and documents 
               <br />
               that we send out, it becomes a great hard- 
               <br />
               ship. I hope the Postmaster General will 
               <br />
               give the matter his consideration, and permit 
               <br />
               the use of a stamp so far as documents are 
               <br />
               concerned.
