               how could their children be educated?

               Sir, it would be just as unreasonable to

               interfere with the privileges of the minority

               question which is now before us. It is

               dealing with this question in any other

               way, for instance, by leaving it to the

               question in 1896 was simply a joke. and 
               <br />
               did he welcome another agitation of the

               weeks and months on a question of this

               manner in which this question was intro-

               duced, and I can see no reasonable excuse

               for it being so introduced.
