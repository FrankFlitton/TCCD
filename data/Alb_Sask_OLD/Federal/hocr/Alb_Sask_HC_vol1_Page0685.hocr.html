               argued almost entirely on the constitutional

               What I contend is this. That the only 
               <br />
               power that we have as a parliament, under 
               <br />
               the Act of 1871, is to provide &amp; constitution ; 
               <br />
               not such a constitution as we may think ﬁt 
               <br />
               to give to these provinces, but a constitu- 
               <br />
               tion in accord with the provisions of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act. If you read 
               <br />
               into clause 2 of the Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1571</span> the other 
               <br />
               clauses of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               that constitution has to be in accordance 
               <br />
               with the Act of 1867. Therefore, my own 
               <br />
               personal view is that section 93 would apply. 
               <br />
               However, there is a great difference of 
               <br />
               opinion on this question. We have the 
               <br />
               opinions of some very able men that the 
               <br />
               whole subject is now open to be dealt with 
               <br />
               by this parliament. My own belief is that 
               <br />
               in a matter Where there is such a great 
               <br />
               difference of opinion as to Whether the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment have the right constitutionally to 
               <br />
               interfere in any way with the education 
               <br />
               clauses, that it would have been wiser 
               <br />
               and in every way better to have submitted 
               <br />
               these clauses <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> a judicial tribunal and have 
               <br />
               them interpreted before passing this Bill. 
               <br />
               We create these provinces now with these 
               <br />
               educational clauses in their constitution, 
               <br />
               and we are only going to create friction in

               these two new provinces. The opinion of 
               <br />
               some of the best men in Canada is that you 
               <br />
               are going beyond the constitutional powers 
               <br />
               conferred upon this parliament by the Brit- 
               <br />
               ish North America Act, and we shall have, 
               <br />
               in all probability, a repetition of what has 
               <br />
               occurred in the province of Manitoba. There 
               <br />
               would have been no trouble in submitting 
               <br />
               these educational clauses to a judicial tri— 
               <br />
               banal—the law provides means by which 
               <br />
               the matter could have been referred to our 
               <br />
               Supreme Court, and from the decision of 
               <br />
               that court there could have been an appeal 
               <br />
               to the Privy Council. We could then have 
               <br />
               had the constitutional question settled be- 
               <br />
               yond any doubt.

               Now, Sir, just before I close I would like 
               <br />
               to refer once more to the position of aﬁfairs 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories. Let me quote 
               <br />
               one sentence from the statement made by 
               <br />
               Premier Haultain in his letter of March 
               <br />
               11th. He says : 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               Our laws and institutions are admittedly em- 
               <br />
               clent and satisfactory. Under them the people 
               <br />
               of the Territories have acquired a political 
               <br />
               individuality and identity as distinct as that of 
               <br />
               the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> province.

               It is evident that Mr. Hau‘ltain stated 
               <br />
               what is absolutely correct. For the past

               thirty years we have had no complaint in
