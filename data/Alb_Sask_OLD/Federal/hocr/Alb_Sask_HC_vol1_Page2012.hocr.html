               <br />
               the constitution of 1867, but they have, on 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> the contrary, been inspired by its funda- 
               <br />
               mental principle, in granting to the French 
               <br />
               language in Manitoba the same rights which 
               <br />
               the constitution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iitself</span> grants to the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion parliament. And if we wish ourselves 
               <br />
               to remain faithful to that principle, we 
               <br />
               should follow their example and provide 
               <br />
               that the French and English tongues will 
               <br />
               be for ever, and on an equal footing, ofﬁcial

               <br />
               vast territories which are the property of 
               <br />
               the whole Canadian people. What I claim, 
               <br />
               is the carrying out of the same principle 
               <br />
               which was applied in connection with the 
               <br />
               establishment of the Dominion itself. It 
               <br />
               is the principle which Sir John Macdonald 
               <br />
               advocated when he proclaimed that there 
               <br />
               were no longer in Canada victors and 
               <br />
               \anquished. but two allies whose rights, 
               <br />
               equal by virtue of the constitution, are not 
               <br />
               measured by the numbers and riches of the 
               <br />
               various groups. That is the principle which 
               <br />
               is embodied in the constitution of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               That is the principle which I would have 
               <br />
               recognized and applied to-day. I am not 
               <br />
               breaking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> constitution, but parliament

               In order to do away with a proposal rest—

               to. It is argued that the original compact

               and the rights of the French language in the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               reason for us to repeat it and aggravate it. 
               <br />
               If parliament in 1890 misapprehended the 
               <br />

               <br />
               it is our bounden duty to correct that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mils-</span> 
               <br />
               take. Parliament in 1890 abolished the use 
               <br />
               of the French language in the legislative 
               <br />
               assembly ; and now that injustice becomes 
               <br />
               an argument for those who Wish to carry

               with the printing in French of statutes and 
               <br />
               legal proceedings. An effort is made to pal-

               liate that wrong by covering it up with a 
               <br />
               further crime. To that 1 answer boldly: 
               <br />
               Instead of resuming the work initiated by 
               <br />
               parliament in 1890. let us retrace our foot— 
               <br />
               steps and take the stand taken formerly by 
               <br />

               In this connection there has been some 
               <br />
               quibbling. It has been contended that we 
               <br />
               are not doing away with the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage, but that we are simply leaving to

               <br />
               right to act as they think ﬁt. That is 
               <br />
               another attempt at hedging. We all know

               guage it‘ provincial legislatures are granted 
               <br />

               <br />
               enlighten us in that respect. When, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1890.</span>

               Sir John Thompson moved that the legis-

               <br />
               tongue its proceedings would 'be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carried</span> on. 
               <br />
               the then leader of the opposition, to-day 
               <br />
               Premier of this Dominion (Sir Wilfrid Lau- 
               <br />
               rier) seconded his motion. He drew atten- 
               <br />
               tion to the fact <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> there was not at the 
               <br />
               time a single French Canadian member in 
               <br />
               the legislative assembly. He added that if 
               <br />
               the French minority should elect a single

               the use of the French language. What was 
               <br />
               the outcome ? In 1892, Mr. Haultain moved 
               <br />
               the abolition of the French language. At 
               <br />
               the time there were two French Canadian
