               judge at all from what we read in the news-

               papers from the west, and particularly from

               these proposed provinces), the people of 
               <br />
               Alberta had somewhat got the idea that 
               <br />
               they were going to have a commission

               which would delimit these constituencies,

               quotations from some of the papers that 
               <br />
               this is what the local desire calls for. 
               <br />
               Also we can readily prove, from the same 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sources,</span> that the people of Alberta are

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grievously</span> disappointed with the action of 
               <br />
               the government in this respect. I wish to

               why the people of Alberta are disappointed.

               have not relied on any oiﬁcials. We have 
               <br />
               made our own calculations we have checked 
               <br />
               and rechecked, and I think our schedule will 
               <br />
               stand the test. We have made independent

               <br />
               I want to reiterate what I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">already</span> said, 
               <br />
               that we are not discounting the future. 
               <br />
               We are dealing with things as they are;

               consequently, the ﬁgures which we should

               look for are the figures as they exist. What 
               <br />
               is the extent and character of this country

               that we are called upon to deal with ? Here 
               <br />
               we have a stretch of territory, 360 miles ot‘

               and the ten constituencies on the south are 
               <br />
               given a population of 89,834, While the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">14</span> 
               <br />
               constituencies on the north are given a pop- 
               <br />
               ulation of 75,590. It is proposed here to 
               <br />
               give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">14</span> representatives to 75,590 people and 
               <br />
               10 representatives to 89,834 people. Is that 
               <br />
               fair play ? This calculation gives the total 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">want</span> to ask, as one searching for informa— 
               <br />
               tion, why should it require 9,000 people in 
               <br />
               the south to have a representative, when 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5.400</span> people in the north are thought good 
               <br />
               enough to have a member. I do not know 
               <br />
               the country very well, but is there such a 
               <br />
               difference between the calibre of the people 
               <br />
               of the north and the people of the south 
               <br />
               that it takes 9,000 people in the south to
