               Prime Minister has said in introducing this

               and newspapers and hardly touching the 
               <br />
               question at issue. I think that is a great 
               <br />
               mistake providing we want to do business 
               <br />
               and it seems to me that we should come to 
               <br />
               this House with the object of doing the 
               <br />
               business of the nation in the very best way 
               <br />
               possible.

               What is this system of education ? The 
               <br />
               Lon. members from the Territories say that 
               <br />
               there is not in Canada to-day a school 
               <br />
               system better adapted to their needs than 
               <br />
               that established in the Northwest Terri-

               <br />
               more than once, these ordinances make pro-

               of the members of this House to the powers
