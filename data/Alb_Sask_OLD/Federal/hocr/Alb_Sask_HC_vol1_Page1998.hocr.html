               <br />

               <br />
               .the government authorize that diversion. 
               <br />
               But there is another point. It is stated—I 
               <br />
               am not going to say how true that is—-that 
               <br />
               the intention is to divert the line and by 
               <br />
               that means divert the trafﬁc of that Simil-

               kameen country to the southern roads south 
               <br />
               of the boundary and consequently on to 
               <br />
               the smelters and the American coast trad- 
               <br />
               ing cities. That is stated. It is stated on 
               <br />
               the other hand that that is not intended. 
               <br />
               Well, one statement is as good as another. 
               <br />
               If it be best that the company should build 
               <br />
               on our own ground, either insert that pro- 
               <br />
               vision in the Act or let the government 
               <br />
               take the onus and responsibility of see- 
               <br />
               ing that within reasonable time as much of 
               <br />
               the railway as possible is built in Canadian 
               <br />
               territory. What seems to be, so far as I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.can</span> gather, the opinion of British Colum- 
               <br />
               bia—and what seems to be a reasonable 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinion—is</span> that, ﬁrst of all and as soon 
               <br />
               as possible, the road should be built from 
               <br />
               Cloverdale in towards Princeton and in to- 
               <br />
               wards the Similkameen valley just as far 
               <br />
               and as rapidly as possible. If any one will 
               <br />
               take the railroad map of that country, he 
               <br />
               will see that Mr. Hill’s lines tap our coun- 
               <br />
               try now at seven different points, all ot 
               <br />
               these lines running pretty closely north and 
               <br />
               south. There is a line built from New 
               <br />
               Westminster up to Cloverdale. That line 
               <br />
               at Cloverdale or near that point has a con- 
               <br />
               nection with the southern road; and it is 
               <br />
               to make it sure that that shall not also be 
               <br />
               Simply a tapping branch. but that it is the 
               <br />
               intention of the company to bring their road 
               <br />

               see the line running through there, but let 
               <br />
               there be fair guarantee that he will build 
               <br />
               his line through Canadian territory. That 
               <br />
               is all I want. It is‘not a question of try- 
               <br />
               ing to keep the ground for the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway. Other things being equal, 
               <br />
               I would rather see the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway build that line than any other 
               <br />
               company. I think the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way has put a great deal of enterprise and 
               <br />
               capital and labour in opening up our new 
               <br />
               countries, in British Columbia as well as 
               <br />
               elsewhere in the west, and with less proﬁt, 
               <br />
               for obvious reasons, in British Columbia 
               <br />
               than in most other parts of the country. 
               <br />
               If the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway would put 
               <br />
               that line through, I would rather see them 
               <br />
               do it than the Hill line or any other from the 
               <br />
               south of the border. But if Mr. Hill asks 
               <br />
               simply for a franchise to build a road 
               <br />
               through Canadian territory, if the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway has not yet pre-empted that 
               <br />
               territory and run its line through it, I am 
               <br />
               not raising any objection to Mr. Hill get- 
               <br />
               ting his franchise and building his line. 
               <br />
               He does not ask any subsidy from this coun- 
               <br />
               try; and if he proposes to build without 
               <br />
               a subsidy through Canadian territory, it 
               <br />
               would have to be a mighty strong national 
               <br />
               reason that would cause me to raise any 
               <br />
               objection. But I do not want to see a 
               <br />
               road built which will make that country 
               <br />
               mainly tributary to the United States. I 
               <br />
               want to see a road built which will make 
               <br />
               that country do its particular work as a 
               <br />
               part of Canada. Our cities on the coast are 
               <br />
               more important to us than Seattle or Port- 
               <br />
               land. Our smelting industry, which is not 
               <br />
               large now, but is bound to increase—be- 
               <br />
               cause British Columbia is full of mineral 
               <br />
               and the country to the north is full of un- 
               <br />
               developed minerals—is more important to 
               <br />
               us than the smelting industry of the United 
               <br />
               States.

               We may not have many smelters in opel:— 
               <br />
               ation now, but they are beginning and they 
               <br />
               will grow. I would rather see our smel-

               ters do this work than United States smel-

               from the raw material of the mine to the

               ﬁnished article. That is why I would 
               <br />
               rather see the trunk lines that go through

               <br />
               ports and traversing Canadian territory. 
               <br />
               Let me state again as emphatically as pos- 
               <br />
               sible that I have no objection to Mr. Hill 
               <br />
               having a franchise to build the road. 
               <br />
               All I want is to make sure that 
               <br />
