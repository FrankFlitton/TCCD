               Mr. SPROULE. Let me say another 
               <br />
               thing. I was informed upon inquiry that 
               <br />
               there are peculiarities in the situation there 
               <br />
               which made it practically impossible to get 
               <br />
               a fair test of public opinion. I will give the 
               <br />
               information I got from people in the locality. 
               <br />
               They said: In the ﬁrst place Mr. Oliver is 
               <br />
               coming back here as a minister of the 
               <br />
               Crown, as the head of the Interior Depart- 
               <br />
               ment which controls all the Crown lands 
               <br />
               in that country and whose agents have 
               <br />
               to do with the foreign element which is 
               <br />
               coming in here in large numbers, and con- 
               <br />
               sequently have an inﬂuence over them 
               <br />
               which no one else could have ; these people 
               <br />
               are practically like wards of the government 
               <br />
               and the government have such control over 
               <br />
               them that it would be utterly impossible to 
               <br />
               get a fair test of public sentiment on any 
               <br />
               public question. In the next place, Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver was living in the city that was made 
               <br />
               the capital of the province and they were 
               <br />
               very grateful to Mr. Oliver for getting 
               <br />
               Edmonton selected as the capital, and they 
               <br />
               would regard it as an act of ingratitude 
               <br />
               if they did not endeavour to give him an 
               <br />
               election by acclamation. In the third place,

               a candidate, and especially so with the 
               <br />
               short time at our disposal. It was said 
               <br />
               that if we had time to go among 
               <br />
               the people, and through interpreters 
               <br />
               debate these public questions fairly so 
               <br />
               that these foreigners might understand

               <br />
               what the policy of each party represented, 
               <br />

               that country, but otherwise we could not. 
               <br />
               That being the case we did not choose to

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">S‘PROULE.</span> Well, ‘we are as nearly 
               <br />
               right as the hon. member who has interrupt- 
               <br />
               ed me. Need I give him an instance of 
               <br />
               where he was not always right; if he in- 
               <br />
               vites it much further I will do so. In view 
               <br />
               of these things we did not think it advisable 
               <br />
               to make an effort because we had no fair 
               <br />
               chance and we could not get a fair average 
               <br />
               of expression of what was the will of the 
               <br />
               people, and because of that I say we did 
               <br />
               not desire to either waste our time or spend 
               <br />
               our means to try an election where all the 
               <br />
               odds were against us; where we had no 
               <br />
               chance Whatever to test public opinion.

               Mr. SPROULE. Not spending one dollar 
               <br />
               improperly, but it requires money to travel 
               <br />
               and carry~ on a campaign, and you cannot 
               <br />
               go into a country where you spend half a

               dollar or a dollar for every meal without 
               <br />
               spending money. In view of these facts I 
               <br />
               would not regard it as a proper thing to con- 
               <br />
               test the election. There was a verdict

               given and the hon. member was elected by 
               <br />
