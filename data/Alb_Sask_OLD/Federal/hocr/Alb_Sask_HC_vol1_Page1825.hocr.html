               the minority the school laws of 1875, or the 
               <br />
               principle of these laws, because, as I said 
               <br />
               before, they embody the principle of sep— 
               <br />
               arate schools, and would give them separate 
               <br />
               schools in spite of the ordinances which 
               <br />
               have been passed since. There might have 
               <br />
               been a case for contention before the courts, 
               <br />

               then secured their rights. Clause 16, No. 
               <br />
               2, to my mind does away with the law of 
               <br />
               1875, and does away with the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of Roman Catholic schools, and only 
               <br />
               gives to the minority the schools granted 
               <br />
               by chapters 29, 30 and 31 of the ordinance 
               <br />
               of 1901, which was very much like the ordi- 
               <br />
               nances of 1892 and 1898. My amendment 
               <br />
               goes further than that, and avoids all doubt 
               <br />
               and all chance of litigation, because it says

               As to the ﬁrst educational clause that was

               brought down I must say that it did not seem 
               <br />
               to me to have any other effect than to create

               Any man who takes the trouble 
               <br />
               to inquire will be able to ascertain that by the

               system of the Northwest Territories; not in-

               <br />
               it existed in the province of Quebec, but that 
               <br />
               we were following the established order of 
               <br />
               things in the Northwest Territories, and it is 
               <br />
               probably due to the haste with which that 
               <br />
               clause was drawn that all the agitation that 
               <br />
               subsequently arose is to be attributed, because 
               <br />
               in reality what did that clause give to the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories ? It gave separate

               -——that there is any concession—very far from 
               <br />
               it. I think the last amendment perhaps goes a 
               <br />
               little farther than the original enactment which 
               <br />
               caused so much excitement, because it deﬁnes 
               <br />
               more clearly what the privileges of the separate 
               <br />
               schools are. They were not deﬁned at all in the 
               <br />
               original enactment. It deﬁnes them by refer—

               <br />
               it deﬁnes more clearly these privileges, and it 
               <br />
               may be argued that it secures to the separate 
               <br />
               schools the right of religious instruction. I 
               <br />
               am not just sure under the ﬁrst enactment that 
               <br />
               it would have been possible to say in the North- 
               <br />
