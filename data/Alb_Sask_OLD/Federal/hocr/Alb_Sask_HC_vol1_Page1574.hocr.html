               It is necessary also to consider means 
               <br />
               of communication; for it is advisable that

               as far as possible the same line of com- 
               <br />

               <br />
               found in the same constituency. It also

               <br />
               there Will be any for many years to come, 
               <br />
               one should think twice before endeavouring 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">establish.</span> constituencies, knowing the 
               <br />
               grave diﬂiculties that must necessarily fol- 
               <br />
               low. Then, it is necessary to consider the 
               <br />
               representation of interests. We ﬁnd many 
               <br />
               and varied interests in this rich province of 
               <br />
               Alberta—the ranching and the farming, the 
               <br />
               urban and the rural, the mining, the 
               <br />
               irrigation, the fur trading, and so on. ln 
               <br />
               these interests there are large sums of 
               <br />
               money invested, and an effort should be 
               <br />
               made to see that each of these interests 
               <br />
               is represented in the new House by some 
               <br />
               one who is permitted and able to speak 
               <br />
               for it. And it must not altogether be lost 
               <br />
               sight of that there are immense amounts 
               <br />
               of capital in some of the old constituencies. 
               <br />
               which are to some extent entitled to repre- 
               <br />
               sentation; for certainly investments will 
               <br />
               form a large portion of the consideration 
               <br />
               of the new House, and a territory sparsely 
               <br />
               populated, or practically not populated at 
               <br />
               all, can hardly have the same interest in 
               <br />
               the legislation as can a constituency in 
               <br />
               which large capital is invested. Then. 
               <br />
               ethnological conditions need to be con- 
               <br />
               sidered. It is inadvisable to submerge a 
               <br />
               portion of the population which is to some 
               <br />
               extent homogeneous. It is advisable that 
               <br />
               they should be so placed so as to have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span> by one of themselves. All 
               <br />
               these are considerations that have to be 
               <br />
               taken into account when dealing with the 
               <br />
               distribution of the representation of a pro- 
               <br />
               vince. We are not inclined to place the 
               <br />
               ame stress on more area that the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Interior does. Vacant land does 
               <br />
               not contribute to the revenue of a country 
               <br />
               nor supply votes, and we fail to see how 
               <br />
               we are justiﬁed in the present case in anti— 
               <br />
               cipating, in the rosy manner in which the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of the Interior has done, the

               possible ﬁlling up at some future date of 
               <br />
               this northern country. The hon. minister 
               <br />
               t'as argued that such representation should 
               <br />
               be given in the new legislature because of 
               <br />
               the development that is about to take place 
               <br />
               in that northern country. Well, I submit 
               <br />
               that the legislature which will be elected by 
               <br />
               the people of Alberta will be thoroughly 
               <br />
               competent to deal with measures for the 
               <br />
               development of that northern country, whe-
