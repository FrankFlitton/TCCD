               <br />
               1889 and made that speech from which we

               had a quotation this afternoon, that speech 
               <br />
               in which he said that ‘no Italian priest shall 
               <br />
               tithe or toll in our Dominion.‘ He went to 
               <br />
               Toronto and made that speech and what has 
               <br />
               fanned the ﬂame is that these people of 
               <br />
               Ontario and these people of the west now 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that an Italian priest is in this country 
               <br />
               for that very purpose and that he was 
               <br />
               brought here by the right hon. gentleman. 
               <br />
               The fact that the people have discovered 
               <br />
               all these things has helped to fan the ﬂame. 
               <br />
               What more has fanned the ﬂame? It is 
               <br />
               the discovery of how this Bill was intro- 
               <br />
               duced into parliament in so far as it has 
               <br />
               been divulged in this debate. It has been 
               <br />
               proved that the sub-committee which drew 
               <br />
               up this Bill was composed of the Secretary 
               <br />
               of State, the Minister of Justice and the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister, and no one else as far as 
               <br />
               we know. Something else has come out 
               <br />
               this afternoon which will still further fan 
               <br />
               the ﬂame and it is that the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               all along was in consultation with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Arch»</span> 
               <br />
               bishop of Ephesus as regards this school 
               <br />
               clause and as regards the boundaries of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. Is it not enough to fan the 
               <br />
               ﬂame when the great Protestant majority 
               <br />
               of this country, the 59 per cent, ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the Bill dealing with the educational liber- 
               <br />
               ties of the people of the west was drawn. 
               <br />
               brought forward and introduced into this 
               <br />
               parliament by these three members of the 
               <br />
               government with the assistance of the Papal 
               <br />
               ablegate and that not one of the ministers 
               <br />
               who represent the great Protestant body 
               <br />
               of this country was consulted, but that they 
               <br />
               were ignored in the matter? Is not that 
               <br />
               something to fan the ﬂame?

               lighted the torch? It is the constant dis-

               as did my hon. friend from North Toronto 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster) this afternoon, if thePapal

               repeatedly waited upon by the right hon.

               cussed why was not the Minister of the

               the public mind be inﬂamed to-day when it

               <br />
               the statement made by the Papal ablegate 
               <br />
               and published to-day is a conﬁrmation in 
               <br />
               substance of what was stated ln Mr. Rogers 
               <br />
               letter. Here is the crux of the whole mat— 
               <br />
               ter and it was not denied; grant. for the 
               <br />
               moment, that the Papal ablegate had the, 
               <br />
               right to discuss the school question in this 
               <br />
               interview with the Manitoba minister, he 
               <br />
               coupled the school question up with the 
               <br />
               boundary question where he had no juris-

               to have authouity to propose a, settlement 
               <br />
               of the school question.

               There is the crux; that is a thing that 
               <br />
               is not denied. It is asserted by Mr. Rogers, 
               <br />
               it is not denied by the ablegate and it is not 
               <br />
               denied by the government. The kernel of 
               <br />
               the whole matter lies in this that the able-

               Justice, the Prime Minister and the Papal 
               <br />
               ablegate. were daily holding interviews 
               <br />
               about this school question and discussing 
               <br />
               the matter in all its shapes and forms, while 
               <br />
               the people of the west and the minister from 
               <br />
               the west and Mr. Haultain were ignored. 
               <br />
               Is there any wonder Why the country has 
               <br />
               been fanned into ﬂame when the people 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discover</span> these things ? I would like to know 
               <br />
               if the Minister of Finance and the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior had any interviews with the 
               <br />
               Papal ablegate. I do not suppose they will 
               <br />
               admit it. but all the other gentlemen have 
               <br />
               to admit it; the Prime Minister had an 
               <br />
               opportunity of denying it and he did not 
               <br />
               deny it, and his colleague who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">followed</span> 
               <br />
               him was not able to deny it. The additional 
               <br />
               fact. which goes to the public to-morrow, 
               <br />
