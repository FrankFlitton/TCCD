               ing the whole of this discussion. The growth 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> while not always in the past 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SﬂtleﬂCtŒ‘y,</span> has of recent years been quite 
               <br />
               up to our expectations and fully warrants 
               <br />
               all the optimism that has been shown, and 
               <br />
               We have not only grown in resources and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population,</span> but 'I think we have grown in 
               <br />
               intelhgence, in richness, and in ‘all other 
               <br />
               marks of progress. And yet, as I consider 
               <br />
               the treatment of some public questions, it has 
               <br />
               been a question in my mind whether with 
               <br />
               all that progress we have quite held our own 
               <br />
               —-I shall not say progressed—but quite held 
               <br />
               our own in matters requiring deliberation 
               <br />
               and self-restraint. Possibly it may be a 
               <br />
               passing phase in our career, but I regret 
               <br />
               that at the moment there is some evidence 
               <br />
               of at least a standing still in that respect. 
               <br />
               In a country like ours, that is new and 
               <br />
               young, that has immense territories, that has 
               <br />
               a sparse population spread over a great 
               <br />
               area, it is exceedingly necessary that care 
               <br />
               should be used in all the legislation we 
               <br />
               bring forward. The cohesion between the 
               <br />
               different portions of the country is not yet 
               <br />
               strong ; the national feeling has not grown 
               <br />
               possibly, to the extent it should; we have 
               <br />
               been so busy in many other respects. Our 
               <br />
               country is divided in various ways; we 
               <br />
               have in the east a ﬁne set of provinces 
               <br />
               speaking one language. They are partially 
               <br />
               divided from the next province by a ter- 
               <br />
               ritory which possibly is not fertile or ﬁt 
               <br />
               for agriculture,andthen we come to a pro- 
               <br />
               vince in which another language ls spoken. 
               <br />
               Then we pass on to Ontario and there again 
               <br />
               we have the English language. Between 
               <br />
               Ontario and Manitoba there is a portion of. 
               <br />
               territory almost unsettled and so we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               breaks as we continue through our country 
               <br />
               and necessarily that leads to a lack of co- 
               <br />
               hesion between the various .parts of it, and 
               <br />
               it is necessary in all our legislation that we 
               <br />
               should be particularly careful to avoid any- 
               <br />
               thing that would break or strain or separate. 
               <br />
               This is particularly applicable to questions 
               <br />
               of the kind that is _at present under dis- 
               <br />
               cussion. The educational features of this Bill 
               <br />
               are the ones that have aroused the greatest 
               <br />
               friction, but there are many other import- 
               <br />
               ant questions involved in it and some of 
               <br />
               them may have untoward results if they 
               <br />
               are not carefully handled. In all new pro- 
               <br />
               posals that come before one it is natural 
               <br />
               that some special features in them should 
               <br />
               ﬁrst take pre-eminence, that you would ﬁrst 
               <br />
               ﬁnd your mind coming to a decision on 
               <br />
               certain points, and this has been most strik- 
               <br />
               ingly so in the consideration of this ques- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Etion.</span> It sometimes happens that you ﬁnd 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thatgthe</span> point on which you ﬁrst come to a 
               <br />
               decision is not the point that you should 
               <br />
               have first decided; the sequence is not 
               <br />
               always of importance. It was natural when 
               <br />
               this Bill was brought in for the formation 
               <br />
               of two new provinces out of. those Terri- 
               <br />
               tories that our minds should revert to the 
               <br />
               history of our country, to the time at which 
               <br />
               those lands became either in the union of

               to the years 1870 when, by a certain class

               <br />
               I think, as I have heard it stated, by a pur- 
               <br />
               chase of these lands from the Hudson Bay 
               <br />
               Company, but by the purchase of their 
               <br />
               rights, whatever they were, and by the 
               <br />
               grant of that country from the Crown to 
               <br />
               Canada. That country contained a very 
               <br />
               small population and by the Act of 1871 we 
               <br />
               were entrusted with the government of it. 
               <br />
               In the Act, I think, we will agree, that 
               <br />
               while they were territories we were en- 
               <br />
               trusted with the power to govern them as

               that Act by a lieutenant governor and coun- 
               <br />
               cil. Later on, when the population had 
               <br />
               grown larger and when the needs of the 
               <br />
               country were greater, they were given a 
               <br />
               certain amount <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'of</span> legislative control of 
               <br />
               their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs,</span> and in the Mackenzie Act 
               <br />
               of 1875. that was carried to a considerable 
               <br />
               extent, and they had, even before they be— 
               <br />
               came a province, representatives and have 
               <br />
               representatives in this Parliament. Under 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875, a legislature with certain- 
               <br />
               powers was created there and while full 
               <br />
               powers were not given, comparatively large 
               <br />
               powers were given although certain limi- 
               <br />
               tations were placed upon the powers 
               <br />
               granted. Under that legislative power 
               <br />
               these Territories enacted certain ordinances 
               <br />
               and among them were those relating to 
               <br />
               education, and it so happened that in the 
               <br />
               Mackenzie Act there was a speciﬁc refer- 
               <br />
               ence made to the privileges of minorities in 
               <br />
               regard to denominational schools and it 
               <br />
               was under that that these schools were 
               <br />
               ﬁrst established. Later on this legislature, 
               <br />
               acting, perhaps, not under the law of 1875, 
               <br />
               but it seems to me rather acting beyond that 
               <br />
               law, or taking power not granted to them 
               <br />
               by the law of 1875, passed ordinances which 
               <br />
               appeared to restrict the privileges given in 
               <br />
               regard to denominational schools in that 
               <br />
               territory. Later on it made other changes 
               <br />
               and we ﬁnd by the record that the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic minority in the Territories made an 
               <br />
               appeal to the government here at Ottawa, 
               <br />
               of which Sir John Thompson was then a 
               <br />
               member, for redress or for the veto of those 
               <br />
               ordinances. This was not granted, but these 
               <br />
               ordinances remained in force and certain 
               <br />
               regulations also passed by their educational 
               <br />
               council. That state of attairs has con- 
               <br />
               tinued down to the present time. We are 
               <br />
               told that on the whole these ordinances have 
               <br />
               been fairly acceptable. We realize, how- 
               <br />
               ever, that the law of 1875 has not been 
               <br />
               fully carried out by the ordinances and 
               <br />
               the regulations now in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fo'rce.</span> We realize 
               <br />
               also that we cannot say positively that the 
               <br />
               schools or the educational regulations are 
               <br />
               entirely acceptable to the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               minority in these Territories. But such of 
               <br />
               the privileges as under the law of 1875 and 
               <br />
