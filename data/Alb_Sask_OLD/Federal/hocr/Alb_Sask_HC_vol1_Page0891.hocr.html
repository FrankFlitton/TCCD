               Then let us give these provinces home rule

               no relation to the British North America

               <br />

               <br />
               no say in the matter ; they had to obey the

               the laws that applied to them as territories. 
               <br />
               When they are made provinces they should 
               <br />
               be given a free hand to make laws under

               allow the federal government to pass an

               a majority of their constituents, and they
