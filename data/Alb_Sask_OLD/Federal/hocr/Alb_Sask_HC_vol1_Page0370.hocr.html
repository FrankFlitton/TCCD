               Saying no more about that, if this de-

               hon. First Minister stated, vacant and has 
               <br />
               been vacant for ever so long it ought to be 
               <br />
               an additional reason and a very strong 
               <br />
               additional reason why other departments 
               <br />
               which are vacant or virtually vacant in 
               <br />
               this House should be ﬁlled up. For in- 
               <br />
               stance, take the Department of the Interior. 
               <br />
               The minister himself of that department 
               <br />
               for a long time, by reason of illness,.was 
               <br />
               unable to be at the department. I suppose 
               <br />
               there is no department of this government 
               <br />
               which has so varied a range of interests and 
               <br />
               requires so much a constant, steady and 
               <br />
               ﬁrm head as the Department of the Inte- 
               <br />
               rior. The hon. gentleman who was the 
               <br />
               minister has been away from that depart- 
               <br />
               ment for a considerable length of time. 
               <br />
               Changes took place whilst he was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">away.</span> 
               <br />
               changes which have never been explained 
               <br />
               to this House. The deputy minister retired 
               <br />
               or was forced to retire, I do not know 
               <br />
               which, and a new man was placed in the 
               <br />
               department. There is an additional reason 
               <br />
               why there should be some responsible head 
               <br />
               of the department. With its varied inter- 
               <br />

               been things said against that department 
               <br />
               and they are said against that department 
               <br />
               now. The right hon. gentleman has not 
               <br />
               read the newspapers and moved up and 
               <br />
               down Canada without knowing all these 
               <br />
               things. For that reason then, and when a 
               <br />
               new deputy minister takes hold, nominally, 
               <br />
               there should be a strong, ﬁrm and respon— 
               <br />
               sible man at the head of the department. 
               <br />
               During the whole session we have not been 
               <br />
               able to get any information from the In- 
               <br />
               terior Department such as we should have 
               <br />
               got. There has not been a question of 
               <br />
               moment brought up because there has been 
               <br />
               no person in the House representing the de- 
               <br />
               partment to answer for the department. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman who leads the 
               <br />
               government says: I am nominally the head 
               <br />
               of the department. ‘Nominally ’ that is the 
               <br />
               correct word. It is absolutely impossible 
               <br />
               for him to master the details of that 
               <br />

               is a constitutional principle in order to serve

               a purpose. The purpose once served he 
               <br />
               throws away his invention, he has no use 
               <br />

               which will call for another constitutional

               principle. What is his constitutional prin-

               ciple? It was adverted to by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend here (Mr. R. L. Borden). It was the 
               <br />
               result of a circumstance which was none 
               <br />
               too creditable to the government of my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend. An hon. gentleman went 
               <br />
               into a department in the temporary ab- 
               <br />
               sence of another minister meddled in a 
               <br />
               matter of its administration and so brought 
               <br />
               about some considerable confusion in the 
               <br />
               government of this country. It was then 
               <br />
               that the new constitutional principle was 
               <br />
               devised, invented, brought out brand new, 
               <br />

               Territories—the premier and one of his ca- 
               <br />
               binet, backed up, as I said the other day, 
               <br />
               by a third member of his cabinet. When 
               <br />
               he gets them here he throws them lightly 
               <br />
               aside, at least the Tory part of the repre- 
               <br />
               sensation, he ﬁnds sources of information in 
               <br />
               his own way and he refuses almost abso— 
               <br />
               lutely upon the most important part of his 
               <br />
               Bill to recognize the legal and constitutional 
               <br />
               representative of that portion of the coun- 
               <br />
               try for which this Bill is being specially 
               <br />
               provided. As he himself says this is the 
               <br />
               most momentous of questions before the 
               <br />
               House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alfectlng</span> absolutely and particularly 
               <br />
               that portion of the country, and yet he will 
               <br />
               not either test the feeling of the people of 
               <br />
               that country, or what is of much more im- 
               <br />
