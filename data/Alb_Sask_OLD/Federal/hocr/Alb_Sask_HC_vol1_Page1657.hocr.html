               <br />
               ation lead us to believe that the census of 
               <br />
               1901 in regard to the district of Athabaska 
               <br />
               is no more correct as representing the popu- 
               <br />
               lation of to-day than it is in regard to the 
               <br />
               district of Rosebud, which, according to the 
               <br />
               census, has a population of only a very few 
               <br />
               over 1,000 people in 1901, but which, in the 
               <br />
               election of 1904, cast very nearly 1,000 
               <br />
               votes. I think it is very unfair that our 
               <br />
               hon. friends should absolutely ignore the 
               <br />

               baska rest their case absolutely on the 
               <br />

               <br />
               one part let us have it all over, and if we

               <br />
               point out that my hon. friend from Argen- 
               <br />
               teuil (Mr. Perley) and my hon. friend from 
               <br />

               <br />
               hear before of a disparity between the num- 
               <br />
               ber of votes in one constituency as com- 
               <br />
               pared with another ? They wanted to know 
               <br />
               Why it took two men in Calgary to be equal 
               <br />
               in value to one man in Stony Plain, and 
               <br />
               they seemed to think that was a poser. Well 
               <br />
               my friend from Argenteuil represents a

               <br />

               <br />
               lation of 47,650. It would appear that it 
               <br />
               takes three men in St. Antoine to equal one 
               <br />
