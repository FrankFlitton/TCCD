               had shifted the pedestal on which he stood

               way that there is not one hon. gentleman

               on that side of the House since his speech

               successful controversion of his statements

               stitutional point there is only one course

               which will satisfy the public mind that 
               <br />
               can be taken by the right hon. leader of 
               <br />
               the government, and that is to have the

               <br />
               questions which should be submitted, so 
               <br />
               that we may have this constitutional ques-

               other and so that there may be no further 
               <br />
               controversy upon the point. It is the duty

               one question : Do the subsections of clause

               ther question should be submitted as to

               whether or not this government has any 
               <br />

               There is not only that question which is 
               <br />
               in doubt, but we all know, after listening

               has arisen between him and the premier of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. We have read 
               <br />
               the interview with the premier of the North— 
               <br />

               <br />
               ‘News,’ in which that gentleman contends 
               <br />
               that if clause 16 is passed in its present 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shape,</span> it willJmpose upon the new provinces

               exactly the state <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> which existed in 
               <br />
               1875 after the passage of the Act of that year 
               <br />
               giving the Territories the constitution they 
               <br />
               now enjoy. In the face of all these doubt- 
               <br />
               fu-I points of law affecting the constitution, 
               <br />
               there should be a submission to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Privy 
               <br />
               Council in England, perhaps to the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court ﬁrst, and the public mind would be 
               <br />
               set at rest by a decision from that quarter 
               <br />
               in a way in which it could not be otherwise. 
               <br />
               I do not propose to take up the time of the 
               <br />
               House any longer on this question, because 
               <br />
               I think that at this late stage of the debate 
               <br />
               speeches should be curtailed as far as 
               <br />

               of affairs that exists in this coun-

               <br />
               on this side of the House that would induce 
               <br />
               the people to agitate in any sense of the 
               <br />

               matter is over and the question is decided

               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, a great deal has been said 
               <br />
               upon this question; almost every phase of 
               <br />
               it has been threshed out ; and after all that 
               <br />
               has been said on both sides of the House 
               <br />
               and all that has been written in the various 
               <br />
               newspapers, I would have said nothing upon 
               <br />
               the question, but that if I gave a silent vote, 
               <br />
               it might be inferred that I was unwilling 
               <br />
               to say one word in favour of this Bill. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'1</span>

               <br />
               which rests upon me in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard.</span> I think 
               <br />
               the House and you, Mr. Speaker, will agree 
               <br />
               that I have not troubled the House very 
               <br />
               much or spoken unduly on every subject 
               <br />
               that came before it since I have been a 
               <br />
               member. I do not think any one can accuse

               me of that terrible disease which has been 
               <br />
               properly termed a running at the mouth. 
               <br />
               If there is one disease which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'I</span> abhor above 
               <br />
               another, it is that ; and I only feel justiﬁed 
               <br />
               in speaking on subjects in which I am spe-

               other place in' the Dominion of Canada. 
               <br />
               It is there that the great volcanic eruption

               found in the newspaper oﬁices and on the 
               <br />
               platforms of that city. I have great respect 
               <br />
               for the people of Toronto and for the papers 
               <br />
