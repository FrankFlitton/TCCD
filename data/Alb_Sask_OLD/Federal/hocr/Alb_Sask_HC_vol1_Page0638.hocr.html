               gentlemen? It seems to me absolutely con-

               clusive. If this is not the conclusion, then

               it seems to me you can give no affect to the

               do ask some consideration at the hands

               so, I ask again for protection in that regard 
               <br />
               for those who think as I do upon this ques- 
               <br />
