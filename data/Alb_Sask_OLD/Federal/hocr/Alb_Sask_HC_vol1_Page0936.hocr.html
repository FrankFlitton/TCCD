               have just mentioned. One of the reasons 
               <br />
               given why we should grant separate schools 
               <br />
               to the Northwest Territories is the alleged 
               <br />
               early settlement of that country by the 
               <br />
               French Canadians. I shall not take up any 
               <br />
               time in dealing with this school question, 
               <br />
               as I am not a lawyer nor am I accustomed 
               <br />
               to deal with questions of this kind. I think 
               <br />
               it most unfortunate that this government 
               <br />
               has introduced this school question on the 
               <br />
               eve of the granting of provincial autonomy. 
               <br />
               I have lived in that country for thirty years, 
               <br />
               and up to this time, I have never heard the 
               <br />
               school question put forward as an issue on 
               <br />
               the public platform. It has been stated by 
               <br />
               several members on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House that the school question was an issue 
               <br />
               in that country at several elections. Just 
               <br />
               to illustrate that point I will read what two 
               <br />
               members of the House have said with re-

               I believe the majority in the Northwest Ter— 
               <br />
               rîtories are just as tolerant as they are in 
               <br />
               any other part of the Dominion. I 
               <br />
               am not a lawyer, but I will say that 
               <br />
               from what I have heard of the opinions 
               <br />
               quoted from eminent constitutional lawyers; 
               <br />
               it seems to me that the question of educa- 
               <br />
               tion was intended by the British North 
               <br />
               America Act to be left to the provinces to 
               <br />
               deal with: and I still hope that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guy—</span> 
               <br />
               ernment will see their way clear, even at 
               <br />
               this late stage, to drop the educational 
               <br />
               clauses from this Bill and let the provinces 
               <br />
               deal with that subject. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, Mr. Speaker, I propose to say a 
               <br />
               few words on the question of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">boundary</span> 
               <br />
               between the two provinces. That is a ques- 
               <br />
               tion that has been passed over rather lightly 
               <br />
               by the speakers who have discussed this 
               <br />
               Bill. I want to give you an illustration of 
               <br />
               the way the proposed boundary will-affect 
               <br />
               some interests detrimentally. We have only 
               <br />
               one stock range in the Dominion of Can- 
               <br />
               ada. and that is in that portion of the new 
               <br />
               provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               that used to form a portion of the old 
               <br />
               provinces of Assiniboia and Alberta. What 
               <br />
               I mean by a stock range is a country where 
               <br />
               cattle and horses can range all the year 
               <br />
               round, where stock of all kinds live on the 
               <br />
               prairies for twelve months in the year. That 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stock</span> country extends from the Rocky moun— 
               <br />
               tains east about 300 miles along the inter- 
               <br />
               national boundary line, going as far north as 
               <br />
               the Red Deer river, perhaps 200 miles. The 
               <br />
               stock runs at large in numerous herds, and 
               <br />
               the animals are only known to the owners 
               <br />
