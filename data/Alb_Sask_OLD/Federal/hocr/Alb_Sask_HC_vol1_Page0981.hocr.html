               had been dinned‘into my. ears .all my days 
               <br />
               that separate schools were dangerous and 
               <br />
               that we should have nothing to do with them. 
               <br />
               Well, I went to the normal school in the 
               <br />
               provmce of Quebec, passed my examination 
               <br />
               and took _out my certiﬁcate as a teacher in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that'provmce.</span> And I taught school in the 
               <br />
               provmce of Quebec for four years. Then 
               <br />
               it was that I began to see that that se- 
               <br />
               parate schools as they existed there were 
               <br />
               not as bad as I had thought they were. 
               <br />
               The separate schools seemed a different 
               <br />
               thing as I saw it in Quebec from what 
               <br />
               I thought it was when I saw it in On- 
               <br />
               turio. 
               <br />
               the advantage of separate schools in Que- 
               <br />
               bec would hardly know what to do without 
               <br />
               them. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And</span> when I taught in one of those 
               <br />
               separate schools and saw what difﬁculties 
               <br />
               we should have to contend with if we had 
               <br />
               no separate schools. I began to see that the 
               <br />
               system was not such a bad thing after all. 
               <br />
               And I thought that if the Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               in Quebec give even-handed justice to the 
               <br />
               Protestants of that province, We Protestants 
               <br />
               in Ontario should do no less for the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics here. And we are doing it. Hav-

               ing had a long experience in teaching, there 
               <br />
               is one thing I Wish above all others, and 
               <br />
               that is that our children should have a ﬁrst-

               lieve that if this Bill is passed the children 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories will have an 
               <br />

               school is subject absolutely to all the foregoing
