               <br />
               my case, I admit, is one that hon. gentlemen

               opposite pronounce the most aggravated of the 
               <br />
               lot. It is one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> has engrossed, at all events,

               the largest share of public attention. 1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may.</span> 
               <br />
               tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I gave the pledge 
               <br />
               which was read in the House, that I signed it, 
               <br />
               that I gave it voluntarily. 1 went of my own 
               <br />
               accord to my bishop and gave the pledge to 
               <br />
               him, as a Roman Catholic, dealing with the 
               <br />
               head of his church in the diocese to which he 
               <br />
               belonged. I gave it to him, and I mean to 
               <br />
               stand ‘by it, lot the consequences be what they 
               <br />
               may. I am speaking for myself alone, I am 
               <br />
               dealing with the pledge I gaVe, and I say that 
               <br />
               having given, having handed it over voluntarily 
               <br />
               to the bishop of the diocese to which I belong. 
               <br />
               from that day to this I have never been asked 
               <br />
               to account for that pledge which I gave, nor 
               <br />
               has my attention been ever drawn to the fact, 
               <br />
               up to the present time, that I have not fulﬁlled 
               <br />
               it. but the pledge was delivered over to the 
               <br />
               Tory party to be made use of for political pur— 
               <br />
               poses. Now, Sir, I attach some value to the 
               <br />
               position I occupy in this House, not because of 
               <br />
               my personal merit, but because of the favour 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friendship</span> of my honoured leader (Mr. 
               <br />
               Laurier). but more value do I attach by far to 
               <br />
               the good opinion of hon. members on both sides 
               <br />
               of this House—on the other side as well ason 
               <br />
               this—and if I am called upon, as I should have 
               <br />
               been called upon'before, to say why I did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">n‘on</span>

               fulﬁl my pledge, I will feel that I have for-
