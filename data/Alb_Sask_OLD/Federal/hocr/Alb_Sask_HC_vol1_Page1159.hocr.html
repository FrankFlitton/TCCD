               tleman made this afternoon surprised me— 
               <br />
               I was not surprised before. The hon. gen-

               tleman said that there was no province in 
               <br />
               Canada to-day which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[had</span> the exclusive 
               <br />
               right. to legislate with respect to education. 
               <br />
               In admitting Prince Edward Island and 
               <br />
               British Columbia into the union was any— 
               <br />
               thing said about education ? The Minis-

               ter of Justice cannot say that, Mr. Speaker ; 
               <br />
               nothing was said about education and there- 
               <br />
               fore the educational clauses automatically 
               <br />
               were read into the constitution of Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island. But I want to ask another 
               <br />
               question and that is this: What other 
               <br />
               power to-day can legislate with respect to 
               <br />
               education in New Brunswick outside the

               legislative assembly of the province of New 
               <br />

               <br />
               the other side of the House answer that 
               <br />
               question ? There is no authority and if 
               <br />
               there is no authority then, Sir, under ex- 
               <br />
               isting conditions, the legislative assembly 
               <br />

               the exclusive legislative power to-day. The

               have not gone far in nation building if we 
               <br />
               cannot to-day do what We did in 1875. We

               this is established by the free will of the 
               <br />

               <br />

               wishes the preservation of the status quo

               <br />
               not trust the people of the west with res- 
               <br />
               pect to this school question. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               quoted Mr. Clement who has written an 
               <br />
               excellent work on the constitution of Can- 
               <br />
               ada. He quoted a letter from Mr. Clement 
               <br />
               with respect to section 93 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, to the effect that if

               <br />

               <br />
               a province, that system will automatically 
               <br />
               go into the constitution of the new pro- 
               <br />
               vince? Does the Minister of Justice as a 
               <br />
               lawyer believe that? Does the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice as a lawyer concur in that view. If 
               <br />
               so, why does the government seek to place 
               <br />
               legislation upon the statute-book that gives 
               <br />
               an emphatic denial to any such principle ? 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman evoked the enthusiasm 
               <br />
               of his followers when he said that the policy 
               <br />
               of the Liberal party was clear before the 
               <br />

               <br />
               to say that so far as I am informed and so 
               <br />
               far as I can understand, if the policy pro-
