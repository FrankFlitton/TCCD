               put these labels on all the seeds sold and

               there would be no means of determining

               be within the requirements of the Act and

               could not be punished. So there would be no

               remedy for a farmer if he bought impure 
               <br />

               <br />
               through this House that will not be effect-

               ister of Agriculture in his desire to get 
               <br />
               clean seeds for the farming community, and 
               <br />
               it the Bill was likely to be effective even 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> a small measure in bringing this about, 
               <br />
               I would give it my hearty support. But 
               <br />
               there are many ways in which the penalties 
               <br />
               might be evaded, and a great deal of seed 
               <br />
               could still be sold without the purchaser 
               <br />
               being able to get at the wholesaler if he sold 
               <br />
               impure seed. I think it would be well to 
               <br />
               have this phase of the Bill thoroughly look- 
               <br />
               ed into, and I think it would be well to 
               <br />
               send the Bill before the Agricultural Com- 
               <br />

               <br />
               farmers and the wholesale seedsmen, but 
               <br />
               a'so the retail dealers throughout the coun-

               try. These latter are an important class, 
               <br />
               and the Bill ought to be carefully consider-

               <br />
               the standpoint of other persons interested, 
               <br />

               greatly improved by sending it to the Com-

               heard on it. I am opposed to it for several 
               <br />
               reasons. In the ﬁrst place, I think in its 
               <br />
               present form it would be detrimental to the 
               <br />
               farmers in selling their clover and other 
               <br />
               small seeds, because it Will amount just to 
               <br />
               this. that a few dealers who Will go into the 
               <br />
               business after this Bill becomes law will 
               <br />

               <br />
               every bushel of clover seed they sell. I am 
               <br />
               also opposed to it because it will have the 
               <br />
               effect of driving a certain class of people 
               <br />
               out of the trade, who are to-day doing a 
               <br />
               great deal to supply farmers with good 
               <br />

               <br />
               they are doing in this direction, I have been 
               <br />
               in the milling business myself for the last 
               <br />
               ten years, and I know to what trouble they 
               <br />
               have put themselves in order to get pure 
               <br />
               seed for the farmers at actual cost. I just 
               <br />
               wanted to offer my objection to the Bill 
               <br />
