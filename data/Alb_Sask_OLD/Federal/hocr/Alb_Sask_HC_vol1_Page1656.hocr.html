               duce them to view it in something the same

               light by comparison with other instances 
               <br />
               as for instance when the Redistribution Bill 
               <br />
               relating to the seats of this parliament was 
               <br />
               passed in 1903. In the Northwest Terri-

               tories at that time, according to the census 
               <br />
               there was a matter of a little over 150,000

               exactly the same in regard to the district

               in regard to the district of Athabaska, but 
               <br />
               on that point he has not any better infor- 
               <br />
               mation than we have, and our information 
               <br />
               is that the conditions are not strained in 
               <br />
               the district of Atha-baska. We regret very 
               <br />
               much that we have not later census infor- 
               <br />

               <br />
               information in regard to the increase of 
               <br />
               population, in regard to the increase of trade

               and in regard to development generally 
               <br />
               which leads us to believe that there is a 
               <br />
               comparatively large population in the west- 
               <br />
