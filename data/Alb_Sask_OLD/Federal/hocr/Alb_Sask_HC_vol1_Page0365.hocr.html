               right that they should be stated and some

               answer made—we have had rumours from

               the press of the province of Quebec in close 
               <br />
               touch with this administration, and even 
               <br />
               direct statements, that the cause assigned

               to this parliament for the resignation of the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior was not the true 
               <br />
               cause. Further than that, a certain journal

               published in the province of Quebec with 
               <br />
               which a very devoted champion and warm

               rumour, said to have emanated from a cer-

               tain member of the administration, who 
               <br />

               We have a statute which says that there

               <br />
               statute goes on to say : ‘The Minister of the

               statute, and that statute has been in force 
               <br />
               during every one of the thirty-one days

               <br />
               the Interior has resigned. What was my

               right hon. friend’s view with regard to this 
               <br />

               the House, but it is not out of place that I
