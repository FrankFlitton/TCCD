               well and you shall pay for them both out

               <br />
               I say it is a discussavble question in this 
               <br />
               country ; and, if it is contended that the ini- 
               <br />
               nority have a right to discuss it, then the 
               <br />
               majority have a right to take part in that 
               <br />
               discussion in a moderate and proper way,— 
               <br />
               and I will not say a word offensive or in- 
               <br />
               ﬂammatory; I would rather discuss the 
               <br />
               legal aspect of the case, but I think this is 
               <br />
               not the best time for that, and besides that 
               <br />
               phase of it has been so well discussed by my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the leader of the opposition; in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">committee</span> I may have a word or two to say 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘on</span> that phase of the matter. I say that, if 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*the</span> minority are free to discuss this matter, 
               <br />
               then, the majority certainly have a right to 
               <br />
               present their views without being denounced 
               <br />
               from day to day by the government party 
               <br />
               as trying to raise an agitation, to inﬂame 
               <br />
               ;the minds of the people by appealing to their 
               <br />
               prejudices. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">II,</span> for one, repel such an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">insinÀ</span> 
               <br />
               nation. I make no such appeals. But Isayi 
               <br />
               distinctly that I do want to see the people 
               <br />
               aroused to the fact that we are, probably 
               <br />
               for the last time, dealing with a great ques- 
               <br />
               tion affecting the greater portion of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion. I want the people to realize that 
               <br />
               this is a question which may determine the 
               <br />
               permanency of the British institutions on this 
               <br />
               part of the continent. I do not wish to 
               <br />
               say anything extravagant. But look at the 
               <br />
               condition. People are pouring in there from 
               <br />
               the United States—it is the boast of hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite that thousands of them 
               <br />
               :are coming in. They are people who have 
               <br />
               not been accustomed to a system of separate 
               <br />
               schools and who will not willingly submit 
               <br />
               to separate schools. We have people com- 
               <br />
               ‘ing in from all other quarters of the earth 
               <br />
               as well. Many of them have been oppressed 
               <br />
               in their own country and have had griev- 
               <br />
               ances not unlike to this. They have come to 
               <br />
               what they have regarded as a free country. 
               <br />
               They have come to a country in which, they 
               <br />
               were told by the literature given them by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Interior, that they would 
               <br />
               have free <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">national</span> schools. These people 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"fully</span> as Canadians do, the vast possibilities

               I cannot forget at this moment that the policy 
               <br />
               which I have advocated and maintained all 
               <br />
               along has not been favourably received in all 
               <br />
               quarters. Not many weeks ago I was told from 
               <br />
               high quarters in the church to which I belong, 
               <br />
               that unless I supported the School Bill which 
               <br />
               was then being prepared by the government, 
               <br />
               and which we have now before us, I would in- 
               <br />
               cur the hostility ot a great and powerful body.

               Sir. this is too grave a phase of this question 
               <br />
               for me to pass by in silence. I have only this 
               <br />
               to say: even though I have threats held over 
               <br />
               me coming. as I am told, from high dignitaries 
               <br />
               in the church to which I belong, no word of 
               <br />
               bitterne5s shall ever pass my lips as against 
               <br />
               that church.

               Now, I will take the liberty, because it 
               <br />
               involves another point as well, of referring
