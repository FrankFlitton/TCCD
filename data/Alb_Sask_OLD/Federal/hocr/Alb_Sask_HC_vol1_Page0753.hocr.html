               ”future. We know that when the province 
               <br />
               or Manitoba was created, the Conservative 
               <br />
               party then in power, did not see ﬁt to ex- 
               <br />
               press in unequivocal language <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exactly</span> what 
               <br />
               the rights of that province were in regard 
               <br />
               to education, and the consequence Was a 
               <br />
               great lawsuit and much turmoil, which 
               <br />
               kept the people of Manitoba in a state of 
               <br />
               worry and excitement for many years. 
               <br />
               I hope this parliament will not adopt the 
               <br />
               policy of the Conservative party in that 
               <br />
               regard, and leave an opening for lawsuits, 
               <br />
               as‘ was suggested by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Stormont (Mr. Pringle) in arguing that this 
               <br />
               question should be submitted to the courts, 
               <br />
               the consequence of which would be to con- 
               <br />
               tinue the uproar that how unhappily pre- 
               <br />
               vails. Therefore, as we have full power 
               <br />
               under the Act of 1871, I think we should de- 
               <br />
               fine in clear terms exactly what the rights 
               <br />
               of minorities shall be.

               Mr. HALL. The imperial parliament has

               <br />

               give'them such jurisdiction as they may 
               <br />
               see ﬁt. It is quite open to the imperial par- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liament‘</span> to grant to this parliament such 
               <br />
               powers and authorities under the widest 
               <br />
               terms, giving them any discretion they may 
               <br />
               see ﬁt, in regard to the establishing of new 
               <br />
               provinces and therefore I say that the im- 
               <br />
               perial parliament did delegate and did give 
               <br />
               full power and authority to this parliament 
               <br />
               to pass such aws as they saw ﬁt under the 
               <br />
               Act of 1871. Of course, I can readily under- 
               <br />
               stand that this parliament would desire as 
               <br />
               far as possible to follow the principles of 
               <br />
               the other provinces, to adapt these principles 
               <br />
               as far as they possibly could and as far as 
               <br />
               they were applicable to the new provinces 
               <br />
               to be created, to apply the same principles 
               <br />
               as those under which other provinces have 
               <br />
               acted and to give to these provinces similar 
               <br />
               jurisdiction to that: which other provinces 
               <br />
               possess. I desire to say a word in 
               <br />
               regard to the question of provincial rights. 
               <br />
               It was pointed out very clearly and very 
               <br />
               fully by the hon. Postmaster General (Sir 
               <br />
               William Mulock) in his address that there 
               <br />
               are not two provinces in the Dominion 
               <br />
               which have exactly the same constitution 
               <br />
               word for word. They are all different in 
               <br />
               some respects. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂferences</span> in some cases 
               <br />
               are minor but in other cases they are not, 
               <br />
               so that when you hear people talking about 
               <br />
               provincial rights being invaded they should 
               <br />
               learn just exactly what the rights are, what 
               <br />
               are provincial rights and what are not pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights before they express their- 
               <br />
               opinion upon the question. I ﬁnd in section 
               <br />
