               words—and I shall not detain the House 
               <br />
               at great length—on some of the other 
               <br />
               clauses of the Bill, more especially the 
               <br />
               clauses dealing with education. But we all 
               <br />
               realize the vast importance of this Bill on

               <br />
               live in that country. We realize its vast 
               <br />
               importance because of the people who are 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yet</span> to go into that country. And we real-

               after year the overﬂow of population from 
               <br />
               the older provinces, perhaps more especially 
               <br />
               from the province of Ontario, is going into 
               <br />
               these two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neW‘</span> provinces which we are now 
               <br />
               creating. There our sons and daughters and 
               <br />
               our grandchildren are going to build up 
               <br />
               their homes. Is it to be wondered at that 
               <br />
               we regard with the deepest anxiety the 
               <br />
               character of the constitution to be given to 
               <br />
               these provinces, the nature of the law under 
               <br />
               which they are to be governed, and more 
               <br />
               especially the educational system under 
               <br />
               which the children in those provinces will 
               <br />
               receive their training? It is alleged that 
               <br />
               during the present spring, from the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario alone, some 8,000 people have 
               <br />
               gone into the western country, possibly some 
               <br />
               to the province of Manitoba, but others. 
               <br />
               and I think the majority, to the two new 
               <br />
               provinces to which we are about to give a 
               <br />
               constitution. 'Hence, I say, we are deeply 
               <br />
               interested in the character of the legislation 
               <br />
               we are now enacting. Complaint has been 
               <br />
               made in some parts of the country and even 
               <br />
               in this House that we are devoting too much‘ 
               <br />
               time to the consideration of this Bill, that 
               <br />
               we are wasting the time of. the House in 
               <br />
               discussing the matter. I have no sympathy 
               <br />
               whatever with that feeling. I believe we 
               <br />
               should be perfectly justiﬁed in spending two 
               <br />
               or three months in order to reach a com- 
               <br />
               plete understanding of the measure now 
               <br />
               before us. I think it would be time and 
               <br />
               money well spent. It costs but a little more 
               <br />
               to carry on a session of four or ﬁve months 
               <br />
               than to carry on one of three months. The 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce, if there is a sacriﬁce, is on the 
               <br />
               part of hon. members of this House; the 
               <br />
               country practically does not sustain the loss 
               <br />
               if we continue the discussion of this Bill. 
               <br />
               But. even apart from that, I say, the money 
               <br />
               consideration should not inﬂuence us, the 
               <br />
               time occupied need not be taken into con-

               <br />
               sideration for some considerable time. It 
               <br />
               has been spoken of from year to year. The 
               <br />
               propriety of granting provincial rights to 
               <br />
               these‘ Territories has been frequently brought

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> give attention to this question. We ﬁnd

               that the right hon. First Minister, (Sir Wil- 
               <br />
               frid Laurier), in September last, soon after 
               <br />
               the House had been dissolved, realized the 
               <br />
               importance of this issue, realized that there 
               <br />
               was a demand from the Northwest for 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy, realized that the people 
               <br />
               there were becoming tired of being merely 
               <br />
               the wards of the Dominion government, 
               <br />
               and wished to be placed in possession of full

               rights of provincial self-government in all

               those matters delegated to them under the

               British North America Act. I have before

               nection with this matter. I am very much

               afraid that the right hon. Prime Minister 
               <br />
               was not as fair to the people of the west 
               <br />
               on that occasion as he ought to have been. 
               <br />
               I think it was his duty to inform those 
               <br />
               people, as he was appealing to them on 
               <br />
               the eve of a general election, that he was 
               <br />
