               <br />
               to be just. Give us the same rule that we 
               <br />
               have given you, do for us what we have

               tion in the past. The' French Canadian’s 
               <br />
               heart is generous, his heart is grateful and 
               <br />
               he will never forget what you have done.

               But on the other hand—and in this I am 
               <br />
               not uttering any threat—I regret every time 
               <br />
               I go back to my province to ﬁnd developing

               that feeling that Canada is not Canada for 
               <br />
               all Canadians. We are sometimes in Quebec 
               <br />
               accused of being provincialists. We are 
               <br />
               not provincialists by nature. We have 
               <br />
               stood for the defence of the whole soil of 
               <br />

               <br />

               as were made in Ontario itself where we 
               <br />
               were preserved only because there was a 
               <br />
               text of law, we are bound to come to the

               conclusion that Quebec is our only country 
               <br />
               because we have no liberty elsewhere. I

               your brethren, are entitled to receive at 
               <br />
               your hands. If you do that, if you are just

               without trying to take with one hand what
