               <br />
               this: The Protestant minority could not get 
               <br />
               the legislation until after confederation. 
               <br />
               Then Mr. Galt said at London: Very well, 
               <br />
               then we must make that promise binding by 
               <br />
               the constitution; we must add that other 
               <br />
               clause that not only if at the time of con- 
               <br />
               federation separate schools exist but if legis-

               separate school privileges and then that

               <br />
               will be an appeal to the sovereign power, the 
               <br />
               parliament of the colonies. That is the his- 
               <br />
               tory of it and the whole history of it. You 
               <br />
               may search the whole history of it from 
               <br />
               ﬁrst to last and that is a fair statement of 
               <br />
               the case. For New Brunswick and Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, not by compact, but in London, was 
               <br />

               <br />
               clause extended into a saving clause which 
               <br />
               applied to all the provinces at the time of 
               <br />
               the union. It was generalized, it was the 
               <br />
               compact principle extended to the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. That is the Confederation Act.

               One point more with reference to the

               <br />
               had a case so clear for remedial legislation 
               <br />
               as had the Manitoba minority in 1896. All 
               <br />
               the legal diﬂiculties were out of the way, 
               <br />
               all the decisions were given, and the path 
               <br />
               was absolutely clear between that minority 
               <br />
               with its grievance and the power which

               threw himself across the way and prevented

               <br />
               and prevented its enactment. More has 
               <br />

               could under the constitution. We were pre-

               on to-day simply because we are opposed to 
               <br />
               a French premier—to the gentleman from

               that in all probability we were going down

               to our political death, and doing it because
