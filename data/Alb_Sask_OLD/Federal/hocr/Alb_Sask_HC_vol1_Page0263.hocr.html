               Sir, my hon. friend the Minister of Customs, 
               <br />
               speaking last night, referred to the fact that

               it was said that the province of Manitoba had 
               <br />
               been harsh in abolishing that system. Well,

               Sir, I am here to say that you cannot abolish 
               <br />
               abuses of that kind by handling people with 
               <br />
               kid gloves. I am here to say that if there is 
               <br />
               any act in my public life I am proud of, it is 
               <br />
               the fact that I was one of those who helped 
               <br />
               to abolish that system of education in Mani-

               the grounds which he strongly urges being 
               <br />
               that his government had abolished the dual

               system. I may state to the House that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has not deputed me to 
               <br />
               state what his views are; we have been 
               <br />
               anxious for him to speak for himself. I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that among those supporting him on 
               <br />
               that occasion, were: Mr. Clifford Sifton of

               have assigned to that system its true char- 
               <br />

               In 1875, when the Act to which so much 
               <br />
               reference has been made was passed, there 
               <br />
               were only 500 people living there; and the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Finance, a few evenings 
               <br />
               ago, stated that he never would be a party 
               <br />
               to the passing of an Act to override a local 
               <br />
               ordinance or local statute—that would be a 
               <br />
               gross interference with provincial rights. 
               <br />
               But to my mind time is not a very great 
               <br />
               distinction between overriding an Act in ex- 
               <br />
               istence to-day, and picking out of our or- 
               <br />
               dinance a certain portion and saying that 
               <br />
               suits us, and we will adopt it so that you 
               <br />
               cannot repeal it for all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tine</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">come.</span> it 
               <br />
               seems to me that the one is no greater in- 
               <br />
               fringement or invasion than the other. The 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Finance holds up as a 
               <br />
               model of tolerance the province of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, which I have no doubt is all that 
               <br />
               he claims for it; but it did not strike me 
               <br />
               that the attitude he took in passing legisla- 
               <br />
               tion which was going to kill what it was 
               <br />
               going to create was a very tolerant atti— 
               <br />
               tude. I think I can say for my own con- 
               <br />
               stituents that they will exercise as much 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tolerance</span> and give as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much</span> fair-play to 
               <br />
               the minority in that country as any class

               that the people of that country are as good
