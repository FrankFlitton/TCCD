               the Northwest would be simply crazy at present 
               <br />

               <br />
               this year, because our immediate ﬁnancial needs 
               <br />
               are fairly well met; the lalok of borrowing

               approve of delay until all doubts of the Can-

               <br />
               I hope this doub1t will not exist very long. I

               hop_e the lease <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wl'lll</span> soon be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settled</span> by a judgment

               the position I take is that the gOVernment

               <br />
               the people of the Northwest should be granted

               This view thus expressed in the news- 
               <br />
               papers and in the House, I also expressed 
               <br />
               very distinctly to my electors in West As- 
               <br />

               <br />
               test last autumn, and I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> every reason 
               <br />
               to believe that the majority of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> electors 
               <br />
               of West Assiniboia concurred in the view. 
               <br />
               I declared explicitly in the contest that I 
               <br />
               should oppose any constitutional change un- 
               <br />
               til the tax exemption matter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">became23</span> more 
               <br />
               clear, and until the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west learned deﬁnitely that they would not 
               <br />
               as provinces stand in danger of the burden 
               <br />
               of that perpetual limitation upon their taxing 
               <br />
               power which was imposed upon the added 
               <br />
               portion of the province of Manitoba in 1881. 
               <br />
               The situation in January 
               <br />
               autonomy negotiations opened was that no 
               <br />
               ﬁnal judgment had been obtained. It is 
               <br />
               true that. since January, the Supreme Court 
               <br />
               of Canada has given judgment overturning 
               <br />
               the Manitoba court’s decision. of March. 
               <br />
               1903. But, until the case has been carried 
               <br />
               to the Privy Council and judgment obtained 
               <br />
               there, the matter cannot be considered as 
               <br />
               ﬁnally settled: I need not repeat to the 
               <br />
               House that in January last I was opposed 
               <br />
               to proceeding with the autonomv measures 
               <br />
               Now, I shall explain brieﬂv the reason why 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Manitoba</span> court judgment led me to re—

               <br />
               The Northwest test case was that of a school 
               <br />
               district, the Springdale school district. It 
               <br />

               of the powers of the local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislature</span> to levy 
               <br />
               11 tax upon the company. The case was 
               <br />
               taken for the purpose of obtaining an inter-

               the Northwest was created a province that
