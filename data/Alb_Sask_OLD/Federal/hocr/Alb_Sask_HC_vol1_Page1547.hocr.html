               the census of 1901 was 69,441. or let us 
               <br />
               say in round numbers 70,000. That would 
               <br />
               give, if you divide the population by 23 con- 
               <br />
               stituencies, a unit of a little over 3,000. The 
               <br />
               number of votes registered was 20.950, or 
               <br />
               let us say in round numbers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">20</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">000.</span> By 
               <br />
               dividing that number by 23, you would get 
               <br />
               a unit of about 1.300. The number of votes 
               <br />
               polled was 20.961, or say in round numbers 
               <br />
               21,000. Dividing that by 23, you get a 
               <br />
               little over 900. So that on the whole I think 
               <br />
               that there is a fair correspondence between 
               <br />
               these ﬁgures, that no injustice has been 
               <br />
               done to anybody, and that the endeavour 
               <br />
               has been made to have as fair a division 
               <br />
               as was possible, especially if you consider 
               <br />
               the character of the population. which is 
               <br />
               sometimes in compact groups and sometimes 
               <br />
               very sparse.

               Mr. FOSTER. I Would like to ask the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior 21 little more closely 
               <br />
               how they came to make the estimate of 
               <br />
               250,000 population for each of these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. If it was a guess of course it 
               <br />
               would be no good at all; and it" it was 
               <br />
               worth trying to ﬁnd out, there must have 
               <br />
               been some methods adopted. What methods 
               <br />
               were adopted, and What did they show <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?</span> 
               <br />
               On the face of it, it would seem as if they 
               <br />
               were optimistic as to their estimate of the 
               <br />
               population. November, 1904, was not long 
               <br />
               ago, and you took as a basis of the popu- 
               <br />
               lation the registered vote. That gives you, 
               <br />
               say, 30,000. That would make about eight 
               <br />
               to a family in order to bring up the popula- 
               <br />
               tion to 250,000. I doubt very much if that 
               <br />
               would be the average in the Northwest. 
               <br />
               There may be some large families there, 
               <br />
               but there are a great many bachelor estab- 
               <br />
               lishments. It seems to me that that would 
               <br />
               tend to bring down the average rather than 
               <br />
               to raise it. I would not think that more
