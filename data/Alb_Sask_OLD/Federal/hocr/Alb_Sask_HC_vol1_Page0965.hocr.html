               <br />
               of Toronto felt very much relieved after 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman (Mr. Grant) had made 
               <br />
               his apology. The people of that great 
               <br />
               city, I have no doubt, were downcast, they 
               <br />
               went about with their heads down and 
               <br />
               feeling very glum. But, after the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman had made his apology on their 
               <br />
               behalf they.would make up their minds 
               <br />
               that the situation was improving and that 
               <br />
               they might attend the horse show and enjoy 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves.</span> The hon. gentleman (Mr. Grant) 
               <br />
               in continuing thought his apology as ap- 
               <br />
               plied to the whole of Ontario, was too 
               <br />
               general, and he gave us to understand 
               <br />
               that all the fanatical people were to 
               <br />
               be found within the limits of the city of 
               <br />
               Toronto. Now, Mr. Speaker, the popula- 
               <br />
               tion of Toronto is made up almost wholly 
               <br />
               of native Canadians, and of natives of the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario at that. Toronto is 
               <br />
               not a composite city, it is a Canadian city. 
               <br />
               I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that the 
               <br />
               peopleof Toronto do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁer</span> in sentiment 
               <br />
               and opinion, at any rate so far as this 
               <br />
               question is concerned, from the people of 
               <br />
               the rest of the province of Ontario. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Ontario (Mr. Grant) 
               <br />
               tried to lead the members of this House 
               <br />
               to believe that the educational clauses in 
               <br />
               this Bill were satisfactory to the people 
               <br />
               of this province and to the people of his 
               <br />
               constituency. One hearing or reading the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s speech would come to 
               <br />
               1he conclusion that the people of the rid- 
               <br />
               ing of North Ontario and the people of the 
               <br />
               whole province of Ontario _ were crying 
               <br />
               out to have these clauses enacted in the 
               <br />
               Bill. Of course, I do not pretend that these 
               <br />
               were the hon. gentleman’s words, but no 
               <br />
               other idea could be taken from his obser- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vations</span> than the one I have given. As I 
               <br />
               have said before, it would be far better 
               <br />
               if hon. members on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House would tell their colleagues and the 
               <br />
               people generally the exact position of affairs 
               <br />
               in Ontario so far as this question is con- 
               <br />
               cerned. The hon. member for North On- 
               <br />
               tario went so far as to speak of the people 
               <br />
               who had sincere views on this question 
               <br />
