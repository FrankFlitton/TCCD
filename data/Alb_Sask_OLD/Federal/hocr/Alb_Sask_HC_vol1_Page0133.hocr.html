               The right hon. gentleman appealed to his 
               <br />
               record dealing with these troublesome ques- 
               <br />
               tions, and pleaded that he had given sufﬁ- 
               <br />
               cient evidence of his desire to conciliate and 
               <br />
               treat the various elements and creeds in this 
               <br />
               country upon lines that are broad, national 
               <br />
               and humane. He referred .to his refusal to 
               <br />
               interfere in the New Brunswick agitation 
               <br />
               with regard to separate schools and gave 
               <br />
               that as an evidence of the spirit of fairness 
               <br />
               and toleration which actuates him. In the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst speech he made on this measure he also 
               <br />
               referred to that matter, and drew attention 
               <br />
               to the fact that he ha'd then advocated non- 
               <br />
               interference with the rights of the province. 
               <br />
               Well. it struck me at the time that if that 
               <br />
               be the record of the right hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               it is a great pity he did not embody the 
               <br />
               spirit which then actuated him into the 
               <br />
               measure now before parliament, because, 
               <br />
               if I understand the English language, this 
               <br />
               measure is above all things an interference 
               <br />
               with provincial rights. The right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman told us that he refused to interfere 
               <br />
               in the agitation over the Jesuits Estate Bill 
               <br />
               because it was the undoubted right of the 
               <br />
               province to pass that Bill. Let me say that 
               <br />
               the Jesuits Estate Bill was my ﬁrst ex- 
               <br />
               perience in parliamentary life with one ot“ 
               <br />
               these vexed questions, and I agreed with 
               <br />
               the right hon. the First <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister</span> that as it 
               <br />
               was dealing with lands belonging to the 
               <br />
               province, which in my judgment the pro- 
               <br />
               vince had a perfect right to sell and do what 
               <br />
               it liked with the proceeds, consequently we 
               <br />
               as a federal parliament had no right to inter- 
               <br />
               fere. I held that it was a Bill dealing with 
               <br />
               education, which under the British North 
               <br />
               America Act came within the exclusive right 
               <br />
               of the province; and therefore if the pro- 
               <br />
               vince chooses to sell those lands and use the 
               <br />
               proceeds for educational purposes, or throw 
               <br />
               them into the sea, we had no right to inter- 
               <br />
               fere. Therefore although the question ex- 
               <br />
               cited a great deal of feeling in my section of 
               <br />
               the country, I stood by that principle as 
               <br />
               ﬁrmly as I stand by it to-day. and I did it 
               <br />
               believing that the only guarantee for the 
               <br />
               successful workng out of confederation lay 
               <br />
               in giving the provinces all the rights con- 
               <br />
               ferred on them by the constitution, and only 
               <br />
               exercising here those rights which belong to 
               <br />
               the federal parliament. Then we had the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman boasting that on the 
               <br />
               question of the Manitoba school education 
               <br />
               he had stood by provincial rights and en- 
               <br />
               deavoured by conciliatory methods to adjust 
               <br />
               the diﬂerences between the two classes of 
               <br />
               people in that province and ﬁnally succeed- 
               <br />
               ed. Well, Mr. Speaker, I was with the First 
               <br />
               Minister on that question as well. I took 
               <br />
               the same grounds that I did on the Jesuits 
               <br />
               Estate question, namely, that it was un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly the right of the province to deal 
               <br />
               with education, and I opposed any proposal 
               <br />
               to coerce or_ force Manitoba at that time. 
               <br />
               Was I right then? I submit that I was 
               <br />
               consistent in the stand I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'took</span> upon those two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\</span> 
               <br />
               questions, which were at the very antipodes“

               the matter before the House as ﬁrmly as I 
               <br />
               did on the Jesuits Estate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Bill</span> and the Reme-

               vince of Manitoba to do what I thought she 
               <br />
               had a perfect right to refuse to do? Then, 
               <br />
               I say, I am consistent with my record <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               every particular. But the First Minister is 
               <br />
               not consistent with his record. On other oc- 
               <br />
               casions he stood by provincial rights ; to—day 
               <br />
               he is abandoning the principle of provinc1a1 
               <br />
               rights and forcing upon these unwilling pro- 
               <br />
               vinces laws which compel them to do what 
               <br />
               the constitution never intended they should 
               <br />
               be compelled to do. The right hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               man defends his conduct by saying : I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">am</span> 
               <br />
               doing this in obedience to the constitution. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) said 
               <br />
               last night that he did not understand the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister to say that he was compelled 
               <br />
               by the constitution to take the course he 
               <br />
               does. But I have here the Prime Minister’s

               tion 93 of the British North America Act 
               <br />
