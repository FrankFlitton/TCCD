               Mr. iSPROULE. When the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man asked me before in reference to that. 
               <br />
               I said that I had no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recollection</span> of it._ I 
               <br />
               said that I was not then as familiar with 
               <br />
               the British North America Act as I am to- 
               <br />
               day, and I did not know the purport of 
               <br />
               many of the clauses of that Act; so that 
               <br />
               enactmentl bearing upon it might be passed 
               <br />
               in this House without my knowing anything 
               <br />
               about them. _But when the question was 
               <br />
               brought before the House in such a way 
               <br />
               that I understood it, I always opposed such 
               <br />
               an enactment. In support of that statement, 
               <br />
               I need only mention the fact that when Mr. 
               <br />
               Dalton McCarthy moved a resolution with 
               <br />
               regard to one of the clauses of the Act of 
               <br />
               1875, I both spoke and voted in favour of 
               <br />
               . his motion, and what were the reasons I 
               <br />
               gave for doing so ? I said that while Sir 
               <br />
               John Thompson says we'shall have power 
               <br />
               to give the Territories any kind of constitu- 
               <br />
               tion we like when we come to form them 
               <br />
               into provinces, and while other members 
               <br />
               think the same, the tendency of members, 
               <br />
               especially lawyers, was to have great re— 
               <br />
               gard for precedents, and when we come to 
               <br />
               that time the very fact that the minority 
               <br />
               may have enjoyed those rights for a num- 
               <br />
               ber of years will be quoted as giving them 
               <br />
               vested rights, which it will be held we have 
               <br />
               no moral right to take away from them. 
               <br />
               As I did not want to have that claim made, 
               <br />
               I voted against it.
