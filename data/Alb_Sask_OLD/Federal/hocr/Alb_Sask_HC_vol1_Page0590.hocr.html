               people, and one of his friends said that the 
               <br />
               Reform party fought the church a few years 
               <br />
               ago, and that it even took the church to the 
               <br />
               courts and that this is an evidence that the 
               <br />
               Reform party is not in favour of a Papal 
               <br />
               ablegate. Perhaps not, but it was the Re- 
               <br />
               form party that brought him here. The 
               <br />
               member for Pictou told us that we on this 
               <br />
               side dislike the Catholics and the Catholic

               <br />
               the slightest in the world. So far as I know 
               <br />
               and I verily believe it, there is no senti-

               <br />
               Catholic or the Roman Catholic church. We 
               <br />
               have the same respect and veneration for 
               <br />
               that church that we have for other churches 
               <br />
               and for its members as we have for other

               and I want to say so. What is the gist of 
               <br />
               all this discussion this afternoon ? The Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Agriculture gave us a very learned 
               <br />
               disquisition but he never touched the sub- 
               <br />
               ject. He tried to draw a red herring across 
               <br />
               the track like the member for Pictou who 
               <br />
               never mentioned the issue from the moment 
               <br />
               he rose till he sat down. He tried to do like 
               <br />
               that little ﬁsh that spouts out an inky ﬂuid 
               <br />
               in the 'water so as to becloud everything—-

               I see the hon. member for Pictou is leaving

               <br />
               tory of the ablegate since he has been here. 
               <br />
               What did he come for ? To reconcile dif- 
               <br />
               ferences between them and their church 
               <br />

               has gone beyond the bounds of that work,

               reputed to be an able statesman, a 
               <br />

               who think themselves statesmen, but who 
               <br />
               are not equal to the occasion. Who are 
               <br />
               they ? The Prime Minister was the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               who sent to Rome, and he was joined by 
               <br />
               thirty—nine of his supporters. They are the 
               <br />
               parties who brought the ablegate here, who 
               <br />
               are responsible for his being here, who have 
               <br />
               been using him since, and Who are bring- 
               <br />
               ing discredit on their church by the capa- 
               <br />
               city in which they are employing him. I 
               <br />
               say that if there is any objection to what 
               <br />
               the ablegate has done, we do not blame 
               <br />
               him, and have not a word to say against 
               <br />
               him ; but we blame the men who brought 
               <br />
               him and who have employed him in that 
               <br />
               work. They are the parties who are res- 
               <br />
               ponsible, and they are the parties who will 
               <br />
               be brought to book for it as soon as the 
               <br />
               voice of the people of Canada has an op-

               portunity of being heard on the subject.

               ﬁght one as vigorously as another. I am 
               <br />
               speaking of a principle which is inherent 
               <br />
               in the constitution of the British empire. 
               <br />
               We have learned long since of the painful 
               <br />
               effects of the interference of the church 
               <br />
               with the rights of the state. That question 
               <br />
               was fought out, and the relative duties of 
               <br />
               each was assigned to it. But that question 
               <br />
               is cropping up to-day, and who are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">res</span> 
               <br />
               ponsible for it '? The present government; 
               <br />
               they are the parties who have introduced 
               <br />
               that question. We are told that there is 
               <br />
               excitement in the country to-day. If there 
               <br />
               is, what is the occasion of it? It is the 
               <br />
               danger apprended by the people of Canada 
               <br />
               that we are going to have the issue of state 
               <br />
               and church to ﬁght over again. That is why 
               <br />
               there is excitement; that is why so many- 
               <br />
               letters and petitions are coming to Ottawa; 
               <br />
               that is why there is such an intense <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> 
               <br />
               throughout the country against the present 
               <br />
               government. -Is there to-day any interfer- 
               <br />
               ence with the affairs of the state by any 
               <br />
               church ? Need I ask that question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> 
               <br />
               the information that has been given to this
