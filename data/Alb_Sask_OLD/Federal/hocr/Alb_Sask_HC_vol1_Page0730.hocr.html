               <br />
               always bear in mind that these ordinances

               posed and forced separate schools upon that

               not independent voluntary territorial leg—

               <br />
               of ‘members of the cabinet Who have given 
               <br />

               bate, we ﬁnd these gentlemen singularly at 
               <br />
               variance. The right hon. the First Minister, 
               <br />
               who introduced this measure, told us that he 
               <br />
               stood on the rock of the constitution. He 
               <br />
               contended, though he made no serious at- 
               <br />
               tempt to prove it as a matter of law, that 
               <br />
               Canada was under a legal obligation to re- 
               <br />
               strict the legislative rights of the proposed 
               <br />
               new provinces to legislate as to schools. It 
               <br />
               appears to me, Mr. Speaker, that he very 
               <br />
               properly stated what, and what alone, can 
               <br />
               be the real question which this parliament 
               <br />
               ought to decide, and that that question must 
               <br />
               be decided and decided favourably to the 
               <br />
               contention of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«government</span> before they 
               <br />

               even it they become law. The hon. Minis—
