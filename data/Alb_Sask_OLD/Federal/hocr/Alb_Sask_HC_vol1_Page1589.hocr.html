               no hon. gentleman can read the statements 
               <br />
               of those four hon. gentlemen and come to 
               <br />
               any other conclusion than that the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               given on the two sides are as far apart as 
               <br />
               Australia is from Canada. And yet the 
               <br />
               right hon. First Minister tells us that he 
               <br />
               wants to listen to other arguments from 
               <br />
               this side of the House before he answers 
               <br />
               the arguments advanced yesterday. If the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman wishes to shorten the 
               <br />
               debate on this question, the best plan he 
               <br />
               can adopt is to answer early in the de-

               <br />
               men on this side of the House in order that

               other hon. gentlemen may not ﬁnd it ne-

               cessary to prepare themselves to prolong 
               <br />
               the debate. Surely the government ought 
               <br />
               to be ready to point out to the opposition 
               <br />
               in what respect the statements made by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Calgary and the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for St. Antoine are wrong. That can 
               <br />
               be done if the government is right ; but any 
               <br />
               one reading the statements of the four hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen who spoke cannot come to any 
               <br />
               other conclusion than that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they?</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">derive:</span> 
               <br />
               their information from entirely different 
               <br />
               sources ; therefore it is necessary that some 
               <br />
               explanation should be made by the govern- 
               <br />

               the idea of the government coming down 
               <br />
               with these two important measures, and 
               <br />
               having only the meagre statements made 
               <br />
               by the right hon. the First Minister and

               fore on a serious question of this kind. In 
               <br />
               the case of our general distribution, we had 
               <br />
               more satisfaction than this. We are treated 
               <br />
               in a contemptible manner by the g0vern- 
               <br />
               ment on this question, and I am surprised 
               <br />
               at the course taken by the right hon. the 
               <br />
               First Minister on this occasion.

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. The surprise

               <br />

               <br />
               the surprise he manifests. When he says 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«that</span> there is a serious discrepancy between

               St. Antoine, I take direct issue with him.

               Antoine. This is a very plain statement; 
               <br />
               let us verify it. I said yesterday that we 
               <br />
               based our information upon the number of 
               <br />

               <br />
               census of 1901. These were three, not-all,

               of the sources of information upon which

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁgures</span> were not disputed. According to 
               <br />
               the statement given to me by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Calgary, for which I acknowledge his 
               <br />
               courtesy, the number of votes recorded in 
               <br />
               the last- election in the different constituen-

               cies of Alberta, with the exception of Peace 
               <br />
               River and Athabaska, is put at 20,700, a 
               <br />
               difference of 262. Is there any very serious 
               <br />
               discrepancy there ? With regard to the 
               <br />
               number of votes registered in those consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies, the ﬁgure I gave was 29,950, while 
               <br />
               the ﬁgure given to me by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Calgary was 30,077, a difference of 
               <br />
               127. The addition in the one case was made 
               <br />
               by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery from 
               <br />
               the books of the votation furnished to him; 
               <br />
               the same books were furnished to the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the other side of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> 
               <br />
               and they made their own addition; yet the 
               <br />
               results correspond, with only the smadl dis— 
               <br />
               crepancies I have mentioned. Another 
               <br />
               source of information is the population ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the census of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1901.‘</span> I gave the 
               <br />
               population for these various constituencies 
               <br />
               at 69,441. Up to the present moment I 
               <br />
               have not seen these ﬁgures challenged. 
               <br />
               Therefore, I say there is no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerence</span> or 
               <br />
               dispute as to the ﬁgures on which we base

               our division. I shall have further remarks 
               <br />
               to make on this subject, but for the moment 
               <br />
               I simply call the attention of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from East Elgin to the fact that practically 
               <br />
               there is no difference between the ﬁgures 
               <br />
