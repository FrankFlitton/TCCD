               My lion. friend the Minister of Justice will 
               <br />
               stand by section 16 and will not deny him—

               <br />
               certain observations of the Deputy Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice, in this opinion, which seems to 
               <br />
               me to illuminate very greatly the question 
               <br />
               to which I have just now been adverting— 
               <br />
               the question as to whether or not the Act of 
               <br />
               1875 constitutes a compact to which regard 
               <br />
               must be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> when we are framing u consti- 
               <br />
               tution for the new province; and I do not 
               <br />
               think anything has been said or quoted by 
               <br />
               any hon. gentleman on this side which is 
               <br />
               more absolutely destructive of the position 
               <br />
               of the government in this regard than are 
               <br />
               the words of the deputy minister to which I 
               <br />
               now call attention. In referring to clause 
               <br />
               15, he says : 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The criticism of the clause is, I think, largely, 
               <br />
               if not altogether, founded on misapprehension. 
               <br />
               It is, as I understand it, suggested that these 
               <br />
               words may enlarge or limit the constitutional

               said with regard to the Act of 1875. The

               Deputy Minister of Justice, in giving this 
               <br />
               opinion, was dealing with the question of

               legislative power. He said that we cannot

               because a certain power was possessed by 
               <br />

               contain express provisions determining the pro-

               if they did not contain any such provisions I 
               <br />
               do not see how it could be argued that a power,

               which the Territorial assembly had; can without

               <br />
               of the Territorial assembly; they derive no 
               <br />
               powers by reference to its constitution; they 
               <br />
               are new bodies created in the execution of 
               <br />
               special powers by parliament, and there is no 
               <br />
               room for the application to them of the laws
