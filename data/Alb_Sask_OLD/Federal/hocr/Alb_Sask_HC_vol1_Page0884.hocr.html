               of education in the new provinces. 111 my 
               <br />
               opinion, the best way to settle that question 
               <br />
               would be for my hon. friend to advocate 
               <br />
               and vote for the amendment moved by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition. I cannot agree

               with him when he says that if a province 
               <br />

               <br />

               do not think that any such doctrine would

               us that an attempt is being made to stir 
               <br />

               <br />
               the responsibility, but he insinuated as 
               <br />
               much. Let me, however, call his attention 
               <br />
               to the fact that it is the government which, 
               <br />
               by presenting the legislation submitted to 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing on in the country. I was sorry to hear 
               <br />
               the reﬂection which the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               made on the worthy leader of the opposition. 
               <br />
               He charged that hon. gentleman with lack- 
               <br />
               ing courage on this question. I cannot be- 
               <br />
               lieve that my hon. friend is well acquainted 
               <br />

               <br />
               would not have ventured any such state- 
               <br />
               ment. The leader of the opposition, Sir, has 
               <br />
               submitted his case to this House and the peo- 
               <br />
               ple in the strongest possible language, and 
               <br />
               there has not been a man on the government 
               <br />
               side, even the hon. gentleman himself, who 
               <br />
               has dared to attempt to refute the arguments 
               <br />
               which my hon. leader submitted. îDhe hon.

               hon. members should disagree on this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and yet he would lead us to believe 
               <br />
               that our leader has not the courage of his

               cally the only place where there is agitation 
               <br />
               over this question. Evidently he has not
