               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I may say to my

               hon. friend, that I trust that before bring-

               <br />
               into the question himself. I am inclined 
               <br />
               to think he cannot have had correct infor- 
               <br />
               mation in relation to these schedules or he 
               <br />
               would not have presented them to the

               House. I do not pretend to know any— 
               <br />
               thing about them myself, but my hon. friends 
               <br />
               on this side of the House who came from 
               <br />
               the _Northwest have looked into them pretty 
               <br />
               carefully and I am very much astonished 
               <br />
               indeed that my right hon. friend should 
               <br />
               seek to pass through the House these sche-

               dules if they are of the character which 
               <br />
               these hon. gentlemen have described to me. 
               <br />
               I have every conﬁdence they are telling me 
               <br />
               exactly what they believe, and also that 
               <br />
               their belief is founded on a very careful 
               <br />
               investigation.

               I would like to ask my hon. friend an-

               other question and it is this: It was sug-

               that which has been announced to the House 
               <br />
               by the government, might be made. I do 
               <br />
               not yet know whether or not we are to 
               <br />
               regard that as an informal notice that other 
               <br />
               important amendments are in contemplation 
               <br />
               by the government, but we have had some 
               <br />
               remarks in which there may be something 
               <br />
               or in which there may be nothing in the

               past few days that indicate that the re- 
               <br />
               marks of the hon. Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               were intended to have a certain signiﬁ- 
               <br />
               cance. I would like to ask my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend whether there are any other impor-

               tant amendments now in contemplation by 
               <br />
               the government. I do not’ wish him to tell 
               <br />
               me that the Bills may be amended. I 
               <br />
               know that. but what I ask is whether there 
               <br />
               are other amendments now in contemplation 
               <br />

               Rt. Hon. Sir WILFRID <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LAURIEIR</span> (Prime 
               <br />
               Minister). In regard to the ﬁrst of the 
               <br />
               two questions which have been put to me 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden). I 
               <br />
               have to say that my information in regard 
               <br />
               to the schedules is the same as his own. I 
               <br />
               got my information from my friends the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span> as he got his information from his 
               <br />
               friends. My information is very different 
               <br />
               from the information which he has re- 
               <br />
               ceived, and either his friends are astray, 
               <br />
               or my friends are astray, because they do 
               <br />
               not appear to agree. The constituencies 
               <br />
               have been marked on the map, and the 
               <br />
               work of describing them is merely clerical. 
               <br />
               The constituencies themselves which have 
               <br />
               been carved out seem to be fair as far as 
               <br />
               my information goes. In these matters, 
               <br />
               as in all matters, the government Will al-

               that nothing is so delicate perhaps as to

               has not been found to be practicable, but 
               <br />
               l believe it is the intention of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment to do substantial justice to all par- 
               <br />
               ties concerned. In regard to the Manitoba 
               <br />
               Bill, if that were to be a precedent, the 
               <br />
               policy adopted was to leave the constituen— 
               <br />
               cies practically to the new provincial gov— 
               <br />
               ernment. We thought this would be per- 
               <br />
               haps liable to very serious abuse, that it 
               <br />
               would not be acceptable, and we could not 
               <br />
               see that there was any other policy than 
               <br />
               to have the schedules prepared here and 
               <br />
               to have the constituencies marked out. In

               regard to the other question of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, I may say that up to the present

               time the government have not considered 
               <br />
               any amendment to the Bill; I do not say 
               <br />
               that we may not. offer any. but, no amend- 
               <br />

               to amend the present franchise Act in re-

               of this Bill. When we are talking about
