               <br />
               chose a man by the name of Burke. Burke

               was a French Canadian with an Irish name,

               <br />
               had been the policy of the Liberal party for 
               <br />
               years to deprive the Roman Catholics and

               What was the result? Mr. Francis wanted

               .Mr. BERGEBON. I thank my hon. friend 
               <br />
               for the correction. True Mr. Martin was in 
               <br />
               the opposition, but he became shortly after 
               <br />
               a minister of the government which was 
               <br />
               formed. Mr. Martin was in opposition, and 
               <br />
               speaking in the name of his party he pro- 
               <br />
               mised the people that if there should be a 
               <br />
               change of government, all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> had been 
               <br />
               said by a Mr. Burke and his friends about 
               <br />
               the Liberal party abolishing Catholic schools 
               <br />
               and the French language, if they came into 
               <br />
               power, was wrong, and that such had never 
               <br />
               been the policy of the Liberal party. The 
               <br />
               people believed Mr. Martin and elected Mr. 
               <br />
               Francis—a most extraordinary thing under 
               <br />
               the circumstances. That was the death of 
               <br />
               the Conservative party; and Mr. Greenway. 
               <br />
               the present member for Lisgar, was called 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span> to form an administration. What 
               <br />
               did Mr. Greenway do? I have said that 
               <br />
               the province was divided into two par- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ties</span> There was a kind of dead—look, so 
               <br />
               that although the defeat of Mr. Burke 
               <br />
               had killed the Conservative party, the 
               <br />
               Liberal party was not any stronger. They
