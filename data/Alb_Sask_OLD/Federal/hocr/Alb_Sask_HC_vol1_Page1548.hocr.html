               Mr. FOS"E'R. Just think about it for a 
               <br />
               moment. Go through the ranching district 
               <br />
               and through the agricultural country as 
               <br />
               well, and you will ﬁnd many of what are 
               <br />
               called bachelor families—men without their 
               <br />
               wives, two brothers, a father and a son, or 
               <br />
               somethingof that kind. I do not know that 
               <br />
               you ﬁnd, outside of the foreign population, 
               <br />
               any larger families amongst the stated fam- 
               <br />
               ilies there than you ﬁnd here; and I am 
               <br />
               quite sure that the foreign population, while 
               <br />
               it totes up pretty large, would not overcome 
               <br />
               that disparity. If you take ﬁve, and mul- 
               <br />
               tiply it by the voters’ list of November, that 
               <br />
               would give you 150,000, and there is a great 
               <br />
               difference between 150,000 and 250,000. I 
               <br />
               do not know that it makes any particular 
               <br />
               difference whether you estimate it at the one 
               <br />
               ﬁgure or at the other, if you base it on the 
               <br />
               voting population of last year. But it forms 
               <br />
               the basis for a disappointment hereafter, if 
               <br />
               you make an estimate of 250,000 people, and 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that there are 100,000 or more less 
               <br />
               than that number. I would like to know 
               <br />
               the basis on which the government came to 
               <br />
               that conclusion.

               <br />
               gave a population of about 165000. Then

               Mr. OLIVER. The apparent discrepancy 
               <br />
               between the number of voters on the list 
               <br />
               and the estimated population may be ac- 
               <br />
               counted for in this way, that the names of 
               <br />
               foreign—born immigrants who have come in 
               <br />
               during the past three years, as having been 
               <br />
               read by the Minister of Justice, would not 
               <br />
               appear upon the voters’ list, as they are not 
               <br />
               entitled to naturalization or to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«a</span> place on 
               <br />
               the voters’ list until they have been three 
               <br />
               years in the country. So for the last three 
               <br />
               years the immigration of foreign-born peo- 
               <br />
               ple is not accounted for in any degree by 
               <br />
               the number of voters on the list. I may say 
               <br />
               further that I have before me a statement 
               <br />
               of the number of homestead entries in the 
               <br />
               district of Alberta up to the 31st of March, 
               <br />
               1905, amounting to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">49,815.</span> If it were taken 
               <br />
               for granted that each homestead represents 
               <br />
               a homesteader, and each homesteader a 
               <br />
               family, and each family the number ot‘ ﬁve, 
               <br />
               it would give a population of 250,000, not 
               <br />
               taking into account the cities.
