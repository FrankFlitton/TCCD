               <br />
               where there was interest there must be 
               <br />
               principal behind it; and if the Dominion 
               <br />
               was entitled to .pay to the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario a ﬁxed amount of interest yearly, cer- 
               <br />
               tainly there was a capital which the pro- 
               <br />
               vince was entitled to call for. That was 
               <br />
               the case in reference to the subsidy grant- 
               <br />
               ed to the province of Ontario in the year 
               <br />
               1884 of $142,414, being the equivalent of 
               <br />
               5 per cent interest on $2,848,000. Now, to 
               <br />
               put the matter plainly, I will read a letter 
               <br />
               written <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1by</span> the Minister of Finance, and we 
               <br />
               will ascertain whether his opinion is the 
               <br />
               same to-day as it was in the year 1900; if 
               <br />
               it is, then I think we should make some 
               <br />
               further change in this clause. The letter 
               <br />
               is somewhat lengthy, but I can read it in 
               <br />
               a very few minutes. I think it is well that 
               <br />
               hon. members should hear this letter, be- 
               <br />
               cause it reviews the whole matter. The let- 
               <br />
               ter is written to the provincial treasurer of 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario, dated, Ottawa, 
               <br />
               January 12, 1900, in answer to a communi- 
               <br />
               cation sent by the Hon. Mr. Ross to the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance. The Minister of Fin-
