               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> Even if they had been consulted, the simple 
               <br />
               fact that a dual system of schools was 
               <br />

               <br />
               to be taken as a reason why at this distant

               dence is wanted to show that the Act of 
               <br />
               1875 was not considered to be a permanent 
               <br />
               measure, we have only to look at the mea- 
               <br />
               sure before us, where we ﬁnd a clause re— 
               <br />
               pealing the old Territorial Act, showing 
               <br />
               conclusively that it was designed merely to 
               <br />
               regulate the affairs of that country until 
               <br />
               such time as new provinces should be creat- 
               <br />
               ed. That being the case, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘I</span> hold that we are 
               <br />
               now untrammelled and perfectly free to 
               <br />
               give to those provinces such a constitution 
               <br />
               as we think is best for them. We are not 
               <br />
               obliged to go back ten, or twenty, or thirty 
               <br />
               years, in order to ascertain what privileges 
               <br />
               or powers they possessed at that time. 
               <br />
               Everything of that kind is to be wiped out ; 
               <br />
               old things are passed away, and all things 
               <br />
               are to become new; a new era is to be 
               <br />
               ushered in, and we are absolutely free to 
               <br />
               determine what kind of constitution, in the 
               <br />
               light of iconditions now existing, should 
               <br />
               guide the destinies of that country for all 
               <br />
               time to come. I think this proposition has 
               <br />
               been made clear by very high legal authori- 
               <br />
               ty. I do not like to repeat over and over 
               <br />
               again the opinions of public men, but I 
               <br />
               think we make no mistake if we repeat 
               <br />
               daily the opinions of some of our public 
               <br />
               men on some of these constitutional ques- 
               <br />
               tions, because we want to get them, not 
               <br />
               only into the minds of the people, but into 
               <br />
               the minds of hon. members of this House, 
               <br />
               some of whom do not yet apprehend them. 
               <br />
               Whether they'have not listened to them or 
               <br />
               studied them, I do not know ; but certainly, 
               <br />
               from their utterances and from the applause 
               <br />
               which those utterances received from others, 
               <br />
               I apprehend that they have not yet realized 
               <br />
               the full import of the opinions of our great 
               <br />
               public men of the past regarding this ques— 
               <br />
               tion. Notwithstanding my hesitation to re- 
               <br />
               peat what has been said before, I‘will refer 
               <br />
               to only two or three of these opinions. One 
               <br />
               of them is that of a gentleman whose opinion 
               <br />
               was always regarded as a high authority in 
               <br />
               this House. I had the honour of sitting in 
               <br />
               this House for some eight or nine years with 
               <br />
               Sir John Thompson, and I say now what I 
               <br />
               said during his lifetime, that in my opinion 
               <br />
               he was the brainiest man in Canada in his 
               <br />
               time and the highest constitutional authori- 
               <br />
               ty. In my opinion, any statement made by 
               <br />
               Sir John Thompson on a question of this 
               <br />
               kind was worthy of the best consideration ; 
               <br />
               and what did he say in 1894 ? Referring to 
               <br />
               the very question to which I have made re— 
               <br />
               ference, he said:

               have been saying. We are free to give to

               a constitution to that country than those of 
               <br />
               1875, who practically knew nothing of the

               <br />
               try. I will give you one further quotation, 
               <br />
               which is from a gentleman who sat in this 
               <br />
               House for eight or nine years whilst I had 
               <br />
               the honour of being a member of it. 
               <br />
               Though he was politically opposed to me, I 
               <br />
               listened to his utterances on many occasions 
               <br />
               and always with a great deal of pleasure; 
               <br />
               I refer to the Hon. David Mills. I remember 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abat</span> hon. gentleman coming across and 
               <br />
               perhaps gathering around him a group of 
               <br />
               new members, and sitting down and discuss- 
               <br />
               ing with us constitutional questions that 
               <br />
               were before the country at that time. I 
               <br />
               received information privately from the Hon. 
               <br />
               David Mills in that way which I do not 
               <br />
               think I shall ever forget. I learned to re— 
               <br />
               spect that gentleman for his erudition. I 
               <br />
               believe that he was too cautious a man to 
               <br />
               give an opinion on any constitutional ques- 
               <br />
               tion until he had thoroughly sifted it, and 
               <br />
               when he did give an opinion he was able to 
               <br />
               rely upon it. That was the opinion I formed 
               <br />
               of the Hon. David Mills, and it is the one 
               <br />
               I entertain to—day. In 1894, when a ques—

               <br />

               Mills, given in 1894, and that is the opinion 
               <br />
               which I hold in 1905, and I believe it to 
               <br />
               be the one held by the great bulk of hon. 
               <br />
               members on this side. Complete autonomy, 
               <br />
               complete self-government, provincial rights. 
               <br />
               the right to decide for themselves, not only 
               <br />
               in other matters but especially in the mat- 
               <br />
               ter of education, the right to decide what 
               <br />
               kind 0f school system they should have, 
               <br />
               whether a national or a dual system—those 
               <br />
               are rights which belong to_the provinces. I 
               <br />
               shall not trouble the House by quoting what 
               <br />
               was said by Mr. Justice Girouard along the 
               <br />
               same lines, but would ask permission to 
               <br />
               quote once more a few words from the 
               <br />
               Right Hon. Sir John Thompson. In answer 
               <br />
               to an hon. member of this House, he said :
