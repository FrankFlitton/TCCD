               law, While its main outlines remained for

               the most part, was amended from time to

               <br />
               change made in the school system. That 
               <br />
               change was so complete that the minority 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territory considered that 
               <br />
               they had a grievance and appealed to the 
               <br />
               Governor in Council for redress. Let me 
               <br />
               just quote here the statement of Mr. Forget. 
               <br />
               He says:

               Until the date of the ordinance of 1892 we 
               <br />
               had never been denied the right to administer 
               <br />
               our schools, to regulate the programme of 
               <br />
               studies, to choose the text books, to control re-

               <br />
               French language whenever thought convenient. 
               <br />
               These rights were exercised by the Catholic 
               <br />
               section of the board of education, and strictly 
               <br />
               speaking they were sufﬁcient to preserve to our

               This is what was said by Mr. Forget, now

               Lieutenant Governor of the Territories, and,
