               Trust funds and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their'investments</span> have al— 
               <br />
               ways been hedged around with the most 
               <br />
               scrupulous exactness and it has been con- 
               <br />
               sidered that everything of a speculative 
               <br />
               or hazardous nature should be eliminated. 
               <br />
               Uur provincial law prescribes the kinds of 
               <br />
               securities in which trust company funds 
               <br />
               can be invested, and they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can.</span> only he 
               <br />
               invested in such securities as are not of a 
               <br />
               speculative or hazardous kind. You join 
               <br />
               with a trust company which has a very im- 
               <br />
               portant and responsible duty to perform, and 
               <br />
               with the same capital that carries it is an in- 
               <br />
               surance business which is much more specu- 
               <br />
               lative, much more liable to loss and contin- 
               <br />
               gencies of risk. You subject the capital <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               ought to be very closely hedged as a guaran- 
               <br />
               tee and bond for trust funds to the more 
               <br />
               or less speculative calls of an insurance com— 
               <br />
               pany. I can quite see that if the very great- 
               <br />
               est care is taken that none but good titles 
               <br />
               would be guaranteed and that consequently 
               <br />
               the loss will be small. you could use that 
               <br />
               sort of an argument for joining these busi- 
               <br />
               nesses together. The provincial authorities 
               <br />
               have only gone to the length of permitting 
               <br />
               a trust and loan business to be carried on 
               <br />
               together. and unless good reasons can be 
               <br />
               shown for combining a guarantee and in- 
               <br />
               surance business, I think it would be well 
               <br />
