               ner? This question was framed by me 
               <br />
               about the lst of May, and I did not refer 
               <br />
               to its exact terms until to—day. As soon as 
               <br />
               the minister rose I saw that the second clause 
               <br />
               did ask for the names, although the other 
               <br />
               clauses did not, and a fair answer would 
               <br />
               not have disclosed the names of any parties. 
               <br />
               I wished to retract that part of my state- 
               <br />
               ment, but how was I received by the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Customs ? I was told .that no gen- 
               <br />
               tleman would have made such a statement 
               <br />
               in this House.

               Mr. BENNETT. I have this to say to 
               <br />
               those who are near hearing on the back 
               <br />
               benches, that I am going to let the people 
               <br />
               of East Simcoe decide as to whether I am a 
               <br />
               gentleman or not. ISO long as they are satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed with my course, or a large majority of 
               <br />
               them, I will be in this House. It is not” 
               <br />
               often that the Minister of Customs tries the 
               <br />
               role of brow-beater, or censor, or mentor; 
               <br />
               and if he is going to try it on me, I can tell 
               <br />
               him and the other members of the cabinet 
               <br />
               that it will be just as much lost on me when 
               <br />
               it comes from him as when it comes from 
               <br />
               any of the others. I am here representing 
               <br />
               the people of East Simcoe, and so long as 
               <br />
               my majority is increased, as it has been in- 
               <br />
               creasin in that riding, I can well believe 
               <br />
               that my constituents are in accord with me. 
               <br />
               NOW that I have behind me in East Simcoe, 
               <br />
               not the strong arm of the. Ontario govern-
