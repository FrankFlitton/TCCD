               the administration of their own lands. 
               <br />
               What other excuse has been given ? 
               <br />
               We heard from the Prime Minister that in 
               <br />
               the interests of immigration it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> essen-

               tial that the Dominion should retain con- 
               <br />
               trol of the lands because the new provinces 
               <br />
               might act adversely-to the interests of the 
               <br />
               Dominion as a whole in that regard. That 
               <br />
               was an extraordinary reason to come from 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister. Section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">95</span> of the, Brit-

               So that the very reason that was given

               reason given in all this debate that seemed 
               <br />

               The Minister of the Interior, who is familiar

               section 95 of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
