               <br />
               000 population is not very apparent, but I 
               <br />
               imagine that it was supposed at that time 
               <br />
               that the population of these provinces was 
               <br />
               not likely to reach a very much higher ﬁgure 
               <br />
               than 400,000. And this calculation has pro- 
               <br />
               ven true. It took years for Nova Scotia to 
               <br />
               reach that maximum; New Brunswick has 
               <br />
               not reached it yet, nor has Manitoba nor 
               <br />
               British Columbia. But it would be mani- 
               <br />
               festly unfair to these new provinces to limit 
               <br />
               their maximum to 400.000. Already the 
               <br />
               population is about 250,000. Therefore, in— 
               <br />
               stead of ﬁxing the maximum at 400,000 
               <br />
               population. we have ﬁxed it at 800,000.

               that I should review it here, and present it 
               <br />
               again to the House. In 1867, when con- 
               <br />
               federation was established the debts of the 
               <br />
               provinces were assumed by the Dominion— 
               <br />
               the debts of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               and New Brunswick. Now, the debt at that 
               <br />
               time of Old Canada, that is the provinces of 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec, amounted to $67,000,- 
               <br />
               000 in round numbers. The debt of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick was about $7,000,000 and that of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia about $8,000,000. It so hap- 
               <br />
               pened that the debt of New Brunswick rep- 
               <br />
               resented an average of about $25 per head of 
               <br />
               the population, and the debt of Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               of about $8.000,000 was nearly the same per 
               <br />
               head of her population. The debt of Old 
               <br />
               Canada was a little greater per head. There- 
               <br />
               fore, when allowance was made for the 
               <br />
               debts of the provinces, the debt of Ontario 
               <br />
               and Quebec was taken not at $67,000,000, 
               <br />
               but at $02,000.00. That is, Ontario and Que- 
               <br />
               bec were each relieved of about $31,000,000. 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia of $8,000,000, and New Bruns— 
               <br />
               wick of $7,000,000. The provinces of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and New Brunswick entered con- 
               <br />
               federation without debt, while Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec had between them a debt of about 
               <br />
               $5,000,000. Later on. new arrangements 
               <br />
               were made. new debts of the provinces were 
               <br />
               assumed by the Dominion, and the provinces 
               <br />
               were freed from such liabilities. By this 
               <br />
               means the capitation allowance for debt was 
               <br />
               increased from $25 to $32.43 per head. This 
               <br />
               is the last allowance that was made for 
               <br />
               debt, and, if I remember well this was made 
               <br />
               by statute passed in 1884 or 1885. There- 
               <br />
               fore, we make this allowance of $34.43 per 
               <br />
               head to these new provinces. They have a 
               <br />
               population of 250,000 souls each. This 
               <br />
               makes a total of $8,107,500.
