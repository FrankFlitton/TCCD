               how his section would work in conjunction 
               <br />
               with section 17. I understood the minister 
               <br />

               <br />
               portance, and perhaps the minister will ex-

               Mr. LENNOX. I think the minister and

               the committee should carefully consider the 
               <br />
               elî‘ect of this legislation. As the minister

               <br />

               <br />
               merely as information received from other 
               <br />

               pledge themselves to the accuracy of it as 
               <br />
               coming from original sources. But they will 
               <br />
               be bound, under this section, to swear to

               the faithful and exact discharge of the 
               <br />
               duties that are expected of them and to 
               <br />
               the secrecy of the statistics collected. And 
               <br />
               under section 31, it is provided that these 
               <br />

               I :all the minister’s attention again to the 
               <br />
               position we are taking in connection with 
               <br />
               sections 17 and 30 taken together. We have 
               <br />
               certain ofﬁcials appointed by municipalities 
               <br />
               or by the provincial government and bound 
               <br />
               to carry out the instructions of the authori- 
               <br />
               ty that appointed them. Almost inevitably. 
               <br />
               1 fear, at seine time, the duties prescribed 
               <br />
               by the federal government under this Act 
               <br />
               will conﬂict with the duties as deﬁned by 
               <br />
               the local authorities. And it is a pretty 
               <br />
               drastic measure to provide that a neglect 
               <br />
               of duty required by this government on the

               part of an oiﬁcer appointed by the local

               <br />
               an indictable offence. I think we come

               dangerously near usurping the powers of 
               <br />

               i‘ully makes any false declaration touching 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any,</span> such matter,’ is guilty of an indictable 
               <br />
               offence. Of course, if he makes a return 
               <br />
               saying that it is inforn'iation he has collect- 
               <br />
               ed in his capacity as an officer of the local 
               <br />
               authority, and wilfully falsiﬁes that return, 
               <br />
               I think he should be held guilty of an in- 
               <br />
               dictable oifenee. But if he transmits the 
               <br />
               information he collects, he would carry out 
               <br />
               the full spirit of the law.

               is another feature. Section 31 says "who
