               will agree that we have acted wisely in in- 
               <br />
               serting this clause in the Bill. If the con-

               tention of my hon. friend from Lanark is

               <br />
               My hou. friend says that this clause by 
               <br />
               which we continue the exemption of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway property from 
               <br />
               taxation is absolutely null and void, that it is 
               <br />
               not worth the paper on which it is written. 
               <br />
               If that be so, the legislature of the province 
               <br />
               of Alberta will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">next</span> session pass an Act to 
               <br />
               tax the property of the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway Company, and then the question 
               <br />
               will have to be determined by the courts. 
               <br />
               If the courts decide that the statute passed 
               <br />
               in 1881 was ultra vires of this parliament 
               <br />
               and that we could not impose any such 
               <br />
               exemption of taxation on the new province, 
               <br />
               then, when we come to negotiate with the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway Company, we 
               <br />

               <br />
               is concerned. Is that not full justiﬁcation

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Everything 
               <br />
               said by my hon. friend is a vindication ot‘ 
               <br />
               the government. The construction of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Lanark may be right but 
               <br />
               there are others who think he is wrong. It 
               <br />
               is a question on which I olfer no opinion. 
               <br />
               It is one of those mysterious questions of 
               <br />
               law which had best be left to the judges t° 
               <br />
               decide. But in the meantime there are two 
               <br />
               sides to it. There are some who pretend that 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> of 1881 is good and valid, and there 
               <br />
               are others who, like my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Lanark, take the opposite view. If it is 
               <br />
               right and valid, we have to comply with it ; 
               <br />
               but if it is null and void, so much the better.

               Mr. SCOTT. As a taxpayer in the pro-

               <br />

               <br />
               and the hon. member for South York were- 
               <br />
               right in their contention that this legislation 
               <br />
               will be found to be ultra vii-es and that the 
               <br />
               provinces will have the power, regardless

               <br />
               unfortunately we have a precedent against 
               <br />
               us in this very matter. A portion of the

               vince of Manitoba in 1881 and a similar 
               <br />
               provision to this was put in the Bill adding 
               <br />
               that area to Manitoba. Litigation ensued 
               <br />
               and a few weeks ago a decision was handed 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">down.</span> by the Supreme Court of Canada, 
               <br />
               which is entirely against the content-ion of 
               <br />
               my hon. friends. A municipality in the 
               <br />
               added portion of Manitoba levied taxes 
               <br />
               upon the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. 
               <br />
               The Canadian Paciﬁc Railway protested 
               <br />
               and a suit was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carried;</span> through the 
               <br />
               courts in Manitoba. The judgment in Mani- 
               <br />
               toba was in favour of the company and has 
               <br />
               been upheld by the Supreme Court of Can— 
               <br />
               ada. The hon. member for South York is 
               <br />
               perfectly right however in his contention 
               <br />
               that this is a very serious matter for the 
               <br />
               new provinces. On the second reading of 
               <br />
               the Bill, I explained that it was the detail 
               <br />
               which gave the greatest amount of difﬁ— 
               <br />
               culty. As the matter stood in J <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anuaryiast,</span> 
               <br />
               the situation has become changed in some 
               <br />
               degree by the Supreme Court judgment
