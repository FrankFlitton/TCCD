               <br />
               the names of many Roman Catholics are on 
               <br />

               <br />
               would the Roman Catholics of this country. 
               <br />
               The Galicians say: We left one country 
               <br />
               because of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tyranny,</span> of the church, and we

               <br />
               They do not want separate schools; they 
               <br />
               want national schools; and the result is 
               <br />
               that none of them are asking for this pro- 
               <br />
               vision in the Bill, while hundreds of them 
               <br />
               have deliberately petitioned against it. Ro- 
               <br />
               man Catholics in the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               have also petitioned against it, very many 
               <br />
               of them. I have had petitions sent to me 
               <br />
               in large numbers, and my attention has 
               <br />
               been drawn to the fact that Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               names were on those petitions. In some 
               <br />
               instances I have know them very well; 
               <br />
               I have known them for years; and I as— 
               <br />
               sume that they knew what they were seek-
