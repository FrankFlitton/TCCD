               Mr. R. L. BORDEN (Carleton, Out.). Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, before the Orders of the Day are 
               <br />
               called, I would like to say a few words 
               <br />
               with respect to a matter that was mentioned 
               <br />
               in the House yesterday. Let me, in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place, speak of the letter of February 23rd, 
               <br />
               which evidently was not received by the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister. May I be permitted to 
               <br />
               say that I understood from the remarks of 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister yesterday that there 
               <br />
               was rather a reﬂection on Mr. Rogers in the 
               <br />
               suggestion that the letter had not been re- 
               <br />
               ceived. I rather gathered that the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister had some doubts as to whether or 
               <br />
               not the letter was written. Perhaps I mis- 
               <br />
               understood the right hon. gentleman, but 
               <br />
               it is, I think, right to say that very ample 
               <br />
               evidence was forthcoming of the writing 
               <br />
               and of the sending of the letter, and while 
               <br />
               we at once accept most unreservedly the 
               <br />
               statement of the Prime Minister that he 
               <br />
               did not receive it, still I would think that, 
               <br />
               under the circumstances, it would be a per- 
               <br />
               fectly proper thing to include that letter in 
               <br />
               the correspondence which is about to be 
               <br />
               printed.

               Since the discussion of yesterday a state-

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Monseigneur</span> Sharretti. I will come to that 
               <br />
               a little later on. Let me say that I know 
               <br />
               nothing of the circumstances under which 
               <br />
               a delegate of the Holy See was in the ﬁrst

               place brought to this country beyond what 
               <br />
               has been stated by gentlemen on the other 
               <br />
               side of the House, who are well qualiﬁed to 
               <br />
               make such statements. because they have 
               <br />
               personal knowledge of that which they 
               <br />
               state.

               As I gather from them the Delegate Apos- 
               <br />
               tolic came to this country in 1897, not at 
               <br />
               the instance of the bishops of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic church in Canada, but at the in- 
               <br />
               stance of some forty Liberal members of 
               <br />
               parliament who are members <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic church. I understand that there 
               <br />
               was no demand for the appointment of a 
               <br />
               delegate by the bishops or clergy. In mak-
