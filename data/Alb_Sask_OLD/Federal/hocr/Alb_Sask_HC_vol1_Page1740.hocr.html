               Canada is suffering immensely from this 
               <br />
               cause. The motion is a condemnation of 
               <br />
               the minister but he says he will accept it 
               <br />
               and thereby condemns himself and the

               administration of his department. The Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Agriculture says it is true that we 
               <br />
               have made contracts with the steamship 
               <br />
               companies to provide cold storage. Yes, 
               <br />
               they did, but what did those contracts con- 
               <br />
               tain? Only a portion of what they ought 
               <br />
               to contain. They pretend to provide that 
               <br />
               cold storage shall be supplied to the farm 
               <br />
               ers at a reasonable rate as was done by his 
               <br />
               predecessors, when similar contracts were 
               <br />
               made which contained a stipulation specify- 
               <br />
               ing exactly how much in addition to the 
               <br />
               usual freight rates should be added for cold 
               <br />
               storage. The present contracts do not en—

               subsidies for the provision of cold storage, 
               <br />
               and in both of these cases I say the govern- 
               <br />
               ment have lamentably failed in the making 
               <br />
               of the contracts to provide adequate cold 
               <br />

               <br />
               and with a uniform temperature throughout 
               <br />
               the voyage. When the Minister of Trade 
               <br />
               and Commerce had his contract before the 
               <br />
               House we asked for a copy and what did 
               <br />
               that tell us? It contained a provision that 
               <br />
               the steamships securing a subsidy shall pro- 
               <br />
               vide adequate cold storage but there was no 
               <br />
               penalty attached if they do not provide 
               <br />
               that cold storage. It is like the old saying 
               <br />
               that a law without a penalty is valueless. 
               <br />
               You may say a thing is improper and should 
               <br />
               not be done, but if you do not provide some 
               <br />
               punishment your law is cf no use, and so a 
               <br />
               contract of this kind without some penalty 
               <br />
               clause is valueless. You may say as the 
               <br />
               Minister of Trade and Commerce said, that 
               <br />
               these steamships shall provide adequate cold 
               <br />
               storage, but they get the subsidy whether 
               <br />
               they provide it or not, and the farmers suf- 
               <br />
               fer in consequence. The result is that we 
               <br />
               . are paying for something we never get and 
               <br />
               that is why we are blaming the government.

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. The intention is to 
               <br />
               continue on the conditions existing in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories at the present time 
               <br />
               with respect to laws, &amp;c., and at the same 
               <br />
               time to get rid of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               Act which shall cease to be operative in the 
               <br />
               territories after this comes into force. I 
               <br />
               have had the advantage of a conference 
               <br />
               with the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. 
               <br />
               Borden) and while we are at one with re- 
               <br />
               spect to the object we both have in view. it 
               <br />
               has been suggested by the leader of the op- 
               <br />
               position that possibly some other form of 
               <br />
               words might be found to carry out our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ob—</span> 
               <br />
               ject. In that view sections 15 and 24 might 
               <br />
               either be allowed to remain in abeyance or 
               <br />
               be carried to-night with the understanding 
               <br />
               that if hereafter any better form of words 
               <br />
               is found we might reconsider the clauses, 
               <br />
               or, in the alternative, hold the clauses in 
               <br />
               abeyance.

               <br />
               very plain, but it is not easy to adopt the

               is that the section now under consideration,
