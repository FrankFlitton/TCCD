               happened in 1900 and again in 1904, that it 
               <br />
               did not pay politically, and that as far as 
               <br />
               he was concerned that was the end of his 
               <br />
               sacriﬁcing himself. If I am wrong in my 
               <br />
               understanding of what the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               said I am wrong honestly. That is the im- 
               <br />
               pression which I gathered from his speech, 
               <br />
               but if the hon. gentleman tells me that it 
               <br />
               is not the language which he used I am 
               <br />
               prepared to accept his statement. Perhaps 
               <br />
               he will permit me to read What he did say 
               <br />
               on that point.
