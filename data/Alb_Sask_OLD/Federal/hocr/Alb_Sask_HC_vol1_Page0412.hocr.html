               <br />
               information with regard to it on two points. 
               <br />
               Have we been in the habit of incorporating 
               <br />
               trust companies with these powers and how 
               <br />
               do these powers compare with those given 
               <br />
               trust companies which are incorporated by 
               <br />
               a provincial legislature, for instance, by the 
               <br />
               legislature of Ontario? In the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario, I know, legislation with regard 
               <br />
               to trust companies has been pretty stringent 
               <br />
               and somewhat exclusive; in fact the late 
               <br />
               government adopted a policy of not incorpor- 
               <br />
               ating for the present any larger number 
               <br />
               of trust companies than were there already. 
               <br />
               Their powers in Ontario are limited, and 
               <br />
               the restrictions put upon them are very 
               <br />
               considerable. Now I see you make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a‘trnst</span> 
               <br />
               company here, then you add to that another

               Mr. FOSTER. Would that cover the 
               <br />
               point I raised, that is, would it act as a bar 
               <br />
               to their doing business in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario? For instance, suppose it is true that 
               <br />
               there are no trust companies incorporated 
               <br />
               by the province of Ontario that have these 
               <br />
               powers joined to a trust company, before 
               <br />
               you incorporate this company, does that sec- 
               <br />
               tion have the effect of making it impOSSible 
               <br />
               in the province of Ontario for them to carry 
               <br />

               <br />
               titles and the like of that ‘? If that be the 
               <br />
               meaning. it meets the objection that I 
               <br />
               raised.

               Mr. FIELDING. I would not like to say 
               <br />
               that it goes as far as that. That is quite 
               <br />
               a debatable point. But I would take that . 
               <br />
               to mean that the general law of the pro—

               vince with regard to trusts, for example, 
               <br />
               would have to prevail; this company only 
               <br />
               could do business subject to the general
