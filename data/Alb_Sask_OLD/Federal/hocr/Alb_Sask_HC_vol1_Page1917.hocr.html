               <br />
               very closely by the Prime Minister himself. 
               <br />
               I was rather inclined to think his sentiments 
               <br />
               to-night were not quite in accord with some 
               <br />
               sentiments I have heard him utter before 
               <br />
               in this House. I tried to hunt them up 
               <br />
               hurriedly, but have not succeeded in ﬁnd- 
               <br />
               ing them. Perhaps I can do so later. I am 
               <br />
               glad to see that he is with me because I 
               <br />
               think he is now in the right track and I 
               <br />
               agree with him and am glad to do so. There 
               <br />
               is no need in the world for any people, 
               <br />
               whether French or any other people, to have 
               <br />
               French made ofﬁcial. If the French become 
               <br />
               strong enough they have suﬂicient national

               restore what was abolished in 1892. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend knows very well. and he has 
               <br />

               <br />

               question and to decide how its proceedings 
               <br />

               We are face to face with the statement 
               <br />
               that in 1877 the French and English langu- 
               <br />
               ages were to be the oﬁicial languages in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. I will explain in a 
               <br />
               fe.v minutes how that resolution came to 
               <br />
               be incorporated in the Bill of 1877. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dealing</span> 
               <br />
               now with what happened in 1890, =I hnd 
               <br />
               that then and there it was decided that 
               <br />
               the local legislature should be absolutely 
               <br />
               free to decide how the records, how the 
               <br />
               proceedings of the legislative assembly 
               <br />
               should be recorded, and we ﬁnd also that 
               <br />
               in ‘January, 1892, as I have just mentioned, 
               <br />
               on motion of Mr. Haultain, the English . 
               <br />
               language was declared to be the only oth- 
               <br />
               cial language <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> the records and proceedings 
               <br />
               of the legislative assembly. Now, this is a 
               <br />
               settled question as far as this parliament 
               <br />
               is concerned. It is a question over which 
               <br />
               it would not be advisable to :try to do What 
               <br />
               was done in 1890. But what is my hon. 
               <br />
               friend proposing? Is he proposing to declare 
               <br />
               that the English and French languages will 
               <br />
               be forever the ofﬁcial languages in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories? No, he simply says we 
               <br />
               are going to declare that the English and 
               <br />
               French languages shall be official languages, 
               <br />
               but next year. after a few months. six 
               <br />
               months from that time, the legislative as- 
               <br />
               sembly would have the right to declare 
               <br />
               Whether the French language would continue 
               <br />
               to be an ofﬁcial language or not. Why not 
               <br />
               take a bold position? Why should my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, if he wants to restore the French 
               <br />
               language, it“ he is serious in contending that 
               <br />
               the French is an ofﬁcial language in the 
               <br />
               ‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nor</span> formulate words declaring

               that it shall be for ever the ofﬁcial language
