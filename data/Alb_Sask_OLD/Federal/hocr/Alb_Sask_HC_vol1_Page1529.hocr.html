               they think ﬁt, and it would not make the 
               <br />
               slightest diﬂ’erence whether they were all

               Protestants or partly Protestants and part-

               among them Jews and Mormons—they 
               <br />
               would be a majority for the establishment 
               <br />
               of a school. And, when these schools had 
               <br />
               been established the minority could esta-

               <br />
               anything more than separation; it does 
               <br />
               not involve the idea tha-t the separate

               could follow without a fuller and more

               depart from the point he raised this after- 
               <br />
               noon as to the difference between section 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Th.“.</span> No. 1, and section 16, No. 2. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend has gone back to that old heresy 
               <br />
               and fallacy of his that there is no constitu-

               further upon that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nowuthough</span> I may ex-

               change some words with him upon it later 
               <br />
               on. But let me show him again, since he 
               <br />
               has declined to see it, so far, the difference 
               <br />
               between section 16, No. 1, and section 16, 
               <br />
               No. 2. Under section 16_ No. 1, which prac- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tically</span> re-enacted the law of 1875, there 
               <br />
               was no restriction whatever upon the pow- 
               <br />
               er of the minority to establish such schools 
               <br />
               as they thought ﬁt. So far as I know 
               <br />
               there was no restriction whatever. My hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lt’riend</span> says that in that case, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jou</span> could 
               <br />
               have many different laws for different dis- 
               <br />
               tricts. Sir, that ’would have been the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legi-</span> 
               <br />
               timate and logical conclusion of the law. 
               <br />
               And, in order to obviate that in the Ter—

               not authorize that to 'be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">down</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘t‘ter</span> it

               had been in force for a number of years

               it was withdrawn, and it was held to be a

               grievance, and that grievance has been 
               <br />
               felt ever since. My hon. friend is familiar 
               <br />
               with the correspondence which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tool;</span> place 
               <br />
               between Archbishop Tache and others 
               <br />
               when this law was withdrawn in 1892, they 
               <br />
               made it the subject of complaint. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend might think that if the archbishop 
               <br />
               had been as good a lawyer as he is, he- 
               <br />

               <br />
               we have enacted the law of 1875 again, so— 
               <br />
               that they may not begin again. Although

               <br />
