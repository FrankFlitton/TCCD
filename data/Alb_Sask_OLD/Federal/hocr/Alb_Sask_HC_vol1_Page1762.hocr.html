               to the courts, the law was not disallowed, 
               <br />
               the minority rather submitted to the condi- 
               <br />
               tion of things imposed on them. They nc- 
               <br />
               cepted loyally that condition of things. They 
               <br />
               have taken their part in the working out of 
               <br />
               this law; and although they thought that 
               <br />
               by it they were deprived of an important 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> they submitted loyally to that depriv— 
               <br />
               ation. They have taken their share in the 
               <br />
               working out of the Act, and as I am given 
               <br />
               to understand it has worked on the whole 
               <br />
               satisfactorily. At all events, we have the 
               <br />
               opinion of Mr. Haultain—who in that re— 
               <br />
               spect ought to be counted an authority—that 
               <br />
               if he were dictator he would not change the 
               <br />
               present law. It is satisfactory to the Pro- 
               <br />
               testants, and as I understand from an in— 
               <br />
               terview in the press, in which Bishop Legal, 
               <br />
               Bishop of Alberta, was reported to have 
               <br />
               said that so far as it went, although not an 
               <br />
               ideal system, he was satisﬁed with it, it is 
               <br />
               accepted by the Catholics. Therefore we

               <br />
               the rights of the minority, is on the whole 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accepted</span> as satisfactory and with a desire

               to work it out for the common welfare of 
               <br />
               the country. What then was to be done un- 
               <br />
               der the circumstances ? Here is the law as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> is to-day and as it has been for 14 years. 
               <br />
               It may be that the point taken by Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson was well taken. I pass no opiu— 
               <br />
               ion on that. It may be that the point taken 
               <br />
               by the minority was well-founded, and on 
               <br />
               that I likewise pass no opinion.‘ But we ﬁnd a 
               <br />
               condition of things which has been in exist- 
               <br />
               ence 14 years, and I think it would be fool- 
               <br />
               hnrdy to attempt to displace it now. At all 
               <br />
               events, the point we have in view, the end 
               <br />
               we pursue, on behalf of the minority on both 
               <br />
               sides, whether Protestant or Catholic, is that 
               <br />
               the present'condition of things shall con- 
               <br />
               tinue, and the view we take is that it comes 
               <br />
               within the purview of section 98 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act. That is the 
               <br />
               position we take. I do not say that our 
               <br />
               drafting is absolutely unimpeachable. I 
               <br />
               have stated our view and aim, and to this 
               <br />
               aim and purpose we propose to adhere, but 
               <br />
               I do not intend to be committed absolutely 
               <br />
               to the drafting of clause No. 2. If it be in— 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient, we are Willing to consider any 
               <br />
               reasonable amendment, provided it be on 
               <br />
               the line I have stated and on no other. But
