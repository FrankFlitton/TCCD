               to retain it for ever ? Why tie their hands

               worse if they wish to do so ? Well, Sir, I 
               <br />
               think there are substantial reasons why 
               <br />
               we should not do that. Any man who 
               <br />
               is familiar with the history of this ques- 
               <br />
               tion in this country would, I think, pause 
               <br />
               before permitting this troublesome ques- 
               <br />

               made too stable and enduring. Permanency

               a different song being sung by the persons

               who are clamouring against this legislation

               the other, better is it I say, a thousand times 
               <br />
               that this educational system should be 
               <br />
               crystallized into an Act of parliament which 
               <br />
               will give it the element of permanency and 
               <br />

               cial separateness, but in national solidarity;

               and this universal shouting for provincial rights 
               <br />
               as paramount, and this speaking of the national 
               <br />
               government as an outside power which has no 
               <br />

               such a system of schools as the majority in

               surprise, ‘Why, that is a totally different

               course the two ideals are very different. If it 
               <br />
               were not so, there would be none of this trouble. 
               <br />
               But just as strong as is our objection to the 
               <br />
               clerical school for our children,-so strong <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is'</span> 
               <br />
               the objection of the Roman Catholic for the 
               <br />
               non-clerical school. People may say they do 
               <br />
               not believe this; that many Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               in their hearts prefer the non—sectarian school. 
               <br />
               This is not to the purpose; they say they do 
               <br />
               not hold these conscientious objections, and 
               <br />
               who but themselves can say what they believe ? 
               <br />
               When they cease to prefer separate schools 
               <br />
               they will presumably have none. We may say 
               <br />
               it is only the priests who want the separate 
               <br />
               schools. but our system of government is based <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"</span> 
               <br />
               on persuasion. and, if they can persuade the 
               <br />
               people more than we can, we have to accept 
               <br />
               the declarations ot our fellow citizens as to 
               <br />
               what they really do want.
