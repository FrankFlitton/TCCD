               Speaker, the Bill which is now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«before</span> the 
               <br />
               House is one of great importance to Can- 
               <br />
               ada and particularly to the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories which are about to be created into 
               <br />
               provinces. As I have the honour to re- 
               <br />
               present a constituency which forms a part 
               <br />
               of these great Territories I consider it my 
               <br />
               duty to give some reasons why I intend to 
               <br />
               support the Bill which is before the House 
               <br />
               as I certainly will do. I have listened 
               <br />
               with a great deal of attention to the views 
               <br />
               expressed by hom. members <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'on</span> both sides 
               <br />
               of the House and I have endeavoured to 
               <br />
               realize their point of view. I was particu- 
               <br />
               larly struck with the simile used by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
               <br />
               when he congratulated my right hon. friend 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) on ' 
               <br />
               the introduction of this Bill. He likened 
               <br />
               the provinces which are being created to 
               <br />
               a pair of twins which had just arrived on 
               <br />
               the scene. At the time I thought the com- 
               <br />
               parison was a very happy one. but further 
               <br />
               consideration struck me that it perhaps did 
               <br />
               not quite ﬁt the occasion. I thought it 
               <br />
               would have been 'fairer to have compared 
               <br />
               the two young provinces to a couple of 
               <br />
               youths who have been under probation, 
               <br />
               who have completed their education and 
               <br />
               are about to enter into their estate. The 
               <br />
               Dominion government have been the trus- 
               <br />
               tees who have been looking after their 
               <br />
               interests until they came of age and until 
               <br />
               they were ﬁt to be entrusted with their 
               <br />
               own affairs. I thought the simile was 
               <br />
               very well taken by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey, but at the same time I thought 
               <br />
               possibly his professional pride was piqued 
               <br />
               at not being called in as consulting physi- 
               <br />
               cian on the auspicious occasion. These 
               <br />
               provinces, having attained man’s estate, are 
               <br />
               about to become independent to a certain 
               <br />
               extent; that is as independent as any per- 
               <br />
               son can be in these days, or as any pro- 
               <br />
               vince can be that is a member of this great 
               <br />
               confederacy. No province can be perfectly 
               <br />
               independent any more than any individual 
               <br />
               who is a member of a community can be 
               <br />
               perfectly independent. There must be 
               <br />
               some restraints to guard against en- 
               <br />
               trenching upon the rights, privileges and 
               <br />
               property of the different provinces, .but 
               <br />
               so long as they keep within their rights 
               <br />
               and privileges they are free. It is so 
               <br />
               with these new provinces. They are 
               <br />
               now the centre of observations and the 
               <br />
               methods adopted by them at this present 
               <br />
               juncture and their ability to cope with the 
               <br />
               problems with which they must deal will 
               <br />
               have a most powerful effect in the future 
               <br />
               of these provinces. If at the commence- 
               <br />
               ment of their career they deal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recklessly,</span> 
               <br />
               weakly, or carelessly with the questions 
               <br />
               which will be presented to them their fut- 
               <br />
               ure career will be most injuriously affected 
               <br />
               and all that aiïects them will certainly 
               <br />
               affect the rest of Canada to an extent that
