               man himself has spoken loudly and passion- 
               <br />
               ately with regard to this question. He said 
               <br />
               the people were aroused, that the torch had 
               <br />
               gone through the land. Can he say less

               now, or are these mere dull and idle plati- 
               <br />
               tudes ? It is he who has lighted the torch 
               <br />
               and has sent it through this land, as is

               <br />
               of the petitions that are laid on the table 
               <br />
               day after day, petitions coming to this 
               <br />
               House irrespective of party, showing that 
               <br />
               the people are aroused. These petitions 
               <br />
               come, to a large extent, from former ad- 
               <br />
               herents of the right hon. gentleman’s party 
               <br />
               in 1896, which fact is sufﬁcient to show 
               <br />
               that he has broken faith with that party, 
               <br />
               and that he does not represent it any more 
               <br />
               on this question. This plea for toleration 
               <br />
               was loudly raised by ministers of the Crown 
               <br />
               who, it was thought, from their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">previous</span> 
               <br />
               utterances, would have taken a very differ- 
               <br />
               ent stand in regard to these Bills. The cry 
               <br />
               of toleration and the cry of peace were 
               <br />
               raised by these hon. gentlemen, from whom 
               <br />
               1t was thought we would have had a very 
               <br />
               much more stable line of argument. We 
               <br />
               have had from them a plea for the cessation 
               <br />
               of strife and passion. We have had the 
               <br />
               thunder of the hon. Minister of Customs 
               <br />
               (Mr. Paterson) against this engendering 
               <br />
               of strife and passion. In his sonorous tones, 
               <br />
               that ﬁlled this chamber, we had an appeal 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> moderation, and I wonder how his voice 
               <br />
               will sound when he goes back to his con- 
               <br />
               stituency and tries to square the remarks 
               <br />
               he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[made</span> upon this Bill with what he said 
               <br />
               on a previous occasion. There is a great 
               <br />
               deal of hypocrisy about the cry of tolera- 
               <br />

               <br />
               while we are asked to be tolerant, a part of 
               <br />
               the people are being muzzled and bound 
               <br />
               hand and foot by measures of a coercive 
               <br />
               character. We are asked to allay strife and 
               <br />
               passion while the people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               are being bound for all time under the slav-

               <br />
               calmly submit to the imposition by this

               parliament of such measures as this parlia-

               voices in opposition to this we are accused 
               <br />
               of engendering strife and passion. The 
               <br />

               <br />
               claimed that this Bill was a compromise. I 
               <br />
               fail to see in what respect it is a compro- 
               <br />
               mise. My conception of a compromise is 
               <br />
               that the parties interested pro and con come 
               <br />
               together, they discuss, they give way and 
               <br />
               they agree. I do not understand that this 
               <br />
               is any compromise in the ordinary accepta-

               <br />
               have always seen attributed to it. It is not 
               <br />
               that kind of a compromise. It is the kind 
               <br />
               of a compromise which is inﬂicted on the 
               <br />

               per cent of the Roman Catholic denomination

               the party that is represented in- opposition 
               <br />
               in this House has been lacking in the power 
               <br />
               to deal with great questions which make

               <br />

               <br />
               the ﬂoor of this House. Is he forgetful of 
               <br />
               all that has been done by the party which 
               <br />
               is now in opposition in this House, of all 
               <br />
