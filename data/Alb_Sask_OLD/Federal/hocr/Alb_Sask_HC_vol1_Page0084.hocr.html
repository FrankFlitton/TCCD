               I have read that draft Bill and I fail to

               It seems to me that if a question arises on 
               <br />
               which the difference of opinion between one 
               <br />

               <br />
               clear that he feels it is his duty to resign, 
               <br />
               then, he is not doing his duty to his con—

               <br />

               <br />
               silently in his place and refraining from 
               <br />
               taking any part in the discussion of that 
               <br />
               question when it comes up. It strikes me 
               <br />
               that if I were in such a connection, I would 
               <br />
