               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TISDIA‘LE;</span> I think if it is necessary 
               <br />
               to make out an exceptional case, one has 
               <br />
               been made out here. It has been shown 
               <br />
               that the proprietorship of this railroad is 
               <br />
               exclusively American and as far as I am 
               <br />
               individually concerned—and 1 am only ex- 
               <br />
               pressing my own sentiments—I was not in 
               <br />
               accord with the change in the Railway 
               <br />
               Act, because I believe that in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> 
               <br />
               which is one of the greatest countries in 
               <br />
               the world, our one weakness in times past— 
               <br />
               and we are not beyond that condition of 
               <br />
               weakness yet—is the need of capital to 
               <br />
               develop our immense area, our great re— 
               <br />
               sources and the magniﬁcent possibilities of 
               <br />
               our splendid country. Why should we not 
               <br />
               allow people of another country to come in 
               <br />
               with capital when in my opiniOn we can 
               <br />
               sufﬁciently clothe them under the system of 
               <br />
               international law that exists to control their 
               <br />
               own property which we allow them to ac— 
               <br />
               quire in this country, I think that at present 
               <br />
               and for many years to come, nothwithstand. 
               <br />
               ing the magniﬁcent development we are mak- 
               <br />
               ing, that one of the things of which we 
               <br />
               should be most careful, is the inducement of 
               <br />
               capital to come in here, to protect the capital 
               <br />
               when it does come in and to give those 
               <br />
               whom we allow to become interested in 
               <br />
               enterprises, especially in large enterprises 
               <br />
               in this country, a cordial welcome and con- 
               <br />
               trol of what they are permitted to acquire. 
               <br />
               The time has not yet come, even in the 
               <br />
               mother-country, great as it is, thickly set- 
               <br />
               tled as it is, developed as it is, that they 
               <br />
               have found it necessary to enact laws of 
               <br />
               this sort to protect the interests of the 
               <br />
               country as against the capital of those whom 
               <br />
               they invite to enter that country. There- 
               <br />
               fore as I said my individual opinion was that 
               <br />
               it was a mistake to change the Railway Act 
               <br />
               even to the extent that we did, for as I 
               <br />
               understand the international 
               <br />
               civilized countries, when people acquired 
               <br />
               property under the law of a country in 
               <br />
               which they invest their capital under the 
               <br />
               comity of nations, they do it with the full 
               <br />
               knowledge that in so investing they are sub— 
               <br />
               ject to the laws of the country in which 
               <br />
               the investment is made. I think in a com- 
               <br />
               mercial transaction that is a sufﬁcient pro- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jection.</span> Under the circumstances that have 
               <br />
               been developed here I feel it is my duty to 
               <br />
               explain why I view this matter as I do 
               <br />
               and to justify the vote I propose to give in 
               <br />
               support of this Bill. I say that I invite 
               <br />
               American capital, I invite European capi- 
               <br />
               tal. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:I</span> believe the majority of the people of 
               <br />
               this country if they understood this ques- 
               <br />
               lion would agree with me that the capital 
               <br />
               of all nations should be induced to come 
               <br />
               to Canada. We want to control, we must 
               <br />
               pass the laws, we must regulate the actions 
               <br />
               of every one who comes into this country, 
               <br />
               and must see that the laws shall be obeyed

               property. We can place restrictions on them 
               <br />
               without compelling them to become British 
               <br />
               subjects. They have to obey our laws, and 
               <br />
               that is sufﬁcient protection for us. If my

               we are asked here to make an excep-

               York they won’t allow a British subject to
