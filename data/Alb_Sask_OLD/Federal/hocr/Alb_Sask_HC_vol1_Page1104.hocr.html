               tions to show how public feeling has been 
               <br />
               aroused in this country, a result largely 
               <br />
               due I think to the course pursued by the 
               <br />
               Conservative party. I have recently seen 
               <br />
               two letters addressed to hon. members of 
               <br />
               this House both from residents of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario. The writer of one letter 
               <br />
               inquired if it were not true that the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics of Canada serving in our militia 
               <br />
               got bigger pay per day than the Protes- 
               <br />
               tant-s. I saw another letter inquiring as to 
               <br />
               whether it was not true that all through 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec there were being 
               <br />
               stored riﬂes and ammunition in the base- 
               <br />
               ments of the Catholic churches. These gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen scented danger, and they may have 
               <br />
               been quite honest in their fear; but I say 
               <br />
               they were aroused to this particular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dorm</span> of 
               <br />
               excitement largely by the position taken by

               the Conservative party.

               tion which he took in 1896 by reason of 
               <br />
               the fact that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conservative</span> party was 
               <br />
               defeated in that year, and had been de-

               tected twice since. Now, Sir, no declar- 
               <br />
               ation has been quoted more frequently in 
               <br />
               the United States than that of Henry Clay, 
               <br />
               who said that he would rather be right 
               <br />
               than be president. But the declaration 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for North To- 
               <br />
               ronto is that ‘he will follow the people, 
               <br />
               whether they are right or whether they 
               <br />
               are wrong. He is like the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immortal</span> Flan- 
               <br />
               nignn from Texas, who, in closmg a 
               <br />
               speedh, addressed his audience saying: 
               <br />
               ‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yentlemen,</span> them’s my sentiments, and if 
               <br />
               they don’t suit you they can be changed.’ 
               <br />
               Now certainly these are not high ideals to 
               <br />
               put before the youth of this country. There 
               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> distinction between right and wrong, 
               <br />
               and there is surely no reason in this coun-

               try why a person should desert What he 
               <br />
               considers to be the true position merely 
               <br />
               because his party meets with a political re-

               other chamber said that on New Year’s 
               <br />
               Day, 1896, that day when the whole world 
               <br />
               breathes forth hosannas of peace on earth 
               <br />
               and good will towards man, he made a call 
               <br />
               upon one of the ministers, and he tells us 
               <br />
               that while he was paying his respects to 
               <br />
               the ladies, this ~minister 'Was trying to 
               <br />
               seduce one of his other ministers away 
               <br />
               from the cabinet. Now if such conduct 
               <br />
               prevailed on New Year’s Day among cabinet 
               <br />
               ministers, surely we could expect almost 
               <br />
               anything to occur in the ranks of the Gon- 
               <br />
               servative party. But I notice that the prin- 
               <br />
               ciples of the hon. member for North Toronto. 
               <br />
               his political ethics, were not of a much 
               <br />
               higher standard in the past than they are 
               <br />
               to—day. He addressed this parliament in 
               <br />
               1896 upon the Manitoba school question and 
               <br />
               I think he was the last speaker on the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> side. I must admit that he made 
               <br />
               a speech which was an exceedingly able 
               <br />
               and admirable one, notwithstanding that 
               <br />
               there are portions of it with which I do 
               <br />
               not agree. I wish to read just a short 
               <br />
               quotation from that speech to show what 
               <br />
               was the standard of political ethics of that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman then and When I read that 
               <br />
               I am sure hon. gentlemen will not be sur—

               prised at the position taken by him the 
               <br />
               other day. He was then address—mg the 
               <br />
               Conservative party. He knew that there

               were to be many desertions from the rnnks
