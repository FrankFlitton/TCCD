               fore the House the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               took one position, and they supported him. 
               <br />
               He cried white in 1896, and they supported 
               <br />
               him; they said it was good. In 1905 when 
               <br />
               he cries black, they say, it is better, it is 
               <br />
               right, it is justice to the minority. It might 
               <br />

               <br />
               slavish adulation or such clinging to party or 
               <br />
               such serving of the exigencies of party which

               they desire to hold together at all costs.

               than they ever had, are taking advantage

               of the moment to enact laws which Will

               <br />

               party take the full responsibility for What 
               <br />
               they are doing. If they persist in betraying 
               <br />
               the people’s rights, if they can make one 
               <br />
               promise and obtain power on that promise, 
               <br />
               and then desecrate and violate it, there is 
               <br />
               only one question that remains, and that is, 
               <br />
               whether there is a right of appeal. This is 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst session of a new parliament, and 
               <br />
               early in the session the Bill was introduced. 
               <br />
               The Bill is one that has been talked of for 
               <br />
               two years. It was kept in the shade by hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite until they had obtained a 
               <br />
               large and substantial majority in this House. 
               <br />
               The moment that majority is obtained, it is 
               <br />
               used for the purpose of passing through a 
               <br />
               measure to brand by coercive methods these 
               <br />
               Northwest provinces with a system of edu— 
               <br />
               cation which they do not desire, and which 
               <br />
               the majority would not have voted for if 
               <br />
               they had ever had an opportunity of voting 
               <br />
               on this question. Then the question arises, 
               <br />
               is there an appeal ? Sir, this is the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               session of a new parliament. Hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite congratulate themselves that 
               <br />
               in six months’ time all this magniﬁcent 
               <br />
               ﬂurry which they have raised will pass as 
               <br />
               a cloud of dust before a June rain. Hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen are congratulating themselves in 
               <br />
               vain. Let me remind these hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               that there are men in this country who think 
               <br />
               more of the eternal principles of justice 
               <br />
               than to let these events pass as a day- 
               <br />
               dream. The people of this country will 
               <br />
               remember, not only for six months, not 
               <br />
               only over one session, but over several 
               <br />
               sessions, and when the time comes, be 
               <br />
               it early or long deferred, when hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen have to submit themselves 
               <br />
               to their respective constituencies in the 
               <br />
               changed garb which they have now 
               <br />
               adopted, and the people have an opportunity 
               <br />
               through the ballot of passing judgment upon 
               <br />
               them, that judgment will, I fancy, empha- 
               <br />
               size to these hon. gentlemen that the people 
               <br />
               have not forgotten and do not forget this 
               <br />
               interference With their sacred rights as 
               <br />
               easily and as soon as the hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               would like them to forget. Sir, it is a dan- 
               <br />
               gerous thing to triﬂe with public rights; it 
               <br />
               is a dangerous thing to interfere with the 
               <br />
               principles and privileges that belong to a 
               <br />
               free people, and it is, in this particular case, 
               <br />
               an act for which the people will mete out 
               <br />
               justice when they have the opportunity with 
               <br />
               regard to the changed position of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite. Sir, I shall cast my 
               <br />
               vote for the amendment proposed by the 
               <br />
               hon. leader of the opposition. I shall cast 
               <br />
               my vote in that way, because I think the 
               <br />
               amendment contains those principles which 
               <br />
               will make for the paciﬁcation of this coun-
