               establish such a province with the necessary

               powers of a province under the Britsh North

               a province in the territory affected by the

               bargain must be within the contemplation 
               <br />
               of both parties. Then, as under the British

               North America Act the right of taxation be- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the taking away of that power, it cannot be 
               <br />
               wrong for the province to exercise that 
               <br />
               power of taxation. It seems to me that in 
               <br />
               accepting these privileges the company 
               <br />
               accepts them under the law, and that under 
               <br />
               the law, the moment that the province is 
               <br />
               created, it has the right to tax. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»</span> Surely, then,

               in fairness the company hardly say that the

               section 92 of the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               Suppose—taking it the other way—you 
               <br />
               make a law giving the provinces authority 
               <br />
               to have their own customs, their own post 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office,</span> and to deal with criminal law, and to 
               <br />
               control other matters that are within the 
               <br />
               jurisdiction of the Dominion. Section 92 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act provides 
               <br />
               that certain things shall be in the control 
               <br />
               of the provinces ‘exclusively’—that is the 
               <br />
               word that is used. and these things include 
               <br />
               even the amending of their constitution. 
               <br />
               Then, section 91 gives certain powers ex- 
               <br />
               clusively to the Dominion. When we make 
               <br />
               a bargain here. it must be assumed that we 
               <br />
               contemplate doing only what we have the 
               <br />
               right to do. and any person with whom we 
               <br />
               make a bargain must take the risk of what 
               <br />
               our powers are. When we create a province 
               <br />
               and it is brought to our attention that we 
               <br />
               have made a bargain which we cannot con- 
               <br />
               trol so far as the province is concerned, we 
               <br />
               should not be called upon to go on record 
               <br />
               in this parliament with the declaration that 
               <br />
               the province is bound to do anything which 
               <br />
               the British North America Act says that it' 
               <br />
               is not bound to do. 
               <br />
