               I ask again, is there any fairness in that ? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ross saw in 1881, if the exemptions 
               <br />
               were made an item of the contract. that 
               <br />
               when provinces were created it would be 
               <br />
               improper and unjust to leave them saddled 
               <br />
               with the burden of the exemptions. Mr. 
               <br />
               Blake in 1881 declared that the people 0.1’ 
               <br />
               the Northwest would be less than men if 
               <br />
               they suffered such a limitation upon the-ir 
               <br />
               autonomy to exist. In January, 1906, when 
               <br />
               confronted with the declaration of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment that provinces were to be erected 
               <br />
               this year, I took the position that if it was 
               <br />
               intended to leave the provinces under these 
               <br />
               exemptions I must oppose the measures, in 
               <br />
               particular view of the possibility that by 
               <br />
               waiting for the Privy Council judgment on 
               <br />
               the test cases a comparatively easy way 
               <br />
               might be found of obtaining relinquishment 
               <br />
               by the company of the provincial exemption 
               <br />
               rights. The Prime Minister intimated to 
               <br />
               me his recognition that these exemptions, 
               <br />
               both Dominion and provincial. would have 
               <br />
               to be abrogated in the interests not alone 
               <br />
               of the provinces but, of the Dominion. With 
               <br />
               that intimation that the provinces need 
               <br />
               not fear that they would be left under the

               Mr. SCOTT. You can have your own 
               <br />
               opinion about that. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               has publicly repeated the assurance which 
               <br />

               new provinces. Is it unnecessary? I say 
               <br />
               it is no more unnecessary than your section 
               <br />

               these Bills. but section 16 of the contract 
               <br />
               of 1881 which imposes the limitation. Sec- 
               <br />
               tion 23 merely states that the provinces are 
               <br />

               <br />
               the contract is good or bad in legality or

               or perfect, to that degree the provinces are

               that their autonomy has been invaded by a

               <br />
