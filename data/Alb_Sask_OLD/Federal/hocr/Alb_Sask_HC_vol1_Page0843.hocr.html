               <br />
               information that may be of some value to 
               <br />
               them and to their sons who go out to 
               <br />
               that country, because, I am glad to say, that 
               <br />
               we have in the west the sons and daughters 
               <br />
               of Quebec and Ontario and of every other 
               <br />
               province in this Dominion and that there are 
               <br />
               no better settlers in the world than the 
               <br />
               people from this eastern country. But, Sir, 
               <br />
               what are the conditions to-day and what 
               <br />
               were they 25 years ago? As I have said 
               <br />
               Manitoba was the experimental farm. The 
               <br />
               farmers who went into that country knew 
               <br />
               that the country was fertile, but they did 
               <br />
               not know that the season was long enough 
               <br />
               to enable them to ripen wheat. They were 
               <br />
               afraid their labours would not receive very 
               <br />
               much return. By experiment it has been 
               <br />
               found that by cultivating and tilling the soil 
               <br />
               the prairie is changed from a non-conductor 
               <br />
               or reﬂector ot heat, that the prairie will 
               <br />
               absorb and retain heat and that we are able 
               <br />
               to grow wheat and never think anything of 
               <br />
               frost. That is an experiment that the peo— 
               <br />
               ple of Manitoba have had to work out for 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt of the whole western country. 
               <br />
               These are some obstacles which the farmers 
               <br />
               had to contend With. I speak from experi- 
               <br />
               ence. After raising their crop they had to 
               <br />
               take it sometimes 50 miles with a yoke of 
               <br />
               .exen and sell it for 40 cents a bushel. That 
               <br />
               was done for a good many years and that 
               <br />
               will illustrate some of the hardships that 
               <br />
               the people had to go through. As to our 
               <br />
               schools, people were afraid to go into that 
               <br />
               western country because the country was 
               <br />
               so sparsely settled that it was almost impos- 
               <br />
               sible to have schools. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               What would we do if we were obliged to 
               <br />
               have two kinds of schools ? A great many 
               <br />
               gentlemen who have spoken on the other

               <br />
               told us what they think is good for the 
               <br />
               west. But, .Sir, the people of Quebec and 
               <br />
               the' people of Ontario do not understand 
               <br />
               how different are the conditions in the west, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the conditions prevailing in the east. 
               <br />
               I may digress to refer to a trivial matter 
               <br />
               now, but if there is any one here who was 
               <br />
               in Manitoba in the early days he per-

               When we went into that country the mode 
               <br />
               of conveyance was the Red river cart rather 
               <br />
               than the Pullman car, and sleeping on the

               <br />
               but you did not feel it. I point theSe out 
               <br />
               as some of the things the pioneers in that 
               <br />
               western country had to experience, in order 
               <br />
               to prove to the people of the east that Mani- 
               <br />
               toba and the Territories were worth some- 
               <br />
               thing. In view of what the people of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba have suffered, is their province not 
               <br />
               deserving of better treatment at the hands 
               <br />
               of this government ? I say here honestly. 
               <br />
               that this government did not consider the 
               <br />
               whole question before they decided that 
               <br />
               Manitoba could not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extendedilvestward.</span> 
               <br />
               One reason they have given for not ex- 
               <br />
               tending Mauitoba to the west is, that Mani- 
               <br />
               toba has incurred a debt and that the man 
               <br />
               dn one section of land is liable for a certain 
               <br />
               debt from which the man on the other side 
               <br />
               of the line is free. Let us look at that from 
               <br />
               a business standpint. I admit that Manitoba 
               <br />
               has a heavier debt than the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories, but Manitoba has assets to show 
               <br />
               for it. When a business man is consider- 
               <br />
               ing his ﬁnancial position he considers his 
               <br />
               assets as well as his liabilities, and if he 
               <br />
               has assets that more than balance his liabil- 
               <br />
               ities he thinks himself pretty well off. That 
               <br />
               is a sound business principle and it applies 
               <br />
               to the province of Manitoba. I wish my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Lisgar (Mr. Greenway) 
               <br />
               were here because he would understand 
               <br />
               something of What I am speaking about. 
               <br />
               When Mr. Greenway was premier of Maui— 
               <br />
               toba, he offered a very great sum of money 
               <br />
               ii he could get a 10 cent rate on wheat 
               <br />
               from Winnipeg to Port Arthur. We were 
               <br />
               paying 14, 15 and'16 cents per hundred, on 
               <br />
               wheat from Winnipeg to Port Arthur, and 
               <br />
               a difference of even one cent per bushel 
               <br />
               means a great deal to the farmer. When 
               <br />
               the Roblin government came into power 
               <br />
               they got a ten cent rate and they got it 
               <br />
               without costing that country a cent. I 
               <br />
               want to compare the freight rates on the 
               <br />
               Canadian side, which have been secured by 
               <br />
               this business transaction of the Roblin gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, with the wheat rates on the other 
               <br />
               side of the line, and then I will ask if there 
               <br />
               is not some reason why Manitoba should 
               <br />
               have a debt. If this government had in- 
               <br />
               vestigated the matter and explained as 
               <br />
               they should have done to the people why 
               <br />
               Manitoba should be extended west, before 
               <br />
               iive years had elapsed these people would 
               <br />
               have been entirely satisﬁed and we Would 
               <br />
               have had two great provinces. Here are 
               <br />
               the freight rates on wheat. From Winnipeg 
               <br />
               to Port Arthur, 421 miles, the rates on 
               <br />
               wheat is 10 cents per 100 pounds or 6 cents 
               <br />
               per bushel. From Brainerd, Minnesota to 
               <br />
               Duluth, 119 miles, note the diiÏerence, the 
               <br />
               freight is 10-cents per 100 pounds. From 
               <br />
               Gretna to Port Arthur, 500 miles, the freight 
               <br />
