               opinion on this question. Why did not the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick)

               rise in the ﬁrst instance and give an opinion, 
               <br />
               more particularly in view of the fact that 
               <br />
               weeks have elapsed since the hon. leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) spoke on 
               <br />
               this question and gave a legal opinion which 
               <br />
               stands -to-day unshattered, and has not had 
               <br />
               one particle stricken from it or from any of 
               <br />
               the strong arguments that were adduced in 
               <br />
               it? We have two Bills, and it is hardly 
               <br />
               worth while going into the merits of the 
               <br />
               two owing to the fact that on the question 
               <br />
               of principle the two are almost the same. 
               <br />
               The whole question is involved in this school 
               <br />
               matter, whether or not there shall be two 
               <br />
               systems of schools in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. Two grounds have been taken, and 
               <br />
               I propose shortly to speak on this question, 
               <br />
               because the ground has been well traversed. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst ground taken by the Prime Minis- 
               <br />
               ter was, as I understood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> that in the ori- 
               <br />
               ginal Act which gave power to these Terri- 
               <br />
               tories a system of separate schools was con- 
               <br />
               ferred upon the people there. But, as the 
               <br />
               law that gave these people the system of 
               <br />
               schools which there prevails was a law 
               <br />
               framed by this parliament, it is an admitted 
               <br />
               fact, and it has not been contradicted, that 
               <br />
               this parliament had exactly the same right 
               <br />
               to take away as it had the right to give. 
               <br />
               The people of these Territories had, in ad- 
               <br />
               dition to their separate school system of 
               <br />
               education, under the Acts, the right to the 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial use of the French language in the 
               <br />
               Territories, and yet, although that right was 
               <br />
               similarly given to them, it was taken away 
               <br />
               by this parliament. So, on the same line 
               <br />
               of argument, and on the same line of rea- 
               <br />
               soning, as they had the right to remove the 
               <br />
               privilege of the ofﬁcial use of the French 
               <br />
               language in the Northwest Territories, they 
               <br />
               had the right to divorce these people from 
               <br />
               the system of separate schools. I do not 
               <br />
               propose to give my opinion on this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, because my opinion, as I expect the 
               <br />
               opinions of many legal gentlemen in this 
               <br />
               House, will have very little weight. I can 
               <br />
               rely upon the opinions of admittedly great 
               <br />
               constitutional lawyers: I will cite the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               position of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government“</span> If the position 
               <br />
               of the government is weak in its legal aspect 
               <br />
               that weakness is in the main due to the ut— 
               <br />
               terances of certain cabinet ministers. When 
               <br />
               they saw their weakness and when they 
               <br />
               saw that men like the member for South 
               <br />
               Perth (Mr. McIntyre) could not be convinced 
               <br />
               by the so-called legal argument, they endea— 
               <br />
               voured to arrest the stampede by dwelling 
               <br />
               on the political expediency of the case. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance in an impassioned ad- 
               <br />
               dress turned to his followers and told them : 
               <br />
               If you don’t support this Bill the govern- 
               <br />
               ment goes out and the Tories will come into 
               <br />
               power. The Minister of Finance evidently 
               <br />
               thought that it is not a question of principle 
               <br />
               or a question of the legal rights of the mino- 
               <br />
               rity, but that the whole question at issue 
               <br />
               was one of practical politics. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">want</span> to be 
               <br />
               fair to the Minister of Finance who did 
               <br />
               offer one argument in favour of the Bill, 
               <br />
               and were he in the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight</span> I would 
               <br />
               ask him a question. He pointed to the fact
