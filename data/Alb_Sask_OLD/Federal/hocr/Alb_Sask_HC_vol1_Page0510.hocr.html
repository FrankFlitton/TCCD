               Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. The Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice was not present, so far as my 
               <br />
               1ecollection goes, during the time I was 
               <br />
               there. A few minutes after I arrived Mr. 
               <br />
               Rogers,—who was the only minister from 
               <br />
               Manitoba who spoke—explained that his 
               <br />
               government desired the extension of the 
               <br />
               boundaries of Manitoba easterly to the Hud— 
               <br />
               son bay and northerly. The memorial said 
               <br />
               northerly, and when he explained that they 
               <br />
               desired an extension easterly to Hudson bay, 
               <br />
               so as to include territory at the mouth of the 
               <br />
               Churchill river and the Nelson river, I at 
               <br />
               once observed that he was asking to extend 
               <br />
               the territory of Manitoba easterly in a direc- 
               <br />
               tion which would perhaps interest the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario as well. Up to that mom- 
               <br />
               ent, when it was only proposed, so far as 
               <br />
               the memorial went, to extend Manitoba 
               <br />
               northerly,—although they may have intended 
               <br />
               north easterly to come out at Hudson bay— 
               <br />
               it did not occur to me that the desire was to 
               <br />
               go to the mouths of those two rivers. There- 
               <br />
               fore so soon as that object was known to 
               <br />
               me, I said that the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               would have the right to he heard before we 
               <br />
               could adjudicate upon that point or form 
               <br />
               any opinion upon it. Mr. Rogers took the 
               <br />
               ground that the province of Ontario had no 
               <br />
               right or claim to any territory lying north 
               <br />
               of that province and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adjacent.</span> to Maui- 
               <br />
               toba’s easterly limit, and therefore had no 
               <br />
               right to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heard.‘</span> I controverted that view 
               <br />
               and explained that I could not agree to it. 
               <br />
               He said if you will allow me I can satisfy 
               <br />
               you that Ontario has no right to be heard. 
               <br />
               I replied that it would be a waste of time 
               <br />
               to try and convert me on that point and 
               <br />
               that, speaking as a minister from the pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario, I must insist upon that 
               <br />
               province being heard before this question 
               <br />
               is gone into.

               <br />

               that province was present and could sub- 
               <br />
               mit its case. Upon that statement I with-

               drew from the meeting, and I am told

               it might be regarded by the two provinces

               tude I assumed on that question, and that

               was that until the province of Ontario could

               day, with regard to the matter with which 
               <br />
               he has dealt, he would have given us an 
               <br />
               explanation that has not yet been made 
               <br />
               with reference to the introduction of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> 
               <br />
               Bill without even consultation with these 
               <br />
               two gentlemen. It is gratifying to 
               <br />
               know that although two members of 
               <br />
               his own government could not be con-

               sulted with regard to the provisions of 
               <br />
               this Bill, the Postmaster General has been 
               <br />
               so strenuous in his advocacy of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights</span> 
               <br />
               of his province of Ontario that the minis- 
               <br />
               ters of that province had to be consulted. 
               <br />
               However, there is an old proverb that cha- 
               <br />
               rity well understood begins at home, and 
               <br />
               possibly the rights of ministers to be heard 
               <br />
               with regard to important matters to be 
               <br />
               dealt with by parliament may be extended 
               <br />
               not only to the provincial ministers of On- 
               <br />
               tario, but to ministers of this very adminis- 
               <br />
               tration.
