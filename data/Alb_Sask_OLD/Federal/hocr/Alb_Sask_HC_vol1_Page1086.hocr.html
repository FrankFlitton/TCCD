               conclusively the intention of the framers of 
               <br />
               the Act, and I submit that the Act contains 
               <br />
               this underlying principle, namely, that it 
               <br />
               was absolutely necessary that any province 
               <br />

               <br />
               same status as the four provinces then in 
               <br />
               the confederation. We can understand very 
               <br />
               readily why such language was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">used;</span> The 
               <br />
               then provinces comprising this Dominion 
               <br />
               were jealous lest any other province should, 
               <br />
               by any possibility, in the future obtain great- 
               <br />
               er powers than they themselves enjoyed. 
               <br />
               There had been a struggle for equality all 
               <br />
               through. All through the framers of con- 
               <br />
               federation were struggling for equality. 
               <br />
               Sometimes the effort was to repress the 
               <br />
               struggles for supremacy that would break 
               <br />
               out here and there on the part of certain 
               <br />
               provinces, and they were all exceedingly de- 
               <br />
               sirous that no new province should have 
               <br />
               any greater powers than they themselves 
               <br />
               possessed. Undoubtedly it was not thought 
               <br />
               necessary then to suggest to the imperial 
               <br />
               authorities to pass an Act which would give 
               <br />
               the Dominion parliament the right to create 
               <br />
               new provinces with less power. No one 
               <br />
               then considered the possibility of our creat- 
               <br />
               ing new provinces with less powers than 
               <br />
               those which the older provinces had acquir- 
               <br />
               ed. Suppose, for instance, that in this Bill 
               <br />
               we omitted to provide for certain powers 
               <br />
               which properly pertain to &amp; province with 
               <br />
               regard to many matters that suggest them- 
               <br />
               selves, and which are provided for in sec- 
               <br />
               tion 92 of the British North America Act—— 
               <br />
               suppose these powers were left out, who 
               <br />
               would supply them ? That is a very perti- 
               <br />
               nent question. This Parliament could not 
               <br />
               do so. I apprehend that the powers of this 
               <br />
               parliament would be exhausted by enacting 
               <br />
               the constitution, and consequently would be

               <br />
               of it afterwards. These provinces would
