               of these sections any mention of the question

               of education. That is a fact that may well 
               <br />
               be pointed to. Why is it so ? It is because 
               <br />
               education was not given exclusively either 
               <br />
               to the provinces or to the Dominion and it 
               <br />
               is wrong to say as many hon. members have

               They accepted that assurance. They gave

               that as a reason why it was not necessary

               to have that Act submitted to the Canadian

               to deal with the statute as it stands to-day
