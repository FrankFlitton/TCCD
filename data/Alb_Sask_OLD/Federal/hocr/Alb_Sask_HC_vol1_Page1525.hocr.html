               Roman Catholic or to the conscience of the 
               <br />
               Protestant. Let us take a concrete ex- 
               <br />
               ample. Here is a school established say 
               <br />
               by a Roman Catholic district in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec; then their catechism will be 
               <br />
               taught, the Roman Catholic catechism, that 
               <br />
               is to say the Roman Catholic form of 
               <br />
               Christianity will be taught in that school. 
               <br />
               If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> is a minority there composed say 
               <br />
               of Presbyterians, of that very ﬁne body of 
               <br />
               men, ‘who as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they‘</span> claim themselves with 
               <br />
               some pride, are fed on oatmeal and the 
               <br />
               shorter catechism, that naturally is very 
               <br />
               offensive to them, and they would have the 
               <br />
               right to secede. Take the converse proposi- 
               <br />
               tion. Suppose there is in Quebec as there 
               <br />
               is in the eastern townships, a school where 
               <br />
               the Protestants are in the majority and 
               <br />
               then the shorter catechism is taught. That 
               <br />
               would be offensive to the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               minority and there they would have the 
               <br />
               right to secede also. Take another case. 
               <br />
               Suppose there is a Protestant school where 
               <br />
               no religion is taught and there is a Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic minority <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{there</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{they</span> want 
               <br />
               to have religion taught, it is offensive to 
               <br />
               their conscience that no religious instruc- 
               <br />
               tion should be given to their children: 
               <br />
               there again provision is made that they 
               <br />
               nave the right to secede. There are only 
               <br />
               two kinds of education which can be given 
               <br />
               in a school, secular or religious. It is con- 
               <br />
               ceivable and easily conceivable that reli— 
               <br />
               gious education which is given in a school 
               <br />
               may be offensive to the conscience either 
               <br />
               of the Catholic minority or the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority if there is such a minority in 
               <br />
               that school. But when you come to secular 
               <br />
               matters it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerenzt.</span> And yet, Sir, in the 
               <br />
               manner in which secular education may be 
               <br />
               given, there may be something offensive to 
               <br />
               the conscience of the minority. There can be 
               <br />
               only one way <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> teaching arithmetic or 
               <br />
               grammar, and that cannot offend the con- 
               <br />
               science of any one. whether Protestant or 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic. But every one knows that 
               <br />
               it is not so in regard to the teaching of 
               <br />
               history. for instance. History may be 
               <br />
               taught in a manner which will be offensive 
               <br />
               to the Protestant minority or to the Catho- 
               <br />

               <br />
               of history the truth of which would not

               circumstances the minority may have cause 
               <br />
               for offence in the manner in which even 
               <br />
               secular education is given. and in that

               <br />
               the Roman Catholic church has always 
               <br />
               sought to have for herself the privilege of

               secular education as well as religious edu-

               <br />
               passed. the majority and the minority were 
               <br />
               given the privilege of having the education

               <br />
               to the minority the right of having a sepa-

               rate organization for the tuition of their 
               <br />
               own children. There were two systems of 
               <br />
               education established—a system for the 
               <br />
               Protestants and a system _for the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics. This condition existed for some 
               <br />
               years, but it was a cause of great friction, 
               <br />
               and it was ﬁnally changed by the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture, which passed an Act taking to the 
               <br />
               civil power the teaching of secular educa— 
               <br />
               tion and leaving religious education 
               <br />
               altogether apart. Now, this was a 
               <br />
               grievance to the minority. If you look at 
               <br />
               the correspondence which took place on 
               <br />
               this subject, you will ﬁnd that the removal 
               <br />
               of the peculiar arrangement which existed, 
               <br />
               and which permitted Roman Catholics to 
               <br />
               have the organization of their own schools, 
               <br />
               was the grievance which was felt by them 
               <br />
               with the greatest acuteness.‘ But the legis— 
               <br />
               lature thought otherwise. They were per- 
               <br />
               severing in their views, and they would 
               <br />
               not yield upon that point. Let me now 
               <br />
               explain the law which has been substituted 
               <br />
               for the law of 1875. As I said a moment 
               <br />
               ago, the characteristic feature of the pre— 
               <br />
               sent law, which was enacted to take the 
               <br />
               place of the law of 1875, is this, that the 
               <br />
               legislature has separated absolutely reli- 
               <br />
               gious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">education</span> ’from secular education. 
               <br />
               Secular education has been made by the 
               <br />
               legislature the sole privilege of the trustees 
               <br />
               in every district. Under the ordinance, 
               <br />
               chapter 29, which contains a new clause 
               <br />
               in substitution of the old law, the state 
               <br />
               does not pretend to have the slightest con- 
               <br />
               trol of religious education. At half past 
               <br />
               three in the afternoon the secular education 
               <br />
               is at an end, and then the trustees can 
               <br />
               come in and have whatever sort of religious 
               <br />
               education they desire. It may be the short-
