               of us on this side of the House would not 
               <br />
               have been astonished if we had seen the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Justice rise to disagree 
               <br />
               with ‘the right hom. gentleman, and to 
               <br />
               state that he was not entirely in accord 
               <br />
               with him; because rumour has been ban-

               <br />
               ister of Justice. But that is indicative 
               <br />
               only of the tempest that is raging or the 
               <br />
               ﬁre that is burning within those doors. 
               <br />
               There was a burst out on the 2lst day of 
               <br />
               February. when the Bill was introduced, 
               <br />
               and we have again had a burst out from 
               <br />
               the Minister et Justice in another way. 
               <br />
               But I must refer again to what the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman said, although the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Simcoe has referred to it. The hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice has stated that we 
               <br />
               have appealed to prejudice, that we have 
               <br />
               circulated petitions and have dragged in 
               <br />
               the creedal question. Sir, I have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">111</span> 
               <br />
               this House during the whole of this dis- 
               <br />
               cussion since this Bill was introduced, and 
               <br />
               I say that on every occasion on which it has 
               <br />
               been dealt with, it has been dealt with on 
               <br />
               this side irrespective of party, faction, sec- 
               <br />
               tion or creed. There has been no question 
               <br />
               raised upon which that charge could be 
               <br />
               visited upon any member on this side of 
               <br />
               the House. But it has been said that the 
               <br />
               action of bodies or associations of. persons, 
               <br />
               and of individual persons who 'have felt 
               <br />
               themselves aggrieved, and who are exer- 
               <br />
               cising their prerogative in appealing to 
               <br />
               parliament by petition, has been engineered 
               <br />
               and provoked from this side of the House. 
               <br />
               I would ask the Minister of Justice if he 
               <br />
               considers that the action of the Liberal 
               <br />
               papers in Ontario has been engineered by 
               <br />
               gentlemen on that side of the House—whe- 
               <br />

               <br />

               hen. gentlemen opposite, in opposition to 
               <br />
               this Bill. Would he like to take one horn 
               <br />
               of the dilemma or both? If we are res- 
               <br />
               ponsible for one, is it too much to say 
               <br />
               that they are responsible for the others ? 
               <br />
               Then. Sir, there is in this measure that 
               <br />
               which has provoked some questions from 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition to-day; and, 
               <br />
               without desiring or intending to take the 
               <br />
               time of the House longer than a few mo-

               ments to run over the ground, I would

               face to face with the utterances of the

               Prime Minister himself. On the 21st day 
               <br />
               of February there was transacted here an

               event for which this House had been wait-

               ing for some time. In the speech from 
               <br />
               the Throne we had read that the long-

               that the Bill Would be introduced, so far 
               <br />

               when asked if the Minister of the Interior
