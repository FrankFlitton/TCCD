               These reasons, strong and forcible as they

               were in 1884, are even stronger and more

               duty of parliament to make ample, even gen-

               <br />
               should be given to the new provinces. Our 
               <br />
               constitution, which is to be found in the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, contains a very 
               <br />
               remarkable provision. It contains the pro- 
               <br />
               vision that out of the Federal treasury 
               <br />
               there shall be paid to the provinces 
               <br />
               a large amount of money in the shape 
               <br />
               of subsidies to assist them in carrying on 
               <br />
               their business. This, I say, is a very extra- 
               <br />
               ordinary provision. It is, I believe. unique. 
               <br />
               At all events, so far as my information goes, 
               <br />
               I do not know that any similar provisiOn is 
               <br />
               to be found in the constitution of any other 
               <br />
               federal government. It is a sound principle 
               <br />
               of ﬁnance, and a still sounder principle of 
               <br />
               government, that those who have the duty 
               <br />
               of expending the revenue of a country 
               <br />
               should also be saddled with the responsi- 
               <br />
               bility of levying and providing it. That 
               <br />
               principle has been departed from in our 
               <br />
               case, and no doubt was departed from with 
               <br />
               some object. What can have been the rea- 
               <br />
               sons which induced the fathers of confed- 
               <br />
               eration in 1867 to depart from so obvious a 
               <br />
               principle of ﬁnance and government. The 
               <br />
               reasons are simply these. Confederation 
               <br />
               was the result of several compromises. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It</span> 
               <br />
               would have been impossible to establish it 
               <br />
               if there had not been a policy of give and 
               <br />
               take adopted among all the constituent 
               <br />
               bodies. And I am quite sure, I am speak- 
               <br />
               ing absolute historical truth when I say 
               <br />
               that neither Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               Ontario nor Quebec would ever have con- 
               <br />
               sented to part with their revenues, to give 
               <br />
               up their powers of taxation in customs and 
               <br />
               excise. if they had not been promised that 
               <br />
               out of the federal revenues they would be
