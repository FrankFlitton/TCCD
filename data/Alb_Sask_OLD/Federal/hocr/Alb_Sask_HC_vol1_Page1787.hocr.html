               nine schools were organized. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every</span> 
               <br />
               school organized by the Catholics since <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has:</span> 
               <br />
               been refused this privilege. There are now- 
               <br />
               150 schools organized and supported by 
               <br />
               Catholics that should be called Catholic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pub-\</span> 
               <br />
               lic schools. Only forty—nine appear <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now.</span> 
               <br />
               Why? Because that is all the remnant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               those established previous to the ordinance 
               <br />
               of 1901. All the others were refused, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> 
               <br />
               shown by the document I have just read, 
               <br />
               which emanates from the same authority 
               <br />
               that the Minister of Inland Revenue (Mr. 
               <br />
               Brodenr) has quoted. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘And</span> everybody who 
               <br />
               has been in the Northwest knows that these 
               <br />
               are the facts. Since 1901, the Catholics have- 
               <br />
               no right to establish a Catholic publie 
               <br />
               school. Yet, as I have said, there are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">150%</span> 
               <br />
               schools that should be known by that name.. 
               <br />
               I venture to say that nine-tenths of the 
               <br />
               Catholics of the Northwest Territories live 
               <br />
               in school districts in which they form a 
               <br />
               majority. And here we have the result—— 
               <br />
               not one more Catholic public or separate 
               <br />
               school to-day than four years ago. _And this. 
               <br />
               has been pointed to with pride by the Min— 
               <br />
               Fielding) as showing 
               <br />
               the disposition of Catholics not to organize 
               <br />
               more separate schools. When the law of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment it is hardly to be wondered at if you 
               <br />
               do not do exactly what you would like to 
               <br />
               do. As the Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier) has said, the effort has been to 
               <br />
               make the Catholics believe that they were 
               <br />
               receiving bread when they were being given 
               <br />
               a stone. The Prime Minister has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quoted</span> 
               <br />
               Bishop Legal. ‘De Canada,’ of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Montreal,</span> 
               <br />
               had for three weeks, under great headlines, 
               <br />
               a statement of the alleged opinion of Bishop 
               <br />
               Legal—because both parties in Quebec <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">still</span> 
               <br />
               like to use the name of a bishop, when it is 
               <br />
               to their own advantage. Bishop Legal was 
               <br />
               quoted as saying: We are satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               the school system of the Northwest, and we
