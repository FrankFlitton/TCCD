               wrong. and I think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">II</span> will be able to satisfy 
               <br />
               him of that. We are aware that the Ameri- 
               <br />
               cans have been patrolling the northern 
               <br />
               waters and that by their recent maps which 
               <br />
               I have seen they have given American 
               <br />
               names to some parts of the territory up there 
               <br />
               which I think are under British jurisdiction. 
               <br />
               We ought to provide against that. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend says that the best Way to provide 
               <br />
               against that is to organize a strong terri-

               <br />
               organized an expedition which has been 
               <br />
               tWo winters if not three in these northern 
               <br />
               waters. Mr. Low just returned last year 
               <br />
               from an expedition and another commander 
               <br />
               ——I forget his name—is now there to assert 
               <br />
               jurisdiction. He has planted the British 
               <br />
               ﬂag upon many parts of these northern 
               <br />
               territories, and his report is available now. 
               <br />
               This is the only way we can take jurisdic- 
               <br />
               tion in these distant lands. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               will agree with me that if we were to organ- 
               <br />
               ize a government, say of Athabaska, in order 
               <br />
               to reach these far away points we would 
               <br />
               have to go around the Mackenzie river and 
               <br />
               we could not ﬁnd a base of operation at the 
               <br />
               mouth of that river. We have to do it in 
               <br />
               two ways. So far as the territory imme- 
               <br />
               diately north of Mackenzie is concerned we 
               <br />
               can have a post of the Mounted Police at 
               <br />
               the mouth of the Mackenzie river, and with 
               <br />
               regard to the territory in the vicinity of 
               <br />
               Greenland and Baﬂ‘in Straits we can only 
               <br />
               reach it from the east as we are doing at 
               <br />
               the present time. We have, I think, done 
               <br />
               everything in order to anticipate'the objec- 
               <br />
               tion to which my hon. friend has called the 
               <br />
               attention of the House.- We cannot allow the 
               <br />
               Americans to take possession of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> lands; 
               <br />
               we claim them to be British territory and we 
               <br />
               intend to assert our jurisdiction over them. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Another question is, alto why we in- 
               <br />
               cluded Athabaska in these new provinces. 
               <br />
               We have done so because a portion of the 
               <br />
               district of A-thabaska is altogether differ-

               Mackenzie and the districts of 'Keewatin

               <br />
               Athabaska is fair agricultural land; all
