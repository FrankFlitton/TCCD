               appears to be unable to answer the argument

               troducing these extraneous matters. It is

               quite true that there is a discrepancy be-

               tween city constituencies and rural constitu- 
               <br />
               encies, but that has always been the case. 
               <br />
               The province of Alberta has practically the 
               <br />
               same conditions all over its extent; it has 
               <br />
               a few small towns but no large cities and no 
               <br />
               great urban populations as we understand 
               <br />
               it in this part of Canada. The city of Ed- 
               <br />
               monton in the north and Calgary in the 
               <br />
               south are both small cities compared with 
               <br />
               the large cities of eastern Canada. But even 
               <br />
               in the eastern constituencies we have no 
               <br />
               such discrepancies as the minister would 
               <br />
               lead us to think. What constituency in this 
               <br />
               part of Canada has ﬁfteen times as great a 
               <br />
               voting population as another constituency? 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman proposes to give two 
               <br />
               members to Athabaska which accordingto 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister’s own ﬁgures has only 342 
               <br />
               voters while the town of Calgary with 2,653 
               <br />
               voters only gets one member. A voter in 
               <br />
               Athabaska will have ﬁfteen and a half times 
               <br />
               as much power as a voter in Calgary. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman further goes on to say there 
               <br />
               is only 10 per cent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diiference</span> between the 
               <br />

               <br />
               are only 1,710 half-breeds and white people. 
               <br />

               <br />
               should these 342 voters, 90 per cent of whom
