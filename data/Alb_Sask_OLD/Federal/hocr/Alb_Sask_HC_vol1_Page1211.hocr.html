               North Toronto (Mr. Foster), a number of

               reports have been made as to that country

               very valuable information to have before

               the attempt to withhold these lands from the 
               <br />

               <br />
               withheld, we desire to know what compen- 
               <br />
               sation is to be given to the new provinces 
               <br />
               for them. I have been endeavouring to 
               <br />
               figure out just what was allowed to the 
               <br />
               province of British Columbia for the 20-mile 
               <br />
               strip on either side of the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway track, which was alienated for 
               <br />
               railway purposes by the Dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and, according to my ﬁgures, I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that there is annually paid to the province 
               <br />
               of British Columbia the sum of $100,000 for 
               <br />
               lands that were handed over to the Cana— 
               <br />
               dian Paciﬁc Railway. Estimating the area 
               <br />
               of that 20—mile strip on either side of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway track, we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               this $100,000 is paid to the province of Brit- 
               <br />
               ish Columbia for practically only 13,000,000 
               <br />
               acres, whereas, in the new provinces, we are 
               <br />
               not getting one-quarter the compensation, 
               <br />
               and even when our population is doubled 
               <br />
               we do not get one-half. What I desire to point 
               <br />
               out is that the land in the province of Brit- 
               <br />
               ish Columbia is land taken along the rail- 
               <br />
               way track. a great part of it in country 
               <br />
               which is practically worthless, and yet a 
               <br />
               much more liberal allowance is made to the 
               <br />
               province of British Columbia for thatland 
               <br />
               which was taken away'from it than is being 
               <br />
               made by the present administration for 
               <br />
               land that is just as much taken away from 
               <br />
               the provinces of Alberta and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatchewan“</span> 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd that these ﬁgures for the area of this 
               <br />
               land in British Columbia work out as fol- 
               <br />
               lows. taking the line as straight between 
               <br />
               the different points: Stephen to Beaver foot. 
               <br />
               22 miles; Beaver foot to Beaver mouth, 42
