               so that the argument based upon that point 
               <br />
               was scarcely worth the time it took to state 
               <br />
               it. It was within the right of the Manitoba 
               <br />
               government to choose their own time and 
               <br />
               the time chosen was that of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">approaching</span> 
               <br />
               creation of provinces in the west. Then 
               <br />
               they pressed their claim and I say that was 
               <br />
               an opportune time. The right hou. gentle- 
               <br />
               man tried to make something out of the 
               <br />
               fact that he stated his policy with reference 
               <br />
               to the extension of Manitoba’s boundaries 
               <br />
               on February 2lst, and that therefore there 
               <br />
               was no reason at all for any person no 
               <br />
               matter what his position to attempt to gain 
               <br />
               inﬂuence for any purpose over the Manitoba 
               <br />
               government by holding out to them the idea ‘ 
               <br />
               that their territories might be enlarged. I 
               <br />
               take issue with my right hon. friend in that 
               <br />
               respect. He did not state in detail the policy. 
               <br />
               of. the Dominion government with reference 
               <br />
               to the extension of those Territories. He 
               <br />
               simply stated that they did not propose to 
               <br />
               extend those Territories until after con— 
               <br />
               ference with other provinces, and that steps 
               <br />
               would be taken at once or as soon as con- 
               <br />
               venient to call the representatives of the 
               <br />
               different provinces that might be interested 
               <br />
               to come together and to talk this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter‘</span> 
               <br />
               over. It would have been possible to extend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i</span> 
               <br />
               the Manitoba boundaries to the northwest, 
               <br />
               to the north or to the northeast at any time; 
               <br />
               these districts were all perfectly open and 
               <br />
               they lay there with all their possibilities. 
               <br />
               Let us come to one other point, to the very 
               <br />
               small point that was taken to—day that 
               <br />
               Monseigneur Sbarretti did not see Mr. 
               <br />
               Rogers, he did not know Mr. Rogers, he had 
               <br />
               no conversation with Mr. Rogers, and that 
               <br />
               therefore the whole argument was against 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers. My right hon. friend must 
               <br />
               have taken leave of his senses. Was 
               <br />
               the Hon. Colin Campbell down here on a 
               <br />
               private pleasure trip ? Was he down here 
               <br />
               as a private citizen ? He was down here' 
               <br />
               with his colleague Mr. Rogers as a delega- 
               <br />
               tion of the Manitoba government backed 
               <br />
               by the resolutions of their legislature as 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial as any commission could be made. 
               <br />
               They were here on an ofﬁcial visit and for 
               <br />
               an ofﬁcial occasion and it does not matter 
               <br />
               a single bit as to whether this conference 
               <br />
               was had with Mr. Rogers or Mr. Campbell.

               Mr. Speaker, the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man did not consult the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior who represented the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories, who was their sole 
               <br />
               representative in the cabinet in reference to 
               <br />
               the educational clauses of the Bill, but he 
               <br />
               sits in abject silence and allows me to state 
               <br />
               here in the House endorsed by that silence 
               <br />
               that he did care to consult the Papal delegate 
               <br />
               here in Ottawa. The right hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               government did not consult the hon. Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Finance (Mr. Fielding). Will the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman tell me now whether 
               <br />
               he consulted on that educational clause more 
               <br />
               frequently the one than the other, his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Post-</span> 
               <br />
               master General or the Papal ablegate '? 
               <br />
               Why all this trouble and talk in the country 
               <br />
               because Monseigneur Sbarretti goes to the
