               confederation the more we appreciate the 
               <br />
               spirit which guided its fathers. They were 
               <br />
               nation-builders, the men who sat at the con-

               ference of Quebec. Their vision of the 
               <br />
               future extended much beyond the union of 
               <br />
               the four original provinces. They foresaw 
               <br />
               that, in the years to come, the existence of

               Before I proceed any further, let me ex-

               More so, now that the vexed French shore

               <br />
               and France. It seems to me that nothing

               stands in the way to prevent the union of

               would indeed be remiss to their duty if 
               <br />
               they did not grapple and overcome the ob—

               As I said, a moment ago, the granting of 
               <br />
               autonomy to the Northwest Territories has 
               <br />
               been received with favour by the country 
               <br />
               at large. Long ago, it was felt, that if 
               <br />
               ever the tide of immigration would turn 
               <br />
               our way it would never recede. The tide 
               <br />
               is on us—more especially since the last ﬁve 
               <br />
               or six years—and from all parts of the 
               <br />
               world, immigration is pouring so to say, 
               <br />
               towards the new promised land of western 
               <br />
               Canada. With a population of half a mil— 
               <br />
               lion inhabitants; with the expectation of 
               <br />
               doubling that ﬁgure before many years have 
               <br />
               elapsed; having fairly passed the period of 
               <br />
               infancy, it was but just and fair that the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories should be given the 
               <br />

               I insist however on two points: 1. The

               Northwest Territories have been acquired 
               <br />

               of the debate, it is well to bear in mind 
               <br />
               those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁve</span> peculiar features of the situation.

               <br />
               two features of the Bill, to say a word or 
               <br />
               two concerning the division of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories into two provinces. This is 
               <br />
               one of Mr. Haultain's <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grievances~but</span> from 
               <br />
               all appearances, it seems to be a personal 
               <br />
               grievance. Is it because. as future premier 
               <br />
               of one of the provinces, he will command less 
               <br />
               inﬂuence? That, I would not venture to 
               <br />
               say. But be it a personal grievance or not, 
               <br />
               the fact remains that the division of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories into two provinces is 
               <br />
               in accord with public opinion all over Can- 
               <br />
               ada. Sir, we are legislating for the future 
               <br />
               whilst Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Haultain—if</span> his views on this 
               <br />
               question were adopted—would bind us to 
               <br />
               the present only. Moreover, we live in a 
               <br />
               confederation. Should not the history of 
               <br />
               other confederacies be an object lesson to 
               <br />
               us? The danger may be remote, but do 
               <br />
               you not agree with me, Mr. Speaker, that 
               <br />
               by carving two provinces out of that im-

               mense western territory, the balance of 
               <br />

               tributed as among all the others ? At the
