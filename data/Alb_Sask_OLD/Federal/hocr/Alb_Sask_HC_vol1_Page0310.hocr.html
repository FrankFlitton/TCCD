               ment says so, it means a great majority of 
               <br />
               the people of this country, Liberals as well 
               <br />
               as Conservatives, the independent thinking 
               <br />
               people on both sides of politics, are of the 
               <br />
               opinion that the government is doing wrong. 
               <br />
               But, says the government, we are in for ﬁve 
               <br />
               years anyway and what matters it ? Well, 
               <br />
               I say to them that the ﬁve years will go by. 
               <br />
               They may hold themselves in power for ﬁve 
               <br />
               years, but when the election comes the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of Canada will do as the people of Lin- 
               <br />
               coln county did four years after the 
               <br />
               pledge of the Prime Minister was broken 
               <br />
               and on which pledge they returned a sup- 
               <br />
               porter -of his to this House. The chief whip 
               <br />
               of the Reform party held the constituency 
               <br />
               of Lincoln by a majority of nearly 500, but 
               <br />
               the government broke its pledges as to pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights, as on every other question, 
               <br />
               and the people of the county of Lincoln 
               <br />
               punished the government because of its 
               <br />
               broken pledges, and a man of no greater 
               <br />
               ability than your humble servant was elect- 
               <br />
               ed and the chief whip of the Reform party 
               <br />
               was left at home. As the people of Lincoln 
               <br />
               county did in that instance, so shall the 
               <br />
               people of the Dominion do when they get 
               <br />
               the opportunity. It may be that the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister will retire from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office</span> before an 
               <br />
               appeal is again made to the electorate; it

               may be that the Minister of Finance or the 
               <br />
               statesmanlike Postmaster General will make
