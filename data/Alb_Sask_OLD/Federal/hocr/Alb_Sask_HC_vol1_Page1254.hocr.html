               House during the present session with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">res«</span>

               pect to the awarding of tenders upon an

               advertisement which gave very short not- 
               <br />
               ice and which practically was equivalent 
               <br />
               to no advertisement at all. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acting</span> 
               <br />
               Minister of Public Works (Mr. Hyman) then 
               <br />
               admitted that the contention of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Simcoe (Mr. Bennett) was cor- 
               <br />
               rect, and that a new advertisement should 
               <br />
               be issued in order that intending tenderers 
               <br />
               might have reasonable notice. According 
               <br />
               to the information which is now before the 
               <br />
               House in connection with the present mat- 
               <br />
               ter, it appears upon the statement of the 
               <br />
               secretary of the department that a con- 
               <br />
               tract has been awarded, and when he is 
               <br />
               asked with regard to the advertisement he 
               <br />
               returns no answer whatever. At all events 
               <br />
               the gentlemen who are interested in the 
               <br />
               matter and who have been Watching for 
               <br />
               an advertisement have not been able to ob- 
               <br />
               serve any. It is quite possible that 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman may have 
               <br />
               been misinformed as to the answer he 
               <br />
               gave, but that is- only a triﬂing cir- 
               <br />
               cumstance compared with the real ques- 
               <br />
               tion which is: That a very large con- 
               <br />
               tract for wire fencing between Canada 
               <br />
               and the United States along the boundary 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories, has been 
               <br />
               awarded without giving any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opportunity</span> 
               <br />
               whatever to those engaged in the business 
               <br />
               to tender for it. This matter will have to 
               <br />
               be discussed again when the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has had an opportunity of look- 
               <br />
               ing into it, but it is a very strong indication 
               <br />
               to him that he should have followed at an 
               <br />
               earlier date the advice of hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               on this side of the House, and appointed 
               <br />
               a Minister of the Interior Without that 
               <br />
               delay which did occur. There have been 
               <br />
               some very curious proceedings in connec— 
               <br />
               tion With this matter. I will not dwell upon 
               <br />
               it to-day, because it is only right that the 
               <br />
               government should have an Opportunity Of 
               <br />
               stating the facts and making their position 
               <br />
               plain before the House. I venture to think, 
               <br />
               as the writer of one of these letters says, 
               <br />

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SAM.</span> HUGHES There are several 
               <br />
               very curious coincidences in connection 
               <br />
               with this matter. First, I draw the at- 
               <br />
               tention of the Prime Minister to the fact 
               <br />
               that we have no evidence that any tenders 
               <br />
               were called for this enormous work. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rSup-</span> 
               <br />
               pose we take it as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">7-14</span> miles from the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               meridian to the ﬁfth meridian, and assum— 
               <br />
               ing that part of the boundary is in Manitoba, 
               <br />
               we would have in round numbers, 700 miles 
               <br />
               to be fenced or a total of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">224,000</span> rods which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> a nice tidy little contract for some gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen to get without any rivals being allow— 
               <br />
               ed to tender. lSecond: We have the as- 
               <br />
               tounding spectacle of the secretary of the 
               <br />
               department some time ago informing a ﬁrm 
               <br />
               that wished to put in a tender—a ﬁrm that 
               <br />
               is well known throughout the length and 
               <br />
               breadth of Canada as a wire fence company 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»—we</span> have the secretary of the department 
               <br />
               informing this ﬁrm that the contract_ has 
               <br />
               been let, and a few days afterwards the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Prime</span> Minister stands up in his place in 
               <br />
               the House—having received information I 
               <br />
               dare say from the same department—to 
               <br />
               state that the contract has not been let, but 
               <br />
               that the matter is under consideration. Here 
               <br />
               is another surprising little coincidence, and 
               <br />
               let me call the attention of the First Min- 
               <br />
               ister to it. In looking to ‘Hansard’ to 
               <br />
               see the exact terms of the Prime Minister's 
               <br />
               answer, we ﬁnd that the whole question and 
               <br />
               the whole answer is deliberately—I will 
               <br />
               not say deliberately in the sense that they 
               <br />
               are intentionally left out—but the whole 
               <br />
               matter is undoubtedly left out ot‘ ‘Han- 
               <br />
               sard.’

               Mr. SAM. HUGHES. I do not accuse 
               <br />
               the First Minister. I think that, bad as he is 
               <br />
               he would be above that. The answer that was 
               <br />
               given here was undoubtedly furnished by 
               <br />
               the Department of the Interior, and the 
               <br />
               peculiar coincidence is that the question 
               <br />
               and answer are deliberately left out of 
               <br />
               ‘Hansard ’ the next morning. I am drawing 
               <br />
               this matter to the attention of the First 
               <br />
               Minister. Would it be too much to ask 
               <br />
               him to ﬁnd out how many of his present 
               <br />
               or past colleagues in this House are inter-

               ested in ranching along the American bor-
