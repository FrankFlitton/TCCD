               insinuate that we on this side have not

               legal argument of the leader of the opposi-

               that up beyond saying that we are all proud 
               <br />
               of the leader of the opposition. We feel 
               <br />
               that we have one man here who is not only 
               <br />
               able to take care of himself, but able to 
               <br />
               sustain the combat on any question that 
               <br />
               comes before this House, legal or other—

               <br />
               gentleman on the opposite side. He has 
               <br />
               proved this to be the case in the past, and 
               <br />
               I venture to say that he will continue to 
               <br />
               show in the future that it is still the case. 
               <br />
               Then we have the member for North To— 
               <br />
               ronto (Mr. Foster) whom I have no hesita-

               <br />
               dreaded in the past, but never more than 
               <br />
               at the present time. This is shown by the 
               <br />
               very fact that in the past on two occasions 
               <br />
               when he was defeated, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> put forth every 
               <br />
               effort of the government, not only by their 
               <br />
               voice and by means that are not too clear 
               <br />
               or too fair, but they put forth their money 
               <br />
               bags, which they sent to all parts to ac- 
               <br />
               complish the work to an extent that is detri- 
               <br />
               mental to the best interests and to the mor— 
               <br />
               ality of this country. My hon. friend who 
               <br />
               has just sat down (Mr. Beland) tried to 
               <br />
               make a point out of the fact that they are 
               <br />
               more liberal in Quebec than in other prov- 
               <br />
               inces. They may be, looking at it from a 
               <br />
               religious point of view, but when we look 
               <br />
               at it from a political point of view we 
               <br />
               must know that there are some reasons why 
               <br />
               there are only 12 Conservatives from that 
               <br />
               province. The Conservatives have about 
               <br />
               100,000 votes in Quebec while the Reform- 
               <br />
               ers have only about 130,000, and notwith- 
               <br />
               standing that there were only 11 Conser— 
               <br />
               vatives returned and 54 Reformers, prov- 
               <br />
               ing beyond a doubt that there was some 
               <br />
               work going on behind the scenes that was 
               <br />
               not of a religious nature. I might point to 
               <br />
               the liberality of Ontario. In the Conser- 
               <br />
               vative government of the province of On— 
               <br />
               ario, one of the strongest governments the 
               <br />
               province ever had, there is for the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               time as Minister of Public Works a French 
               <br />
               Canadian, and we have as Minister of Crown 
               <br />
               Lands a Roman Catholic, both men worthy 
               <br />
               of the positions and we the Conservatives of 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario were pleased be— 
               <br />
               yond degree when we saw the choice which 
               <br />
               the present premier, Hon. Mr. Whitney, had 
               <br />
               made. I ask you to point to such liber- 
               <br />
               ality under any other circumstances and I 
               <br />
               venture to say that if I had the vote here 
               <br />
               it would be found that so far as their re— 
               <br />
               presentatives are concerned the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics have received a fair share of the 
               <br />
               vote according to their numbers in the prov- 
               <br />
               ince of Ontario, particularly in connection 
               <br />
               with the Conservative party. In looking 
               <br />
               over the votes we ﬁnd that in all cases they 
               <br />
               have had a larger representation in the

               overlapped; they have not been well deﬁned

               and great injustice has on many occasions

               been done in consequence. Look, for ln-

               stance, at our railways, look at the conﬂict

               <br />

               the jurisdiction of the different parliaments

               in that respect should be well deﬁned. We

               ﬁnd that hon. gentlemen were discussing

               matters in connection with these grievances

               great question of the Bill which is before

               <br />

               <br />
               the attention of the people of Canada will 
               <br />
               be diverted from the other great questions

               <br />
               be too carefully considered. It is my opin-

               <br />
               west or east, and then we would have had 
               <br />
               one province west of that, making two in 
               <br />

               <br />
               I shall endeavour to show why this injustice
