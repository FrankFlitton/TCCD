               which I intend to take is that there is no

               tion and the amendment thereto, of which 
               <br />
               notice has been given In this House; that, 
               <br />
               in substance and in principle, they are prac- 
               <br />
               tically the same. I say that I do not in- 
               <br />
               tend to deal with the constitutional aspect 
               <br />
               of these clauses, because I intend to rest 
               <br />
               my position upon the argument put forward 
               <br />
               in this House by the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               have conﬁdence, and especially do we have 
               <br />
               conﬁdence in his legal opinions; therefore, 
               <br />
               I feel satisﬁed to rest my case in respect 
               <br />
               to this feature of the Bill upon his judg- 
               <br />
               ment. Sir, my premises will be that this 
               <br />
               parliament is not called upon to make what 
               <br />
               I believe to be an amendment to the consti- 
               <br />
               tution by forcing these educational clauses 
               <br />
               upon these provinces, and in that respect 
               <br />
               creating a constitution for them. I say that 
               <br />
               this parliament is not called upon to legis- 
               <br />
               late in this manner, and that it is pursuing 
               <br />
               an unconstitutional course in doing so. 
               <br />

               In discussing this Bill, many questions 
               <br />
               have been- introduced which have no bearing 
               <br />
               upon the issues before us. The Quebec situ- 
               <br />
               ation has been more than once, more than 
               <br />
               twice, more than a hundred times, referred 
               <br />
               to and dwelt upon by members of this 
               <br />
               House, sometimes in- order, and sometimes 
               <br />
               out of order, I think. In dealing brieﬂy with 
               <br />
               this matter, I would refer in passing to the 
               <br />
               speech of the hon. member for Labelle (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bourassa), a Speech which I could not but re. 
               <br />
               gard as inﬂammatory and as one which does 
               <br />
               not correctly represent the views of the
