               sentimental relations will be favourable to

               Canada and to the British empire. We 
               <br />
               have heard a great deal of imperalism in 
               <br />
               this country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“lot</span> long ago noble senti-

               for Victoria and Haliburton (Mr. Sam. 
               <br />
               Hughes), and certainly there is something 
               <br />
               which appeals to the intelligence of every 
               <br />
               Canadian in the word ‘imperalism’ owing 
               <br />
               to the debt of gratitude we owe and of the 
               <br />
               continued gratitude which we expect to 
               <br />
               entertain for the British empire. I believe 
               <br />
               that for many years to come, for the present 
               <br />

               ism which we can offer to the British em-
