               is one of the most cynical arguments that

               has been used so far. We have the testi-

               ordinances abolishing separate schools were 
               <br />
               passed in the Northwest. a protest was 
               <br />
               made. The member for Brandon—I do not

               know if it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> a moment of forgetful-

               <br />
               drawn into the dangerous abyss in which 
               <br />
               some gentlemen opposite are having such

               a ﬁne time these days—but the member for 
               <br />
               Brandon said the protest came from the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic clergy and in order to con- 
               <br />
               vince us. he immediately gave the opinion 
               <br />
               of two of the most eminent laymen of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories; two fathers of 
               <br />
               families, two representatives of the people, 
               <br />
               one the Lieutenant Governor to-day and 
               <br />
               the other a judge of the Supreme Court. 
               <br />
               These were the members of the hierarchy 
               <br />
               quoted by the hon. member from Bran— 
               <br />
               don. Tnese gentlemen came here and they 
               <br />
               said: ‘An injustice has been done us; we 
               <br />
               are deprived of the right of giving to our 
               <br />
               children the education which our conscience 
               <br />
               binds us to give; our money is taken for 
               <br />
               the support of schools we cannot attend.’ 
               <br />
               But, they were sent away from Ottawa; 
               <br />
               they were not numerous enough probably 
               <br />
               to obtain justice. Then they went to the 
               <br />
               provincial assembly and again they laid 
               <br />
               their case at the foot of the Crown—as the 
               <br />
               Crown was represented there—and again 
               <br />
               they Were found to be too weak and too 
               <br />
               few. Because they did not rebel in arms, 
               <br />
               because they accepted the established state 
               <br />
               of things; a state of things which was a 
               <br />
               breach of the compact, a state of things 
               <br />
               which in the words of Sir John Thompson 
               <br />
               and the words of the member for Brandon, 
               <br />
               constituted a legal encroachment upon their 
               <br />
               rights; because they did not rebel in arms; 
               <br />
               because they followed the advice that has

               always been given by the hierarchy to the 
               <br />
               Catholics of this country to be peaceful;

               stands in the position of a father having 
               <br />
               two sons, big Peter and little Paul. He 
               <br />
               gives <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">334</span> to big Peter and $2 to little Paul 
               <br />
               and he says: ‘Now, boys, agree together,

               <br />

               <br />
               the street big Peter gets after little Paul, 
               <br />
               beats him and takes $1.50 of his two dol- 
               <br />
               lars. These gentlemen opposite stand up 
               <br />
               and say: Don't tyrannize big Peter; but 
               <br />
               force little Paul to give Peter the 50 cents 
               <br />
               he has left. And hon. gentlemen on this

               dragged into provincial limits just now. 
               <br />
               Now, Sir, there is another subject which is 
               <br />
               much talked of in the public press, but 
               <br />
               which has not been treated of in this House 
               <br />
               and I think one voice at least should be 
               <br />
               raised in parliament to protest against it. 
               <br />
               It is said : ‘ Admitting that the constitution 
               <br />
               allows you to grant separate schools to the 
               <br />
               Northwest, yet you should not fasten upon 
               <br />
               these people such a bad system of educa- 
               <br />
               tion which has made of Spain. of Italy. of 
               <br />
               France, of all Catholic countries. the scum 
               <br />
               ot“ the earth.’ And we are told: Look at 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec, look at _the south 
               <br />
               of Ireland. a degraded population, a low- 
               <br />
               minded ignorant people. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I propose to deal for a few moments with 
               <br />
               the subject of Catholic education, with what 
               <br />
               it has done for the world. in what way it 
               <br />
               has succeeded and why it has not always 
               <br />
               succeeded. Here again I am tempted to 
               <br />
               ask: What kind of history is taught in the 
               <br />
               public schools of this country? I know 
               <br />
               as well as any man. and I have learned to 
               <br />
               know in the Catholic schools where I was 
               <br />
               educated. that there is such a thing as the 
               <br />
               evolution of nations. that nations in our own 
               <br />
               age as well as nations in the past. and as 
               <br />
               well as nations to come for all time. have 
               <br />
               and will have their periods of prosperity. 
               <br />
               and their days of decadence.
