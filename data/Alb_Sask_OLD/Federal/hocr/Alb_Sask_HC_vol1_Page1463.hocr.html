               different feeling that would be from that 
               <br />
               which will arise when they look at the

               us, we are not permitted to have them or

               administer them. There is something in 
               <br />
               the pride of a country as in the pride of a 
               <br />
               man. The settler who goes to northern On- 
               <br />
               tario and takes up 160 acres of land, is told : 
               <br />
               You may have this land, but of all the tim- 
               <br />
               ber standing up on it you shall not have 
               <br />
               one stick except what you need to build 
               <br />
               your house and barn. And‘he feels: This 
               <br />
               is not my farm ; I haVe the surface soil, but 
               <br />
               What grows upon it does not belong to 
               <br />
               me. And is he satisﬁed? No, he is not 
               <br />
               and will not be. He has not the pride of 
               <br />
               a man who owns What he uses. The same 
               <br />
               pride and the same energy that ownership 
               <br />
               inspires would give more intense life to

               feature of the argument was that which 
               <br />
               laid great stress on the assumption that the 
               <br />
               people of the west were deprived of their 
               <br />
               control of the timber, lands and minerals 
               <br />

               nership of the Dominion. The people of 
               <br />
               the west are citizens of the Dominion, and 
               <br />
               the ownership of these lands by the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion is not less ownership by the west 
               <br />
               than if that ownership rested with the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial government. I think it is a pity

               that, in the stress of argument in this

               way which the hon. member (Mr. Foster) 
               <br />
               has at command. It would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> most unfor-

               tunate if the people of the west should be 
               <br />
               educated into the idea that in any way 
               <br />
               they were not citizens of the Dominion,

               the properties of the Dominion, as they cer- 
               <br />
               tainly do. It matters not so much whether 
               <br />
               these properties are administered by the

               been taken so persistently by our friends 
               <br />
               on the other side of the House. They insist 
               <br />
               on treating this question of ownership of 
               <br />
               the lands and dealing with the lands as a 
               <br />
               matter of revenue rather than of as a 
               <br />
               matter of development. Now, in my esti- 
               <br />
               mation that is where they are absolutely 
               <br />
               at variance with the whole spirit of the 
               <br />
               west. The spirit of the west is that, whe- 
               <br />
               ther these lands are given away or sold, 
               <br />
               or whatever shall be done with them, the 
               <br />
               object and aim shall be the development of 
               <br />
               those resources, the bringing of those re- 
               <br />
               sources into active use; the main object is 
               <br />
               not to derive a sum of money for their 
               <br />
               sale.
