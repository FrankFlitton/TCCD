               a great many years ago ? Have not these

               people of the Dominion to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">come</span> along to 
               <br />
               them and say: We entered into a solemn 
               <br />
               obligation With the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way twenty-ﬁve years ago that they were 
               <br />
               to be exempted from taxation in your coun— 
               <br />
               try, and now the time has come to erect you 
               <br />
               as provinces, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{we</span> are going to dump the 
               <br />
               load on you. Let us look into the matter 
               <br />
               from that point of view, and I say that the 
               <br />
               government cannot justify the discharge of 
               <br />
               the obligation they owe to the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway by imposing it on these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, and I also bring out this view now 
               <br />
               that here is a confession in this House by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice of the supremacy of 
               <br />
               parliament to do anything it likes in regard 
               <br />
               to the creation of new provinces; that we 
               <br />
               are not bound by the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. They are asserting the rig-ht to impose 
               <br />
               limitations on the provinces in regard to 
               <br />
               their municipal taxation, and they are im- 
               <br />
               posing other limitations on the provinces in 
               <br />
               a way they should not. I was glad to hear 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition ('Mr. R. L. Bor— 
               <br />
               den) endorse whavt Manitoba is doing. It is 
               <br />
               within the competence of these new pro— 
               <br />
               vinces to tax these railways on their income, 
               <br />
               and they have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:further</span> power even—they 
               <br />
               can tax one company more than another. 
               <br />
               The cure may come in this way, that the 
               <br />
               two new provinces—and I advise them to 
               <br />
               do it at the ﬁrst session—may put a tax on 
               <br />
               the earnings of the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way unless the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               agree to surrender this advantage that they 
               <br />
               have. And let us just see what it is. Here 
               <br />
               is the original clause, which I shall read 
               <br />

               the Minister of Justice admit that this is a

               fair to respect the contract contained in the

               <br />
               Justice that there is as good a contract in 
               <br />

               <br />

               between the Dominion and the Canadian

               choose as to which contract has the most 
               <br />
               sanctity, I say that the original contract 
               <br />
               between the Dominion and the provinces is 
               <br />
               the one that has the senior position in that 
               <br />
               regard, and I say that parliament ought to 
               <br />
               leave this clause out. There is nothing man- 
               <br />
               datory even in the contract that we shall re- 
               <br />
               impose this, or if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> is anything manda- 
               <br />
               tory it is that we must respect provincial 
               <br />
               rights in this case; and if the cure is not 
               <br />
               effected in one way, it shall be in another. 
               <br />
               It is all very well to give us lawyers’ 
               <br />
               opinions, as has been done in this House. 
               <br />
               Let me recall to the people and to this House 
               <br />
               an instance bearing on this. In Ontario not 
               <br />
               long ago the attention of the Attorney Gen— 
               <br />
               eral was called to the existence of a certain 
               <br />
               pool-room nuisance in my own constituency. 
               <br />
               The Attorney General went into the law 
               <br />
               and said: The law is this, and I am power- 
               <br />
               less; I can do nothing, but I am obeying 
               <br />
               the law. He said: That is the law ; just 
               <br />
               as we are told here to-day: This is the 
               <br />
               law. But a change of government took 
               <br />
               place, another Attorney General comes in, 
               <br />
               and he says : This is the law. He enforces 
               <br />
               the law, and the result is altogether differ- 
               <br />
               ent. What is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerence</span> between these 
               <br />
               two legal opinions ? Lawyers do not always 
               <br />
               agree, in fact they differ all the time. As I 
               <br />
               said before, you can get as many opinions 
               <br />
               as you care to pay out fees; and if that 
               <br />
               is the case, the people of the province, as 
               <br />
               their rights are deﬁned in this solemn con- 
               <br />
               tract, the British North America Ac't, ought 
               <br />
               to be defended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">10-day</span> from the imposition 
               <br />
               that is being put upon them ; and again I 
               <br />
               call the attention of the Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
               when he talks about vested rights, to the 
               <br />
               fact that the government is to-day putting 
               <br />
               on the statute-book a statute which enables 
               <br />
               the Dominion government to evade its obli- 
               <br />
               gation and to impose it upon these two 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">small</span> provinces in the west. If that is the 
               <br />
               case, I say it is not good law ; it is not the 
               <br />
               constitution ; it is not respecting sacred 
               <br />
               rights, and I trust the Prime Minister will 
               <br />
               give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘me</span> some credit for, perhaps—although, 
               <br />
               not being a lawyer, because I do not profess 
               <br />
               to be one, and I thank God I am not one— 
               <br />
               but I hope he will give me credit for saying 
               <br />
               something in the interest of the settlers, 
               <br />
               and bringing to the notice of parliament a 
               <br />
               grievance that can be cured in Spite of the 
               <br />
               opinions of lawyers. There is a way to cure 
               <br />
               .these grievances, and they can be cured 
               <br />
               without doing injustice to anybody.
