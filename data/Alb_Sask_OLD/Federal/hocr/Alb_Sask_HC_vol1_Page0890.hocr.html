               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Oliver) was unfair to Ontario in making 
               <br />
               these comparisons. He told us that when 
               <br />
               each of these new provinces has a population 
               <br />
               of 2,000,000 they will receive a revenue from 
               <br />
               the Dominion of $2,200,000. But they will 
               <br />
               not have their own Crown lands, their 
               <br />
               timber or their minerals, and they will have 
               <br />
               to resort to direct taxation. Hence it is that 
               <br />
               I claim that the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver) tried to create a Wrong impression 
               <br />
               in the west when he made these statements. 
               <br />

               In the west we will have three provincial

               <br />
               judicial systems and three provincial sub— 
               <br />
               sidies, where two under each department 
               <br />
               would be plenty. We have too much gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in Canada as it is now, and the idea 
               <br />
               of multiplying unnecessary governments 
               <br />
               should not be encouraged. However, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, the Bill was presented for its 
               <br />
               second reading, and, in the interim the press, 
               <br />
               the pulpit, and the platforms of this country 
               <br />
               had been educating public opinion on the 
               <br />
               question, and the draughtsman of the Bill 
               <br />
               saw it was best to change the wording of 
               <br />
               this clause pertaining to education. This 
               <br />
               change in the education clause has had the 
               <br />
               desired effect of apparently bringing the 
               <br />
               party together again, but there has not been 
               <br />
               a man of them who has succeeded in ex-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,to</span> attempt an explanation of them. Carlyle

               deliberately rebel against anything that does 
               <br />
               not deserve rebelling against.’ So with the 
               <br />
               people of Canada. If they did not feel that 
               <br />
               this Bill was an imposition upon their rights, 
               <br />
               they would not be rebelling against it as 
               <br />
               they are doing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> They do feel that 
               <br />
               the government are forcing legislation on 
               <br />
               those provinces that should not be forced 
               <br />
               upon them, and that they are perfectly 
               <br />
               justiﬁed in rebelling against that legisla— 
               <br />
               tiOll. Some government members have said 
               <br />
               that the people of Ontario are intolerant on 
               <br />
               this question. I want to say to these hon.

               <br />
               of Ontario when they speak of them as an 
               <br />
               intolerant people. The people of Ontario 
               <br />
               are a most tolerant people, a people who 
               <br />
               have readily and willingly and gladly given

               <br />
               everything they possess. The ministers
