               <br />
               with respect to the boundaries of these new 
               <br />
               provinces. When a proper time comes, when 
               <br />
               we take up the consideration of the various 
               <br />
               clauses in committee, I shall, perhaps, ex~

               <br />
               boundaries, I should like to state that my 
               <br />
               view is that the ideal division of the west- 
               <br />
               ern prairies is two provinces including the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba. I think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> while 
               <br />
               that is the ideal division of this Western 
               <br />
               country, the opportunity to realize it was 
               <br />
               lost a good many years ago. I will also 
               <br />
               state that if it was possible to make a divi- 
               <br />
               sion now—which it is not, because there are 
               <br />
               vested rights there, and hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite who insist that these people 
               <br />
               who are living in eastern Assiniboia

               <br />
               the people of the Northwest what kind of 
               <br />
               school system they will have—I say, if it 
               <br />
               were possible to have two provinces in the 
               <br />
               western country including the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, it would be desirable to move the 
               <br />
               boundaries down below to the 60th parallel. 
               <br />
               I think the time is coming with that vast 
               <br />
               territory beyond the 56th or 57th parallel 
               <br />
               when it will be ﬁtted for a new prov- 
               <br />
               ince. I do not agree with the opin— 
               <br />
               ion of certain gentlemen that the terri- 
               <br />
               tory up there is useless territory. I regret 
               <br />
               that some of my hon. friends on this side of 
               <br />
               the House have expressed that view. This 
               <br />
               is not a true view according to my convic- 
               <br />
               tion. I am one of those who believe that 
               <br />
               the zone of production is moving very rapid- 
               <br />
               ly northward. In 1818, the United States 
               <br />
               government appointed a commission to in— 
               <br />
               quire into the agricultural resources of 
               <br />
               Illinois. You would hardly believe it, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, but that commission reported un- 
               <br />
               favourably on the agricultural resources of 
               <br />
               that great state. It is not more than twentY- 
               <br />
               ﬁve or thirty years since it was impossible 
               <br />

               I believe the time will come when three or

               <br />
               Edmonton they will be producing wheat; 
               <br />
               proﬁtably. I had the pleasure. a year ago, 
               <br />
               of listening to a very interesting address, in 
               <br />
               St. Paul, Minnesota. by a very eminent 
               <br />
               agricultural specialist of the United States. 
               <br />
               He stated that he had made a thorough ex- 
               <br />
               amination of our great western country and 
               <br />
               was convinced-that we have in that country 
               <br />
               both climate and soil conditions favourable 
               <br />
               to the proﬁtable production of fall wheat 
               <br />
               two hundred miles north of the town of 
               <br />
               Edmonton. Therefore I think that if it had 
               <br />
               been possible to create two provinces in that 
               <br />
               western country and to have brought the 
               <br />
               boundary below the 60th parallel, it would 
               <br />
               have been the ideal division of that territory. 
               <br />
               But as I have already stated, the opportunity 
               <br />
               for that is past,—it is now impossible to re— 
               <br />
               alize that idea]. The people there do not 
               <br />
               want to go into the province of Manitoba. I 
               <br />
               regret that, because I think that Manitoba 
               <br />
               is not after all, a very bad province to live 
               <br />

               Now, with respect to the boundaries of the 
               <br />
               province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Manitoba, I would like to state 
               <br />
               that that province has been very unfortunate 
               <br />
               indeed. In 1811, the old district of Assim- 
               <br />
               boia, which is now part of the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, contained within its borders a 
               <br />
               large tract of country below the 49th parallel 
               <br />
               of latitude. "he International Commission 
               <br />
               appointed for the purpose of ﬁxing the inter- 
               <br />
               national boundary deprived us of certain 
               <br />
               territory down there. Many years after- 
               <br />
               wards, and some twenty years ago, the 
               <br />
               courts decided that we were not entitled to 
               <br />
               certain districts of territory east of our 
               <br />
               present boundaries, and the province of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(9n-</span> 
               <br />
               tario took from us through the courts about 
               <br />
               75,000 square miles of territory. We were 
               <br />
               unfortunate also in having a government 
               <br />
               ruling the destinies of this country about 
               <br />
               twenty years ago who did not rise to the 
               <br />
               situation and extend the boundaries of the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba westward. If that 
               <br />
               had been done, if the boundary could have 
               <br />
               been at about the location of the present 
               <br />
               city of Regina. and a new province made 
               <br />
               beyond that. we would have the ideal condi- 
               <br />
               tion as to boundaries, I think. Now, while 
               <br />
               it is impossible, according to my view, to 
               <br />
               have the boundaries extended westward, 
               <br />
               there is a possibility, there is a certainty— 
               <br />
               I feel quite sure in making the statement—- 
               <br />
               that we shall have our boundaries extended 
               <br />
               northward. We have the right to this, if
