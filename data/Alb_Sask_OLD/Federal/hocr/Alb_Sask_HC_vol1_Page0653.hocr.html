               the government will not be in a position to

               accidental, but that the evidence shows that 
               <br />
               there was a desire to stiﬂe an expression 
               <br />
               of opinion by the people of the west, and 
               <br />
               to prevent them presenting their case before 
               <br />
               the government of Canada. The draft Bill 
               <br />
               submitted by Mr. Haultain deals with ﬁnan— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cial</span> questions and general <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutional</span> 
               <br />
               questions alone, and there was an absolute 
               <br />
               omission from it of any reference to the 
               <br />
               school question. Did the government point 
               <br />
               out to him that there was this omission, 
               <br />
               and did they tell him that they were going 
               <br />
               to deal with the question themselves? 
               <br />
               Nothing of the kind. The right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man did everything he possibly could to 
               <br />
               stave off public discussion, and through the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior announced that it 
               <br />
               would be a matter of conference and discus- 
               <br />
               sion between the two high contracting parties 
               <br />
               but when it came to the crux he stiﬂed 
               <br />
               discussion. When the Prime Minister wrote 
               <br />
               to Mr. Haultain on the eve of last election, 
               <br />
               did he tell Mr. Haultain that he had 
               <br />
               changed his idea with regard to the school 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> and that he intended to bring it 
               <br />
               into the arena of Dominion politics ? Not a 
               <br />
               bit of it. On the contrary, he wrote to Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain that he would have on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of parliament a larger number of represent- 
               <br />
               atives <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{from</span> the west, and that the other ques- 
               <br />
               tions involved would be considered. The 
               <br />
               right .hon. gentleman is very fond of boast- 
               <br />
               ing that he has a mandate from the people, 
               <br />
               but where is his mandate from the people on 
               <br />
               this question, a question which, above all 
               <br />
               others, requires that the voice of the elec-
