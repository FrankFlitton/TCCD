               the minority in the Northwest any of their

               in this House and the country. That is not 
               <br />
               my position. I have advocated leaving to 
               <br />
               the people of the Northwest Territories the 
               <br />
               power to deal with this question because 
               <br />
               I believe it is the right way to deal with it 
               <br />
               under the constitution. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> have said that if 
               <br />

               <br />
               the rights of the minority to any extent 
               <br />
               to which they may see ﬁt I regard that as 
               <br />
               a matter with which they are to deal and I 
               <br />
               have not one word of criticism to offer in 
               <br />
               regard to their action in that respect. That 
               <br />
               is my position. It seems to me that it is a 
               <br />
               plain and deﬁnite position, but I do not 
               <br />
               understand the argument and the position 
               <br />
               of those who say that there are pledges 
               <br />
               which ought to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> regarded as sacred and 
               <br />
               which ought to be maintained and who at 
               <br />
               the same moment stand up and vote against 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Labelle and my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Beauharnois when they seek 
               <br />
               to enact legislation which would carry out 
               <br />
               those pledges. Some criticism has ‘been 
               <br />
               uttered in regard to my own position. It is 
               <br />
               said that I am too technical. that I pay too 
               <br />
               much regard to the constitution, that you 
               <br />
               must look at the constitution not in the light 
               <br />
               of the exact words which are employed or 
               <br />
               in the light of the legal meaning which is to 
               <br />
               be attached to these words, but that you must 
               <br />
               look at it in some broader, wider and more 
               <br />
               generous light. I do not know where limi- 
               <br />
               tations or qualiﬁcations of that kind would 
               <br />
               lead us. That is my difﬁculty. You must 
               <br />
               in the end determine by some rule what the 
               <br />
               constitution means, and I venture to say 
               <br />
               that in so far as the interests of minorities 
               <br />
               in this country are concerned it is very much 
               <br />
               safer to adhere I_to the true spirit and 
               <br />
               meaning of the constitution than to de- 
               <br />
               part from it. If' an invasion of the con- 
               <br />
               stitution is demanded or is granted to—day 
               <br />
               in the interest of the minority in this coun- 
               <br />
               try, who shaii know to what extent a de- 
               <br />
               mand of that kind may be made at some 
               <br />
               time in the future on behalf of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the/majo‘rity</span> 
               <br />
               in this country? For example, would we 
               <br />
               all be quite willing that the complete and 
               <br />
               unlimited power of dealing with the British 
               <br />
               North America Act should be conferred 
               <br />
               upon this parliament? There may be a 
               <br />
               good deal of question as to whether or not 
               <br />
               all of us would concur in that view, and yet, 
               <br />
               as far as the constitution of these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces is concerned, that is a view which 
               <br />
               has been impressed by the government upon 
               <br />

               wisest course in the interests of either the 
               <br />
               majority or the minority in this country. It 
               <br />
               is not the wisest course surely in the interest 
               <br />
               of the minority because we do not know at 
               <br />
               what moment a test of that kind may be 
               <br />
               applied as against them ; it is not the wisest 
               <br />
               course in the interest of the majority, be- 
               <br />
               cause i-t is not in their interest that there 
               <br />
               should be any dissatisfaction raised by 
               <br />
               efforts of that kind which may in the end 
               <br />
               tell against the welfare of the country. I 
               <br />
               did not ﬁnd myself able last night to vote 
               <br />
               for the motion of my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Labelle; I do not ﬁnd myself able to—night 
               <br />
               to vote for the motion of my hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bergeron), but if it were simply a question 
               <br />
               of choice I am not sure that I would not 
               <br />
               prefer either one or the other of these to the 
               <br />
               amendment suggested by the government. 
               <br />
               For the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasons</span> which I have already given 
               <br />
               I am Opposed to both, and I shall therefore 
               <br />
               be obliged to vote against the motion of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Beauharnois as I have 
               <br />
               already voted against that of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Labelle.
