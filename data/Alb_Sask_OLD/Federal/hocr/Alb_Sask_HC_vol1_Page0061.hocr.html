               and that on that account the boundaries 
               <br />
               of Manitoba will not be extended. Because 
               <br />
               that province happens to be ruled at pre-

               sent by a Conservative government and 
               <br />
               because that government will not alter the 
               <br />
               school policy to suit the wishes of support- 
               <br />
               ers of the right hon. gentleman. we are 
               <br />
               to be denied our just request for an exten— 
               <br />
               sion of our boundaries. 1 bring this mat— 
               <br />
               ter to the attention of the House because 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman may not be aware 
               <br />
               of the extent to which the discussion of 
               <br />
               this question is carried in the journals of 
               <br />
               the west. 1 have even seen that reason

               Well, if we are to be treated in this way, 
               <br />
               we ought to know it. The right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman has never yet given this House any 
               <br />
               reason why the request of Manitoba for an 
               <br />
               extension of its boundaries should not be 
               <br />
