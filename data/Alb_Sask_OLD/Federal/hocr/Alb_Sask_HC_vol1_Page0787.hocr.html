               Then, I come to the question of religious 
               <br />
               teaching which has so often been referred 
               <br />
               to in this House. It is permissible to open 
               <br />
               the school with the Lord’s Prayer and it 
               <br />
               is also permissible after half past three 
               <br />
               in the afternoon to have religious instruc- 
               <br />
               tion. But that can only be given in case 
               <br />
               the parents themselves petition for it and 
               <br />
               the trustees consent to it. In such case a 
               <br />
               minister or a priest may teach from half 
               <br />
               past three to four o’clock, but it is specially 
               <br />
               provided that any scholar may absent him- 
               <br />
               self from such teaching if his parents so 
               <br />
               desire, and also that any scholar who may 
               <br />
               be proﬁcient in religious teaching shall not 
               <br />
               have his marks counted to his advantage 
               <br />
               in the general total. We also ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               university which they have by recent legis- 
               <br />
               lation decided to establish in the Northwest 
               <br />
               shall be strictly non-sectarian in principle 
               <br />
               and that no religious dogma or creed shall 
               <br />
               be taught and no religious test shall be 
               <br />
               required of any student or other person, so 
               <br />
               that, as I pointed out, the system in vogue 
               <br />
               in the Canadian Northwest is not only a 
               <br />
               non-sectarian system, but I might also say 
               <br />
               a system that is practically divorced from 
               <br />
               religious teaching.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There is a small number of separate 
               <br />
               schools in the Canadian Northwest and that 
               <br />
               number is not increasing notwithstanding 
               <br />
               the fact that the Roman Catholic population 
               <br />
               has been growing. In 1898 there were 509 
               <br />
               public school districts established in the 
               <br />
               Canadian Northwest. Last year this num- 
               <br />
               ber had increased to 1,235, or, in other words 
               <br />
               it had become just two and a half times as 
               <br />
               great as it was six yeras ago. Has there 
               <br />
               been a corresponding increase in the number 
               <br />
               of separate schools ? Let us see. In 1898 
               <br />
               there were 14 separate school districts, 
               <br />
               and in 1904, 16 separate school districts, 
               <br />
               and if I am rightly informed but 12 
               <br />
               of these are in operation and but 10 
               <br />
               of these are Roman Catholic separate 
               <br />
               schools. If we look into the character of 
               <br />
               these Roman Catholic separate schools we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that eight of them are to be found in 
               <br />
               municipalities of considerable size where 
               <br />
               there are already other schools established 
               <br />
               and where the existence of two schools to- 
               <br />
               gether is in no wise a detriment to educa- 
               <br />
               tion. Further, by reference to page 129 of 
               <br />
               the annual Northwest Territory report for 
               <br />
               1903 we ﬁnd that every one of these eight 
               <br />
               separate schools has a certiﬁcated teacher

               <br />
               that if this legislation that the govern- 
               <br />
               ment is now proposing in the form of 
               <br />
               the amended clause 16 should pass, it would 
               <br />
               be but the entering wedge for the gradual 
               <br />
               establishment of a complete dual system of 
               <br />
               schools in the Canadian Northwest. I think 
               <br />
               the history of schools and of education in 
               <br />
               the Canadian Northwest denies that proposi- 
               <br />
               tion. I knoW it is extremely difﬁcult for 
               <br />
               the separate schools at the present time 
               <br />
               existing to keep .pace with the requirements 
               <br />
               —that the struggle which it is necessary for 
               <br />
               them to make is hardly commensurate with 
               <br />
               the returns they secure from it, and it is 
               <br />
               highly improbable if this legislation is per- 
               <br />
               mitted to continue that the number of sep-

               arate schools in the Canadian Northwest 
               <br />

               As one intersted in Canadian education

               some of its problems, in endeavouring to

               <br />

               Northwest diminished the educational excel-

               lence that might otherwise be attained, then 
               <br />
               I would feel strongly constrained not to

               perpetuate a system which was calculated 
               <br />
               to fall below the general average of educa- 
               <br />
               tion. But my fears in that respect would 
               <br />
               be absolutely groundless, I believe. The 
               <br />
               more I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.examine</span> into the existing system

               in the- Northwest, the more I am con-

               vinced that it is one of the most efﬁcient 
               <br />
               systems to be found anywhere in Canada. 
               <br />
               I have been endeavouring to make certain 
               <br />
               tests of. this system in order to ﬁnd out, by 
               <br />
               the rules we are accustomed to apply in 
               <br />
               other provinces, whether educational efﬁci- 
               <br />
               ency in the Northwest is all that may be de— 
               <br />
               sired. We speak, for instance, of the per- 
               <br />
               centage of certiﬁcated teachers, and I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that in 1903 only ﬁve per cent'of these 
               <br />
               teachers in the entire Canadian Northwest 
               <br />
               were teaching on temporary permits without 
               <br />
               certiﬁcates, and although 250 new teachers 
               <br />
               ﬂocked in there last year the percentage of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">uncertiiﬁcated</span> teachers is now only seven 
               <br />
               per cent. I believe the best provinces we 
               <br />
               have, educationally speaking, are Manitoba 
               <br />
               and Ontario, but they cannot make any 
               <br />
               such showing as this, while in the province
