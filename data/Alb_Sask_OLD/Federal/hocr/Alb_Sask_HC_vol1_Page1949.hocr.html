               <br />
               the 3rd of November last. The enumerators 
               <br />
               who drew up those lists were government 
               <br />
               employees of the administration here at Ot-

               within a month of the drawing up of the

               the population of the Northwest is changing

               making the distribution. A distribution has 
               <br />
               been made based, it seems to me, if it was 
               <br />
               based on anything at all, on the vaguest and 
               <br />
               most sanguine estimates of the prospective 
               <br />
               population of the northern part of the pro-

               prospective population of the southern por— 
               <br />
               tion of the province. This distribution prac- 
               <br />
               tically gives double the representation, man 
               <br />
               for man, to the newer population who are 
               <br />
               going into the newer country which is being 
               <br />
               opened up to the north. That population is 
               <br />
               composed largely of late arrivals who do not 
               <br />
               understand the political questions of the

               <br />
               as all men who go into a new country are, 
               <br />
               in getting started, to study these questions 
               <br />
               and to form personal opinions upon them. 
               <br />
               And over this population it cannot be doubt- 
               <br />
               ed that the Dominion government exercises 
               <br />
               a considerable amount of inﬂuence. Only 
               <br />
               half the representation to which they are 
               <br />
               entitled on a fair distribution is apparently 
               <br />
               given to the older settlements of the south

               extraordinary discrepancies in individual

               <br />

               <br />
               cast in the district of Saltcoats. That is to

               <br />
               in the old district of Saltcoats, and a voter 
               <br />
               in Redberry exercises as much inﬂuence 
               <br />
               as seven in the district of South Qu'Appelle.
