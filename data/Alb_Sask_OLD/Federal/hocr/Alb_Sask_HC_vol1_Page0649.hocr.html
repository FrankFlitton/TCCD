               ernment's policy, and he has now an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity to do so. If on Monday he introduces 
               <br />
               the other Bill and states his policy, we shall 
               <br />
               then be in a position to discuss the two Bills 
               <br />
               intelligently. In the meantime no interest 
               <br />
               can suffer if this Bill is not dealt with at 
               <br />
               once.
