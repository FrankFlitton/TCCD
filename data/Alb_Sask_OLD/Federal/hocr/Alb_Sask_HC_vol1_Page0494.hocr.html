               correct record of some of the things that had 
               <br />
               taken place and putting him in the very

               <br />
               told us that he had great pity for the North— 
               <br />
               west Territories—no Minister of the Interior, 
               <br />
               not a friend in the government and all the

               members from the Northwest dumb and 
               <br />
               muzzled. Within ﬁve minutes after making 
               <br />
               that assertion he made the assertion that 
               <br />
               the terms granted to the Territories by these 
               <br />
               Bills were so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good,</span> were so liberal, were so 
               <br />
               magnanimous that they would bring every

               other province knocking at the door of the 
               <br />

               Territories had not any member in the gov— 
               <br />

               <br />
               ernment and if the Northwest members did 
               <br />
               not do anything to help the Territories, they 
               <br />
               have not fared very badly according to that

               On that occasion he was very anxious that 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               longer the Minister of the Interior. Why ? 
               <br />
               Simply because we members from the west 
               <br />
               know better than any other class of men in 
               <br />
               this country just what the Northwest Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories and what Canada has lost by that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman not being a member of the 
               <br />
               government. I had the pleasure of going 
               <br />
               to that western country in 1878, just in the 
               <br />
               month that Sir John Macdonald came into 
               <br />
               power, and I know what the conditions were. 
               <br />
               We know what their rule was for eighteen 
               <br />
               long years. We saw the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway built through that country, we saw 
               <br />
               thousands and millions of dollars expended, 
               <br />
               we saw thousands and thousands of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work</span> 
               <br />
               men brought into that country and we saw 
               <br />
               hundreds of thousands of dollars expended 
               <br />
               per annum in bringing in immigrants. What 
               <br />
               was the result? The government of Sir 
               <br />
               John Macdonald spent money with a lavish 
               <br />
               hand in bringing in immigrants but they 
               <br />
               passed laws and regulations of such a 
               <br />
               nature and carried them out in such a man- 
               <br />
               ner that they drove the people out of the 
               <br />
               country. That was the result of their ad- 
               <br />
               ministration for eighteen long years. But, 
               <br />
               in 1896 a brighter day dawned for Canada 
               <br />
               and especially for the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               and if ever the right hon. leader of the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment did one good day’s work for Can— 
               <br />
               ada he did it on the day that he appointed 
               <br />
               the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cliﬂord</span> Sifton as the member of 
               <br />
               his cabinet representing the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. What has taken place since that 
               <br />
               day about eight years ago ? The whole his-

               tory and the whole development of that

               House, I may say that at that time we had 
               <br />
               four members in this House from the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. In 1901, when the census 
               <br />
               was taken, we were entitled to six mem- 
               <br />
               bers, and I have no doubt that the House 
               <br />
               of Commons here thought they were doing 
               <br />
               a very generous act, as in fact they were, 
               <br />
               when they gave us ten members instead of 
               <br />
               six. But, if we had representation by popu- 
               <br />
               lation in this House the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories would be represented by not ten mem- 
               <br />
               bers but by ﬁfteen. Whatever advantage 
               <br />
               obtained for the Northwest in 
               <br />
               the past has been brought about largely by 
               <br />
               the active and energetic work of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex-Min-</span> 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior. And, Sir, I am sure I 
               <br />
               will meet with the approval of every mem- 
               <br />

               Mr. TURRIFF. I would say further, that 
               <br />
               the lion. member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               is too young a man and too able a man 
               <br />
               that Canada should lose his services. It is 
               <br />
               our hope, we Liberals at all events, that 
               <br />
               the country will be able to avail itself of 
               <br />
               his services before long, and that in 
               <br />
               the interests of the whole Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada we shall long retain him. 
               <br />
               When the hon. member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster) was recently ﬁshing for 
               <br />
               information, he talked about dangling 
               <br />
               the portfolio of the Interior, and sena- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">torshilps,</span> before the members from the 
               <br />
               Northwest in order to get their support for 
               <br />
               this Bill. Let me tell him that there is no 
               <br />
               member from the west who is not supporting 
               <br />
               this Bill on its merits, and the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man (Mr. Foster) went very far astray when 
               <br />
               he made the assertion to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'which</span> I have re- 
               <br />
               ferred. But, of course, he ought to know; 
               <br />
               he has been in the government and he has 
               <br />
               been out of the government and he went 
               <br />
               back into the government and he probably
