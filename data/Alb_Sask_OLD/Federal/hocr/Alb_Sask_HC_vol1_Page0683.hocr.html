               the view that we should have an absolutely

               <br />
               past three in the afternoon. Then there is 
               <br />
               a provision for religious instruction from 
               <br />
               half-past three p.m. to four o’clock, and 
               <br />
               there is a provision that where there is a 
               <br />
               public school, the minority, Protestant or 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic, may organize a separate 
               <br />
               school, but every separate school is subject 
               <br />
               absolutely to all the foregoing conditions and 
               <br />
               is in every sense of the term a public school. 
               <br />
               I think I am right in saying that the mean- 
               <br />
               ing of the amended Bill, is: that the pro— 
               <br />
               vince shall have exclusive jurisdiction in 
               <br />
               regard to education but the province cannot 
               <br />
               deprive the minority of the right to this 
               <br />
               religious instruction from half-past three in 
               <br />
               the afternoon until four o’clock. Now, Sir, 
               <br />
               we are going to have in that country, in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place, a national school; a school in 
               <br />
               which as these ordinances provide there 
               <br />
               should be only one language, the English 
               <br />
               language, except in regard to an elementary 
               <br />
               class in French. These schools in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories are therefore more truly 
               <br />
               national schools than the schools in the pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba, because we ﬁnd in the 
               <br />
               Manitoba School Act a provision for bi- 
               <br />
               lingual schools similar to the provisions we 
               <br />
               have in Ontario, and there is no provision of 
               <br />
               that sort in the Northwest Territories ordi- 
               <br />
               nances. It would then appear that the 
               <br />
               whole objection centres down to the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of this one half hour of religious in- 
               <br />

               <br />
               diiference of opinion as to that. A great
