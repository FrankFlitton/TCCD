               actness what he said in that letter. He 
               <br />
               said: We want to have the Intercolonial 
               <br />
               reach up to the great lakes of Canada and 
               <br />
               acquire a portion of the great western trafﬁc 
               <br />
               which is rapidly increasing. Then he 
               <br />
               added: ‘If any gentleman in this country 
               <br />
               knows of any better way to accomplish that 
               <br />
               than by acquiring the Canada Atlantic, it 
               <br />
               will be in order for him to take the ﬂoor.’

               So, I have pointed out to my hon. friend

               to the bench of Nova Scotia and the other 
               <br />
               elevated to the very important position of

               <br />
               Blair, formerly Minister of Railways, were 
               <br />
               of opinion that it is absolutely essential to

               certainly was the direction of his argu-

               part of its great system, and, in the next

               <br />
               Why, the thing is inconceivable—to give the

               Grand Trunk Railway power to acquire the 
               <br />

               <br />
               part of its great system, and then to pass 
               <br />
               a Bill which shall have the effect of de- 
               <br />
               claring that that action was absolutely 
               <br />
               meaningless and nonsensical. My hon.

               I am speaking on the matter at some length

               in order to place our position correctly in 
               <br />
               the mind of my hon. friend, who seems to 
               <br />
               think that we have some set purpose of de—

               <br />
               everything we desire by permitting this Bil-l

               an important question, in the government

               Bill about to be introduced. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend has referred to our policy with 
               <br />
               regard to the Canada Atlantic. Well 
               <br />
               we have made it pretty plain, I think, 
               <br />
               during last session and the session before. 
               <br />
               I frankly avowed in this House on both oc- 
               <br />
               casions that I thought it would be in the 
               <br />
               interest of this country to extend the Inter- 
               <br />
               colonial to the shores of the Georgian bay. 
               <br />
               [ went further than that, but it is sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               for my present purpose to call attention to 
               <br />
               the fact that I did take that position, and 
               <br />
               I do not recede from it now. I did not com- 
               <br />
               mit myself absolutely to effecting that 
               <br />
               extension by means of the Canada Atlantic. 
               <br />
               I said that upon certain data which I pre- 
               <br />
               sented to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House with regard to the 
               <br />
               earning power of the Canada Atlantic, I 
               <br />
               believed so far as I was able to obtain 
               <br />
               information, that it would be a good thing 
               <br />
               for the country to acquire that road; but I 
               <br />
               said if the government, after due examina- 
               <br />
               tion, should come to the conclusion that the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial could be extended to the 
               <br />
               shores of the Georgian bay by some better 
               <br />
               means, I would be prepared to acquiesce in 
               <br />
               that conclusion if it commended itself to my 
               <br />
