               talking with one of the western Liberal 
               <br />
               members one day. I expressed my admir- 
               <br />
               ation of the Minister of Justice and said 
               <br />
               what a clever gentleman I thought him 
               <br />
               to be. This hon. gentleman replied: Yes. 
               <br />
               he is just a little bit too clever. Perhaps 
               <br />
               they thought the hon. Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
               being so clever, would be able to inclose 
               <br />
               in Autonomy Bill No. 2, certain veiled sen- 
               <br />
               tences, certain legal clauses that to the 
               <br />
               laymen from the prairies of the west look- 
               <br />
               ed insigniﬁcant. but to the Minister of Jus— 
               <br />
               tice and the right hon. Prime Minister meant 
               <br />
               a good deal more than the gentlemen from 
               <br />
               the west thought they did. I may say 
               <br />
               that is my opinion of this Bill. I believe 
               <br />
               it gives all that was intended to be given 
               <br />
               in Autonomy Bill No. 1, and in conver- 
               <br />
               sation with Mr. Haultain. the premier of 
               <br />
               that western country. that view received 
               <br />
               conﬁrmation. I must say that I think Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain is one of the cleverest men in 
               <br />
               the Dominion of. Canada to-day. There 
               <br />
               are few men his equal in ability. He 
               <br />
               says that Autonomy Bill No. 2 gives more 
               <br />
               than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Autonomy</span> Bill No. 1 intended to give, 
               <br />
               and I notice that in an interview in the 
               <br />
               Toronto papers, Mr. Haultain carries out 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contention.</span> I think he is right. I 
               <br />
               am a layman. I am not a lawyer and I am

               glad of it. I am pleased to say that.

               addition to what was proposed to be given 
               <br />

               <br />

               of section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">14</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Territories 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 in regard to separate schools. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Under</span> the statutes of 1875 there grew up in 
               <br />
               the Territories a system of separate schools 
               <br />
               and of dual language entirely conducted by 
               <br />
               the clergy. The speech of the hon. mem— 
               <br />
               ber for Brandon will prove that assertion. 
               <br />
               There were separate schools in the most 
               <br />
               objectionable form. When the kick was

               <br />
               duced the amendment under discussion. The 
               <br />
               amendment proposed says that nothing in 
               <br />

               <br />
               sult is that the original Bill re-enacts a part 
               <br />
               of section 14 of the statute of 1875, and the 
               <br />
               amendment probosed does not change it, 
               <br />
               because it provides that section 41 of the 
               <br />
               ordinance, chapter 29 which is identical 
               <br />

               <br />
               statute of 1875, shall not be interfered with. 
               <br />
               It is only a play on words; all the provisions 
               <br />
               of the ordinances are simply matters ot regu-

               and so are not incorporated in the Act as 
               <br />
               amended. Now then, Mr. Speaker, for these 
               <br />
               reasons <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I,</span> claim that the second Bill gives 
               <br />
               all that it is contended would have been 
               <br />
               given in the ﬁrst place. I have heard this 
               <br />
               discussed from day to day in this House, 
               <br />
               and I have never yet heard the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice stand up to say that such is not 
               <br />
               the case. For my part I would like very 
               <br />
               much to see the Minister of Justice stand 
               <br />
               up in this House and tell us if the second 
               <br />
               Bill simply means the one half hour’s teach- 
               <br />
               ing in these schools in the west.’ I would 
               <br />
               like to hear him give it that interpretation 
               <br />
               if it be correct, but I doubt very much that 
               <br />
               he will do so. We were told by the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) in his speech, 
               <br />
               that this Autonomy Bill was never intended 
               <br />
               to give to the Northwest provinces anything 
               <br />
               more than they have now in the matter of 
               <br />
               education, and he said that it was the fault 
               <br />
               of the draughtsman who drew that Bill that 
               <br />
               it included, as the hon. gentleman said, the 
               <br />
               greatest church endowments that ever were 
               <br />
               given in the world. It was the fault of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               draughtsman, he said, that ashare of $50.- 
               <br />
               000,000 worth of public school lands were 
               <br />
               given to these separate schools which were 
               <br />
               to have all the characteristics of church 
               <br />
               schools. Well, the Minister of Justice has 
               <br />
               since admitted that he was the draughtsman, 
               <br />
               so that I presume he must be the man to 
               <br />
               take the blame. But what I want to know 
               <br />
               is, who it was that the member for Brandon 
               <br />
               meant when he stated in this House that 
               <br />
               the draughtsman was to blame. I have in

               <br />
               I will not say one word that could be in any
