               <br />
               Elgin (Mr. Ingram) is a very fair one. The

               <br />
               ment what they think of this amendment. 
               <br />
               As to the meaning of the amendment, 1 
               <br />
               think my hon. friend (Mr. Lamont) has ex-

               plained it so as to remove all ambiguity.

               a question upon Which we are not likely to

               favour that policy will continue to favour it,

               We have taken a position from the start.

               came to consider the clause as it was ﬁrst

               in doubt as to what was assured to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               passed in 1901, which are the law of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories to—day—conceding 
               <br />
               that our intention was to perpetuate the law 
               <br />
               as it exists to-day—every ambiguity is re-

               moved. We know exactly where we are. 
               <br />
               The position at the present time is that there

               <br />
               amendment I have proposed. Under that 
               <br />
               law as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘it</span> exists to-day, the majority may 
               <br />
               establish what is called a public school. The 
               <br />
               minority in the district, whether Protestant 
               <br />
               or Roman Catholic, if they are not satisﬁed 
               <br />
               with the treatment they receive from the 
               <br />
               majority, may establish a separate school. 
               <br />
               From the opening of the school up to half- 
               <br />
               past three o’clock the education given is 
               <br />
               absolutely secular, and absolutely under the 
               <br />
               control of the board of education of the 
               <br />
               province, in every particular—not only in 
               <br />
               the public schools but in the separate schools 
               <br />
               as well. It has been contended by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) and also 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend from Beauharnois (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bergeron) and others that in this respect 
               <br />
               the provisions of the organic law of 1875 has 
               <br />
               been departed from. That may be—I do not 
               <br />
               dispute that or consider that point at this 
               <br />
               moment. So far as religious instruction is 
               <br />
               considered I believe that the law of 1901 is 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accordance</span> with the law of 1875,—that 
               <br />
               is, that the majority of the ratepayers in a 
               <br />
               district can have such religious teachings as 
               <br />
               they see ﬁt. So far as the secular education 
               <br />
               is concerned these schools may be called 
               <br />
               national. but so far as religious education 
               <br />
               is concerned, they may be called denomi- 
               <br />
               national. because trustees who represent 
               <br />
               the people of the locality are at liberty under 
               <br />
