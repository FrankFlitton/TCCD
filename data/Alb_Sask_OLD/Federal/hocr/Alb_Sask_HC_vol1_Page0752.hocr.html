               people has been stiﬂed and that the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest are being treated as child- 
               <br />
               ren. The hon. member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               says that they are being treated as if they 
               <br />
               were in swaddling clothes and without in- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Northwest Territories, as free electors will 
               <br />
               appreciate such words indicating that they 
               <br />
               do not know their own business. Surely, 
               <br />
               in the next election to take place in the

               people of the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now then, with regard to the power of 
               <br />
               this parliament to pass this law I think there 
               <br />
               can be no question whatever. Under the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, 1871, eXpress 
               <br />
               power was given to this parliament to create 
               <br />
               out of the Territories new provinces con- 
               <br />
               taining such provisions for the constitution 
               <br />
               and administration of such provinces and 
               <br />
               for the passage of laws for the peace, order 
               <br />
               and good government of the provinces, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> this parliament might see ﬁt. I contend 
               <br />
               that under this Act this parliament has 
               <br />
               full jurisdiction to create these provinces, 
               <br />
               and inasmuch as we have full power to 
               <br />
               create these provinces, I say we should not 
               <br />
               involve them at the outset in a great law- 
               <br />
               suit in order to determine what rights they 
               <br />
               possess under the new constitution, but we 
               <br />
               should take pains now to express them as 
               <br />
               clearly as we can. I can readily under- 
               <br />
               stand that the creation'of lawsuits and 
               <br />
               constitutional difﬁculties has been part of 
               <br />
               the political capital of hon. members op- 
               <br />
               posite in the past, and that they would no 
               <br />
               doubt like to continue that policy in the 
               <br />
