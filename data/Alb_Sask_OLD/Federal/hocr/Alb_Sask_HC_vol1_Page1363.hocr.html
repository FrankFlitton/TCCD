               which has been brought up by my hon. 
               <br />

               <br />

               tract which was given last year for the 
               <br />

               <br />
               appears that this contract was .let by my 
               <br />
               lamented colleague, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sutherland.</span> I would 
               <br />
               be slow to believe that Mr. Sutherland who 
               <br />
               was a very careful man did any-thing which 
               <br />
               was not in accordance with the law. Not

               <br />
               thing which has been done was not quite 
               <br />
               according to law. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">une</span> law provides to—day 
               <br />
               that all work which involves an expendi- 
               <br />
               ture of more than $5.000 should be given 
               <br />
               by public tender and contract. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend says it is time we should take up 
               <br />
               this matter, but he must know that we have 
               <br />
               already taken it up. We wanted to be 
               <br />
               doubly sure, and so the law enacted this 
               <br />
               session provides that not only tenders 
               <br />
               should be invited but that individual min-

               tenders will have to be invited. That is

               for an initial work which eventually 
               <br />
               amounted to about $10,000. I would be

               slow to believe that Mr. Sutherland in his

               <br />
               given, it was found that a small additional

               more than one week ago a letter containing
