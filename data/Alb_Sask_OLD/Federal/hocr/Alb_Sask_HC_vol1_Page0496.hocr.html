               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’l‘Ulkllili‘I".</span> The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Marquette (Mr. W. J. Roche) took a ﬂing at 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ext-Minister</span> of the Interior because he 
               <br />
               had not said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anything</span> about the extension of 
               <br />
               the boundaries of Manitoba. The eX-Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior knows better than the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Marquette that the rights 
               <br />
               of the province of Manitoba are absolutely 
               <br />
               safe in the hands of the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man who leads the government at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time, and that it was not necessary 
               <br />
               for him to have anything at all to say about 
               <br />
               that. The other day, when the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Calgary (Mr. M. S. McCarthy) was criti— 
               <br />
               cising the government for the manner in 
               <br />
               which it divided the country into two pro— 
               <br />
               vinces. he claimed that the line of division 
               <br />
               should have been sixty miles further east. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that my hon. friend is a great 
               <br />

               IIe said himself that the only difference in 
               <br />
               the areas was about 8,000 square miles, 
               <br />
               whereas if you put the dividing line sixty 
               <br />
               miles further east the difference would be 
               <br />
               75.000 square miles. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Well.</span> I do not think

               that it‘ you were to try for a month, you
