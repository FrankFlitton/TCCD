               I did not think of that, but I am a little dense 
               <br />
               to-day. The minister, I am sure, drew on 
               <br />
               his imagination, for it was altogether too 
               <br />
               transparent a statement to say that the peo— 
               <br />

               <br />
               say that some one in the interests of this 
               <br />
               bitu-lithic pavement concern said: We 
               <br />
               want to get this government, which is going 
               <br />
               to make this city the Washington of the 
               <br />
               north. put this pavement on Wellington 
               <br />
               street, are you in favour of it ? It will not 
               <br />
               cost you a cent. Those who will have to 
               <br />
               pay for it are the hayseeds from Victoria 
               <br />
               and the other rural districts. Who would 
               <br />
               not sign a petition of that kind? Who 
               <br />
               would not be willing to get something for 
               <br />
               nothing ? The Minister of Justice got some- 
               <br />
               thing for nothing the other day, and these 
               <br />
               gentlemen were quite willing to be in the 
               <br />
               same position. The petition argument of 
               <br />
               the acting minister was so very weak, that 
               <br />
               it will not hold. I shall not enter into a 
               <br />
               comparison of the different pavements. All 
               <br />
               I have to say is this, that the pavement in 
               <br />
               question consists of an ordinary piece of 
               <br />
               grading with a little coal-tar spread over it, 
               <br />
               a little stone .put on top and a little of this—— 
               <br />
               I forget these high fainting names—at all 
               <br />
               events this Warren composition laid over it. 
               <br />
               The result is that the dust is ﬂying np from 
               <br />
               it every day, and the government have two 
               <br />
               or three good henchmen sprinkling water 
               <br />
               over it to enable us to get into the building. 
               <br />
               Yet they tell us that it costs as much as solid 
               <br />
               6 inch asphalt pavement. The thing is pre- 
               <br />
               posterous. I shall not make a comparison 
               <br />
               of it with the asphalt for wheel purposes: 
               <br />
               but we are told that it is used for such pur- 
               <br />
               poses where there is not a great deal of 
               <br />
               trafﬁc; and that, though it may be a little 
               <br />
               soft, it makes an excellent pavement. We 
               <br />
               are told further that the great advantage of 
               <br />
               this pavement is that in hot weather the 
               <br />
               horses do not slip on it, because when the 
               <br />
               tar melts, if the horses stand a little while, 
               <br />
               their hoofs sink into it and there they are. 
               <br />
               That is the advantage, we are told, of this 
               <br />
               pavement over asphalt pavement. Against 
               <br />
               our good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend»</span> Mr. Robinette I have not a 
               <br />
               word to say. He is a most worthy and enter- 
               <br />
               prising gentleman, but I was a little. sur— 
               <br />
               prised he had not nerve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough</span> to face the 
               <br />
               music. I am surprised at his lack of tact 
               <br />
               and judgment, but I am told by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend beside me that it cannot be the Robin— 
               <br />
               ette I mean. The Robinette I refer to is a 
               <br />
               lawyer in Toronto, and my legal friend says 
               <br />
               that no lawyer can enter into any such con— 
               <br />
               tracts because that is contrary to the statute 
               <br />
               law of Ontario. Therefore it must be some 
               <br />
               other man than T. C. Robinette with whom 
               <br />
               we are all familiar, but I have no personal 
               <br />
               information regarding that fact at all. This 
               <br />
               may be similar to the fence around Major 
               <br />
               Hill park. which the late Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works (Mr. Tarte) told us, in reply to a

               had evaded the statute by allowing the fence 
               <br />
               to be put in sections costing $3,000 each and 
               <br />

               <br />
               it may be that the present contract is a

               similar way of evading the statute. I trust

               it is necessary, in the interest of public

               notice. I do not suppose the Prime Minister

               only notice in a general way that I intended

               points I intended to deal with in discussing

               terday. That letter stated in detail the 
               <br />
               points I was going to bring up. So, I have 
               <br />
               done my duty. The Prime Minister has 
               <br />
               promised us that this thing shall not occur 
               <br />
               again. I am glad of that. But I am re- 
               <br />
               minded to ask the Prime Minister whether. 
               <br />
               on some future occasion he will be good 
               <br />
               enough to tell us why he has found it neces- 
               <br />
               sary to put this curbing hand upon not only 
               <br />
               the acting Minister of Public Works, but 
               <br />
               all his ministers, in regard to contracts. Let 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman take us into his 
               <br />
               conﬁdence in this matter. Has he found it 
               <br />
               necessary to do something because of scan- 
               <br />
               dals so great and so frequent -all over the 
               <br />
               country ? Is that the reason ?
