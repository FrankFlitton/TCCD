               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">party.</span> from Ontario, from British Columbia, 
               <br />
               from Manitoba, from the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, endorse that sentiment? Are they 
               <br />
               prepared to endorse it and stand by it? 
               <br />
               They do endorse it by their conduct in this 
               <br />
               House, because from the ﬁrst word I have 
               <br />
               spoken on this question to the present I 
               <br />
               have been treated as though I ought to be 
               <br />
               ostracized from society, as though I was un- 
               <br />
               worthy of respect in this House. Whenever 
               <br />
               I have spoken as representing the Orange 
               <br />
               element of this country, sneers have been 
               <br />
               heaped on me without number, invectives, 
               <br />
               the strongest that could be found in the 
               <br />
               English language, have been hurled against 
               <br />
               me, everything I have said has been treated 
               <br />
               with disdain or contempt for the ‘yellow- 
               <br />
               dog’ element, which is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the»</span> Orange element 
               <br />
               of this country. That element is too strong 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> to take these insults as compliments, 
               <br />
               and I want to tell hon. gentlemen that when 
               <br />
               I speak for them I speak for 500,000 in- 
               <br />
               telligent citizens of Canada, who will resent 
               <br />
               these insults when the time comes, and will 
               <br />
               speak out with no uncertain sound. When 
               <br />
               that day does come, I can invite either the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance, or the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, or the Minister of Customs, to say 
               <br />
               whether they or their friends were discreet 
               <br />
               in heaping abuse on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘yellovw—dog’</span> ele— 
               <br />
               ment, the Orange element of this country. 
               <br />
               They have been gibed at and insulted in 
               <br />
               this House. Every invective that could be 
               <br />
               used is used against them, and now we are 
               <br />
               told to-day that they represent a class of 
               <br />
               people who are bordering on hydrophobia, 
               <br />
               that they are an element which should be 
               <br />
               kept down, that they are arousing strife 
               <br />
               and kindling a tire. I ask who started the 
               <br />
               ﬁre ?
