               justice at the hands of this parliament. 
               <br />
               Blackstone’s theory is that the king repre- 
               <br />
               sents power, the senators represent wisdom, 
               <br />
               and the commonors represent good inten— 
               <br />
               tions. I can only say that the stand I take 
               <br />
               on this question before this House is taken 
               <br />
               because I believe I am in the right. We ap- 
               <br />
               proach this subject with a certain amount of 
               <br />
               reluctance, but we would be weak men, men 
               <br />
               not worthy of being called Canadians were 
               <br />

               <br />
               little things, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">especially</span> a responsibility 
               <br />
               so great as the present one. Let us have a 
               <br />
               due regard for the honour and interest of 
               <br />
               our mighty nation, and debate this subject 
               <br />
               in a broad and patriotic spirit. Let us not 
               <br />
               deceive ourselves as to the importance of 
               <br />
               our task. I therefore urge on the govern- 
               <br />
               ment to be strong, to do what is right by the 
               <br />
               new provinces in education ; and if they do, 
               <br />
               they will support this amendment.

               No matter how we vote on this question, 
               <br />
               we will be criticised and condemned or ap- 
               <br />
               proved of; but if we are doing what we 
               <br />
               believe to be right we need not fear criti— 
               <br />
               cism. Canada possesses a large and ever in-

               creasing number of citizens who recognize 
               <br />
               that it is the duty of members of parliament 
               <br />
               not only to be faithful to their duties in 
               <br />
               this House, advocating what we believe to 
               <br />
               be right, fearlessly and conscientiously, but 
               <br />
               to have principles, and be not afraid to 
               <br />
               maintain them. Let us guard not only the 
               <br />
               resources of Canada, but let us guard her 
               <br />
               schools, and her education. Compromise 
               <br />
               in this measure is out of the question. Nar- 
               <br />
               row politicians and papers may be satis- 
               <br />
               fied by it, but the people will not; it will 
               <br />
               not satisfy and settle the question. There 
               <br />
               is only one thing to do and that is to eli- 
               <br />
               minate the clause as proposed by the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition. Let Saskatchewan and 
               <br />
               Alberta make their own laWs with regard 
               <br />
               to education and work out their own des~ 
               <br />
               tiny. The government would gladly seek 
               <br />
               refuge behind any weak subterfuge that 
               <br />
               may present itself. When ten years ago 
               <br />
               this same party were ﬁghting for provincial 
               <br />
               rights, the people who are condemning them 
               <br />
               to—day were upholding them. In this land 
               <br />
               every important piece of legislation such 
               <br />
               as this turns on the will of the House of 
               <br />
               Commons, we are responsible to the people, 
               <br />
               and the people rule. If this body miscon- 
               <br />
               duct itself, we can refer the matter to the 
               <br />
               people and their decision will be ﬁnal. Na- 
               <br />
               poleon said that people grow old quickly 
               <br />
               on ﬁelds of battle. But my impression is 
               <br />
               that governments grow old more quickly ln 
               <br />

               <br />
               government is dying at the top, many of 
               <br />

               <br />
