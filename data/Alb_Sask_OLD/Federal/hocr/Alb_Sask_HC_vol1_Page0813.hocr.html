               In 1889, Mr. Dalton McCarthy took up the 
               <br />
               policy advocated of old by Mr. Geo. Brown, 
               <br />
               or rather that advocated by the oligarchy 
               <br />
               and family compact, in the years following 
               <br />
               the conquest, when every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁort</span> was made 
               <br />
               to anglicize us at all cost, by inducing us 
               <br />
               to renounce what we regarded as our na- 
               <br />
               tional heritage, our institutions, our tongue 
               <br />
               and our laws, under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fallacious</span> pretext 
               <br />
               of national unity. The by-word was then: 
               <br />
               ‘Let us abolish the separate schools and 
               <br />
               the use of the French language.’ That is 
               <br />
               the object, not openly stated perhaps, but 
               <br />
               quite apparent on the part of several. They 
               <br />
               do not all speak out, of courSe, as does 
               <br />

               <br />
               is carried on, moreover, with a view to in-

               Your letter of March 13 is somewhat a sur- 
               <br />
               prise to me. I do not know anything of the 
               <br />
               privileges enjoyed by the Protestant minority 
               <br />

               <br />
               ate schools in the Territories, I may say that 
               <br />
               advantage has not been taken of them to any 
               <br />
               great extent. One per cent only of the schools 
               <br />
               in the Territories are Catholic separate schools. 
               <br />
               The school system‘here is such as cannot be 
               <br />
               taken exception to. There is only one series 
               <br />
               of text—book; the inspectors are the same 
               <br />
               for all establishments; the standard of quali- 
               <br />
               ﬁcation for teachers is uniform; the standard 
               <br />
               of classiﬁcation for schools, whether Protest-

               case of that Conservative club, as in that of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Grey. To regain 
               <br />
               power, such is the highest aim of our oppon- 
               <br />
               ents in their political warfare. To fan the 
               <br />
               ﬂame of prejudice, to set one against the 
               <br />
               other the various races,. the various prov- 
               <br />
               inces, to promote racial hatred, to let loose 
               <br />
               the demon of religious antagonism, such are 
               <br />
               the means they have recourse to in order to 
               <br />
               overthrow the government. Such is the un- 
               <br />
               gracious task which the majority of the Con— 
               <br />
               servative party have set themselves to, 
               <br />
               under the vfallacious pretense of upholding 
               <br />
               provincial rights, in the case of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for East Grey, and under that of 
               <br />
               ensuring a full measure of justice to the 
               <br />
               Catholics of the Northwest, in the case of 
               <br />
               the Jacques <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Cartier</span> club.

               It is no use trying to hide the fact. The 
               <br />
               separate school is objected to, on the ground 
               <br />
               that it is an impediment to the uniﬁcation 
               <br />
               of the various races inhabiting this country.
