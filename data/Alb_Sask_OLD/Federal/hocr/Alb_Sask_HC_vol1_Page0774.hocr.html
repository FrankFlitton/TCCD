               enter into a discussion of Christian ethics

               or of the Christian religion, but, Sir, there 
               <br />
               is a main principle of Christian ethics that is 
               <br />
               known as the Golden Rule, that we should

               schools, and I think the least we can do is 
               <br />
               to try to live up to the fundamental princi- 
               <br />
               ple of Christian ethics and do for others 
               <br />
               what we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wish.</span> them to do for us. I want to 
               <br />
               go a step further, and to say to the Pro-

               testants of Canada and other provinces that 
               <br />
               I think it would be more to their credit; 
               <br />
               and would illustrate better their belief in 
               <br />
               the Christian religion, if they would stand

               <br />
               friends in the other provinces realize in the 
               <br />
               slightest degree the advantages afforded us 
               <br />
               by the Catholic majority. By the Catholic 
               <br />
               majority, did I say? No, by the fathers 
               <br />
               and framers of confederation, the men who 
               <br />
               decided that the principle of separate schools 
               <br />
               should be acknowledged in our confedera- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Protestants of that time of our history who 
               <br />
               gave that privilege of separate schools. Men 
               <br />
               like Cartier and other leaders of the R0- 
               <br />
               man Catholics who were engaged in framing 
               <br />
               our constitution did not hesitate for a mo- 
               <br />

               Catholic minorities of those provinces. We 
               <br />

               <br />
               lics of Quebec which, I am ashamed to say, 
               <br />
               the Protestants where they are a majority 
               <br />

               Mr. FISHER. I am coming to that in a 
               <br />
               moment. i do not care particularly to com- 
               <br />
               pare the privileges that the minority in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec enjoy with the privileges 
               <br />
               which, by this Bill and the ordinances of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, are being given 
               <br />
               to the Catholics of the new provinces. That 
               <br />
               comparison would show obviously that we 
               <br />
               have a great deal more privileges than are 
               <br />
               proposed to be given to the Catholics of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. However, that is not 
               <br />
               a matter I need discuss now. The people 
               <br />
               generally on both sides of this question, 
               <br />
               have accepted the principle of giving to the 
               <br />
               Catholics of the new provinces the rights 
               <br />
               and privileges that they enjoy today, which, 
               <br />
               as 1 say, are small in comparison with the 
               <br />
               privileges enjoyed to-day by the Protestant 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minority</span> in the province of Quebec. But 
               <br />
               these privileges granted to the minority in 
               <br />
               the Northwest under the Bill have worked 
               <br />
               satisfactorily and successfully for a number 
               <br />
               of years, and we can, therefore, safely say 
               <br />
               they will work satisfactorily and successfully 
               <br />
               in years to come and, so will satisfy both the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestants</span> and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholics</span> of these new 
               <br />
               provinces. The Minister of Inland Revenue 
               <br />
               (Mr. Brodeur) a moment ago said that we 
               <br />
               of the minority in Quebec have another pri- 
               <br />
               vilege in regard to the distribution of certain 
               <br />
               funds. In Quebec today the Protestants 
               <br />
               number about one-eighth of the population. 
               <br />
               But, in the ﬁrst place, let it be understood 
               <br />
               that all the taxation levied for school pur— 
               <br />
               poses on any Protestant goes to Protestant 
               <br />
               education just as the taxation levied on 
               <br />
               Catholics goes to Catholic education.
