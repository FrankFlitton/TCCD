               position of Minister of the Interior was

               that to go to the country as the honest, states— 
               <br />
               manlike utterance of the First Minister of 
               <br />
               the Dominion of Canada? But, if we have, 
               <br />
               as was said by hon. members on his own side 
               <br />
               of the House, and as is the fact, before us 
               <br />
               one of the most momentous questions that 
               <br />
               have at any time involved the consideration 
               <br />
               of this House, a question that will affect the 
               <br />
               future of the west, half a million miles of 
               <br />
               the best territory of this Dominion and 
               <br />
               the best agricultural country that exists 
               <br />
               to-day, is there any analogy between this 
               <br />
               case and the case of the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior in 1888 ? ‘ Only thirty-one days ago,’ 
               <br />
               says the right hon. First Minister, and in a 
               <br />
               while when it suits my convenience, when I 
               <br />
               get entirely ready, after Ihave held at bay 
               <br />
               the ofﬁce-seekers who want the position and 
               <br />
               Whom I dare not now offend because I want 
               <br />
               to dangle before them the plums of ofﬁce 
               <br />
               and not offend any one of them until after 
               <br />
               this crucial period has gone by, then, after 
               <br />
               the 1st of July, after I have riveted upon 
               <br />
               the west and established the system of 
               <br />

               <br />
               God,—I will announce what I will do. He 
               <br />
               says that he is embarrassed by a wealth of 
               <br />
               material. Very likely. The right hon. 
               <br />
               First Minister is perfectly sincere. He 
               <br />
               has a wealth of material in this House. 
               <br />
               One man says that he is as good as the other. 
               <br />
               Each man says: I am the big man for the 
               <br />
               situation; and this is a source of embarrass- 
               <br />
               ment perhaps to the right hon. First Min— 
               <br />
               ister. He dare not ﬁll that position because 
               <br />
               he is afraid that some of his followers whose 
               <br />
               votes he depends upon might not be avail- 
               <br />
               able in this crisis. I do not know that I 
               <br />
               need say much further in reference to what 
               <br />
               the right hon. First Minister has said. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> right hon. gentleman is more remark- 
               <br />

               occasions than for what he says. But, he

               Canada (wrested from the right hon. First

               Now, I had intended to refer to another

               aspect of this case, but I ﬁnd that I have got 
               <br />
               excited and that is not usual with me. I 
               <br />
               must excuse myself. I believe I am justi-

               occasion. I believe as the right hon. min—

               ister says, that our passions on some of these 
               <br />

               ably ‘ the exaggeration of a noble sentiment,’ 
               <br />
               the right hon. minister says and perhaps 
               <br />
               there is a little exaggeration of noble <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">senti-</span> 
               <br />
               ments from time to time as the debate goes 
               <br />
               on. I think that when we cannot get a 
               <br />
               solitary member representing the west on 
               <br />

               up and advocate the rights of the west, when 
               <br />
               we cannot get the hon. Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               (Mr. Fielding) who was an advocate of 
               <br />
               opinions which are in direct conﬂict with the 
               <br />
               proposition of the government to—day, when 
               <br />
               we cannot get that great democrat to rise 
               <br />
               up and say that in this day the people shall 
               <br />
               be supreme, when we cannot get back into 
               <br />
               the House that champion of national schools, 
               <br />
               the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton). 
               <br />
               to speak one word on behalf of the great 
               <br />
               people of the west, a place which is to be 
               <br />

               <br />
               grandest agricultural territory within this
