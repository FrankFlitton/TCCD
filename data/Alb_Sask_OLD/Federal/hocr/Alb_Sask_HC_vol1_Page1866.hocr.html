               <br />
               put a concrete case before the House. Here 
               <br />
               is a school district, for instance. which is 
               <br />
               composed of Protestants, they have their 
               <br />
               own religious instruction. There are amongst 
               <br />
               them ﬁve or six Roman Catholics. While 
               <br />
               the Protestants have their religious instruc- 
               <br />
               tions, the Catholics want their religious 
               <br />
               instruction also, and whether they shall 
               <br />
               have it is at the option of the school trus- 
               <br />
               tees. If they do not get satisfaction from 
               <br />
               the school trustees, they can secede and 
               <br />
               organize a separate school. Let us take a 
               <br />
               concrete case. Here is a school district 
               <br />
               Where there is a majority of Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lics. There are a few Protestant families, 
               <br />
               and they all go to the same school. If the 
               <br />
               religious instruction which is given by the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic trustees is not satisfactory 
               <br />
               to the Protestants, they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can‘organize</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">se:</span> 
               <br />
               parate school. Now we know that what- 
               <br />
               ever may be the conscientious scruples we 
               <br />
               have upon these matters, at all events my 
               <br />
               co-religionists have them, we know that in 
               <br />
               these new territories there are many dis- 
               <br />
               tricts where there are schools in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which.</span> pu-

               pils of all denominations attend, and some- 
               <br />
               how they manage to get along fairly well. 
               <br />
               Sometimes it happens that they do not,
