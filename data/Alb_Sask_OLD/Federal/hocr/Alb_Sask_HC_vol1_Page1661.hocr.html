               country boundaries must be observed; and 
               <br />

               <br />
               to another principle enunciated by his leader 
               <br />
               and mentioned again <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foo-day,</span> namely, that

               voting power to the elector than city con— 
               <br />
               stituencies. These two principles stated by 
               <br />
               his leader on the ﬂoor of this House many 
               <br />
               times during the debate of 1903, acquiesced 
               <br />
               in by his own vote, are responsible for these 
               <br />
               very differences to which he has called at- 
               <br />
               tention. Now he knows well enough that 
               <br />
               no such principles apply to the province of 
               <br />
               Alberta, because there are no municipal 
               <br />
               and county boundaries there, so far as I am 
               <br />
               aware. He says that the leader of the op- 
               <br />
               position, when the county of Richmond was 
               <br />
               in question in 1903, did not raise his voice. 
               <br />
               Is he quite lure of that ? Is he stating that 
               <br />
               as a fact? Does he per-severe in that state- 
               <br />

               Mr. OLIVER. I would say that the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition did not raise his voice loud 
               <br />

               <br />
               his usual practice he was probably waiting 
               <br />
               outside for the bell to ring before he came 
               <br />
               in to vote on something of which he knew

               I did make a motion before the committee,
