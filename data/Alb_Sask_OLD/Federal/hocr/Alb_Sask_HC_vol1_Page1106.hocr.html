               introduced to the House the cry and prayer 
               <br />
               of the hon. leader of the opposition was: 
               <br />
               Don’t rush the Bill. Then there were many 
               <br />
               requests from the hon. leader of the 01)- 
               <br />
               position, day after day, to bring the Bill 
               <br />
               down immediately and one would imagine 
               <br />
               that the whole Conservative party were 
               <br />
               united, that there were no dissentients in 
               <br />
               their ranks, that they had settled upon a 
               <br />
               sound and ﬁxed policy. They were practi- 
               <br />
               cally saying: Bring forth the beast of sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools so that we may get our hands 
               <br />
               on it right now and here. That was not 
               <br />
               the fact when the second reading of this 
               <br />
               Bill was moved. The position which the 
               <br />
               hon. leader of the opposition took upon 
               <br />
               that occasion was, I say, not creditable to 
               <br />
               himself or to his party. It was not fair to 
               <br />
               the country and I submit it is open to criti- 
               <br />
               cism. The hon. gentleman made a legal 
               <br />
               argument and it was, I concede, a very able 
               <br />
               one. He seemed very sure about the cor- 
               <br />
               rectness of his argument, because he postu- 
               <br />
               lated everything from his premises to his 
               <br />
               conclusion and in effect he said that this was 
               <br />
               the straight and narrow path to sound poli- 
               <br />
               tical principle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and‘statesmanship.</span> He said 
               <br />
               the administration had no more right to pass 
               <br />
               the educational clauses of this Bill than they 
               <br />
               would have to amend Mahomet’s Koran. 
               <br />
               He says it is not open to argument, and 
               <br />
               then he turns to his followers, but he does 
               <br />
               not exhort them to stand together in his 
               <br />
               support as did the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Toronto (Mr. Foster) in 1896, but he tells 
               <br />
               them that he does not expect them to follow 
               <br />
               his lead it for reasons of conscience they 
               <br />
               cannot see their way to do so. I would 
               <br />
               like to know what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conscience</span> has to do with 
               <br />
               the consideration of a question of constitu- 
               <br />
               tional law ‘? I never saw in any text-book 
               <br />
               upon the interpretation of statutes, that 
               <br />
               conscience was a canon of construction. I 
               <br />
               have heard that at one time in England, 
               <br />
               law was measured by the length of the 
               <br />
               chancellor’s foot, but I never heard of 
               <br />
               legal principles being afﬁrmed on the rule 
               <br />
               of consc1ence. I never saw in Holman vs. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Crown, or in the Queen vs. Robinson, or 
               <br />
               in any other constitutional case any refer- 
               <br />
               ence to conscience. Nevertheless, the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman (Mr. R. L. Borden) for some rea- 
               <br />
               son or other turns to his followers and says : 
               <br />
               While I am absolutely sound in my opinion, 
               <br />
               and while the legislation is clearly ultra 
               <br />
               vires. still for conscience sake you are at 
               <br />
               liberty to oppose it. This brand of consci- 
               <br />
               enec seems a very peculiar thing to me—

               in the neighbourhood of Montreal generate a 
               <br />
               different form of conscience from that which 
               <br />
               the atmosphere of Lake Ontario does? The

               hon. member for Cornwall and Stormont 
               <br />
               (Mr. Pringie) has expressed his intention of 
               <br />
               supporting this measure, and I wonder if 
               <br />
               the climatic conditions in his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neighbour»</span> 
               <br />
               hood produces another kind of conscience. 
               <br />
               This conscientious argument submitted by 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition does not appear 
               <br />
               to me to be fair. I look upon it as an inti— 
               <br />
               mation to his followers to pursue whatever 
               <br />
               course might suit their constituents. It is 
               <br />
               possible, of course, that some members of 
               <br />
               the opposition may not have any conscience 
               <br />
               at all on this question, but possibly their 
               <br />
               constituents have a conscience. and it might 
               <br />
               be right to respect the conscience of your 
               <br />
               constituents. I sympathize with any mem- 
               <br />
               ber supporting the opposition who represents 
               <br />
               a constituency where there is perhaps a fair 
               <br />
               division of conscience, for it may be very 
               <br />
               difﬁcult for him to decide which form of 
               <br />
               conscience he will be guided by, as to 
               <br />
               whether he will vote for the Bill or support 
               <br />
               the amendment. I am reminded of another 
               <br />
               story which will illustrate this, though per- 
               <br />
               haps I am breaking my record for story- 
               <br />
               telling. During the days of the American 
               <br />
               civil war a settler lived upon the Mason 
               <br />
               and Dixon line, in the state of Missouri, and 
               <br />
               he was very careful whenever he was gues- 
               <br />
               tioned by a sentry of the northern army to 
               <br />
               declare that he was against slavery, and to 
               <br />
               a confederate sentry he was as careful to 
               <br />
               state that he was in favour of secession. 
               <br />
               But one day both sentries met together, and 
               <br />
               his declaration then was: I am nothing at 
               <br />
               all, and not much of that. I fear that some 
               <br />
               members of the opposition will ﬁnd them- 
               <br />
               selves in that very predicament. 
               <br />

               Possibly it may be good party tactics, and 
               <br />
               possibly these inanceuvers are not at all

               I submit that the position taken by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition was not fair to this 
               <br />
               country ; I submit that it was not fair even 
               <br />
               to his own political friends. The people _of

               rights or about the constitutional question.
