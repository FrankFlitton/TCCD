               <br />
               ended with the end of the world. I 
               <br />
               will content myself with stating the

               <br />
               the world for ever. But this is not the point. 
               <br />
               The point is, what has Catholic education 
               <br />
               done for Catholic countries ? If our friends

               who are making so much noise about the 
               <br />
               corruption of Catholic countries would go to

               material as well as moral prosperity co- 
               <br />
               incided with the time when the Catholic 
               <br />
               church, not dominated, but inspired those 
               <br />
               countries. and when Catholic education high 
               <br />
               or low, was given to all classes of the peOple. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Spain</span> began to decay when greeders in the 
               <br />
               colonies displaced the 1nissionaries-when

               the King of Spain lent himself to the 
               <br />
               anti-Catholic movement which started in 
               <br />
               France and which led to the abolition of the 
               <br />
               Jesuit order. The same thing happened in 
               <br />
               France. But why not go for an example to 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               what has been the inﬂuence of the Catholic 
               <br />
               church on the development of education in 
               <br />
               that province ? It is generally contended 
               <br />
               in all English-speaking provinces that we 
               <br />
               are—I will not say an inferior race, because 
               <br />
               I do not think that is accepted by a great 
               <br />
               number of the English-speaking people; 
               <br />
               but it is very often contended that the sys- 
               <br />
               tem of education in the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               is an inferior one, and that that province has 
               <br />
               a greater number of illiterate people than 
               <br />
               any of the other provinces. it may be that 
               <br />
               a little insight into the history of the educa— 
               <br />
               tional system of Quebec will throw some 
               <br />
               light on the subject. Before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conquest,</span> 
               <br />
               the French government had given lavishly 
               <br />
               what was necessary for the support of pub— 
               <br />
               lic education in New France. At the time of 
               <br />
               the cession there was necessarily a great 
               <br />
               disturbance of the whole system. Five years 
               <br />
               after the cession of Canada the Jesuit order 
               <br />
               was suppressed by the Pope; and, strange 
               <br />
               to say, there was nobody at the time to raise 
               <br />
               an argument against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«the</span> English govern- 
               <br />
               ment for using a papal bull. On the day 
               <br />
               that papal decision was registered, all the 
               <br />
               estates belonging to the Jesuits were seized 
               <br />
               by the British government. Those estates 
               <br />
               had been given to the Jesuits with the legal 
               <br />
               obligation of founding colleges and sec— 
               <br />
               ondary and primary schools; and before 
               <br />
               the conquest they had established two 
               <br />
               colleges and a great number of primary 
               <br />
               schools—a greater proportion being given 
               <br />
               to the people of New France than were 
               <br />
               given in the British colonies to the south. 
               <br />
               After the estates of the Jesuits were seized 
               <br />
               by the British government, were the pro—

               ceeds used for the education of the people ? 
               <br />
               No. The Montreal College was destroyed. 
               <br />
               and was replaced by the Champ de Mars.
