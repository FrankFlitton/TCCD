               Assiniboia that the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               have developed as they have. I think it

               <br />

               the Territories to public attention in the

               <br />
               think also that the name <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatchewan</span>

               contains some historic recollections in con-

               Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">WII/FRED</span> LAURIE-R. I can assure 
               <br />
               my hon. friend (Mr. 'Lake) that it was 
               <br />
               not with that view that I accepted the 
               <br />
               name of Saskatchewan. I have no objection 
               <br />
               to say that the name Saskatchewan has 
               <br />
               many recollections, that one included and 
               <br />
               if my hon. friend wishes to have it on that 
               <br />
               account I have no objection at all. I am 
               <br />
               sorry that the name Assiniboia disappears. 
               <br />
               If my hon, friend prefers Assiniboia to 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan I am willing to sacriﬁce Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan though it recalls something to ine. 
               <br />
               But, with regard to Alberta, I would have 
               <br />
               preferred one of the old historical names. 
               <br />
               However, the name Alberta is so well known 
               <br />
               not only in this country, but even in Eu- 
               <br />
               rope, that we thought we should have to 
               <br />
               retain it. If Assiniboia is preferred to Sas— 
               <br />
               katchewan, I have no objection, but the 
               <br />
               majority seem to think that Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               is the name that should be used. _

               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> great deal of interest in all the other 
               <br />
               provinces, and the people of the west will 
               <br />
               hardly relish the insinuation that this House 
               <br />
               should treat it as of little importance now. 
               <br />
               I presume that if we Were discussing the 
               <br />
               length of lobsters, the hon. gentleman from 
               <br />

               sider such a question as very important and 
               <br />
               would ventilate his eloquence upon it. Well, 
               <br />
               Sir, I have always been of the opinion that 
               <br />
               one province would be sufﬁcient in the west, 
               <br />
               and whilst that question has been fully 
               <br />
               debated in the legislative assembly and was 
               <br />
               approved of by a vote of 25 to 10 at least, 
               <br />
               still it appears <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> that it is utterly im-

               possible to have the government consider

               such a proposition, and I must content

               myself with renewing my objection to the

               proposed dividing line between the pro-

               400 or 500. I say that the Maple Creek

               Board of Trade in passing a resolution on

               pressing the opinion of the ranching dis-

               told us that the Liberal Association of

               tion. I have not the slightest doubt that 
               <br />
               this Liberal Association would be very 
               <br />
               anxious to move the line further west, and 
               <br />
               perhaps that is where the hon. member 
               <br />
               (Mr. Scott) got his idea. I have no doubt 
               <br />
               it he had his way the southern portion 
               <br />
               of Alberta would be gerrymandered clean 
               <br />
               into Montana. When the hon gentleman says 
               <br />
               that he advocates the moving of the line 
               <br />
               further west and the taking of the old east- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ern</span> boundary of Alberta as the boundary of 
               <br />
               the new provinces, I do not think that is 
               <br />
               the idea he always entertained. As we
