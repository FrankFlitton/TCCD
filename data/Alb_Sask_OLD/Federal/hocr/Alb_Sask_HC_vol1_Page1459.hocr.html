               tell the reason, but these are the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">facts</span> of the 
               <br />
               case, that the area of what was thought to 
               <br />
               be unserviceable or arid land has gradually 
               <br />
               and constantly receded and the area of what 
               <br />
               is serviceable and useful has gradually and 
               <br />
               continually grown. I think that probably

               tue same change and the same course of 
               <br />

               place with reference to the northern portion 
               <br />
               of it, so that the whole trend of my argu-

               ment is that we have not by any means

               at the present price ; suppose that you could 
               <br />
               hold these lands, selling as the price suited 
               <br />
               you (the price coming up to a good fair 
               <br />
               amount alongside of your settled portions), 
               <br />
               selling a certain number of acres of these 
               <br />
               lands each year, as much as you deem pru- 
               <br />
               dent and wise, but not by necessity forced to 
               <br />
               sell them, and so on, for a period of ten or 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen years; do you not think that the 
               <br />
               rise in the price of the lands from $1.50 an 
               <br />
