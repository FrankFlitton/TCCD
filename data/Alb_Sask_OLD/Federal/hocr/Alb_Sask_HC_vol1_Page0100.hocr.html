               did be present this measure ? Without

               <br />
               even the honour of my right hon. friend. 
               <br />
               He has not so regarded it. He must be the 
               <br />
               guardian of his own honour, I admit that, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               Now I come to the arguments of my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend when introducing this measure. 
               <br />
               He put forward constitutional grounds, and 
               <br />
               he gave two reasons, which I must examine 
               <br />
               a little in detail, even if in doing so I tres- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pass</span> upon the indulgence of the House. The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst reason he gave, so far as I was able 
               <br />
               to comprehend his argument, was this : That 
               <br />
               when parliament in 1875 enacted section 11 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territoires Act of that 
               <br />
               year, it imposed permanently upon those ter- 
               <br />
               ritories the provisions therein contained, so 
               <br />
               that they must necessarily become embodied 
               <br />
               in the constitution of such territories when 
               <br />
               created into provinces. To state that pro- 
               <br />
               pcsition seems to me to refute it. Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment could at any time within the last 
               <br />
               thirty years have repealed section 11, or 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any.</span> other section of that Act; parliament 
               <br />
               could repeal that section to-day. Parlia-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment</span> on many occasions during the past

               <br />
               provisions contained in that Act. In 1890 
               <br />
               Sir John Thompson introduced and this 
               <br />
               House carried an amendment, to a resolu- 
               <br />
               tion moved by Mr. McCarthy. That resolu- 
               <br />
               tion so amended conferred upon the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories power to deal 
               <br />
               with the question of dual languages after 
               <br />

               My right hon. friend has referred to the op-

               lnion of the late George Brown. So far as

               matters ot policy in this country are con- 
               <br />
               cerned, Mr. Brown’s opinion would undoubt- 
               <br />
               edly be of great weight, and should com- 
               <br />
               mend itself especially to hon. gentlemen on 
               <br />
               that side of the House who were brought

               up in that school of which Mr. Brown was 
               <br />
               the leader. Therefore when my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend, upon the ﬁrst reading of this Bill, 
               <br />
               was obliged to quote the words of Mr. BrOWn 
               <br />
               condemning any attempt to create separate 
               <br />
               schools in the Northwest of Canada, he 
               <br />
               was giving to his followers a lessen read 
               <br />
               to them by the leader of that school in 
               <br />
               which they were brought up. But he was 
               <br />
               not content to deal with the opinion of Mr. 
               <br />
               George Brown upon a question of policy, 
               <br />
               he rather sought to use Mr. Brown as 
               <br />
               a constitutional authority. Well, we 
               <br />
               know that Mr. Brown was not dealing 
               <br />
               with the question from the standpoint 
               <br />
               of constitutional obligation; we know 
               <br />
               he was not well qualiﬁed to do so, be- 
               <br />
               cause he had not the legal training and 
               <br />
               the constitutional knowledge which would 
               <br />
               cause him to be recognized as a great au-

               <br />
               my right hon. friend desired to quote Mr.

               Brown’s views upon the constitution, he 
               <br />
               might well have read to the House these
