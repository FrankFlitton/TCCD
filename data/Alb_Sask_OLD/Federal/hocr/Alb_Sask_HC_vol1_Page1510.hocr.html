               My hon. friend, the Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
               was good enough, for the purpose of con- 
               <br />
               venience, to place in my hands an opinion 
               <br />
               prepared, as I understand, by his deputy 
               <br />
               minister—a very able lawyer, for whose 
               <br />
               opinion both the Minister of Justice and my- 
               <br />
               self have the highest possible regard—With 
               <br />
               regard, not to clause No. 16 which we are 
               <br />
               now discussing. but clause 15, and with re- 
               <br />
               gard to certain criticisms which I made upon 
               <br />
               the language of that section. I observe that 
               <br />
               my hon. friend, the Deputy Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice, considered that the criticisms which 
               <br />
               were made by myself and others on that 
               <br />
               clause were based on what he regards as a 
               <br />
               misunderstanding. That may be quite true. 
               <br />
               but I think there is also a misunderstanding 
               <br />
               upon the part of the deputy minister. That 
               <br />
               gentleman failed to realize that when we 
               <br />
               are dealing with clause 16 or clause 15 or 
               <br />
               any other clause of this Bill, we must in

               the end, on this side of the House, direct our 
               <br />
               criticism towards such amendment as will, 
               <br />
               according to the views of the law ofﬁcers 
               <br />
               of the Crown, bring about the results we 
               <br />
               desire. We may have our own views as to 
               <br />
               what the clause is, but in the end the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment will insist that the opinion of the 
               <br />
               law ofﬁcers of the Crown shall guide them.—

               and properly. so. No government could be 
               <br />
               administered on any other principle. There—

               <br />
               make upon clause 15 or clause 16 or any
