               reminds me of a story I heard when com- 
               <br />
               paratively a boy, of a would-be celebrated 
               <br />
               chemist, who, asked to demonstrate a propo- 
               <br />
               sition in chemistry said: Well boys, you 
               <br />
               will take an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁervescent</span> and you add a 
               <br />
               deliquescent and there will be a precipita- 
               <br />
               tion and that is a conglomeration.and that 
               <br />
               amounts to a demonstration. The chemist 
               <br />
               deﬁed any one to prove the proposition more 
               <br />
               logically than that, and the Chemist’s demon- 
               <br />
               stration is about on a par with the demon- 
               <br />
               stration we have had from the member for 
               <br />
               Pictou. It was a conglomeration in the 
               <br />
               highest sense of the word. He told us that 
               <br />
               Ontario thought she had all the intelligence 
               <br />
               ot' the world, but that we were not above 
               <br />
               going to the east to get a leader. Well, On- 
               <br />
               tario is like Simple Simon; she knows a

               Mr. SPROULE. The man he called a 
               <br />
               political Ismaelite was born in the maritime 
               <br />
               provinces but they discarded him, and we

               accepted him with gratitude and pleasure

               <br />

               ture tells us that it was from the east the 
               <br />

               a wise man from the cast, but if we are to 
               <br />
               judge from the sample we heard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight</span> I 
               <br />
               can assure him we are not likely to make 
               <br />
               any more pilgrimages east in search of wise 
               <br />
               men. The member for Pictou said that Sir 
               <br />
               John Macdonald was a legislative unionist 
               <br />
               and that the member for East Grey who 
               <br />
               championed political rights to—day was a 
               <br />
               great admirer of his. If the member for

               Pictou <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Were</span> as familiar with the political

               the barnyards of Nova Scotia, he would 
               <br />
               know that the member of East Grey dis- 
               <br />
               agreed with Sir John Macdonald on many 
               <br />
               of these questions in regard to provincial 
               <br />
               rights, and that the member for East Grey 
               <br />
               was as sincere then as he is to-day upon the
