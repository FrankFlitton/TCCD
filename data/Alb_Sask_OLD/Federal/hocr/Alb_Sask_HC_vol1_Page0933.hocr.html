               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> in the province of Quebec. A short time 
               <br />
               ago I was speaking with a gentleman from 
               <br />
               Ontario and I told him that in the city 
               <br />
               whence I come, we elected Protestants to 
               <br />
               public ofﬁces, and the answer I got from 
               <br />
               him was that we did that because the Pro- 
               <br />
               testant and the Englishman was the best 
               <br />
               man. Well, Sir, there are good Protestants 
               <br />
               and there are good French Canadians, but 
               <br />
               when it comes to a choice with us we elect 
               <br />
               a Protestant because we . want him to 
               <br />
               .know that we are anxious he should live 
               <br />
               in our midst and that though we are in 
               <br />
               the majority, we believe that those of his 
               <br />
               religion should know that amongst us they 
               <br />
               are trusted citizens. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Let</span> me point out that 
               <br />
               in 1867 there was an election in the county 
               <br />
               of BeauceI a county which at_that time 
               <br />
               had a population of 26,600, there being only 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">304</span> English—speaking Protestants in the 
               <br />
               county. An <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,English</span> Protestant named 
               <br />
               Pozer was elected for that county of Beauce 
               <br />
               by a majority of 530. Perhaps my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) will 
               <br />
               say that he was the better man of the two. 
               <br />
               Well, let me tell him that Mr. Pozer’s op- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ponent</span> at that time was a Frenchman and a 
               <br />
               Catholic who is to—day the chief justice of 
               <br />
               the Supreme Court of Canada. In 1872 there 
               <br />
               was another election in Beauce and Mr. 
               <br />
               1-‘ozer, a Protestant and an Englishman 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> elected by 1,150 majority over his 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French</span> and Catholic opponent. His op- 
               <br />
               ponent at that time was not Sir Elzear 
               <br />
               Taschereau, but Judge Blanchet of the 
               <br />
               Court of Appeals, the highest tribunal in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec. At the next election 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1874,</span> Mr. Pozer was elected by accla- 
               <br />
               mation. "hat is toleration. Be it the result 
               <br />
               of separate schools or the result of any- 
               <br />
               thing else, it shows broad-mindedness and 
               <br />
               it shows that the French Canadian people 
               <br />
               have respect and sympathy for their fellow- 
               <br />
               citizens of the Protestant faith. Had it not

               . been for some of the statements made by

               <br />
               I would not mention these things, because 
               <br />
               they are of so constant occurrence in the

               stance. The city council of Three Rivers——

               that city which, out of a population of 13,- 
               <br />
               000 has only 300 Protestants—has always 
               <br />
               an English Protestant among its members. 
               <br />
               We never form a city council <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.without</span>

               English Protestant. Now, do not for a mo-
