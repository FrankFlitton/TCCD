               Mr. INGRAM. It does seem a singular 
               <br />
               idea in view of what was done in regard to 
               <br />
               Manitoba. They were given two for the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst 17,000, then three for 50,000 and they 
               <br />
               are supposed to have an additional senator 
               <br />
               ‘for every 25,000 people or something like 
               <br />
               that. Supposing that in 1912 these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces should be represented in this House 
               <br />
               by a large number of members who sat on 
               <br />
               the opposition side and that there was a 
               <br />
               minority of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span> supporting the 
               <br />
               government ; suppose that in 1912 the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the opposition representing these 
               <br />
               two provinces set up the claim that they 
               <br />
               were entitled to a greater representation in 
               <br />
               the Senate and the government said: No, 
               <br />
               we refuse to give it to you. The govern- 
               <br />
               ment might undertake to punish these two 
               <br />
               provinces because they sent a larger number 
               <br />
               of opposition supporters than government 
               <br />
               supporters. Why make it possible for such 
               <br />
               a condition to arise ? Why not enact some 
               <br />
               such provision as was suggested by the 
               <br />
               premier of the Northwest Territories, but 
               <br />
               not to the same extent, that they be given 
               <br />
               representation now for a certain number, 
               <br />
               and that when the population increases by 
               <br />
               n certain number they will be entitled to a 
               <br />
               greater representation automatically. The

               <br />

               rived at by the government make it accord—

               <br />
               representation. I do not say you must base 
               <br />

               <br />
               the original scheme of confederation took 
               <br />
               more account of population than did the 
               <br />
               constitution of the United States.
