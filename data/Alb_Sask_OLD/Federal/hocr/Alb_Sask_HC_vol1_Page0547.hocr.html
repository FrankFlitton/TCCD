               <br />
               friend who has just sat down. I was pleased 
               <br />
               to ‘learn that the hon. gentleman is not a 
               <br />
               lawyer, because I naturally supposed that 
               <br />
               he would take pains to steer clear of the 
               <br />
               constitutional question which has taken up 
               <br />
               so much of our time. I think we might well 
               <br />
               leave that question to be thrashed out by 
               <br />
               the lawyers who, so far as We can judge, 
               <br />
               will leave it just as hazy as it was when 
               <br />
               they entered the discussion. And after 
               <br />
               we shall have heard all the learned argu- 
               <br />
               ments advanced by the gentlemen of the

               legal profession on the one side or__ the 
               <br />
               other, I have no doubt that we shall come 
               <br />
               back to the same conclusion which has al- 
               <br />
               ways prevailed in the past, and that is that 
               <br />
               it is their duty to make black appear white 
               <br />
               And as that is part of 
               <br />
               their business, I am glad to know that I am

               perhaps, what I might call an understand-

               At all events the observation was made

               that in assenting to an early adjournment

               on the other hand, it is the duty of the

               courts to interpret them, and whether we 
               <br />
               arrive at the conclusion that this Bill is 
               <br />
               ultra vires or otherwise, I presume the end 
               <br />
               will be that it will have to go to the Privy 
               <br />
               Council. And as that court is composed of 
               <br />
               human beings who are also lawyers, the 
               <br />
               probability is that they will give a decision 
               <br />
               according to the temper in which they are 
               <br />
               and according as their digestion is good 
               <br />
               or had. We shall therefore have to wait 
               <br />
               for their decision to decide whether this 
               <br />
               Bill is legal or not. But I venture to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say,</span> 
               <br />
               that the free and independent elector, the 
               <br />
               ordinary man, as he reads the 92nd clause 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act, will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have.</span> 
               <br />
               no hesitation in concluding that so far as 
               <br />
               education is concerned, that is a question’ 
               <br />
