               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">questions</span> were determined in the afﬁrmative.

               We come now to the Northwest Territo— 
               <br />
               ries, with which we have more immediately 
               <br />
               to deal, and I ﬁnd in 1875 there was a con- 
               <br />
               solidation of the laws aﬁecting that coun- 
               <br />
               try. Chapter 49, 38 Victoria, section 
               <br />
               11 introduces into that country, the same 
               <br />
               principle of separate schools as we ﬁnd pro- 
               <br />
               vided for in the British North America Act 
               <br />
               and as we ﬁnd existing in other provinces. 
               <br />
               This legislaton was enacted, when Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics and Protestants in the Territories 
               <br />
               were probably about equal in number. Cer- 
               <br />
               tainly it was adopted by this parliament al- 
               <br />
               most without dissent, or objection, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques«</span> 
               <br />
               tion. It was accepted by the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest loyally and lived up to with cer-

               minority down to the present day. It sub- 
               <br />
               stantially existed fpr thirty years and was

               lived up to by the people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               loyally and accepted by them harmoniously. 
               <br />
               This brings me to a stage in my address, 
               <br />
               where I desire to make my remarks 
               <br />
               as brief as possible, and where I feel 
               <br />
               compelled to refer more especially to 
               <br />
               the system of education which prevails 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories. We have 
               <br />
               had it described by two gentlemen who 
               <br />
               have addressed the House, one on either 
               <br />
               side; and from the best examination I can 
               <br />
               make of that system in the ordinances of 
               <br />
               the Territories and from the reports of 
               <br />
               the superintendent of education for the 
               <br />

               <br />
               I think I can safely rely on the description 
               <br />
               given by the hon. the Finance Minister and

               What is there, Sir, in all this to which 
               <br />
               anybody can take exception? These details 
               <br />
               constitute the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">essential</span> elements of a na- 
               <br />
               tional school system. That system prevails 
               <br />
               to-day in the Northwest Territories, and 
               <br />
               that system we propose to continue by the 
               <br />
               legislation which we have presented in this 
               <br />
               House. Well, there is still a shadow of dif— 
               <br />
               ference. The difference between a minority 
               <br />
               school and a. majority school in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories is so exceedingly small 
               <br />
               that he who would attempt to make a de- 
               <br />
               ﬁnition of it would ﬁnd himselt in diﬁlculty. 
               <br />
               The difference is with respect to one half 
               <br />
               hour’s instruction in religious matters at the 
               <br />
               close of the school. The school laws of the 
               <br />
               Northwest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> provide for religious 
               <br />
               instruction, not as a matter of obligation, but 
               <br />
               they empower the trustees to authorize religi- 
               <br />
               ous instruction within a certain limit. That 
               <br />
               authority for religious instruction is not con- 
               <br />
               ﬁned to separate schools, it applies to all 
               <br />
               schools in the Territories. It is provided that 
               <br />
               wherever the trustees so wish, wherever the
