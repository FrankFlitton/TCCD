               of 1861, which was then in round numbers 
               <br />
               1,400,000 souls, or 1,396,000 souls. It is 
               <br />
               distributed equally. Quebec received 80

               <br />

               were paid 80 cents per head until they 
               <br />
               reached the maximum of 400,000 souls. It 
               <br />
               was obviously impossible to accept this 
               <br />
               maximum for the provinces of Saskatche-

               wan and Alberta, because already the two

               together have a population which exceeds 
               <br />
               the minimum limit of 400,000 souls, so we

               have suggested that the gradation should 
               <br />
               go on until they have reached in each pro-

               <br />
               been proposed from time to time that that 
               <br />
               limitation should be removed, and that as 
               <br />
               the provinces increased in population the 
               <br />
               amount of their allowance should also in-

               <br />
               has been a ﬁxed limitation in the provinces 
               <br />
               we are making this analogous to it, making 
               <br />
               a liberal allowance for the growth of the 
               <br />
               provinces.

               Mr. SPROULE. There have been many 
               <br />
               applications from Quebec and the other 
               <br />
               provinces for a. readjustment of their sub- 
               <br />
               sidies and we know that from the maritime 
               <br />
               provinces in the last few years there have 
               <br />
               been representations of this kind. In the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst instance, as I understand, they all re- 
               <br />
               ceived 80 cents a head and they were to 
               <br />
               receive that up to a limit of population; 
               <br />
               that was regarded as a ﬁxed and proper 
               <br />
               sum which each should have. In view 
               <br />
               of these repeated applications from the dif— 
               <br />
               ferent provinces does the government think 
               <br />
               that they are justiﬁed in ﬁxing the new 
               <br />
               provinces at the same sum now? If the 
               <br />
               experience of the past has proven that that 
               <br />
               is not enough. would this not be the proper 
               <br />
               time for them to consider what is a proper 
               <br />
               amount and ﬁx it at that sum for the new 
               <br />
               provinces at the present time. rather than 
               <br />
               have to go over the Whole question when 
               <br />
               applications are received from the various 
               <br />
               provinces for an increase of their subsidy ?- 
               <br />
               If you consider applications from Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia. New Brunswick, Prince Edward ls- 
               <br />
               land. Quebec. Ontario and Manitoba. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> 
               <br />
               would have to consider the case of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories as well. and this may 
               <br />
               occur next year. It seems to me that our 
               <br />
               experience ought to enable us to determine 
               <br />
               very well whether this is the correct sum 
               <br />
               or not, and if it is not a large enough sum 
               <br />
               we should strike the present rate for the 
               <br />
