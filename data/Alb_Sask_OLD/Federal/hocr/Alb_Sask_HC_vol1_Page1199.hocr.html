               <br />

               a country where there is a constitution as 
               <br />

               the House ought to be submitted to the 
               <br />
               people in a general election. In the United 
               <br />
               States, if a great constitutional change is 
               <br />
               proposed, it must be submitted to all the 
               <br />
               states for consideration before it can become 
               <br />
               law; and in countries organized under a 
               <br />
               constitution such as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Switzerland,</span> before a 
               <br />
               constitutional change can take place, there 
               <br />

               Now, in Canada, this Bill proposing great

               constitutional issues, was brought down to

               parliament without any intimation to the

               people at the last general election that such 
               <br />

               people were led to believe that no constitu-

               diately the session was opened this Bill

               people of the whole country, I certainly say,

               <br />
               in North Oxford, and the vacancy that I 
               <br />
               think ought to occur in the House, if the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman has conﬁdence in the

               be a vacancy in London. In view, then, of 
               <br />
               these two vacancies, or one vacancy, which- 
               <br />
               ever it may be, I say it is the duty of the

               right hon. gentleman to cause writs to be

               <br />
               those two elections, in Ontario, and to give

               the people of Ontario, that province which

               province—to give the people of that province 
               <br />
               an opportunity to answer the contention, 
               <br />
               which, I believe, is held by the Prime Min-

               opportunity to justify before the people of 
               <br />
               their province the policy which they are 
               <br />
               now advocating in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[this</span> House. Until that 
               <br />
               is done, I say the hon. gentleman cannot ask 
               <br />
               that any progress be made in connection 
               <br />
               with this constitutional Bill now before the 
               <br />
               House; in fact, I do not think this House 
               <br />
               will be justiﬁed in making any progress 
               <br />
               whatever, or progress of the most secondary 
               <br />
               character in a Bill of this kind. But, on the 
               <br />
               contrary, these vacancies ought to be ﬁlled. 
               <br />
               the writs ought to be issued for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elections,</span> 
               <br />
               and an appeal ought to be made to the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of Ontario, and then we will know 
               <br />
               whether those hon. gentlemen are right, or 
               <br />
               whether their principal organ, the Toronto 
               <br />
               ‘Globe,’ is correct in the view which they 
               <br />
               take of this great constitutional changes 
               <br />
               which is involved in the school laws of the 
               <br />
               new provinces. The ‘ Globe’ says it is con— 
               <br />
               stitutionally wrong, that it is wrong as a 
               <br />
               matter of policy, whereas the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men say their policy is right and that they 
               <br />
               are prepared to justify it in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario. Then they must justify it under 
               <br />
               these circumstances in these constituencies 
               <br />
               of Ontario, and—they must justify it now. 
               <br />
               If they hold back these elections. the in- 
               <br />
               ference will be that they are afraid to dis— 
               <br />
               cuss their policy in that province. Surely 
               <br />
               there is no lack of men. I imagine that the
