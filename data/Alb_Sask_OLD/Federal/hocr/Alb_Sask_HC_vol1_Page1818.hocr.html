               <br />
               answer from him in 1896. In Ontario he 
               <br />
               was for investigation, he wanted to ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               the facts; but one thing was sure, there 
               <br />
               would be no coercion. But in Quebec the 
               <br />
               Remedial Bill did not go far enough to suit 
               <br />
               him ; if it were true that the schools were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestant</span> schools, he would do more than 
               <br />
               the Conservatives could do to remedy the 
               <br />
               grievance of the Catholics ; only put him in 
               <br />
               power, and when he was in power every- 
               <br />
               body would be happy; if he could not 
               <br />
               settle the question by conciliation, he would 
               <br />
               take strong means to provide by the consti- 
               <br />
               tution. And he came into power. And what 
               <br />
               has he done? He has satisﬁed that ele- 
               <br />
               ment which led him to take the position he 
               <br />
               did on the Remedial Bill; he has satisﬁed 
               <br />
               the strong Protestant element, which is hon— 
               <br />
               estly convinced that the future safety of 
               <br />
               this country lies in keeping the French 
               <br />
               Canadians and Catholics in a secondary 
               <br />

               <br />
               kind, and those the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has pleased. And to-day—yes, this very 
               <br />
               moment, while I am speaking—the Catholic 
               <br />
               minority in Winnipeg are obliged to pay a 
               <br />
               double tax for education. In the ﬁrst place, 
               <br />
               they must pay for the support of the sepa- 
               <br />
               rate schools; and, as they cannot con- 
               <br />
               scientiously send their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.children</span> to those 
               <br />
               schools, they must pay for the education of 
               <br />
               their children elsewhere. And the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister knows that these people have had 
               <br />
               no redress of these grievances. He knows 
               <br />
               also that in the other parts of the province 
               <br />
               any rights that the Catholics enjoy With 
               <br />
               regard to education are not guaranteed by 
               <br />
               the law—but only exist by tolerance— 
               <br />
               I hope that the situation will not grow 
               <br />
               worse. The present provincial govern— 
               <br />
               ment is Conservative, and I hope that 
               <br />
               they will secure to the Catholics what they 
               <br />
               already have. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘But</span> I am convinced that if 
               <br />
               a Liberal government got into power in 
               <br />
               that province, in twenty-four hours they 
               <br />
               would take away the privileges, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,such</span> as

               they are, which the Roman Catholics en-

               joy. But there has come a day of reckon- 
               <br />
               ing. When the right hon. gentleman (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) was charged with the duty 
               <br />
               of establishing two provinces in the North- 
               <br />
               west, he said—probably prompted by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick)—we 
               <br />
               must try to redeem ourselves in those pro- 
               <br />
               vinces: our case has gone bad in Manito- 
               <br />
               ba, and we cannot rehabilitate ourselves 
               <br />
               there. He had promised that he would 
               <br />
               send Mr. Mowat to Manitoba. ‘Father of 
               <br />
               all the Roman Catholics of Ontario,’ they 
               <br />
               used to call him in Quebec ; no one so good 
               <br />
               as Mr. Mowat. But he never went; but 
               <br />
               they sent another gentleman there. Well, 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice and the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister decided that they would do something 
               <br />
               for the people of the Northwest, and so 
               <br />
               they introduced this Bill with its original 
               <br />
               clause 16. Now, the original clause 16 was 
               <br />
               good. It expressed the ﬁrst idea of these

               And yesterday the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               presented his amended clause. Now, let us 
               <br />
               not play upon words. We have been trying 
               <br />
               here for weeks to ﬁnd out what is the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerence</span> between the ﬁrst clause 16 and 
               <br />
               the second clause 16. And that is going to 
               <br />
               be a great game in the country. In Quebec 
               <br />
               they will say‘ that the two clauses are the 
               <br />
               same thing. And that is.the reason for my 
               <br />
               amendment—I want to make it clear that 
               <br />
               there will not be any mistake about it. 
               <br />
               And in Ontario they will say, as the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of Finance (Mr. Fielding) and the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Customs (Mr. Paterson) and others 
               <br />
               have said, that there is really nothing in 
               <br />
               clause 16 as it is now amended. Why, the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Centre York not only said 
               <br />
               that, but wrote it. He told his friends: 
               <br />
               Don't be anxious ; don’t lose sleep over this 
               <br />
               thing ; even ultra-Protestants need not fear; 
               <br />
               of course, we had to put something in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.the</span> 
               <br />
               Bill about separate schools, but this means 
               <br />
               nothing at all, and in three or four years 
               <br />
               there will not be a single separate school 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               And what is the reason why the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister has proposed this amendment? 
               <br />
               It seems to me that what 'he has done— 
               <br />
               to use a favourite expression of his own 
               <br />
               -is to give a stone for a loaf of. bread. 
               <br />
               I know that what I am now saying 
               <br />
               will be used to help the Liberals in On- 
               <br />
               tario—they will say that the member for 
               <br />
               Beauharnbis himself declared that there 
               <br />
               was nothing in this amended section. But 
               <br />
               we are here to speak the truth concerning 
               <br />
               matters that come before the House. If 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />
               wanted to be candid—and I Wish he would 
               <br />
               he—he would acknowledge that he was 
               <br />
               1 am convinced 
               <br />
               that had he stood up for clause 16 as it 
               <br />
               was originally drafted he would have car- 
               <br />
               ried it. But he got frightened. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) left the 
               <br />
               cabinet. But that was not what frightened 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister. My right hon. friend 
               <br />
               (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) is a lucky man; he 
               <br />
               was born under a lucky star. I think it 
               <br />
               was a good thing for him to get rid of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Brandon; and when the 
               <br />
               opportunity of doing so occurred, he took 
               <br />
               advantage of it in a very clever way. I do 
               <br />
               not want him to smile at that, because he 
               <br />
               must not show approval of what I say. But 
               <br />
               when my hon. friend the Minister of Fin— 
               <br />
               ance (Mr. Fielding) showed his teeth, that 
               <br />
               was a diﬁerent thing. The Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance is spoken of as the coming Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister when my right hon. friend (Sir Wil— 
               <br />
               frid Laurier) claims his right to rest. He 
               <br />
               is considered the strong man in the cabinet. 
               <br />
               There is no comparison between the one 
               <br />
               who left and the one who threatened to
