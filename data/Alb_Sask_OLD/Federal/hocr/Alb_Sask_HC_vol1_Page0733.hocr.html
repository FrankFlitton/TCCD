               Then follow the three subsections which 
               <br />
               are to be substituted for subsection 1 of 
               <br />
               section 93. It is hardly necessary to ob- 
               <br />
               serve again that we have here the bold, 
               <br />
               bald proposition to amend the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, an imperial Act—an impos- 
               <br />
               sibility. it appears to me that our power 
               <br />
               as the parliament of Canada is exhausted 
               <br />
               when we create a province, and that then 
               <br />
               section 93'automatically comes into effect. 
               <br />
               The general rule is contained in the body 
               <br />
               of section 93 which I have twice read to 
               <br />
               the House. But the body of the amended 
               <br />
               clause 16 says that the whole of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">section</span> 
               <br />
               93 as amended shall apply to Alberta and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, that is with the substitution 
               <br />
               for subsection 1 of section 93 of the three 
               <br />
               subsections of the amended clause 16. Why, 
               <br />
               let us ask, is this done? It is done because 
               <br />
               the government know that these restrictive 
               <br />
               subsections of sections 93 do not and can- 
               <br />
               not be made to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apply</span> as they stand and un- 
               <br />
               less, amended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bjo</span> the amended clause 16. 
               <br />
               And let us see Why that is so ‘? If we turn 
               <br />
               to the restrictive subsection 93 we rind 
               <br />
