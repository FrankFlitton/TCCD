               Sir \VILFRID LAURIER. I am glad that 
               <br />
               this debate is starting in such an auspicious 
               <br />
               manner and that both sides are apparently 
               <br />
               in very good humor and in a very good 
               <br />
               frame of mind for the discussion. When 
               <br />
               some time ago I presented this Bill to the 
               <br />
               House, I stated that there were certain ques- 
               <br />
               tions connected with it which were of para- 
               <br />
               mount importance and which in fact were 
               <br />
               the essence of the whole measure. The ﬁrst 
               <br />
               was the number of provinces to be created ; 
               <br />
               the second was the ownership of the land; 
               <br />
               the third was the ﬁnancial terms to be 
               <br />
               granted; and the last was the education 
               <br />
               system. My hon. friend the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. Borden) rose immediately 
               <br />
               after me, but confined his remarks for the 
               <br />
               moment to two of those questions only— 
               <br />
               the ownership of the lands and the school 
               <br />
               question. With regard to the ownership 
               <br />
               of the land, my hon. friend re-asserted the 
               <br />
               position he had often maintained on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this House as elsewhere, namely, that 
               <br />
               the land should go to the provinces to be 
               <br />
               owned and managed by them. On the school 
               <br />
               question my hon. friend was reserved. He 
               <br />
               did not announce any policy, but very wisely 
               <br />
               said that, in his judgment. the subject was 
               <br />
               one which ought to be approached with calm 
               <br />
               and moderation. The press which follows 
               <br />
               and supports my hon. friend took, notwith- 
               <br />
               standing this advice of his. a very different 
               <br />
               attitude. On the land question it said very 
               <br />
               little, if it said anything at all. but upon 
               <br />
               the school question it offered a very violent 
               <br />
               opposition. Perhaps I may not be out of 
               <br />

               In the course of the years I have been in 
               <br />
               this House, many have been the occasions in 
               <br />
               which parliament has had to face and to solve 
               <br />
               questions, simple enough in themselves, but 
               <br />
               complicated and rendered difﬁcult by sudden 
               <br />
               outbursts of passion. And here again I may 
               <br />
               repeat what I had the opportunity of saying 
               <br />
               some few days ago, that in using this word 
               <br />
               ‘passion.’ I do not want to convey any olïen- 
               <br />
               sive sense. I recognize, we all recognize, 
               <br />
               that passions are very often the outgrowth 
               <br />
               of noble sentiment; but let this sentiment 
               <br />
               be ever so meritorious, if it goes beyond a 
               <br />
               certain line, it may become blind, unthink- 
               <br />
               ing, unreasoning passion. In 1875 on the 
               <br />
               New Brunswick school question, in 1889 on 
               <br />
               the Jesuit Estates questions, in 1896 on the 
               <br />
               Manitoba school question, several parts of 
               <br />
               the country—now one part, now another—- 
               <br />
               were roused to a high pitch of excitement. 
               <br />

               Since my conduct on the present occasion 
               <br />
               has been assailed, perhaps I may be pardon- 
               <br />
               ed if I refer for one moment to myself, and 
               <br />
               say that upon every one of these questions, 
               <br />
               I have endeavoured, so far as I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know—‘and</span> 
               <br />
               successfully I think—to act on the very prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of the constitution under which we 
               <br />
               live. In 1875, being then a young man, 
               <br />
               I supported the government of Mr. Mac- 
               <br />
               kenzie which refused to interfere with 
               <br />
               certain legislation passed by the legislature 
               <br />
               of the provinces of Quebec of which the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic minority complained. That 
               <br />
               minority complained that this legislation 
               <br />
               was an invasion of their rights and forced 
               <br />
               an intolerableburden upon them. But, as 
               <br />
               it was established that at the time of con- 
               <br />
               federation New Brunswick had no system 
               <br />
               of separate schools, it followed as a con- 
               <br />
               sequence that this parliament had no juris— 
               <br />
               diction in the matter, and the government 
               <br />
               of Mr. Mackenzie, very properly, I think, 
               <br />
               refused to interfere and disallow that Act 
               <br />
               it was asked to disallow. In 1889, having 
               <br />
               become leader of the party to which I be- 
               <br />
               long, I supported the government of Sir 
               <br />
               John Macdonald when they refused to accede 
               <br />
               to the request of a section of our fellow 
               <br />
               countrymen to disallow the Act of the
