               gard. I do not know enough about the 
               <br />
               history of the province of British Columbia 
               <br />
               to be prepared to oﬁer an opinion upon the 
               <br />
               wisdom of the administration of the pub- 
               <br />
               lic domain of that province. I .know that 
               <br />
               in my own province I do not approve of 
               <br />
               the way the Crown lands have been admin- 
               <br />
               istered; they have been sold instead of 
               <br />
               being leased under proper control as to 
               <br />
               cutting upon them. In Quebec, as I un- 
               <br />
               derstand, there is a system of leasing 
               <br />
               which perhaps may not always have been 
               <br />
               carried out very wisely, and in Ontario 
               <br />
               there is also a system of leasing and I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be-</span>

               <br />
               that policy is reasonably practicable. It 
               <br />
               has been followed with great success in 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia with respect to minerals and

               interested than we can possibly be in the

               ferent reasons why I would like to see the 
               <br />
               land in the hands of the people there. I 
               <br />
               do not think the right policy is being fol-

               immigration arrangements that were intro— 
               <br />
               duced by the Interior Department, the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment were I believe giving each alter-

               nate quarter section to prospective settlers, 
               <br />
               and I think selling the next quarter section 
               <br />
               in order to raise a revenue sufﬁcient to carry 
               <br />
               on the management of the lands. Now it 
               <br />
               is proposed to hold these lands as a source 
               <br />
               of revenue. If this policy is carried out. 
               <br />
               we might ask ourselves how much revenue 
               <br />
               we are to get from it. If we have lost 
               <br />
               more than $1,000,000 in the past, will we

               the Interior (Mr. Sifton) when he proposed

               putting a motion of that kind some time ago, 
               <br />
               intended to allow the settler to have the 
               <br />
               opportunity of buying the quarter section

               <br />
               move in the right direction. It would be an 
               <br />
               improvement on the present policy of giving 
               <br />
               the quarter section at a nominal rate to 
               <br />
               seine company or partnership or individual 
               <br />
               who will hold the land for speculation. To 
               <br />
               allow such lands to be held for speculative 
               <br />
               purposes is a natural hinderamce to the 
               <br />
               settlement of the Northwest, because it aug- 
               <br />
               ments the price which the settler will eventu- 
               <br />
               ally have to pay ; and every dollar added to 
               <br />
               the price of the land is so much in the way 
               <br />
               of the settlement of that country. The 
               <br />
               proper policy would be to extend the present 
               <br />
               condition of giving a quarter section by pro- 
               <br />
               viding that the actual settler, who cultivates 
               <br />
               the ground, will have the opportunity of 
               <br />
               buying another quarter section at a reason- 
               <br />
               able price. To-day, after he gets the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               quarter section for nothing, he ﬁnds himself 
               <br />
               against the land of some speculator, and is 
               <br />
               forced to pay from $6 to $15 an acre before 
               <br />
               he can get the next quarter section. Two 
               <br />
               or three days ago I had a conversation with 
               <br />
               a man who tried to get land out there and 
               <br />
               found the diﬂiculty so great that he actually 
               <br />
               came back in disgust and refused to settle 
               <br />
               under the present conditions. These people 
               <br />
               say that if proper conditions were imposed, 
               <br />
               they would move out there this spring and 
               <br />
               become settlers, but of course greater in- 
               <br />
               ducements are given to Doukhobors and 
               <br />
               Galicians and so on than to the young men 
               <br />
               from other parts of Canada. One gentleman 
               <br />
               that I saw said that he went up there to a 
               <br />
               land ofﬁce and was pointed out a certain 
               <br />
               number of quarter sections upon which he 
               <br />
               might locate. After going out at consider- 
               <br />
               able <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expense</span> and selecting one, when he 
               <br />
               came back and tried to enter for location he 
               <br />
               was coolly told that they promised to hold 
               <br />
               it six months for some man in Ottawa, and 
               <br />
               that if he would wait until the spring and 
               <br />
               this man did not want the land. he could 
               <br />
               have it. After two or three similar experi- 
               <br />
               ences he came away in disgust, and has 
               <br />
               probably given up any notion of locating in 
               <br />
               the Northwest. If the present policy be con— 
               <br />
               tinued, it Will materially affect the settle- 
               <br />
               ment of that country. I do submit that if 
               <br />
               the people there had the management of the 
               <br />
               lands, they would administer it economically, 
               <br />
               promote settlement to a larger exent than is 
               <br />

               <br />
               money to this government. Even looking 
               <br />
