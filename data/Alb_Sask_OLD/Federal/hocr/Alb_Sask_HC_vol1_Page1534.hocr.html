               the opposition. If there are 1,000 Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics and 500 Protestants in a district 
               <br />
               -—I take no note of the others, because it 
               <br />
               seems to me they do not enter into the ac— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">count—the</span> 1,000 Catholics who are in the

               they think ﬁt. The next paragraph of the 
               <br />
               same section provides for the establishment 
               <br />
               of a Protestant separate school. It may 
               <br />
               be said that this interpretation would be 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conﬂict</span> with the power conferred upon

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iwhich</span> I meet that objection is this. I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{say</span> that the Act of 1875 intended that

               <br />
               was what was intended is evidenced by

               <br />
               Roman Catholic schools and the other of 
               <br />
               Protestant schools. It seems to me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               we are beside the question when we 
               <br />
               import into the interpretation of section

               Now, my hon. friend the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition argued this afternoon that we 
               <br />
               on this side of the House were wrong 
               <br />
