               In conclusion, let me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">observe</span> that if

               inferior to their sisters in confederation,

               the consequences will be more serious

               and fear of the people, leading inevitably, 
               <br />
               in my opinion, to dark and devious electoral

               the right hon. gentleman that it was just

               deception of the people, which eventually 
               <br />

               it is not so much with the idea of throwing

               The question submitted to the House has 
               <br />
               been discussed from the constitutional and

               which possibly, for the most part, have a1-

               sequently, I do not claim to have discovered. 
               <br />
               I shall omit discussing for the time being 
               <br />
               some enactments, disappointed as I am at

               having heard them construed in directly op-

               cerity on both sides. I must say that if 
               <br />
               there had not been enacted legislation pro-

               belonging to two distinct nationalities, we 
               <br />
               should pass such a law. Even if the minori-

               with which I do not by any means agree—I 
               <br />
               say we should grant them that right, not
