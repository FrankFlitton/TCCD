               <br />
               that has taken place in 100 years in which the 
               <br />
               clergy’s hand has not been seen '? I wonder 
               <br />
               if the Minister of the Interior were he to 
               <br />
               mentally recall those utterances of his in 
               <br />
               1895 when he said that during the last 100 
               <br />
               years there has not been a single instance 
               <br />
               where anything of an organizing character 
               <br />
               has taken place that the hand of the clergy 
               <br />
               has not been seen would claim, if he were to 
               <br />
               speak according to his honest convictions 
               <br />
               that the same thing is not occurring at the 
               <br />
               present day. He went on :
