               was, and we know where we were. That is 
               <br />
               what he said. I might ask, in view of subse- 
               <br />
               quent events, whether he knew where he was 
               <br />
               or not. One of our objects in coming here to- 
               <br />
               night is to help him to discover where he 
               <br />
               ought to be. We know that the people of the 
               <br />
               Dominion were not consulted; neither were 
               <br />
               the people of the west. We know that Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain and his colleagues were not consulted. 
               <br />
               we know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> neither the Minister of Interior 
               <br />
               nor the Minister of Finance were consulted. 
               <br />
               Do you know whether anybody else at Ottawa 
               <br />
               was consulted ? Have you heard whether the 
               <br />
               Papal Legate was consulted ? . Are you 
               <br />
               people of the west to be trampled upon by him? 
               <br />
               it is as a western man that I appeal to you 
               <br />
               to-night, and especially to the Liberal party, 
               <br />
               to let its voice be heard in no uncertain sound.

               no religious suggestion in the statement I

               <br />
               a word with regard to what has been dis- 
               <br />
               cussed a great deal—‘ We know that Mr.

               Haultain and his colleagues were not con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               stated that he was consulted in regard to 
               <br />
               everything except the matter of education.
