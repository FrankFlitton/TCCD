               prove to the people of the Territories that

               the government has been most careful and

               paternal in retaining the lands and under-

               lately about the boundaries established for 
               <br />
               these provinces, and the government has

               <br />
               Manitoba would be deprived of the beneﬁt 
               <br />

               lities of Manitoba. I do not wonder that 
               <br />
               every member from the Northwest Terri-

               <br />
               so decided and so urgent in his expressions 
               <br />
               of opinion on behalf of the people. It has 
               <br />
               been my good fortune lately to visit the dis-

               <br />
               trains and hotels and also in their homes, 
               <br />
               and I have found them practically unani- 
               <br />
               mous in the desire to be by themselves; 
               <br />
               and they want to have two provinces, or 
               <br />
               even three provinces established. lest there 
               <br />
               should be any risk of their being joined 
               <br />
               to Manitoba. The people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories are a business people, and they 
               <br />
               look at the question of provincial rights and 
               <br />

               <br />
               It is not the course of a man of the

               fully combined to make that new country

               prosperous. I will not undertake to discuss 
               <br />
               from the legal point of view the rights of 
               <br />
               the Crown Within the province or within the 
               <br />
               Dominion government. I am not gifted with 
               <br />
               the legal training or knowledge required to 
               <br />
               do so. But speaking from a common sense 
               <br />
               point of view, I believe that every man in 
               <br />
               the Northwest, as well as every man in the 
               <br />
               east. will admit that the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment has bought and paid for the lands 
               <br />
               of the Northwest. And now, when the 
               <br />
               parliament of Canada is called upon to give 
               <br />
               provincial rights and privileges to the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the two new provinces, it is our duty 
               <br />
               to give them the best we know and can 
               <br />
               give in order to ensure their development 
               <br />
               and future stability and prosperity. We are 
               <br />
               legislating for the happiness and proseprity 
               <br />
               of millions of Christian and British families 
               <br />
               that will be there at the end of the century, 
               <br />
               all united in a true Canadian sentiment, and, 
               <br />
               as I have said, at the same time in a true 
               <br />
               British sentiment, which will be to our ad- 
               <br />
               vantage. In this country we do not look 
               <br />
               forward to independence, and much less to 
               <br />
               annexation; we look for continued rela— 
               <br />
               tions with the mother country, and relations 
               <br />
               which will grow closer all the time. As I 
               <br />
               said, give us prosperity, give us trade, give 
               <br />
               us wheat, give us coal, give us gold, give 
               <br />
               us lumber in the west, and you will have a 
               <br />
               constantly growing sentiment of loyalty to 
               <br />
               the British empire all the time. We may 
               <br />
               expect to see, through a development of 
               <br />
               navigation in Hudson bay, a revolution in 
               <br />

               It has been said that Manitoba should have 
               <br />
               at once an extension of territory, if not 
               <br />
               to the west, then to the north. Mr.

               Speaker, we have a valuable countrv, the 
               <br />
               immense wealth of which is not yet 
               <br />
               suspected. I suspect it, perhaps, because I 
               <br />
               have taken an interest in it all my lifetime 
               <br />
               and made a lengthy visit into that country. 
               <br />
               I know that the people of my c0unty take 
               <br />
               a great interest in that country also. It is 
               <br />
               my practice at home. whenever I pass by a 
               <br />
               school house in the county of Gloucester to 
               <br />
               go in and give a few words of encourage- 
               <br />
               ment to the pupils, and I always make it a 
               <br />
               point to call their attention to the incon— 
               <br />
               ceivable possibilities of our extensive terri— 
               <br />
               tory to the Northwest, and to inspire in their 
               <br />
               breasts an irresistible sentiment of pat- 
               <br />
               riotism and pride in the immense prospects 
               <br />
               which the development of navigation to the 
               <br />
               Hudson bay will open up to all the people 
               <br />
               of Canada. In regard to the extension of 
               <br />
               the boundaries of Manitoba, I think the 
               <br />
               government of this country has acted wise- 
               <br />
               ly and prudently, and that the people of 
               <br />
               the west will in future thank them for it, 
               <br />
               because that development requires further 
               <br />
               study. It is a question that affects not
