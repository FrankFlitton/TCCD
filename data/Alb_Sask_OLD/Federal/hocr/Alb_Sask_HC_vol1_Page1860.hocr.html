               <br />
               ago it assumed great importance, but since then 
               <br />
               a further and still more important issue has 
               <br />
               cropped up, and that is that undue inﬂuences

               Now, Mr. Chairman, I have very little 
               <br />
               further to add in connection with this mat-

               ter. The issue between the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Cape Breton and myself was clearly 
               <br />
               and distinctly deﬁned. I made the asser— 
               <br />
               tion that the right hon. leader of the gov- 
               <br />
               _ernment had been interrogated on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this House as to whether he had been 
               <br />
               holding consultations with the Papal able- 
               <br />
               gate in connection with the educational 
               <br />
               clauses of this Bil-l or not and that although 
               <br />
               he had been interrogated he had not taken 
               <br />
               occasion to deny the assertion. I have 
               <br />
               read the statements of hon. members as re— 
               <br />
               ported in ‘ Hansard’ that the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister was so interrogated and the 
               <br />
               question comes down to this that if the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Cape Breton, as I said in 
               <br />
               my opening, appreciates the position that 
               <br />
               he has placed himself in by the statement 
               <br />
               he made at that meeting declaring the state— 
               <br />
               ment I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[made</span> to be false and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">slanderous</span> 
               <br />
               and oiferin-g <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«to</span> resign his seat if I could 
               <br />

               <br />
               upon the pages of ‘Hansard,’ he should 
               <br />
               carry out his undertaking. While I do not 
               <br />
               expect from an hon. member who would 
               <br />
               be so careless in making a statement such 
               <br />
               as that to which I have referred, which 
               <br />
               he is reported to have made in the ‘ Globe ’ 
               <br />

               resign his seat in the House I do think

               that the'least he could possibly do would

               with hon. gentlemen in this House. I am 
               <br />
               a stranger to many of you. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Bor- 
               <br />
               den) knows me. He knows the province 
               <br />
               from which I come. I put myself in his judg- 
               <br />
               ment if in the province from which I come 
               <br />
               and among the people Who know me my word 
               <br />
               would not be taken on a plain question of 
               <br />
               fact between the hon. gentleman who has 
               <br />
               just spoken and myself. I will at least ask 
               <br />
               the hon. members of this House to follow 
               <br />
               the ordinary common sense way of things 
               <br />
               and to consider how a circumstance of this 
               <br />
               kind would have been brought about. It 
               <br />
               is a well deﬁned and well understood rule 
               <br />
               of evidence that there mus-t be an order of 
               <br />
               common sense in the way things are brought 
               <br />
               about and a story is told. I will say that 
               <br />
               only a part of the truth has been stated By 
               <br />

               <br />
               the meeting in that campaign at which we 
               <br />
               met in North Oxford. It is quite true that I 
               <br />
               said I would bring this matter up in the 
               <br />
               House. It is well within the experience of 
               <br />
               every hon. member of this House that in dis-

               tween the hon. member and myself very

               often things take place and expressions made

               Oxford election is over. It resulted favour- 
               <br />
               ably to us, we were triumphant, we are re- 
               <br />
               joicing in the victory, and I thought it 
               <br />
               would be a small business on my part to

               too glad to meet him. I have taken part 
               <br />
               in campaigns not only in my own province 
               <br />
               but in other provinces, and in these cam-_
