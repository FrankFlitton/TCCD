               it said that one statute represents the con- 
               <br />
               stitution, and that we are bound this way 
               <br />
               or bound that way. Sir, whether it be the 
               <br />
               Act of 1867 or the Act of 1871 or the Act of 
               <br />
               1875 which governs the creation of these 
               <br />
               provinces, I submit that there is one special 
               <br />
               provision which does govern the rights of 
               <br />
               the provinces themselves. If by reading the 
               <br />
               Acts from 1867 to 1886 together we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the provinces have the power to make 
               <br />
               laws with regard to education, Why should 
               <br />
               we in this Bill deprive them of the right to 
               <br />
