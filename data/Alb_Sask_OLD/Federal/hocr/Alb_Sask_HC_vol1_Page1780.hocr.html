               It is well we should know exactly what

               the position <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was,</span> viewed from a different 
               <br />
               point of View. I entirely agree with my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend the Prime Minister in the 
               <br />
               words he uttered this afternoon when he 
               <br />
               said that if we want to build up a nation 
               <br />
               we can only do it on the principle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> con-

               ciliation and fair—play to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">everybody.</span> But if 
               <br />
               we are to put such a principle into practise 
               <br />
               there must be one law for all—one law for 
               <br />
               Protestants <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and.</span> Catholics alike, one law for 
               <br />
               French, English, Scotch and Irish. What 
               <br />
               has been done by the territorial government 
               <br />
               would be qualiﬁed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> an infamous act of

               <br />
               condemn as infamous if done by a Catholic 
               <br />
               government at the expense of a Protestant

               Protestant government at the'expense of a

               Catholic minority? I leave it to the gov-

               ernment to decide what difference there is 
               <br />
               between the two cases. But that is not the

               proved that it is inaccurate. Although that

               provision is to be found in the ordinance of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1884,</span> it was never put into force. In the

               ordinances of 1885, 1886, 1887 and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1888.</span> full 
               <br />
               liberty was given separate schools so far 
               <br />
               as religious teaching is concerned. It was 
               <br />
               only in 1892 that, for the ﬁrst time, was 
               <br />
               applied the ordinance limiting the right of 
               <br />
               religious instruction in these schools. On 
               <br />
               this point I want to correct a mistake made, 
               <br />
               not only by Protestants. but by Catholic 
               <br />
               members of this House. What we ask is not 
               <br />
               that the catechism be taught for half an 
               <br />
               hour during the time given to religious în— 
               <br />
               struction. I have been in one of those 
               <br />
               church schools in the province of Quebec, 
               <br />
               and there all the teaching of catechism we 
               <br />
               had only took up one hour a week. But 
               <br />
               what we claim as inseparable from separate 
               <br />
               schools is that in the teaching of history.
