               to sacriﬁce principle; he has shown such 
               <br />
               a willingness to deceive the people of this

               I have said, Sir, that his political career 
               <br />
               since 1896 has been characterized by insin- 
               <br />
               cerity, deceit and pandering to outside <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in«</span> 
               <br />
               ﬂuences. Now, it would be unfair to the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman to make that asser- 
               <br />
               tion unless I were able to offer some reli- 
               <br />
               able evidence in support of it. Let me, 
               <br />
               then, offer to the House a few illust'ations 
               <br />
               to prove the assertions I have made.

               Perhaps the greatest question that has 
               <br />
               engaged the attention of the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman and his government since 1896 
               <br />
               is the trade question. When the right hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle-man</span> received the suffrages of the 
               <br />
               people of this country in 1896, and prior to 
               <br />
               that time, what was his attitude upon that 
               <br />
               question ? I might go almost so far as to 
               <br />
               say that he was an avowed free trader. He 
               <br />
               was taken to be a strong advocate of the 
               <br />
               principle of free trade. I cannot say that 
               <br />
               he was a champion of free trade—and here 
               <br />
               comes in the evidence. We all remember 
               <br />
               the speeches delivered by the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman on that question in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, and also his speeches in the prov- 
               <br />
               ince of Ontario; we know how his speeches 
               <br />
               in one province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁered</span> from his speeches 
               <br />
               in the other. It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perfeﬁly</span> evident 
               <br />
               to any one who takes the trouble to 
               <br />
               read those speeches and consider them that 
               <br />
               on that important branch of public policy, 
               <br />
               he was playing a double part and was de- 
               <br />
               ceiving the people of this country. When 
               <br />
               he came into power in 1896, he was not 
               <br />
               satisﬁed apparently with the deception 
               <br />
               that be practiced up to that time; but
