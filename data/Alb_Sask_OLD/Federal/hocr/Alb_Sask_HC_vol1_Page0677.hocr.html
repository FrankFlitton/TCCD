               <br />
               the question we are now discussing is one 
               <br />
               of the most important that has come before 
               <br />
               the House, at any rate since I have had the 
               <br />
               honour of having a seat in this parliament. 
               <br />
               Representing as I do my native constituency; 
               <br />
               a constituency in which there are all classes, 
               <br />
               all creeds, and all nationalities which go 
               <br />
               to make up our great Canadian national 
               <br />
               life, I feel that I am not representing here 
               <br />
               the sentiment of Protestants alone, nor the 
               <br />
               sentiments of Roman Catholics alone, but I 
               <br />
               feel it is my duty to endeavour to arrive at 
               <br />
               a conclusion on this subject upon grounds 
               <br />
               which can. appeal to the conscience of all 
               <br />
               men, irrespective of their particular faith. 
               <br />
               I have the good fortune to speak in this 
               <br />
               debate after the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sti—ath-</span> 
               <br />
               cona (Mr. P. Talbot), a gentleman for whom I 
               <br />
               have a very high esteem; a gentleman who 
               <br />
               was in charge of one of the largest educa- 
               <br />
               tional institutions in my town for years, 
               <br />
               and a gentleman who took a very active 
               <br />
               and prominent part in one of the strongest 
               <br />
               . Protestant organizations in the county of 
               <br />
               Stormont. I was much pleased to hear his 
               <br />
               opinions in regard to the school system in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, because I know 
               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman having had wide 
               <br />
               experience in educational matters, not only 
               <br />
               in eastern Canada but in western Canada 
               <br />
               was in a position to speak authoritatively on 
               <br />
               the matter. The hon. gentleman (Mr. P. 
               <br />
               Talbot) has told us what the present posi- 
               <br />
               tion of educational matters in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories is, and it is well that we 
               <br />
               should consider that position of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> in 
               <br />
               connection with the consideration of the 
               <br />
               proposals contained in the present Bill. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Strathcona has told us 
               <br />
               that in his opinion .the educational system 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories to-day is the 
               <br />
               best in the Dominion of Canada, and, as a 
               <br />
               reason for this belief he quoted from the 
               <br />
               Ordinances of 1901, to which I shall refer 
               <br />
               later. Sir, in forming our opinion on this 
               <br />
               question it is well that we should go back 
               <br />
               in Canadian history, in order that we may 
               <br />
               thoroughly understand the genesis of the 
               <br />
               whole issue. I shall not detain the House 
               <br />
               with a recital of What occurred away back 
               <br />
               in the ﬁfties; I shall not detain the House 
               <br />
               with the story of what occurred in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario in 1863. We know that 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Liberalﬂonsewaﬁve</span> party was formed 
               <br />
               111 1854; we know that the policy of the 
               <br />
               Liberal-Conservative party was a most gen- 
               <br />
               erous and broad-minded policy, and we 
               <br />
               know that it met with the greatest opposi-

               ‘ Globe ’ newspaper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> 1854 down to 1863,

               them the action taken at that time by the 
               <br />
               Liberals in Ontario. Let me simply say 
               <br />
               that in the ‘Globe’ of August 1857, our 
               <br />
               French Canadian Conservatives under 
               <br />
               George E. Cartier were described as ‘the 
               <br />
               Pope’s brass band.’ That was the keynote 
               <br />
               of the agitation that was kept up year in 
               <br />
               and year out throughout the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario, against the Conservative party led 
               <br />
               by the Right Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald. 
               <br />
               And, Sir, I could speak of the agitation led 
               <br />
               by the ‘ Globe’ at a later date in 1896, and 
               <br />
               I could speak of the position taken by the 
               <br />
               ‘Globe’ in this very year in reference to 
               <br />
               the Bill now before the House. But, Sir, 
               <br />
               there is no room in this land for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">venti:</span>

               foundations of our union. And, Sir, I may

               justly claim that the Conservative party 
               <br />
               played a very important part in laying the 
               <br />
               basis of that union. For years after con- 
               <br />
               federation the Conservative party wielded 
               <br />
               the destinies of this country, and when they 
               <br />
               were called upon to lay down the reins of 
               <br />
               oﬂice they were able to hand over to their 
               <br />
               successors a united British North America, 
               <br />

               <br />
               It is therefore that I can justly claim that 
               <br />
               the history of the Conservative party is a 
               <br />
               history of which this young nation may

               is any moral obligation upon the people of 
               <br />
               this country to do justice to the minority 
               <br />
               in the Northwest ; I shall leave that entirely 
               <br />
               for the House to say. But, let us look back 
               <br />
               on the history of these Territories to the 
               <br />
               year 1869, and let us see the position of edu- 
               <br />
               cational matters then. There had for years 
               <br />
               previously existed in that country a number 
               <br />
               of schools for children. These schools were 
               <br />
               denominational schools, some of them be- 
               <br />
               ing regulated and controlledby the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic Church and others by various Pro- 
               <br />
               testant denominations. The moneys neces- 
               <br />
               sary for the support of the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               schod'ls were supplied to some extent by 
               <br />
               school fees paid by some of the parents of 
               <br />
