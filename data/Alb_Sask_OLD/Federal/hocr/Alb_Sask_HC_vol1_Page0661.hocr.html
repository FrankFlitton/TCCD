               Mr. O. TU'RGEON (Gloucester). Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, at this late hour of the evening, in 
               <br />
               the closing hours of a long week’s labour, 
               <br />
               and at this advanced stage of this most im- 
               <br />
               portant debate which has brought forth elo- 
               <br />
               quence seldom heard within the walls of 
               <br />
               this House, I would certainly not rise at all 
               <br />
               but that the noble sentiments that have been 
               <br />
               expressed on both sides of this House, not- 
               <br />
               withstanding occasional divergences, have 
               <br />
               recalled some other sentiments, the sentiment 
               <br />
               of gratitude and others, which one entertains 
               <br />
               according to his own particular experiences 
               <br />
               in life. I wish to say, Mr. Speaker, that 
               <br />
               born under the heavens of French Quebec, 
               <br />
               carried away in my early years to other 
               <br />
               shores in search of brothers lost, whom I 
               <br />
               knew merely by the history of their heroes 
               <br />
               and martyrs, I heard my name graced with 
               <br />
               kindly expressions of sympathy and best 
               <br />
               wishes from the Scotch people, the English 
               <br />
               people and the Irish people happily settled 
               <br />
               in various districts of the extensive county 
               <br />
               of Gloucester, which I now have the honour 
               <br />
               to represent. I at once was struck by the 
               <br />
               vivid expressions of sympathy and the ex- 
               <br />
               uberance of the cordial feelings of these 
               <br />
               peoples, who were the ﬁrst to inspire my 
               <br />
               political ambition, who left their homes, 
               <br />
               their ﬁelds, their ﬁshing boats to go to the 
               <br />
               polls to vote for me when my own kindred 
               <br />
               people had not yet thought proper to do so. 
               <br />
               This, Mr. Speaker, was at a time when 
               <br />
               the echoes of the patriotic eloquence of 
               <br />
               Joseph Howe were still vibrating through 
               <br />
               the hills and valleys of New Brunswick and 
               <br />
               the Metapedia, on the onward wave towards 
               <br />
               the western provinces which were soon to 
               <br />
               be united with the rest of Canada by ties 
               <br />
               stronger than the iron rails and bridges of 
               <br />
               the great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">national</span> highway which Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia's patriot had so happily dreamed of 
               <br />
               —the more lasting the nobler ties of fratern- 
               <br />
               ity, equality, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justice</span> and charity. It was 
               <br />
               only a few years afterwards that the fathers 
               <br />
               of confederation, representing the different 
               <br />
               provinces of British North America, met 
               <br />
               together. May I name some of them Whose 
               <br />
               names are still perhaps more familiar than 
               <br />
               others to the people at large? Sir John A.

               many virtues of its many races, has made

               good progress in the development of the re-

               sources which nature has lavished upon her 
               <br />
               until Canada is certain to be one of the 
               <br />
               great nations of the twentieth century, and, 
               <br />
               according to the creed of my faith, the 
               <br />
               greatest Christian nation of the world. Not

               half a century has yet elapsed since those 
               <br />
               days, and we see all the progress which 
               <br />
               Canada has made, incomparable to that of 
               <br />
               any other nation. The United States has had 
               <br />
               its time of great progress, but its growth 
               <br />
               in moral as well as material progress is not 
               <br />
               to be compared with that of Canada during 
               <br />
               the last eight or ten years. We have had 
               <br />
               the advantage of bringing Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island into the union; we have had the ad- 
               <br />
               vantage of bringing in British Columbia, 
               <br />
               which, with its immense resources, in lum- 
               <br />
               ber, in gold, in lands, “in ﬁsheries, is sure 
               <br />
               to become an immense factor in the develop- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada. We have added the great 
               <br />
               Northwest, to which the attention of the 
               <br />
               nations of the world has lately been directed 
               <br />
               by a progressive policy of immigration which 
               <br />
               has never been equalled by any other na- 
               <br />
               tion, not even by the United States; and to- 
               <br />
               day we are called upon to give to that ter- 
               <br />
               ritory all the rights and liberties and privi- 
               <br />
               leges which the constitution permits us to 
               <br />
               give, commensurate with its importance, 
               <br />
               with the requirements of its progress, both 
               <br />
               moral and material, and with the immense

               <br />
               tains in greater quantity than any other— 
               <br />
               resources of land, resources of forest in 
               <br />
               most districts, minerals of all kinds—re- 
               <br />
               sources which have been lying there unde- 
               <br />
               veloped for centuries, which are appealing 
               <br />
               to human intelligence and to human ac- 
               <br />
               tivity for their development in the interest 
               <br />
               of the Canadian people; where millions will 
               <br />
               certainly live in the years to come, and will 
               <br />
               work together in unity, like the people of 
               <br />
               the older provinces; where the French, the 
               <br />
               English, the Scotch, the Irish and the Ger- 
               <br />
               mans will all seek to give the country the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of their labours and of their intelli- 
               <br />
               gence in order to bring the Nor-hwest Terri-

               tories to the head of this great nation, which 
               <br />
               are certainly capable of raising sufﬁcient

               <br />
               by the British people in the cities of England 
               <br />
               or Scotland. In those provinces, by the in-

               terchange of trade and commerce, not only 
               <br />
               the true Canadian sentiment but the true

               British sentiment will be kept up, for these
