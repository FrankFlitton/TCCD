               argument clearer. It seems to me that the

               trend of the argument on the other side up 
               <br />

               Mr. OLIVER. That and that alone. Now, 
               <br />
               if I understand the position of this side, it 
               <br />
               is that the population is one basis, but be— 
               <br />
               sides there should be considered also other 
               <br />
               elements—area, prospects and possibilities, 
               <br />
               community of interest. And we point to the 
               <br />
               example of every distribution of seats in 
               <br />
               every province of the Dominion ever since 
               <br />
               there was a Dominion. We say that our 
               <br />
               policy is that which has governed every party 
               <br />
               in every province, in every distribution. If 
               <br />
               that does not convince hon. gentlemen oppo- 
               <br />
               site that we are in the right, we simply fail 
               <br />
               to convince them, and there is no need to 
               <br />
               prolong the argument. If we, with the whole 
               <br />
               history of the country on our side cannot 
               <br />
               convince them, they can hardly hope to con— 
               <br />
               vince us. I have no hesitation in saying that 
               <br />
               their proposal, if carried into eﬂfect would 
               <br />
               result in the gravest difﬁculty. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) smiles. He doubts 
               <br />
               what I say. He has an amendment which he 
               <br />
               proposes to move setting forth his view of 
               <br />
               the proper distribution of these constituen- 
               <br />
               cies. If I have read that amendment cor- 
               <br />
               rectly, he proposes to give to the Dominion 
               <br />
               electoral district of Alberta 5 local seats; 
               <br />
               to Calgary, 6; to Strathcona, 6; to Edmon- 
               <br />
               ton, 0. If I read the ﬁgures aright, that 
               <br />
               means that 686 voters in the district of AI- 
               <br />
               berta will be entitled to ii.-representative in 
               <br />

               <br />
               while in the district of Strathcona, 966 voters 
               <br />
               would be entitled to one representative.

               and determinedly than within the last five 
               <br />
               minutes—that the basis of representation 
               <br />
               should be equality of population. Yet, in the

               that it is a proper division. In making

               that division he gives an advantage of

               a hundred things affect the' percentage of 
               <br />
               voters who go to the polls. Therefore it 
               <br />
               seems to me clear that the number on the 
               <br />
               list is a much safer guide to the population 
               <br />
               than the number who actually go to the polls.

               Mr. BARKER. Let me ask the minister 
               <br />
               another question. Supposing in two or three 
               <br />
               constituencies there was no contest at all, 
               <br />
               what would he do if he were to rely upon the 
               <br />
               lists ? Would he say there were no voters 
               <br />
               if there was no contest ?

               Mr. OLIVER. That is what my hon. 
               <br />
               friends have been saying with regard to the 
               <br />
               district of Athabaska. But I would like, for 
               <br />
               the information of my hon. friend, to give 
               <br />
               him a fact in regard to the method in which 
               <br />
               voters’ lists are prepared in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. and the purpose which they have 
               <br />
               in view. The very fact which was brought 
               <br />
