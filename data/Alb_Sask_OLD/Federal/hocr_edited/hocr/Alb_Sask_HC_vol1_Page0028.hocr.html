               he was not in his cabinet and was not in his

               <br />
               this ? This autocratic Prime Minister that

               we have in this country eight years ago 
               <br />
               using the words of Bismarck said: We 
               <br />
               shall not go to Canossa. The right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman has been to Three Rivers; he has 
               <br />
               made the treaty of Three Rivers, and in pur-

               suance of that treaty he has chosen in his 
               <br />
               autocratic way to bring down a Bill dealing 
               <br />
               with the great questions now at issue 
               <br />
               without consulting his colleagues. It is said 
               <br />
               that in the preparation of this Bill he con- 
               <br />
               sulted only three of his ministers, of whom 
               <br />
               two came from his own province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               I do not propose to discuss the Bill, but I 
               <br />
               know now why the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               has left the government; it is now known 
               <br />
               that it is on the school question and it is 
               <br />
               on the land question as I said on Monday— 
               <br />
               but it is more. The right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               in introducing a certain measure in this 
               <br />
               House argued on three grounds, the con- 
               <br />
               stitutional ground, the ground of policy, and 
               <br />
               he argued for separate schools per se and 
               <br />
               it is because the proposition is for separate 
               <br />
               schools per se that the late Minister of the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               has an area of only 74,000 square miles, 
               <br />

               <br />
               an area of nearly 300,000 square miles 
               <br />
               each. But the province of Manitoba hap- 
               <br />
               pens to be in favour of public education, 
               <br />
               and she is to be punished ; and now the 
               <br />
               House and the country will be able to 
               <br />
               see how all this came about. If you ex- 
               <br />
               tended the limits of the province of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba to the west, the result would be that 
               <br />
               the portion of territory to the east would 
               <br />
               have the right to regulate its own educat- 
               <br />
               ional affairs, while the other portion of the 
               <br />
               same territory would be shackled. That is 
               <br />
               the reason why Manitoba is being punished. 
               <br />
               And so it turns out, after all the taunts 
               <br />
               that I was met with here on Monday, that 
               <br />
               I was right when I said that Manitoba was 
               <br />
               being punished, and that the Dominion Lands 
               <br />
               Act would have to be changed in order to 
               <br />
               carry out the proposal made in the Bill. I 
               <br />
               was given what was called a categorical 
               <br />
               denial ; but to-day I have received a cate- 
               <br />
               gorical affirmation from the late Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, I warn the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man that he is engaged in a quixotic career 
               <br />
               if he fancies that he and his party, which 
               <br />
               claims to be the party of provincial rights, 
               <br />
               can shackle the two new provinces of the 
               <br />
               west and impose a separate school system 
               <br />
               upon them without consulting the people. 
               <br />
               He does not consult his own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ministers—</span> 
               <br />
               the confession is made to-day. And what 
               <br />
               is to be the fate of that minister who to- 
               <br />
               day declares that he has not been consulted?<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> 
               <br />
               He is to be Tartiﬁed and Blairiﬁed, like the 
               <br />
               other ministers who have resigned ; and 
               <br />
               the same fate awaits any one else who 
               <br />
               chooses not to come under this new czardom 
               <br />
               which we have in this country, under which 
               <br />
               not even a cabinet minister is to be con- 
               <br />
               sulted in regard to public polic y; under 
               <br />
               which that great free west, which feels 
               <br />
               more keenly on these great public questions 
               <br />
               than we do in the east, is not to be con- 
               <br />
               sulted through its recognized minister, but 
               <br />
               this hasty and ill-advised proposal is to 
               <br />
               be introduced into this House in his ab- 
               <br />
               sence.

               I congratulate the late Minister of the

               <br />
               it was proposed to put shackles upon his

               province ; because, he said, if the province
