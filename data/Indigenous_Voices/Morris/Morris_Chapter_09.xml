     THE TREATIES AT FORTS CARLTON AND PITT. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     THE treaties made at Forts Carlton and Pitt in the year 
     <lb/>
     1876, were of a very important character. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The great region covered by them, abutting on the areas in<lb break="no"/>cluded in Treaties Numbers Three and Four, embracing an 
     <lb/>
     area of apprpximately 120,000 square miles, contains a vast 
     <lb/>
     extent of fertile territory and is the home of the Cree nation. 
     <lb/>
     The Crees had, very early after the annexation of the North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     West Territories to Canada, desired a treaty of alliance with 
     <lb/>
     the Government. So far back as the year 1871, Mr. Simpson, 
     <lb/>
     the Indian Commissioner, addressing the Secretary of State in 
     <lb/>
     a despatch of date, the 3rd November, 1871, used the following 
     <lb/>
     language : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " I desire also to call the attention of His Excellency to the 
     <lb/>
     state of affairs in the Indian country on the Saskatchewan. 
     <lb/>
     The intelligence that Her Majesty is treating with the Chip<lb break="no"/>pewa Indians has already reached the ears of the Cree and 
     <lb/>
     Blackfeet tribes. In the neighborhood of Fort Edmonton, on 
     <lb/>
     the Saskatchewan, there is a rapidly increasing population of 
     <lb/>
     miners and other white people, and it is the opinion of Mr. W. 
     <lb/>
     J. Christie, the officer in charge of the Saskatchewan District, 
     <lb/>
     that a treaty with the Indians of that country, or at least an 
     <lb/>
     assurance during the coming year that a treaty will shortly be 
     <lb/>
     made, is essential to the peace, if not the actual retention, of 
     <lb/>
     the country. I would refer His Excellency, on this subject, to 
     <lb/>
     the report of Lieut. Butler, and to the enclosed memoranda of <lb/> Mr. W. J. Christie, the officer above alluded to." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     He also enclosed an extract of a letter from Mr. Christie, 
     <lb/>
     then Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, and subse<lb break="no"/>quently one of the Treaty Commissioners, in which, he for<lb break="no"/>warded the messages of the Cree Chiefs to Lieut.-Gov. Archibald, 
     <lb/>
     " our Great Mother's representative at Fort Garry, Red River 
     <lb/>
     Settlement." This extract and messages are as follows :

            <p>
     On the 13th instant (April) I had a visit from the Cree Chiefs, representing 
     <lb/>
     the Plain Crees from this to Carlton, accompanied by a few followers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The object of their visit was to ascertain whether their lands had been 
     <lb/>
     sold or not, and what was the intention of the Canadian Government in 
     <lb/>
     relation to them. They referred to the epidemic that had raged throughout 
     <lb/>
     the past summer, and the subsequent starvation, the poverty of their 
     <lb/>
     country, the visible diminution of the buffalo, their sole support, ending by 
     <lb/>
     requesting certain presents <hi rendition="simple:italic">at once</hi>, and that I should lay their case before 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty's representative at Fort Garry. Many stories have reached 
     <lb/>
     these Indians through various channels, ever since the transfer of the North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     West Territories to the Dominion of Canada, and they were most anxious 
     <lb/>
     to hear from myself what had taken place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I told them that the Canadian Government had as yet made no application 
     <lb/>
     for their lands or hunting grounds, and when anything was required of them, 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">most likely Commissioners</hi> would be sent beforehand to treat with them, and 
     <lb/>
     that until then they should remain quiet and live at peace with all men. 1' 
     <lb/>
     further stated that Canada, in her treaties with Indians, heretofore, had 
     <lb/>
     dealt most liberally with them, and that they were now in settled houses 
     <lb/>
     and well off, and that I had no doubt in settling with them the same liberal 
     <lb/>
     policy would be followed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I was aware that they had heard many exaggerated stories about the 
     <lb/>
     troops in Red River, I took the opportunity of telling them why troops had 
     <lb/>
     been sent; and if Her Majesty sent troops to the Saskatchewan, it was as 
     <lb/>
     much for the protection of the red as the white man, and that they would be 
     <lb/>
     for the maintenance of law and order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They were highly satisfied with the explanations offered, and said they 
     <lb/>
     would welcome civilization. As their demands were complied with, and 
     <lb/>
     presents given to them, their immediate followers, and for the young men 
     <lb/>
     left in camp, they departed well pleased for the present time, with fair 
     <lb/>
     promises for the future. At a subsequent interview with the Chiefs alone, 
     <lb/>
     they requested that I should write down their words, or messages to their 
     <lb/>
     Great Master in Red River. I accordingly did so, and have transmitted 
     <lb/>
     the messages as delivered. Copies of the proclamation issued, prohibiting 
     <lb/>
     the traffic in spirituous liquors to Indians or others, and the use of strychnine 
     <lb/>
     in the destruction of animal life, have been received, and due publicity 
     <lb/>

     given to them. But without any power to enforce these laws, it is almost 
     <lb/>
     useless to publish them here ; and I take this opportunity of most earnestly 
     <lb/>
     soliciting, on behalf of the Company's servants, and settlers in this district, 
     <lb/>
     that protection be afforded to life and property here as soon as possible, and 
     <lb/>
     that Commissioners be sent to speak with the Indians on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     MEMORANDA : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Had I not complied with the demands of the Indians—giving them some 
     <lb/>
     little presents-and otherwise satisfied them, I have no doubt that they 
     <lb/>
     would have proceeded to acts of violence, and once that had commenced, 
     <lb/>
     there would have been the beginning of an Indian war, which it is difficult 
     <lb/>
     to say when it would have ended. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The buffalo will soon be exterminated, and when starvation comes, these 
     <lb/>
     Plain Indian tribes will fall back on the Hudson's Bay Forts and settlements 
     <lb/>
     for relief and assistance. If not complied with, or no steps taken to make 
     <lb/>
     some provision for them, they will most assuredly help themselves; and 
     <lb/>
     there being no force or any law up there to protect the settlers, they must 
     <lb/>
     either quietly submit to be pillaged, or lose their lives in the defence of 
     <lb/>
     their families and property, against such fearful odds that will leave no hope 
     <lb/>
     for their side. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Gold may be discovered in paying quantities, any day, on the eastern 
     <lb/>
     slope of the Rocky Mountains. We have, in Montana, and in the mining 
     <lb/>
     settlements close to our boundary line, a large mixed frontier population, 
     <lb/>
     who are now only waiting and watching to hear of gold discoveries to rush 
     <lb/>
     into the Saskatchewan, and, without any form of Government or established 
     <lb/>
     laws up there, or force to protect whites or Indians, it is very plain what 
     <lb/>
     will be the result. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think that the establishment of law and order in the Saskatchewan Dis<lb break="no"/>trict, as early as possible, is of most vital importance to the future of the 
     <lb/>
     country and the interest of Canada, and also the making of some treaty or 
     <lb/>
     settlement with the Indians who inhabit the Saskatchewan District.

     <lb/>

            <p>
     Make provision for us against years of starvation. We have had great

     The North-West Council, as already elsewhere stated, had

     territory between the Saskatchewan and the Rocky Moun<lb break="no"/>tains. This state of feeling, which had prevailed amongst 
     <lb/>
     these Indians for some years past, had been increased by the 
     <lb/>
     presence, last summer, in their territory of the parties engaged 
     <lb/>
     in the construction of the telegraph line, and in the survey of 
     <lb/>
     the Pacific Railway line, and also of a party belonging to the

     Geological Survey. To allay this state of feeling, and to pre<lb break="no"/>vent the threatened hostility of the Indian tribes to the parties 
     <lb/>
     then employed by the Government, His Honor Governor 
     <lb/>
     Morris requested and obtained authority to despatch a mes<lb break="no"/>senger to convey to these Indians the assurance that Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners would be sent this summer, to negotiate a treaty with 
     <lb/>
     them, as had already been done with their brethren further east.

     "The Rev. George McDougall, who had been resident as a 
     <lb/>
     missionary amongst these Indians for upwards of fourteen 
     <lb/>
     years, and who possessed great influence over them, was 
     <lb/>
     selected by His Honor to convey this intelligence to the 
     <lb/>
     Indians, a task which he performed with great fidelity and 
     <lb/>
     success: being able to report on his return that although he 
     <lb/>
     found the feeling of discontent had been very general among 
     <lb/>
     the Indian tribes, he had been enabled entirely to remove it 
     <lb/>
     by his assurance of the proposed negotiations during the com<lb break="no"/>ing year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " For the purpose of negotiating this treaty with the Indians, 
     <lb/>
     Your Excellency availed yourself of the services of His Honor 
     <lb/>
     Governor Morris, who had been formerly employed in negotiat<lb break="no"/>ing Treaties Numbers Three, Four and Five. With him were

     associated the Hon. James McKay and W. J. Christie, Esq.,

     both of whom had had considerable experience in such work,

     <lb/>
     his way, with his family, to his distant mission, among the 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboines, near the Rocky Mountains, after a brief sojourn 
     <lb/>
     in the Province of Ontario, but on the request being made to

     him, to explain to the Indians the intentions of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, he at once undertook the duty, and leaving his family to

     Governor of the North-West Territories, promising the Indians,

     that Commissioners would visit them during the ensuing sum<lb break="no"/>mer, to confer with them as to a treaty. The result of his tour,

     and Of the tidings which he bore was very gratifying, as the

     Sir, —In accordance with my instructions, I proceeded with as little 
     <lb/>
     delay as possible to Carlton, in the neighborhood of which place I met with 
     <lb/>
     forty tents of Crees : From these I ascertained that the work I had under<lb break="no"/>taken would be much more arduous than I had expected, and that the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal camps would be found on the south branch of the Saskatchewan and 
     <lb/>
     Red Deer Rivers. I was also informed by these Indians that the Crees and 
     <lb/>
     Plain Assiniboines were united on two points: 1st. That they would not 
     <lb/>
     receive any presents from Government until a definite time for treaty was 
     <lb/>
     stated. 2nd. Though they deplored the necessity of resorting to extreme 
     <lb/>
     measures, yet they were unanimous in their determination to Oppose the 
     <lb/>
     running of lines, or the making of roads through their country, until a set<lb break="no"/>tlement between the Government and them had been effected. I was further 
     <lb/>
     informed that the danger of a collision with the whites was likely to arise 
     <lb/>
     from the officious conduct of minor Chiefs who were anxious to make them<lb break="no"/>selves conspicuous, the principal men Of the large camps being much more

     moderate in their demands. Believing this to be the fact, I resolved to visit 
     <lb/>
     every camp and read them your message, and in order that your Honor may 
     <lb/>
     form a correct judgment of their disposition towards the Government, I will 
     <lb/>
     give you a synopsis of their speeches after the message was read. Mistah<lb break="no"/>wahsis, head Chief of the Carlton Indians, addressing the principal Chief 
     <lb/>
     of the Assiniboines and addressing me, said : "That is just it, that is all 
     <lb/>
     we wanted." The Assiniboines addressing me, said: "My heart is full of 
     <lb/>
     gratitude, foolish men have told us that the Great Chief would send his 
     <lb/>
     young men to our country until they outnumbered us, and that then he 
     <lb/>
     would laugh at us, but this letter assures us that the Great Chief will act 
     <lb/>
     justly towards us." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Beardy, or the Hairy Man, Chief of the Willow Indians, said : " If I had 
     <lb/>
     heard these words spoken by the Great Queen I could not have believed 
     <lb/>
     them with more implicit faith than I do now." The Sweet Grass was absent 
     <lb/>
     from camp when I reached the Plain Crees, but his son and the principal 
     <lb/>
     men of the tribe requested me to convey to the Great Chief, at Red River, 
     <lb/>
     their thanks for the presents received, and they expressed the greatest 
     <lb/>
     loyalty to the government. In a word, I found the Crees reasonable in their 
     <lb/>
     demands, and anxious to live in peace with the white men. I found the Big 
     <lb/>
     Bear, a Saulteaux, trying to take the lead in their council. He formerly lived 
     <lb/>
     at Jack Fish Lake, and for years has been regarded as atroublesome fellow. 
     <lb/>
     In his speech he said : "We want none of the Queen's presents ; when we 
     <lb/>
     set a fox-trap we scatter pieces of meat all round, but when the fox gets into 
     <lb/>
     the trap we knock him on the head ; we want no bait, let your Chiefs come 
     <lb/>
     like men and talk to us." These Saulteaux are the mischief-makers through 
     <lb/>
     all this western country, and some of them are shrewd men.

     A few weeks since, a land speculator wished to take a claim at the cross<lb break="no"/>ing on Battle River and asked the consent of the Indians, one of my Saul<lb break="no"/>teaux friends sprang to his feet, and pointing to the east, said: "Do you 
     <lb/>
     see that great white man (the Government) coming?" " No," said the 
     <lb/>
     speculator. " I do," said the Indian, "and I hear the tramp of the multi<lb break="no"/>tude behind him, and when he comes you can drop in behind him and take 
     <lb/>
     up all the land claims you want; but until then I caution you to put up no 
     <lb/>
     stakes in our country." It was very fortunate for me that Big Bear and his 
     <lb/>
     party were a very small minority in camp. The Crees said they Would have 
     <lb/>
     driven them out of camp long ago, but were afraid of their medicines, as 
     <lb/>
     they are noted conjurers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The topics generally discussed at their council and which will be brought 
     <lb/>
     before the Commissioner are as follows in their own language. "Tell the 
     <lb/>
     Great Chief that we are glad the traders are prohibited bringing spirits into 
     <lb/>
     our cofmtry ; when we see it we want to drink it, and it destroys us ; when 
     <lb/>
     we do not see it we do not think about it. Ask for us a strong law, prohibi<lb break="no"/>ting the free use of poison (strychnine). It has almost exterminated the 
     <lb/>
     animals of our country, and often makes us had friends with our white 
     <lb/>
     neighbors. We further request, that a law be made, equally applicable to 
     <lb/>

     the Half-breed and Indian, punishing all parties who set fire to our forest or 
     <lb/>
     plain. Not many years ago we attributed a prairie fire to the malevolence 
     <lb/>
     of an enemy, now every one is reckless in the use of fire, and every year 
     <lb/>
     large numbers of valuable animals and birds perish in consequence. We 
     <lb/>
     would further ask that our chiefships be established by the Government. 
     <lb/>
     Of late years almost every trader sets up his own Chief and the result is we 
     <lb/>
     are broken up into little parties, and our best men are no longer respected." 
     <lb/>
     I will state in connection with this, some of the false reports I had 
     <lb/>
     to combat in passing through this country, all calculated to agitate th 
     <lb/>
     native mind. In the neighborhood of Carlton an interested party went to 
     <lb/>
     considerable trouble to inform the Willow Indians that I had $3000 for 
     <lb/>
     each band, as a present from the Government, and nothing in my long jour<lb break="no"/>ney gave me greater satisfaction than the manner in which these Indians 
     <lb/>
     received my explanation of the contents of my letter of instructions. At 
     <lb/>
     the Buffalo Lake I found both Indians and Half-breeds greatly agitated. A 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen passing through their country had told them that the Mounted 
     <lb/>
     Police had received orders to prevent all parties killing buffalo or other 
     <lb/>
     animals, except during three months in the year, and these are only samples 
     <lb/>
     of the false statements made by parties who would rejoice to witness a con<lb break="no"/>flict of races. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That your Honor's message was most timely, these are ample proofs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A report will have reached you before this time that parties have been 
     <lb/>
     turned back by the Indians, and that a train containing supplies for the 
     <lb/>
     telegraph contractors, when west of Fort Pitt, were met by three Indians 
     <lb/>
     and ordered to return. Now after carefully investigating the matter and 
     <lb/>
     listening to 'the statements of all parties concerned, my opinion is, that an 
     <lb/>
     old traveller amongst Indians would have regarded the whole affair as too 
     <lb/>
     trivial to be noticed. I have. not met with a Chief who would bear with 
     <lb/>
     the responsibility of the act. ' ' ' ' 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Personally I am indebted both to the missionaries, and the Hudson's Bay 
     <lb/>
     Company's officials for their assistance at the Indian councils. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Believing it would be satisfactory to your Honor and of service to the 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners, I have kept the number of all the tents visited and the 
     <lb/>
     names of the places where I met the Indians.<ref target="#fn_02">*</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     By reckoning eight persons to each tent, we will have a very close approx<lb break="no"/>imate to the number of Indians to be treated with at Carlton, and Fort 
     <lb/>
     Pitt. There may have been a few tents in the forest, and I have heard there 
     <lb/>
     are a few Crees at Lesser Slave Lake and Lac la Biche, but the number 
     <lb/>
     cannot exceed twenty tents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     All of which is respectfully submitted.

     <lb/>

            <p>
     The Commissioners, in the discharge of their task, had to 
     <lb/>
     travel through the prairie district in going to their destination 
     <lb/>
     and returning to Winnipeg, a distance of over 1,800 miles. 
     <lb/>
     They first met the Indians in the vicinity of Fort Carlton, on 
     <lb/>
     the Saskatchewan, in the month of August, 1876, and eventu<lb break="no"/>ally succeeded on the 23rd day of that month, in effecting a 
     <lb/>
     treaty with the Plain and Wood Crees, and on the 28th 
     <lb/>
     of the same month with the tribe of Willow Crees. The 
     <lb/>
     negotiations were difficult and protracted. The Hon. David 
     <lb/>
     Mills, then Minister of the Interior, in his Annual Report 
     <lb/>
     thus characterizes them :—" In view of the temper of the 
     <lb/>
     Indians of the Saskatchewan, during the past year, and of the 
     <lb/>
     extravagant demands which they were induced to prefer on 
     <lb/>
     certain points, it needed all the temper, tact, judgment and 
     <lb/>
     discretion, of which the Commissioners were possessed, to bring 
     <lb/>
     the negotiations to a satisfactory issue." The difficulties were 
     <lb/>
     encountered chiefly at Carlton. The main body of the Crees 
     <lb/>
     were honestly disposed to treat, and their head Chiefs, Misto<lb break="no"/>wasis and Ah-tuk-uh-koop, shewed sound judgment, and an earn<lb break="no"/>est desire to come to an understanding. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They were embarrassed, however, by the action of the Wil<lb break="no"/>low Crees, who, under the guidance of one of their Chiefs, 
     <lb/>
     Beardy, interposed every obstacle to the progress of the treaty, 
     <lb/>
     and refused to attend the Council, unless it was held at the top 
     <lb/>
     of a hill some miles off, where the Chief pretended it had been 
     <lb/>
     revealed to him in a vision that the treaty was to be made. 
     <lb/>
     The Willow Crees were, moreover, under the influence of a 
     <lb/>
     wandering band of Saulteaux, the chief portion of whom resided 
     <lb/>
     within the limits of the other treaties, and who were dis<lb break="no"/>posed to be troublesome. Before the arrival of the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners, the Saulteaux conceived the idea of forming a combina<lb break="no"/>tion of the French Half-breeds, the Crees, and themselves, to 
     <lb/>
     prevent the crossing of the Saskatchewan by the Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Governor, and his entrance into the Indian territories. They 
     <lb/>
     made the proposal first to the French Half-breeds, who declined 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="177"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_177.jpg"/>
          
     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">177</fw> 
     

     to undertake it, and then to the Crees, who listened to it in 
     <lb/>
     silence. One of them at length arose, and pointing to the 
     <lb/>
     River Saskatchewan, said, "Can you stop the flow of that river?" 
     <lb/>
     The answer was, "No," and the rejoinder was "No more can 
     <lb/>
     you stop the progress of the Queen's Chief." When the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners arrived at the Saskatchewan, a messenger from the 
     <lb/>
     Crees met them, proffering a safe convoy, but it was not needed. 
     <lb/>
     About a hundred traders' carts were assembled at tiie crossing, 
     <lb/>
     and Kissowayis, a native Indian trader, had the right of pas<lb break="no"/>sage, which he at once waived, in favor of Messrs. Christie and 
     <lb/>
     Morris, the Commissioners. The other Commissioner, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McKay, met them at Duck Lake next day, having proceeded by 
     <lb/>
     another route, and there they encountered Chief Beardy, who at 
     <lb/>
     once asked the Lieutenant-Governor to make the treaty at the 
     <lb/>
     hill, near the lake. On his guard, however, he replied, that he 
     <lb/>
     would meet the Cree nation wherever they desired, but must 
     <lb/>
     first go on and see them at Carlton, as he had appointed. An 
     <lb/>
     escort of Mounted Police also met the Commissioners at Duck 
     <lb/>
     Lake, having been sent from Carlton, in consequence of the 
     <lb/>
     information given by the Crees of the threatened interference 
     <lb/>
     with their progress. After several days' delay the Commissioners 
     <lb/>
     were obliged to meet the Crees without the Willow Crees. But 
     <lb/>
     after the conference had opened, the Beardy sent a message 
     <lb/>
     asking to be informed of the terms the Commissioners intended 
     <lb/>
     to offer in advance. The reply was that the messenger could 
     <lb/>
     sit with the other Indians, and report to his Chief what he 
     <lb/>
     heard, as it was his own fault that the Chief was not there to 
     <lb/>
     take part in the proceedings. The negotiations then went on 
     <lb/>
     quietly and deliberately, the Commissioners giving the Indians 
     <lb/>
     all the time they desired. The Indians were apprehensive of 
     <lb/>
     their future. They saw the food supply, the buffalo, passing 
     <lb/>
     away, and they were anxious and distressed. They knew the 
     <lb/>
     large terms granted to their Indians by the United States, 
     <lb/>
     but they had confidence in their Great Mother, the Queen, 
     <lb/>
     and her benevolence.

            <p>
     They desired to be fed. Small-pox had destroyed them by 
     <lb/>
     hundreds a few years before, and they dreaded pestilence and 
     <lb/>
     famine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Eventually the Commissioners made them an offer. They 
     <lb/>
     asked this to be reduced to writing, which was done, and they 
     <lb/>
     asked time to consider it, which was of course granted. When 
     <lb/>
     the conference resumed, they presented a written counter<lb break="no"/>proposal. This the Commissioners considered, and gave full 
     <lb/>
     and definite answers of acceptance or refusal to each demand, 
     <lb/>
     which replies were carefully interpreted, two of the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners, Messrs. Christie and McKay, being familiar with the 
     <lb/>
     Cree tongue, watching how the answers were rendered, and 
     <lb/>
     correcting when necessary. The food question, was disposed 
     <lb/>
     of by a promise, that in the event of a <hi rendition="simple:italic">National</hi> famine or <hi rendition="simple:italic">pesti<lb break="no"/>lence</hi> such aid as the Crown saw fit would be extended to them, 
     <lb/>
     and that for three years after they settled on their reserves, 
     <lb/>
     provisions to the extent of $1,000 per annum would be granted 
     <lb/>
     them during seed-time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The other terms were analogous to those of the previous 
     <lb/>
     treaties. The Crees accepted the revised proposals. The treaty 
     <lb/>
     was interpreted to them carefully, and was then signed, and 
     <lb/>
     the payment made in accordance therewith. After the con<lb break="no"/>clusion of the treaty, the Comissioners were unwilling that 
     <lb/>
     the Willow Crees should remain out of the treaty, and sent a 
     <lb/>
     letter to them by a messenger, Pierre Levailler, that they would 
     <lb/>
     meet them half way, at the camp of the Hon. James McKay, 
     <lb/>
     and give them the opportunity of accepting the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     treaty already concluded. The letter was translated to the 
     <lb/>
     Indians by the Rev. Pere André, a Catholic missionary, who, 
     <lb/>
     as well as M. Levailler, urged the Indians to accede to the 
     <lb/>
     proposal made to them, which they agreed to do. The Com<lb break="no"/>missioners met the Indians accordingly, at the place proposed, 
     <lb/>
     and received, after a full discussion, the adhesion of the three 
     <lb/>
     Chiefs and head men of the Willow Crees to the treaty, and 
     <lb/>
     the payments were then made to them.

            <p>
     The Commissioners then prepared to leave for Fort Pitt, but 
     <lb/>
     having been apprised by the Rev. Mr. Scollan, a Catholic 
     <lb/>
     missionary, who had been sent by Bishop Grandin, to be pre<lb break="no"/>sent at the making of the treaty, that Sweet Grass, the princi<lb break="no"/>pal Chief of the Plain Crees, at Fort Pitt, was unaware of the 
     <lb/>
     place and time of meeting, they despatched a messenger to 
     <lb/>
     apprise him of them, and request him to be present. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners crossed the Saskatchewan and journeyed 
     <lb/>
     to Fort Pitt. Near it they were met by an escort of Mounted 
     <lb/>
     Police, who convoyed them to the fort. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There they found a number of Indians assembled, and, dur<lb break="no"/>ing the day, Sweet Grass arrived. In the evening the Chief 
     <lb/>
     and head men waited upon the Commissioners. Delay was 
     <lb/>
     asked and granted before meeting. Eventually the conference 
     <lb/>
     was opened. The ceremonies which attended it were imposing. 
     <lb/>
     The national stem or pipe dance was performed, of which a 
     <lb/>
     full narrative will be found hereafter. The conference pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded, and the Indians accepted the terms made at Carlton 
     <lb/>
     with the utmost good feeling, and thus the Indian title was ex<lb break="no"/>tinguished in the whole of the Plain country, except a compar<lb break="no"/>atively small area, inhabited by the Black Feet, comprising 
     <lb/>
     about 35,000 square miles. I regret to record, that the Chief 
     <lb/>
     Sweet Grass who took the lead in the proceedings, met with 
     <lb/>
     an accidental death a few months afterwards, by the discharge 
     <lb/>
     of a pistol. The Indians, in these two treaties, displayed a 
     <lb/>
     strong desire for instruction in farming, and appealed for the 
     <lb/>
     aid of missionaries and teachers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The latter the Commissioners promised, and for the former 
     <lb/>
     they were told they must rely on the churches, representatives 
     <lb/>
     of whom were present from the Church of England, the Meth<lb break="no"/>odist, the Presbyterian and the Roman Catholic Church. The 
     <lb/>
     Bishop (Grandin) of the latter Church travelled from Edmon<lb break="no"/>ton to Fort Pitt and Battleford to see the Commissioners and 
     <lb/>
     assure them of his good will. After the conclusion of the 
     <lb/>
     treaty, the Commissioners commenced their long return

     <lb/>
     6th day of October, with the satisfaction of knowing that they 
     <lb/>
     had accomplished a work which, with the efficient carrying out 
     <lb/>
     of the treaties, had secured the good will of the Cree Nation, 
     <lb/>
     and laid the foundations of law and order in the Saskatchewan

     of the various churches, Colonel McLeod of the Mounted

     of substantial service.

     me and meet me at Fort Carlton. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the morning of the 4th of August, I forded the Assiniboine about five 
     <lb/>
     miles from Fort Ellice, having accomplished what is usually regarded as 
     <lb/>

     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">181</fw> 
     

     the first stage of the journey to Fort Carlton, about two hundred and 
     <lb/>
     twenty miles. After crossing the river, I was overtaken by a party of the 
     <lb/>
     Sioux who have settled on the reserve assigned to them at Bird Tail Creek, 
     <lb/>
     and was detained the greater part of the day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am sanguine that this settlement will prove a success, as these Sioux 
     <lb/>
     are displaying a laudable industry in cutting hay for their own use and for 
     <lb/>
     sale, and in breaking up ground for cultivation. I resumed my journey in 
     <lb/>
     the afternoon, but a storm coming on, I was obliged to encamp at the 
     <lb/>
     Springs, having only travelled eight miles in all during the day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 5th I left the Springs, and after traversing much fine country, 
     <lb/>
     with excellent prairie, good soil, clumps of wood, lakelets, and hay 
     <lb/>
     swamps, in the Little and Great Touchwood Hills and File Mountain 
     <lb/>
     region, I arrived at the South Saskatchewan, at Dumont's crossing, twenty 
     <lb/>
     miles from Fort Carlton, on the afternoon of the 14th of August. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Here I found over one hundred carts of traders and freighters, waiting to 
     <lb/>
     be ferried across the river. The scow was occupied in crossing the carts 
     <lb/>
     and effects of Kis-so-wais, an enterprising Chippewa trader, belonging to 
     <lb/>
     the Portage la Prairie band, who at once came forward and gave up to me 
     <lb/>
     his right of crossing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I met, also, a young Cree who had been sent by the Crees to hand me a 
     <lb/>
     letter of welcome in the name of their nation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The reason of this step being taken was, that a few wandering Saulteaux 
     <lb/>
     or Chippewa, from Quill Lake, in Treaty Number Four, had come to the 
     <lb/>
     Crees and proposed to them to unite with them and prevent me from cros<lb break="no"/>sing the river and entering the Indian country. The Crees promptly re<lb break="no"/>fused to entertain the proposal, and sent a messenger, as above stated, to 
     <lb/>
     welcome me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I also received from their messenger a letter from Lawrence Clarke, Esq., 
     <lb/>
     Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company at Carlton, offering the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners the hospitalities of the fort. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I sent replies in advance, thanking the Crees for their action, and accept<lb break="no"/>ing the kind offer of Mr. Clarke, to the extent of the use of rooms in the 
     <lb/>
     fort. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was late in the evening before our party crossed the river, so that we 
     <lb/>
     encamped on the heights near it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the morning of the 15th we left for Fort Carlton, Mr.. Christie pre<lb break="no"/>ceding me to announce my approaching arrival at Duck Lake. About 
     <lb/>
     twelve miles from Carlton I found the Hon. James McKay awaiting me, 
     <lb/>
     having travelled by way of Fort Pelly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               Here also a Chief, <persName ref="pers:KAHM1">Beardy</persName> of the Willow Crees, came to see me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He said that his people were encamped near the lake, and that as there 
     <lb/>
     were fine meadows for their horses they wished the treaty to be made there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was at once on my guard, and replied to him, that after I reached 
     <lb/>
     Carlton, which was the place appointed, I would meet the Indians where<lb break="no"/>ever the great body of them desired it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
           
            <pb n="182"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_182.jpg"/>
          
     <fw type="num">182</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw> 
     
            <p>
     He then asked me to stop as I passed his encampment, and see his 
     <lb/>
     people. This I agreed to do; as I was leaving Duck Lake I met Captain 
     <lb/>
     Walker with his troop of mounted police, coming to escort me to Carlton 
     <lb/>
     which they did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When I arrived at Beardy's encampment, the men came to my carriage 
     <lb/>
     and holding up their right hands to the skies, all joined in an invocation to 
     <lb/>
     the deity for a blessing on the bright day which had brought the Queen's 
     <lb/>
     messenger to see them, and on the messenger and themselves ; one of them 
     <lb/>
     shook hands with me for the others. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The scene was a very impressive and striking one, but as will be seen 
     <lb/>
     hereafter, this band gave me great trouble and were very difficult to deal 
     <lb/>
     with. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Leaving the Indian encampment I arrived at Fort Carlton, where Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Christie, Dr. Jackes and myself were assigned most comfortable rooms, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. McKay preferring to encamp about four miles from the fort. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               In the evening, <persName ref="pers:MIST1">Mist-ow-as-is</persName> and <persName ref="pers:AHTU1">Ah-tuk-uk-koop</persName>, the two head Chiefs 
     <lb/>
     of the Carlton Crees, called to pay their respects to me, and welcomed me 
     <lb/>
     most cordially. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 16th the Crees sent me word that they wished the day to confer 
     <lb/>
     amongst themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I acceded to their request, learning that they desired to bring the Duck 
     <lb/>
     Lake Indians into the negotiations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I sent a messenger, Mr. Peter Ballenden, to Duck Lake to inform the 
     <lb/>
     Indians that I would meet them at the encampment of the Carlton Crees, 
     <lb/>
     about two miles from the fort. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 17th, on his return, he informed me that the Chief said " He had 
     <lb/>
     not given me leave to meet the Indians anywhere except at Duck Lake, 
     <lb/>
     and that they would only meet me there." The Carlton Indians, however, 
     <lb/>
     sent me word, that they would be ready next morning at ten o'clock. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 18th, as I was leaving for the Indian encampment, a messenger 
     <lb/>
     came to me from the Duck Lake Indians, asking for provisions. I replied, 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Christie was in charge of the distribution of provisions, but that I 
     <lb/>
     would not give any to the Duck Lake Indians, in consequence of the un<lb break="no"/>reasonableness of their conduct, and that provisions would only be given to 
     <lb/>
     the large encampment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I then proceeded to the Indian camp, together with my fellow Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners, and was escorted by Captain Walker and his troop. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On my arrival I found that the ground had been most judiciously chosen, 
     <lb/>
     being elevated, with abundance of trees, hay marshes and small lakes. The 
     <lb/>
     spot which the Indians had left for my council tent overlooked the whole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The view was very beautiful : the hills and the trees in the distance, and 
     <lb/>
     in the foreground, the meadow land being dotted with clumps of wood, with 
     <lb/>
     the Indian tents clustered here and there to the number of two hundred. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On my arrival, the Union Jack was hoisted, and the Indians at once 
     <lb/>
     began to assemble, beating drums, discharging fire-arms, singing and danc<lb break="no"/><pb n="183"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_183.jpg"/>
         
     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">183</fw>ing. In about half an hour they were ready to advance and meet me. This 
     <lb/>
     they did in a semicircle, having men on horseback galloping in circles, 
     <lb/>
     shouting, singing and discharging fire-arms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They then performed the dance of the " pipe stem," the stem was elevated 
     <lb/>
     to the north, south, west and east, a ceremonial dance was then performed 
     <lb/>
     by the Chiefs and head men, the Indian men and women shouting the 
     <lb/>
     while. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They then slowly advanced, the horsemen again preceding them on their 
     <lb/>
     approach to my tent. I advanced to meet them, accompanied by Messrs. 
     <lb/>
     Christie and McKay, when the pipe was presented to us and stroked by our 
     <lb/>
     hands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After the stroking had been completed, the Indians sat down in front of 
     <lb/>
     the council tent, satisfied that in accordance with their custom we had 
     <lb/>
     accepted the friendship of the Cree nation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I then addressed the Indians in suitable terms, explaining that I had 
     <lb/>
     been sent by the Queen, in compliance with their own wishes and the 
     <lb/>
     written promise I had given them last year, that a messenger would be sent 
     <lb/>
     to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I had ascertained that the Indian mind was oppressed with vague fears; 
     <lb/>
     they dreaded the treaty ; they had been made to believe that they would be 
     <lb/>
     compelled to live on the reserves wholly, and abandon their hunting, and 
     <lb/>
     that in time of war, they would be placed in the front and made to fight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I accordingly shaped my address, so as to give them confidence in the in<lb break="no"/>tentions of the Government, and to quiet their apprehensions. I impressed 
     <lb/>
     strongly on them the necessity of changing their present mode of life, and 
     <lb/>
     commencing to make homes and gardens for themselves, so as to be prepared 
     <lb/>
     for the diminution of the buffalo and other large animals, which is going on 
     <lb/>
     so rapidly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Indians listened with great attention to my address, and at its close 
     <lb/>
     asked an adjournment that they might meet in council to consider my 
     <lb/>
     words, which was of course granted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Rev. C. Scollen, a Roman Catholic Missionary amongst the Black<lb break="no"/>feet, arrived soon after from Bow River, and informed me that on the way 
     <lb/>
     he had learned that Sweet Grass, the principal Chief of the Plain Crees, 
     <lb/>
     was out hunting and would not be at Fort Pitt, and that he was of opinion 
     <lb/>
     that his absence would be a great obstruction to a treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After consulting with my colleagues, I decided on sending a messenger to 
     <lb/>
     him, requesting his presence, and succeeded in obtaining, for the occasion, 
     <lb/>
     the services of Mr. John McKay, of Prince Albert, who had accompanied 
     <lb/>
     the Rev. George McDougall on his mission last year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the evening, Lieut.-Col. Jarvis arrived with a reinforcement of the 
     <lb/>
     Mounted Police, and an excellent band, which has been established at the 
     <lb/>
     private cost of one of the troops. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 19th, the Commissioners, escorted by the Mounted Police, headed 
     <lb/>
     by the band, proceeded to the Indian encampment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <pb n="184"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_184.jpg"/>
            
     <fw type="num">184</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw> 
     
   
            <p>
     The Indians again assembled, following Mist-ow-as-is and Ah-tuk-uk-koop, 
     <lb/>
     the recognized leading Chiefs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I asked them to present their Chiefs; they then presented the two head 
     <lb/>
     Chiefs, and the minor ones. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At this juncture, a messenger arrived from the Duck Lake Indians, asking 
     <lb/>
     that I should tell them the terms of the Treaty. I replied that if the 
     <lb/>
     Chiefs and people had joined the others they would have heard what I had 
     <lb/>
     to say, and that I would not tell the terms in advance, but that the 
     <lb/>
     messenger could remain and hear what I had to say. He expressed himself 
     <lb/>
     satisfied and took his seat with the others. I then fully explained to them 
     <lb/>
     the proposals I had to make, that we did not wish to interfere with their 
     <lb/>
     present mode of living, but would assign them reserves and assist them as 
     <lb/>
     was being done elsewhere, in commencing to farm, and that what was done 
     <lb/>
     would hold good for those that were away. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Indians listened most attentively, and on the close of my remarks 
     <lb/>
     <persName ref="pers:MIST1">Mist-ow-as-is</persName> arose, took me by the hand, and said that "when a thing was 
     <lb/>
     thought of quietly, it was the best way," and asked " this much, that we go 
     <lb/>
     and think of his words." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I acquiesced at once, and expressed my hope that the Chiefs would act 
     <lb/>
     wisely, and thus closed the second day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The 20th being Sunday, the Rev. Mr. John McKay, of the Church of 
     <lb/>
     England, conducted divine service at the fort, which was largely attended; 
     <lb/>
     the Rev. Mr. Scollen also conducted service. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At noon a messenger came from the Indian camp, asking that there 
     <lb/>
     should be a service held at their camp, which Mr. McKay agreed to do; 
     <lb/>
     this service was attended by about two hundred adult Crees. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On Monday, 21st, the head Chiefs sent word that, as the previous day 
     <lb/>
     was Sunday, they had not met in council, and wished to have the day for 
     <lb/>
     consultation, and if ready would meet me on Tuesday morning. I cheerfully 
     <lb/>
     granted the delay from the reasonableness of the request; but I was also 
     <lb/>
     aware that the head Chiefs were in a position of great difficulty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The attitude of the Duck Lake Indians and of the few discontented 
     <lb/>
     Saulteaux embarrassed them, while a section of their own people were either 
     <lb/>
     averse to make a treaty or desirous of making extravagant demands. The 
     <lb/>
     head Chiefs were men of intelligence, and anxious that the people should 
     <lb/>
     act unitedly and reasonably. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We, therefore, decided to give them all the time they might ask, a policy 
     <lb/>
     which they fully appreciated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 22nd the Commissioners met the Indians, when I told them that 
     <lb/>
     we had not hurried them, but wished now to hear their Chiefs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A spokesman, <persName ref="pers:OOPE1">The Pond Maker</persName>, then addressed me, and asked assistance 
     <lb/>
     when they settled on the land, and further help as they advanced in civiliza<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I replied that they had their own means of living, and that we could not 
     <lb/>
               feed the Indians, but only assist them to settle down. <persName ref="pers:BADG3">The Badger</persName>, <persName ref="pers:SOHA1">Soh-<lb break="yes"/>

     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">185</fw> 
     
     ah-moos</persName>, and several other Indians all asked help when they settled, and 
     <lb/>
     also in case of troubles unforeseen in the future. I explained that we could 
     <lb/>
     not assume the charge of their every-day life, but in a time of a great 
     <lb/>
     national calamity they could trust to the generosity of the Queen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Honourable James McKay also addressed them, saying that their 
     <lb/>
     demands would be understood by a white man as asking for daily food, and 
     <lb/>
     could not be granted, and explained our objects, speaking with effect in the 
     <lb/>
     Cree tongue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At length the Indians informed me that they did not wish to be fed 
     <lb/>
     every day, but to be helped when they commenced to settle, because of 
     <lb/>
     their ignorance how to commence, and also in case of general famine; Ah- 
     <lb break="yes"/>

     spring when they commenced to farm, and proportionate help as they ad<lb break="no"/>vanced in civilization, and then asking for a further adjournment to consider 
     <lb/>
     our offers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners granted this, but I warned them not to be unreason<lb break="no"/>able, and to be ready next day with their decision, while we on our part 
     <lb/>
     would consider what they had said. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The whole day was occupied with this discussion on the food question, 
     <lb/>
     and it was the turning point with regard to the treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Indians were, as they had been for some time past, full of uneasiness. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They saw the buffalo, the only means of their support, passing away. 
     <lb/>
     They were anxious to learn to support themselves by agriculture, but felt 
     <lb/>
     too ignorant to do so, and they dreaded that during the transition period 
     <lb/>
     they would be swept off by disease or famine—already they have suffered 
     <lb/>
     terribly from the ravages of measles, scarlet fever and small-pox. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was impossible to listen to them without interest, they were i 
     <lb/>
     exacting, but they were very apprehensive of their future, and thankful, as 
     <lb/>
     one of them put it, " a new life was dawning upon them." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 23rd the conference was resumed, an Indian addressed the people 
     <lb/>
     telling them to listen and the interpreter, Peter Erasmus, would read what 
     <lb/>
     changes they desired in the terms of our offer. They asked for an ox and a 
     <lb/>
     cow each family; an increase in the agricultural implements; provisions 
     <lb/>
     for the poor, unfortunate, blind and lame ; to be provided with missionaries 
     <lb/>
     and school teachers ; the exclusion of fire water in the whole Saskatchewan; 
     <lb/>
     a further increase in agricultural implements as the band advanced in 
     <lb/>
     civilization; freedom to cut timber on Crown lands; liberty to change the 
     <lb/>
     site of the reserves before the survey ; free passages over Government 
     <lb/>
     bridges or scows; other animals, a horse, harness and waggon, and cooking 
     <lb/>
     stove for each chief ; a free supply of medicines ; a hand mill to each band ; 
     <lb/>
     and lastly, that in case of war they should not be liable to serve. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Two spokesmen then addressed us in support of these modifications of 
     <lb/>
     the terms of the Treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I replied to them that they had asked many things some of which had 
     <lb/>
     been promised, and that the Commissioners would consult together about 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="186"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_186.jpg"/>
           
     <fw type="num">186</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw> 
     

     what they had asked that day and the day before, and would reply, but 
     <lb/>
     before doing so wished to know if that was the voice of the whole people, 
     <lb/>
     to which the Indians all assented. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After an interval we again met them, and I replied, going over their de<lb break="no"/>mands and reiterating my statements as to our inability to grant food, and 
     <lb/>
     again explaining that only in a national famine did the Crown ever inter<lb break="no"/>vene, and agreeing to make some additions to the number of cattle and 
     <lb/>
     implements, as we felt it would be desirable to encourage their desire to 
     <lb/>
     settle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I closed by stating that, after they settled on the reserves, we would 
     <lb/>
     give them provisions to aid them while cultivating, to the extent of one 
     <lb/>
     thousand dollars per annum, but for three years only, as after that time 
     <lb/>
     they should be able to support themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I told them that we could not give them missionaries, though I was 
     <lb/>
     pleased with their request, but that they must look to the churches, and that 
     <lb/>
     they saw Catholic and Protestant missionaries present at the conference. 
     <lb/>
     We told them that they must help their own poor, and that if they pros<lb break="no"/>pered they could do so. With regard to war, they would not be asked to 
     <lb/>
     fight unless they desired to do so, but if the Queen did call on them to pro<lb break="no"/>tect their wives and children, I believed they would not be backward . 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I then asked if they were willing to accept our modified proposals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:AHTU1">Ah-tuk-uk-koop</persName> then addressed me, and concluded by calling on the 
     <lb/>
     people. if they were in favour of our offers, to say so. This they all did by 
     <lb/>
     shouting assent and holding up their hands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OOPE1">The Pond Maker</persName> then rose and said he did not differ from his people, but 
     <lb/>
     he did not see how they could feed and clothe their children with what was 
     <lb/>
     promised. He expected to have received that; he did not know how to 
     <lb/>
     build a house nor to cultivate the ground. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TOMA1">Joseph Toma</persName>, a Saulteaux, said he spoke for the Red Pheasant, Chief of 
     <lb/>
     the Battle River Crees, and made demands as follows: Men to build houses 
     <lb/>
     for them, increased salaries to the Chiefs and head men, etc. He said what 
     <lb/>
     was offered was too little ; he wanted enough to cover the skin of the people, 
     <lb/>
     guns, and also ten miles of land round the reserves in a belt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I asked the Red Pheasant how it was that he was party to the requests of 
     <lb/>
     his people, and how, when I asked if that was their unanimous voice he had 
     <lb/>
     assented, and yet had now put forward new and large demands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I said it was not good faith, and that I would not accede to the requests 
     <lb/>
     now made , that what was offered was a gift as they had still their old mode 
     <lb/>
     of living. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The principal Chiefs then rose and said that they accepted our offers, and 
     <lb/>
     the Red Pheasant repudiated the demands and remarks of Toma, and stated 
     <lb/>
     that he had not authorized him to speak for him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MIST1">Mist-ow-as-is</persName> then asked to speak for the Half-breeds, who wish to live 
     <lb/>
     on the reserves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I explained the distinction between the Half-breed people and the Indian 
     

            <pb n="187"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_187.jpg"/>
          
     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">187</fw> 
     

     Half-breeds who lived amongst the Indians as Indians, and said the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners would consider the case of each of these last on its merits. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The treaty was then signed by myself, Messrs. <persName ref="pers:CHRI3">Christie</persName> and <persName ref="pers:MCKA4">McKay</persName>, 
     <lb/>
     <persName ref="pers:MIST1">Mist-ow-as-is</persName> and <persName ref="pers:AHTU1">Ah-tuk-uk-koop</persName>, the head Chiefs, and by the other Chiefs 
     <lb/>
     and Councillors, those signing, though many Indians were absent, yet re<lb break="no"/>presenting all the bands of any importance in the Carlton regions, except 
     <lb/>
     the Willow Indians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 24th the Commissioners again met the Indians, when I presented 
     <lb/>
     the Head Chiefs with their medals, uniforms and flags, and informed them 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Christie would give the other Chiefs and Councillors the same in 
     <lb/>
     the evening. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some half a dozen of Saulteaux then came forward, of whom I found one 
     <lb/>
     was from Qu'Appelle, and had been paid there, and the others did not be<lb break="no"/>long to the Carlton region. I told them that I had heard that they had 
     <lb/>
     endeavoured to prevent me crossing the river, and to prevent a treaty being 
     <lb/>
     made, but that they were not wiser than the whole of their nation, who had 
     <lb/>
     already been treated with. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They did not deny the charge, and their spokesman becoming insolent 
     <lb/>
     I declined to hear them further, and they retired, some stating that they 
     <lb/>
     would go to Fort Pitt, which I warned them not to do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Besides these Saulteaux, there were others present who disapproved of 
     <lb/>
     their proceedings, amongst them being Kis-so-way-is, already mentioned, 
     <lb/>
     and Pecheeto, who was the chief spokesman at Qu'Appelle, but is now a 
     <lb/>
     Councillor of the Fort Ellice Band. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I may mention here that the larger part of the Band to whom these other 
     <lb/>
     Saulteaux belonged, with the Chief Yellow Quill, gave in their adhesion to 
     <lb/>
     Treaty Number Four, at Fort Pelly about the time that their comrades 
     <lb/>
     were troubling me at Fort Carlton. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Christie then commenced the payments, assisted by Mr. McKay, of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Albert, and was engaged in so doing during the 24th and 25th. 
     <lb/>
     Amongst those paid were the few resident Saulteaux, who were accepted by 
     <lb/>
     the Cree Chiefs as part of their bands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The next morning, the 26th, the whole band, headed by their Chiefs and 
     <lb/>
     Councillors, dressed in their uniforms, came to Carlton House to pay their 
     <lb/>
     farewell visit to me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Chiefs came forward in order, each addressing me a few remarks, and 
     <lb/>
     I replied briefly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They then gave three cheers for the Queen, the Governor, one for the 
     <lb/>
     Mounted Police, and for Mr. Lawrence Clarke, of Carlton House, and then 
     <lb/>
     departed, firing guns as they went. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Considering it undesirable that so many Indians should be excluded from 
     <lb/>
     the treaty, as would be the case if I left the Duck Lake Indians to their 
     <lb/>
     own devices, I determined on sending a letter to them. I, therefore, pre<lb break="no"/>pared a. message, inviting them to meet me at the Hon. Mr. McKay's en<lb break="no"/>campment about three miles from the large Indian encampment about 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="188"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_188.jpg"/>
            
     <fw type="num">188</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw> 
     
     half way to Duck Lake, on Monday, the 28th, if they were prepared then 
     <lb/>
     to accept the terms of the treaty I had made with the Carlton Indians. My 
     <lb/>
     letter was entrusted to Mr. Levailler, who proceeded to Duck Lake. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On entering the Indian Council room, he found they had a letter written 
     <lb/>
     to me by the Rev. Mr. André, offering to accept the terms of the treaty, if 
     <lb/>
     I came to Duck Lake. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Indians sent for Mr. André to read my letter to them, which was 
     <lb/>
     received with satisfaction ; both he and Mr. Levailler urged them to accept 
     <lb/>
     my proposal, which they agreed to do, and requested Mr. Levailler to <choice><corr>in<lb break="no"/>orm</corr><sic>inform</sic></choice> me that they would go to the appointed place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Accordingly, on the 28th, the Commissioners met the Willow Indians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After the usual handshaking, and short speeches from two of the Chiefs, 
     <lb/>
     I addressed them, telling them I was sorry for the course they had pursued, 
     <lb/>
     and that I did not go away without giving them this opportunity to be in<lb break="no"/>cluded in the treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KAHM1">Kah-mee-yes-too-waegs</persName>, the Beardy, spoke for the people. He said some 
     <lb/>
     things were too little. He was anxious about the buffalo. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SAYS1">Say-sway-kees</persName> wished to tell our mother, the Queen, that they were 
     <lb/>
     alarmed about the buffalo. It appeared as if there was only one left. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KAHM1">The Beardy</persName> again addressed me, and said,—" You have told me what 
     <lb/>
     you have done with the others you will do with us. I accept the terms ; no 
     <lb/>
     doubt it will run further, according to our numbers ; when I am utterly 
     <lb/>
     unable to help myself I want to receive assistance." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I replied to them, explaining, with regard to assistance, that we could 
     <lb/>
     not support or feed the Indians, and all that we would do would be to help 
     <lb/>
     them to cultivate the soil. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If a general famine came upon the Indians the charity of the Government 
     <lb/>
     would come into exercise. I admitted the importance of steps being taken 
     <lb/>
     to preserve the buffalo, and assured them that it would be considered by the 
     <lb/>
     Governor-General and Council of the North-West Territories, to see if a 
     <lb/>
     wise law could be framed such as could be carried out and obeyed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The three Chiefs and their head men then signed the treaty, and the 
     <lb/>
     medals and flags were distributed, when Mr. Christie intimated that he was 
     <lb/>
     ready to make the payments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They then asked that this should be done at Duck Lake, but Mr. Christie 
     <lb/>
     informed them that, as we had to leave for Fort Pitt, this was impossible ; 
     <lb/>
     and that, moreover, their share of the unexpended provisions and the cloth<lb break="no"/>ing and presents were at the fort, where they would require to go for them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They then agreed to accept the payment, which was at once proceeded 
     <lb/>
     with. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The persistency with which these Indians clung to their endeavor to com<lb break="no"/>pel the Commissioners to proceed to Duck Lake was in part owing to super<lb break="no"/>stition, the Chief, Beardy, having announced that he had a vision, in which 
     <lb/>
     it was made known to him that the treaty would be made there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was partly, also, owing to hostility to the treaty, as they endeavored to 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="189"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_189.jpg"/>
           
     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">189</fw> 
     
            
     induce the Carlton Indians to make no treaty, and urged them not to sell 
     <lb/>
     the land, but to lend it for four years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The good sense and intelligence of the head Chiefs led them to reject'their 
     <lb/>
     proposals, and the Willow Indians eventually, as I have reported, accepted 
     <lb/>
     the treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The 29th was occupied by Mr. Christie in settling accounts, taking stock 
     <lb/>
     of the clothing, and preparing for our departure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     An application was made to me by Toma, the Saulteanx, who took part in 
     <lb/>
     the proceedings on the 23rd, to sign the treaty as Chief of the Saulteaux 
     <lb/>
     band. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I could not ascertain that there were sufficient families of these Indians 
     <lb/>
     resident in the region to be recognized as a distinct band, and as I had no 
     <lb/>
     evidence that they desired him to be their Chief, I declined to allow him to 
     <lb/>
     sign the treaty, but informed him that next year, if the Saulteaux were 
     <lb/>
     numerous enough, and expressed the wish that he should be Chief, he would 
     <lb/>
     be recognized. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He was satisfied with this, and said that next year they would come to 
     <lb/>
     the payments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     His daughter, a widow, with her family, was paid, but he preferred to 
     <lb/>
     remain until next year, as he did not wish to be paid, except as a Chief. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the morning of the 3lst, the previous day having been wet, Mr. Christie 
     <lb/>
     and I left for Fort Pitt, Mr. McKay having preceded us by the other road 
     <lb/>
     —that by way of Battle River. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We arrived on the 5th September, the day appointed, having rested, as 
     <lb/>
     was our custom throughout the whole journey, on Sunday, the 3rd. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     About six miles from the fort we were met by Col. Jarvis and the police, 
     <lb/>
     with their band, as an escort, and also by Mr. McKay, the Factor of the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson's Bay Company, who informed us that he had rooms ready for our 
     <lb/>
     occupation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We found over one hundred lodges of Indians already there, and received 
     <lb/>
     a message from them, that as their friends were constantly arriving, they 
     <lb/>
     wished delay until the 7th. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the morning of the 6th, Sweet Grass, who had come in, in consequence 
     <lb/>
     of my message, accompanied by about thirty of the principal men, called to 
     <lb/>
     see me and express their gratification at my arrival. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Their greeting was cordial, but novel in my experience, as they embraced 
     <lb/>
     me in their arms, and kissed me on both cheeks, a reception which they 
     <lb/>
     extended also to Mr. Christie and Dr. Jackes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Hon. James McKay arrived from Battle River in the evening, and 
     <lb/>
     reported that he had met there a number of Indians, principally Saulteaux, 
     <lb/>
     who had been camped there for some time. There had been about seventy 
     <lb/>
     lodges in all, but as the buffalo had come near, the poorer Indians had gone 
     <lb/>
     after them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They expressed good feeling, and said they would like to have waited until 
     <lb/>
     the 15th, the day named for my arrival there, to see me and accept the treaty, 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="190"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_190.jpg"/>
            
     <fw type="num">190</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw> 
     

     but that the buffalo hunt was of so much consequence to them that they 
     <lb/>
     could not wait so long. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This band is a mixed one, composed of Crees and Saulteaux from Jack 
     <lb/>
     Fish Lake, their Chief being the Yellow Sky. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 7th the Commissioners proceeded to the council tent, which was 
     <lb/>
     pitched on the high plateau above the fort, commanding a very fine view, 
     <lb/>
     and facing the Indian encampment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They were accompanied by the escort of the police, with their band. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Indians approached with much pomp and ceremony, following the 
     <lb/>
     lead of Sweet Grass. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The stem dance was performed as at Fort Carlton, but with much more 
     <lb/>
     ceremony, there being four pipes instead of one, and the number of riders, 
     <lb/>
     singers and dancers being more numerous. After the pipes were stroked by 
     <lb/>
     the Commissioners, they were presented to each of them to be smoked, and 
     <lb/>
     then laid upon the table to be covered with calico and cloth, and returned 
     <lb/>
     to their bearers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After the conclusion of these proceedings I addressed them, telling them 
     <lb/>
     we had come at their own request, and that there was now a trail leading 
     <lb/>
     from Lake Superior to Red River, that I saw it stretching on thence to Fort 
     <lb/>
     Ellice, and there branching off, the one track going to Qu'Appelle and Cyprus 
     <lb/>
     Hills, and the other by Fort Pelly to Carlton, and thence I expected to see 
     <lb/>
     it extended, by way of Fort Pitt to the Rocky Mountains ; on that road I 
     <lb/>
     saw all the Chippewas and Crees walking, and I saw along it gardens 
     <lb/>
     being planted and houses built. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I invited them to join their brother Indians and walk with the white men 
     <lb/>
     on this road. I told them what we had done at Carlton, and offered them 
     <lb/>
     the same terms, which I would explain fully if they wished it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On closing Sweet Grass rose, and taking me by the hand, asked me to 
     <lb/>
     explain the terms of the treaty, after which they would all shake hands with 
     <lb/>
     me and then go to meet in council. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I complied with this request. and stated the terms fully to them, both 
     <lb/>
     addresses having occupied me for three hours. On concluding they expressed 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction, and retired to their council. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 8th the Indians asked for more time to deliberate, which was 
     <lb/>
     granted, as we learned that some of them desired to make exorbitant demands, 
     <lb/>
     and we wished to let them understand through the avenues by which we had 
     <lb/>
     access to them that these would be fruitless. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 9th, the Commissioners proceeded to the council tent, but the 
     <lb/>
     Indians were slow of gathering, being still in council, endeavoring to agree 
     <lb/>
     amongst themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At length they approached and seated themselves in front of the tent. I 
     <lb/>
               then asked them to speak to me. <persName ref="pers:KIHE1">The Eagle</persName> addressed the Indians, telling 
     <lb/>
     them not to be afraid, and that I was to them as a brother, and what the 
     <lb/>
     Queen wished to establish was for their good. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               After some time had passed, <persName ref="pers:MORR1">I</persName> again called on them to tell me their minds 
     <lb/>
         
            <pb n="191"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_191.jpg"/>
       
     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">191</fw> 
    
    and not to be afraid. <persName ref="pers:WEEK1">Sweet Grass</persName> then rose and addressed me in a very 
     <lb/>
     sensible manner. He thanked the Queen for sending me; he was glad to 
     <lb/>
     have a brother and a friend who would help to lift them up above their pre<lb break="no"/>sent condition. He thanked me for the offer and saw nothing to be afraid 
     <lb/>
     of. He therefore accepted gladly, and took my hand to his heart. He said 
     <lb/>
     God was looking down on us that day, and had opened a new world to them. 
     <lb/>
     Sweet Grass further said, he pitied those who had to live by the buffalo, but 
     <lb/>
     that if spared until this time next year, he wanted, this my brother (i.e. the 
     <lb/>
     Governor), to commence to act for him in protecting the buffalo; for him<lb break="no"/>self he would commence at once to prepare a small piece of land, and his 
     <lb/>
     kinsmen would do the same. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Placing one hand over my heart, and the other over his own, he said: 
     <lb/>
     " May the white man's blood never be spilt on this earth. I am thankful 
     <lb/>
     that the white man and red man can stand together. When I hold your 
     <lb/>
     hand and touch your heart, let us be as one ; use your utmost to help me 
     <lb/>
     and help my children so that they may prosper." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Chief's speech, of which the foregoing gives a brief outline in his own 
     <lb/>
     words, was assented to by the people with a peculiar guttural sound which 
     <lb/>
     takes with them the place of the British cheer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:MORR1">I</persName> replied, expressing my satisfaction that they had so unanimously approved 
     <lb/>
     of the arrangement I had made with the nation at Carlton, and promised 
     <lb/>
     that I would send them next year, as I had said to the Crees of Carlton, 
     <lb/>
     copies of the treaty printed on parchment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I said that I knew that some of the Chiefs were absent, but next year 
     <lb/>
     they would receive the present of money as they had done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               The Commissioners then signed the treaty, as did <persName ref="pers:WEEK1">Sweet Grass</persName>, eight other 
     <lb/>
     Chiefs and those of their Councillors who were present, the Chiefs address<lb break="no"/>ing me before signing. James Senum, Chief of the Crees at White Fish 
     <lb/>
     Lake, said that he commenced to cultivate the soil some years ago. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:CHRI3">Mr. Christie</persName>, then chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, gave him 
     <lb/>
     a plough, but it was now broken. He had no cattle when he commenced, 
     <lb/>
     but he and his people drew the plough themselves, and made hoes of roots of 
     <lb/>
     trees. Mr. Christie also gave him a pit-saw and a grind-stone, and he 
     <lb/>
     was still using them. His heart was sore in spring when his children 
     <lb/>
     wanted to plough and had no implements. He asked for these as soon as 
     <lb/>
     possible, and referring to the Wesleyan mission at that place, he said by 
     <lb/>
     following what I have been taught it helps me a great deal. . 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUNT5">The Little Hunter</persName>, a leading Chief of the Plain Crees, said he was glad 
     <lb/>
     from his very heart; he felt in taking the Governor s hand as if it was the 
     <lb/>
     Queen's. When I hear her words that she is going to put this country to 
     <lb/>
     rights, it is the help of God that put it into her heart. He wished an ever<lb break="no"/>lasting grasp of her hand; he was thankful for the children who would 
     <lb/>
     prosper. All the children who were settling there, hoped that the Great 
     <lb/>
     Spirit would look down upon us as one. Other Chiefs expressed themselves 
     <lb/>
     similarly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:KINO1">Ken-oo-say-oo</persName>, or The Fish, was a Chippewayan or mountaineer, a small 
     <lb/>
     band of whom are in this region. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               They had no Chief, but at my request they had selected a Chief and pre<lb break="no"/>sented the Fish to me. <persName ref="pers:KINO1">He</persName> said, speaking in Cree, that he thanked the 
     <lb/>
     Queen, and shook hands with me; he was glad for what had been done, and 
     <lb/>
     if he could have used his own tongue he would have said more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:MORR1">I</persName> then presented Sweet Grass his medal, uniform, and flag, the band 
     <lb/>
     playing "God Save the Queen " and all the Indians rising to their feet. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The rest of the medals, flags, and uniforms, were distributed, as soon as 
     <lb/>
     possible, and Mr. Christie commenced to make the payments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On Sunday, the 10th, the Rev. Mr. McKay conducted the service for the 
     <lb/>
     police and others, who might attend, and in the afternoon the Rev. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McDougall had a service in Cree ; Bishop Grandin and the Rev. Mr. Scol<lb break="no"/>len also had services for the Crees and Chippewayans. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On Monday, the 11th, Mr. Christie completed the payments and distri<lb break="no"/>bution of provisions. The police commenced crossing the Saskatchewan, 
     <lb/>
     with a view to leaving on Tuesday, the 12th, for Battle River. We therefore 
     <lb/>
     sent our horses and carts across the river, and had our tents pitched with the 
     <lb/>
     view of commencing our return journey, early in the morning. Just as we were 
     <lb/>
     about to leave Port Pitt, however, the Great Bear, one of the three Cree 
     <lb/>
     Chiefs who were absent, arrived at the fort and asked to see me. The Com<lb break="no"/>missioners met him, when he told me that he had been out on the plains 
     <lb/>
     hunting the buffalo, and had not heard the time of the meeting; that on 
     <lb/>
     hearing of it he had been sent in by the Crees and by the Stonies or Assini<lb break="no"/>boines to speak for them. I explained to him what had been done at Carl<lb break="no"/>ton and Pitt; he expressed regret that I was going away as he wished to 
     <lb/>
     talk to me. I then said we would not remove until the next day, which 
     <lb/>
     gratified him much. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 13th, Sweet Grass and all the other Chiefs and Councillors came 
     <lb/>
     down to the fort with the Great Bear to bid me farewell. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sweet Grass told me the object of their visit. The Bear said the Indians 
     <lb/>
     on the plains had sent him to speak for them, and those who were away 
     <lb/>
     were as a barrier before what he would have to say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WEEK1">Sweet Grass</persName> said, addressing him, " You see the representative of the Queen 
     <lb/>
     here. I think the Great Spirit put it into their hearts to come to our help. 
     <lb/>
     Let there be no barrier, as it is with great difficulty that this was brought 
     <lb/>
     about. Say yes and take his hand." The White Fish spoke similarly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BIGB1">The Bear</persName> said, "Stop, my friends. I never saw the Governor before; 
     <lb/>
     when I heard he was to come, I said I will request him to save me from 
     <lb/>
     what I most dread—hanging ; it was not given to us to have the rope about 
     <lb/>
     our necks." I replied, that God had given it to us to punish murder by 
     <lb/>
     death, and explained the protection the police force afforded the Indians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BIGB1">Big Bear</persName> still demanded that there should be no hanging, and I informed 
     <lb/>
     him that his request would not be granted. He then wished that the 
     <lb/>
    buffalo might be protected, and asked why the other Chiefs did not speak. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
  
            <pb n="193"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_193.jpg"/>
           
     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">193</fw> 
     
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:KINO1">The Fish</persName>, the Chipewayan replied, " We do not because Sweet Grass has 
     <lb/>
     spoken, and what he says we all say." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I then asked the Bear to tell the other two absent Chiefs, Short Tail and 
     <lb/>
     Sagamat, what had been done; that I had written him and them a letter, 
     <lb/>
     and sent it by Sweet Grass, and that next year they cauld join the treaty ; 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the buffalo, the North-West Council were considering the 
     <lb/>
     question, and I again explained that we would not interfere with the In<lb break="no"/>dian's daily life except to assist them in farming. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I then said I never expected to see them again. The land was so large 
     <lb/>
     that another Governor was to be sent, whom I hoped they would receive as 
     <lb/>
     they had done me, and give him the same confidence they had extended to 
     <lb/>
     me. The Chiefs and Councillors, commencing with Sweet Grass, then 
     <lb/>
     shook hands with Mr. Christie and myself, each addressing me words of 
     <lb/>
     parting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BIGB1">The Bear</persName> remained sitting until all had shaken hands, he then took mine 
     <lb/>
     and holding it, said, " If he had known he would have met me with all his 
     <lb/>
     people. I am not an undutiful child, I do not throw back your hand, but 
     <lb/>
     as my people are not here I do not sign. I will tell them what I have 
     <lb/>
     heard, and next year I will come." The Indians then left, but shortly after<lb break="no"/>wards the Bear came to see me again, fearing I had not fully understood 
     <lb/>
     him, and assured me that he accepted the treaty as if he had signed it, and 
     <lb/>
     would come next year with all his people and accept it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We crossed the river, and left for Battle River in the afternoon, where we 
     <lb/>
     arrived on the afternoon of the 15th. We found no Indians there except 
     <lb/>
     Red Pheasant and his band, whom we had already met at Carlton. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 16th, the Red Pheasant saw the Commissioners. He said he was 
     <lb/>
     a Battle River Indian ; his fathers had lived there before him, but he was 
     <lb/>
     glad to see the Government coming there, as it would improve his means of 
     <lb/>
     living. He wished the claims of the Half-breeds who had settled there 
     <lb/>
     before the Government came to be respected, as for himself he would go 
     <lb/>
     away and seek another home, and though it was hard to leave the home of 
     <lb/>
     his people, yet he would make way for the white man, and surely, he said, 
     <lb/>
     " if the poor Indian acts thus, the Queen, when she hears of this, will help 
     <lb/>
     him." He asked, that a little land should be given him to plant potatoes 
     <lb/>
     in next spring, and they would remove after digging them, to their reserve, 
     <lb/>
     which he thought he would wish to have at the Eagle Hills. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I expressed my satisfaction with their conduct and excellent spirit, and 
     <lb/>
     obtained the cheerful consent of Mr. Fuller, of the Pacific telegraph line, 
     <lb/>
     who is in occupation of a large cultivated field, that the band should use 
     <lb/>
     three acres within the fenced enclosure, and which, moreover, Mr. Fuller 
     <lb/>
     kindly promised to plough for them gratuitously. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     The 17th being Sunday we remained at our camp, and on Monday morn<lb break="no"/>ing, the 18th, we commenced our long return journey, with the incidents 
     <lb/>
     of which I will not trouble you further than to state that, on arriving on 
     <lb/>
     the 4th of October at an encampment about thirty miles from Portage la 
     <lb/>

     Prairie, we found it necessary to leave our tents and carts to follow us 
     <lb/>
     leisurely (many of the horses having become completely exhausted with the 
     <lb/>
     long journey of sixteen hundred miles) and push on to the Portage; on the 
     <lb/>
     5th we reached the Portage, where Mr. Christie and Dr. Jackes remained, 
     <lb/>
     their horses being unable to go farther, and I went on to Poplar Point, 
     <lb/>
     forty-five miles from Fort Garry, where I found accommodation for the 
     <lb/>
     night from Mr. Chisholm, of the Hudson's Bay Company's Post there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I arrived at Fort Garry on the afternoon of the 6th of October, having 
     <lb/>
     been absent for over two months and a half. Mr. McKay, having taken 
     <lb/>
     another road, had arrived before me ; Mr. Christie and Dr. Jackes reached 
     <lb/>
     here subsequently. Having thus closed the narrative of our proceedings, 
     <lb/>
     I proceed to deal with the results of our mission, and to submit for your 
     <lb/>
     consideration some reflections and to make some practical suggestions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1st. The Indians inhabiting the ceded territory are chiefly Crees, but 
     <lb/>
     there are a few Assiniboines on the plains and also at the slope of the 
     <lb/>
     mountains. There are also a small number of Saulteaux and one band of 
     <lb/>
     Chippewayans. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2nd. I was agreeably surprised to find so great a willingness on the part 
     <lb/>
     of the Crees to commence to cultivate the soil, and so great a desire to have 
     <lb/>
     their children instructed. I requested Mr. Christie to confer with the Chief 
     <lb/>
     while the payments were going on, as to the localities where they would 
     <lb/>
     desire to have reserves assigned to them, and with few exceptions they 
     <lb/>
     indicated the places, in fact most of them have already commenced to settle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is, therefore, important that the cattle and agricultural implements 
     <lb/>
     should be given them without delay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would, therefore, recommend that provision should be made for forward<lb break="no"/>ing these as soon as the spring opens. I think it probable that cattle and 
     <lb/>
     some implements could be purchased at Prince Albert and thus avoid trans<lb break="no"/>portation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3rd. I would further represent that, though I did not grant the request, 
     <lb/>
     I thought the desire of the Indians, to be instructed in farming and building, 
     <lb/>
     most reasonable, and I would therefore recommend that measures be 
     <lb/>
     adopted to provide such instruction for them. Their present mode of living 
     <lb/>
     is passing away; the Indians are tractable, docile and willing to learn. I 
     <lb/>
     think that advantage should be taken of this disposition to teach them to 
     <lb/>
     become self-supporting, which can best be accomplished with the aid of a few 
     <lb/>
     practical farmers and carpenters to instruct them in farming and house 
     <lb/>
     building. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The universal demand for teachers, and by some of the Indians for mis<lb break="no"/>sionaries, is also encouraging. The former, the Government can supply; for 
     <lb/>
     the latter they must rely on the churches, and I trust that these will continue 
     <lb/>
     and extend their operations amongst them. The field is wide enough for 
     <lb/>
     all, and the cry of the Indian for help is a clamant one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4th. In connection with the aiding of the Indians to settle, I have to call 
     <lb/>
     attention to the necessity of regulations being made for the preservation of 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="195"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_195.jpg"/>
        
     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">195</fw> 
     

     the buffalo. These animals are fast decreasing in numbers, but I am satis<lb break="no"/>fied that a few simple regulations would preserve the herds for many years. 
     <lb/>
     The subject was constantly pressed on my attention by the Indians, and I 
     <lb/>
     promised that the matter would be considered by the North-West Council. 
     <lb/>
     The council that has governed the territories for the last four years was 
     <lb/>
     engaged in maturing a law for this purpose, and had our regime continued 
     <lb/>
     we would have passed a statute for their preservation. I commend the 
     <lb/>
     matter to the attention of our successors as one of urgent importance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     5th. There is another class of the population in the North-West whose 
     <lb/>
     position I desire to bring under the notice of the Privy Council. I refer to 
     <lb/>
     the wandering Half-breeds of the plains, who are chiefly of French descent 
     <lb/>
     and live the life of the Indians. There are a few who are identified with 
     <lb/>
     the Indians, but there is a large class of Metis who live by the hunt of the 
     <lb/>
     buffalo, and have no settled homes. I think that a census of the numbers 
     <lb/>
     of these should be procured, and while I would not be disposed to recom<lb break="no"/>mend their being brought under the treaties, I would suggest that land 
     <lb/>
     should be assigned to them, and that on their settling down, if after an 
     <lb/>
     examination into their circumstances, it should be found necessary and 
     <lb/>
     expedient, some assistance should be given them to enable them to enter 
     <lb/>
     upon agricultural operations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If the measures suggested by me are adopted, viz., effective regulations 
     <lb/>
    with regard to the buffalo, the Indians taught to cultivate the soil, and the 
     <lb/>erratic Half-breeds encouraged to settle down, I believe that the solution of 
     <lb/>all social questions of any present importance in the North-West Territories 
     <lb/>will have been arrived at. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion, I have to call your attention to the report made to me by 
     <lb/>the Hon. Mr. Christie, which I forward herewith; that gentleman took the 
     <lb/>entire charge of the payments and administration of matters connected with 
     <lb/>the treaty, and I have to speak in the highest terms of the value of his 
     <lb/>services. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Accompanying his report will be found the pay sheets, statements of 
     <lb/>
     distribution of provisions and clothing, memoranda as to the localities of the 
     <lb/>
     reserves, suggestions as to the times and places of payment next year, and 
     <lb/>
     a general balance sheet. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A credit of $60,000 was given to me, and I have placed as a refund to the 
     <lb/>
     credit of the Receiver-General, $12,730.55. This arises from the fact that 
     <lb/>
     owing to the proximity of the buffalo, many of the Indians did not come into 
     <lb/>
     the treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have to acknowledge the benefit I derived from the services of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     James McKay, camping as he did near the Indian encampment. He had 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity of meeting them constantly, and learning their views which 
     <lb/>
     his familarity with the Indian dialects enabled him to do. Dr. Jackes 
     <lb/>
     took a warm interest in the progress of our work, and kept a record of the 
     <lb/>
     negotiations, a copy of which I enclose and which I think ought to be pub<lb break="no"/>lished, as it will be of great value to those who will be called on to administer 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="196"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_09_Page_196.jpg"/>
            
     <fw type="num">196</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw> 
    

     the treaty, showing as it does what was said by the negotiators and by the 
     <lb/>
     Indians, and preventing misrepresentations in the future. The Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners are under obligations to Lieut.-Colonel McLeod, and the other 
     <lb/>
     officers and men of the police force for their escort. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The conduct of the men was excellent, and the presence of the force as an 
     <lb/>
     emblem and evidence of the establishment of authority in the North-West 
     <lb/>
     was of great value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have to record my appreciation of the kindness of Messrs. Clarke, of 
     <lb/>
     Fort Carlton, and McKay of Fort Pitt, and of the other officials of the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson's Bay Company, and of the hearty assistance they extended towards 
     <lb/>
     the accomplishment of our mission. I have also to mention the interest 
     <lb/>
     taken in the negotiations by His Lordship Bishop Grandin, and by the 
     <lb/>
     various missionaries, Protestant and Catholic. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On this occasion, as on others, I found the Half-breed population whether 
     <lb/>
     French or English generally using the influence of their relationship to the 
     <lb/>
     Indians in support of our efforts to come to a satisfactory arrangement with 
     <lb/>
     them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We also had the advantage of good interpreters, having secured the services 
     <lb/>
     of Messrs. Peter Ballendine and John McKay, while the Indians had engaged 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Peter Erasmus to discharge the same duty. The latter acted as chief 
     <lb/>
     interpreter, being assisted by the others, and is a most efficient interpreter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty, and have only in conclusion to 
     <lb/>
     express my hope that this further step in the progress of the work of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion amongst the Indian tribes will prove beneficial to them, and of 
     <lb/>
     advantage to the realm.

     Carlton House, offering to the Governor and party the hospi<lb break="no"/>tality of the Fort.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The next morning, when about ten miles from Carlton, the 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners were met by a detachment of Mounted Police 
     <lb/>
     under Major Walker, who escorted them to the Fort ; on the 
     <lb/>
     way the Commissioners passed an encampment of Crees whose 
     <lb/>
     Chief had previously seen the Governor at Duck Lake and 
     <lb/>
     asked him to make the treaty there ; he replied that he could 
     <lb/>
     not promise, that he would meet the Indians where the greater 
     <lb/>
     number wished. These Crees joined in an invocation to the 
     <lb/>
     deity for a blessing on the Governor, and deputed one of their 
     <lb/>
     number to welcome him by shaking hands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Near the Fort were encamped about two hundred and fifty 
     <lb/>
     lodges of Crees, to whom the Commissioners at once served 
     <lb/>
     out two days' allowance of provisions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 16th the Crees reported that they wanted another 
     <lb/>
     day to confer amongst themselves, this was granted and the 
     <lb/>
     Governor requested them to meet him and the Commissioners 
     <lb/>
     on the 18th at 10 am., to commence the business of the 
     <lb/>
     treaty.

            <p>
     At half-past ten His Honor Lieut.-Gov. Morris, the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     W. J. Christie and Hon. Jas. McKay, accompanied by an 
     <lb/>
     escort of North-West Mounted Police, left the Fort for the 
     <lb/>
     camp of the Cree Indians, who had selected a site about a mile 
     <lb/>
     and a half from the Hudson's Bay Fort. There were about 
     <lb/>
     two hundred and fifty lodges, containing over two thousand 
     <lb/>
     souls. The Governor's tent was pitched on a piece of rising 
     <lb/>
     ground about four hundred yards from the Indian camp, and 
     <lb/>
     immediately facing it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As soon as the Governor and party arrived, the Indians 
     <lb/>
     who were to take part in the treaty, commenced to assemble 
     <lb/>
     
            <pb n="198"

     near the Chief's tents, to the sound of beating drums and the 
     <lb/>
     discharge of small arms, singing, dancing and loud speaking, 
     <lb/>
     going on at the same time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In about half an hour they were ready to advance and meet 
     <lb/>
     the Governor; this they did in a large semi-circle; in their 
     <lb/>
     front were about twenty braves on horseback, galloping about 
     <lb/>
     in circles, shouting, singing and going through various pictur<lb break="no"/>esque performances. The semi-circle steadily advanced until 
     <lb/>
     within fifty yards of the Governor's tent, when a halt was made 
     <lb/>
     and further peculiar ceremonies commenced, the most remark<lb break="no"/>able of which was the " dance of the stem." This was commenced 
     <lb/>
     by the Chiefs, medicine men, councillors, singers and drum- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     beaters, coming a little to the front and seating themselves on 
     <lb/>
     blankets and robes spread for them. The bearer of the stem, 
     <lb/>
     Wah-wee-kah-nich-kah-oh-tah-mah-hote (the man you strike on 
     <lb/>
     the back), carrying in his hand a large and gorgeously adorned 
     <lb/>
     pipe stem, walked slowly along the semi-circle, and advancing 
     <lb/>
     to the front, raised the stem to the heavens, then slowly turned 
     <lb/>
     to the north, south, east and west, presenting the stem at each 
     <lb/>
     point; returning to the seated group he handed the stem to 
     <lb/>
     one of the young men, who commenced a low chant, at the 
     <lb/>
     same time performing a ceremonial dance accompanied by the 
     <lb/>
     drums and singing of the men and women in the background. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This was all repeated by another of the young men, after 
     <lb/>
     which the horsemen again commenced galloping in circles, the 
     <lb/>
     whole body slowly advancing. As they approached his tent, 
     <lb/>
     the Governor, accompanied by the Hon. W. J. Christie and 
     <lb/>
     Hon. J as. McKay, Commissioners, went forward to meet them 
     <lb/>
     and to receive the stem carried by its bearer. It was presen<lb break="no"/>ted first to the Governor, who in accordance with their cus<lb break="no"/>toms, stroked it several times, then passed it to the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners who repeated the ceremony. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The significance of this ceremony is that the Governor and 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners accepted the friendship of the tribe. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

      men ; the Indians slowly seating themselves in regular order 
     <lb/>
     in front of the tent. In a few minutes there was perfect quiet 
     <lb/>
     and order, when His Honor <persName ref="pers:MORR1">the Lieutenant-Governor</persName> addressed 
     <lb/>
     them as follows : 
     <lb/>
      </p>
            <p>" My Indian brothers, Indians of the plains, I have shaken 
     <lb/>hands with a few of you, I shake hands with all of you in my 
     <lb/>heart. God has given us a good day, I trust his eye is upon 
     <lb/>us, and that what we do will be for the benefit of his children. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"What I say and what you say, and what we do, is done 
     <lb/>openly before the whole people. You are, like me and my 
     <lb/>friends who are with me, children of the Queen. We are of 
     <lb/>the same blood, the same God made us and the same Queen 
     <lb/> rules over us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"I am a Queen's Councillor, I am her Governor of all these 
     <lb/> territories, and I am here to speak from her to you. I am 
     <lb/>here now because for many days the Cree nation have been 
     <lb/> sending word that they wished to see a Queen's messenger 
     <lb/>face to face. I told the Queen's Councillors your wishes. 
     <lb/>I sent you word last year by a man who has gone where 
     <lb/> we will all go by and by, that a Queen's messenger 
     <lb/> would meet you this year. I named Forts Carlton and Pitt as 
     <lb/> the places of meeting, I sent a letter to you saying so, and my 
     <lb/>heart grew warm when I heard how well you received it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"As the Queen's chief servant here, I always keep my prom<lb break="no"/>ises; thethe winter came and went but I did not forget my word, 
     <lb/>tent, and I sent a messenger to tell you that I would meet you at 
     <lb/> Carlton on the 15th of August, and at Fort Pitt on the 5th of 
     <lb/> September. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" During the winter I went to Ottawa to consult with the 
     <lb/>other Queen's Councillors about you amongst other matters, 
     <lb/>and they said to me, ' you promised a Queen's messenger to the 
     <lb/>Crees, you have been so much with the Indians, that we wish 
     <lb/>and you to go yourself ;' I said 'the journey is long and I am not a 
     <lb/>strong man, but when a duty is laid upon me I will do it, but,' 
     <lb/>I said, 'you must give with me two friends and councillors

     whom I can trust, to help me in the duty ;' and now I have 
     <lb/>
     with me two friends whom you and I have known long ; one 
     <lb/>
     of them is of your own blood, the other has been many years 
     <lb/>
     amongst you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "I will, in a short time, give you a message from the Queen, 
     <lb/>
     and my Councillors will tell you that the words are true. Be<lb break="no"/>fore I do so, there are so many things I want to say to you 
     <lb/>
     that I scarcely know where to begin. I have been nearly 
     <lb/>
     four years Governor of Manitoba and these territories, and 
     <lb/>
     from the day I was sworn, I took the Indian by the hand, and 
     <lb/>
     those who took it have never let it go. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "Three years ago I went to the north-west angle of Lake 
     <lb/>
     of the Woods, and there I met the Chippewa nation, I gave 
     <lb/>
     them a message and they talked with me and when they 
     <lb/>
     understood they took my hand. Some were away, next year 
     <lb/>
     I sent messengers to them and I made a treaty between the 
     <lb/>
     Queen and them ; there are numbered of those altogether four 
     <lb/>
     thousand. I then went to Lake Qu'Appelle the year after, and 
     <lb/>
     met the Crees and Chippewas there, gave them my message, 
     <lb/>
     and they took my hand. Last summer I went to Lake Win<lb break="no"/>nipeg and gave the Queen's message to the Swampy Crees and 
     <lb/>
     they and I, acting for the Queen, came together heart to heart; 
     <lb/>
     and now that the Indians of the east understand the Queen 
     <lb/>
     and her Councillors, I come to you. And why is all this done? 
     <lb/>
     I will tell you ; it is because you are the subjects of the Queen 
     <lb/>
     as I am. She cares as much for one of you as she does for 
     <lb/>
     one of her white subjects. The other day a party of Iroquois 
     <lb/>
     Indians were taken to England across the ocean ; the Queen 
     <lb/>
     heard of it and sent to them, saying, 'I want to see my red chil<lb break="no"/>dren,' took their hands and gave each of them her picture, and 
     <lb/>
     sent them away happy with her goodness. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "Before I came here I was one of the Queen's Councillors at 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa. We have many Indians there as here, but for many 
     <lb/>
     years there has been friendship between the British, and the 
     <lb/>
     Indians. We respect the Indians as brothers and as men.

            <p>
     Let me give you a proof it. Years ago there was war between 
     <lb/>
     the British and the Americans ; there was a great battle ; there 
     <lb/>
     were two brave Chief warriors on the British side, one wore 
     <lb/>
     the red coat, the other dressed as you do, but they fought 
     <lb/>
     side by side as brothers ; the one was Brock and the other was 
     <lb/>
     Tecumseth whose memory will never die ; the blood of both 
     <lb/>
     watered the ground ; the bones of Tecumseth were hid by his 
     <lb/>
     friends ; the remains of Brock by his, and now a great pile of 
     <lb/>
     stone stands up toward heaven in his memory. And now the 
     <lb/>
     white man is searching for the remains of Tecumseth, and when 
     <lb/>
     found they will build another monument in honour of the Indian. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " I hope the days of fighting are over, but notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
     the whites are as much your friends in these days of peace, as 
     <lb/>
     in war. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " The many Indians in the place that I have left are happy, 
     <lb/>
     prosperous, contented and growing in numbers. A meeting of 
     <lb/>
     the Grand Council of the Six Nation Indians was held a month 
     <lb/>
     ago; they now number six thousand souls. They met to thank 
     <lb/>
     the Queen and to say that they were content, and why are they 
     <lb/>
     content ? Because many years ago the Queen's Councillors saw 
     <lb/>
     that the Indians that would come after, must be cared for, they 
     <lb/>
     saw that the means of living were passing away from the 
     <lb/>
     Indians, they knew that women and children were sometimes 
     <lb/>
     without food ; they sent men to speak to the Indians, they said 
     <lb/>
     your children must be educated, they must be taught to raise 
     <lb/>
     food for themselves. The Indians heard them, the Councillors 
     <lb/>
     gave them seed, land, food, taught their children and let them 
     <lb/>
     feel that they were of one blood with the whites. Now, what 
     <lb/>
     we have found to work so well where I came from we want to 
     <lb/>
     have here in our territories, and I am happy to say that my 
     <lb/>
     heart is gladdened by the way the Indians have met me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      " We are not here as traders, I do not come as to buy or sell 
     <lb/>
     horses or goods, I come to you, children of the Queen, to try to 
     <lb/>
     help you ; when I say yes, I mean it, and when I say no, I mean 
     <lb/>
     it too.

     " I want you to think of my words, I want to tell you that 
     <lb/>
     what we talk about is very important. What I trust and hope 
     <lb/>
     we will do is not for to-day or to-morrow only ; what I will

     " You have to think of those who will come after you, and 
     <lb/>
     it will be a remembrance for me as long as I live, if I can go

     away feeling that I have done well for you. I believe we can

     understand each other, if not it will be the first occasion on

     which the Indians have not done so. If you are as anxious for 
     <lb/>
     your own welfare as I am, I am certain of what will happen.

            </p>

            <p>
     " The day is passing. I thank you for the respectful reception 
     <lb/>
     you have given me. I will do here as I have done on former

     occasions. I hope you will speak your minds as fully and as

     plainly as if I was one of yourselves.

     Here the Indians requested an adjournment until next day

     in order that they might meet in council ; this was granted, and

     the first day's proceedings terminated.

     Late in the evening the escort of Mounted Police was re<lb break="no"/>inforced by a detachment, accompanied by their band, under

     "My friends, we have another bright day before us, and I 
     <lb/>
     trust that when it closes our faces will continue as bright as 
     <lb/>
     the day before us. I spoke yesterday as a friend to friends, as 
     <lb/>
     a brother to brothers, as a father to his children. I did not 
     <lb/>
     want to hurry you, I wanted you to think of my words, and 
     <lb/>
     now I will be glad if you will do as I asked you then, present 
     <lb/>
     your Chiefs to me, and I shall be glad to hear the words of the

     Indians through the voice of their Chiefs, or whoever they may

     appoint.

     The head men then brought forward Mis-tah-wah-sis, of the 
     <lb/>
     Carlton Indians, representing seventy-six lodges. Ah-tuck-ah- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     coop, of the Wood Indians, representing about seventy lodges. 
     <lb/>
     These were acknowledged as the leading Chiefs, after them 
     <lb/>
     came James Smith, of the Fort-a-la-Corne Indians, fifty lodges. 
     <lb/>
     John Smith, of the Prince Albert and South Branch Indians, 
     <lb/>
     fifty lodges. The Chip-ee-wayan, of the Plain Indians, sixty

     lodges. Yah-yah-tah-kus-kin-un, of the Fishing or Sturgeon

     lake Indians, twenty lodges. Pee-yahan-kah-mihk-oo-sit, thirty

     Here a messenger came from the Indians under   <persName ref="pers:KAHM1">Chief 
     <lb/>
     Beardy</persName>, camped at Duck Lake, eight miles from the main camp. 
     <lb/>
     He shook hands with the Governor and said," I am at a loss at 
     <lb/>
     this time what to say, for the Indians' mind cannot be all the

     same, that is why I came to tell the Governor the right of it ; 
     <lb/>
     with a good heart I plead at this time, it is not my own work,

     I would like to know his mind just now and hear the terms of

     the others.

     On the Indians expressing themselves ready to hear the 
     <lb/>
     message, <persName ref="pers:MORR1">the Governor</persName> said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " First I wish to talk to you about what I regard as some<lb break="no"/>thing affecting the lives of yourselves and the lives of your 
     <lb/>
     children. Often when I thought of the future of the Indian 
     <lb/>
     my heart was sad within me. I saw that the large game was 
     <lb/>
     getting scarcer and scarcer, and I feared that the Indians would 
     <lb/>
     melt away like snow in spring before the sun. It was my 
     <lb/>
     duty as Governor to think of them, and I wondered if the In<lb break="no"/>dians of the plains and lakes could not do as their brothers 
     <lb/>
     where I came from did. And now, when I think of it, I see a 
     <lb/>
     bright sky before me. I have been nearly four years working 
     <lb/>
     among my Indian brothers, and I am glad indeed to find that 
     <lb/>
     many of them are seeking to have homes of their own, having 
     <lb/>
     gardens and sending their children to school. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " Last spring I went to see some of the Chippewas, this year 
     <lb/>
     I went again and I was glad to see houses built, gardens 
     <lb/>
     planted and wood cut for more houses. Understand me, I do 
     <lb/>
     not want to interfere with your hunting and fishing. I want 
     <lb/>
     you to pursue it through the country, as you have heretofore 
     <lb/>
     done ; but I would like your children to be able to find food 
     <lb/>
     for themselves and their children that come after them. Some<lb break="no"/>times when you go to hunt you can leave your wives and child<lb break="no"/>ren at home to take care of your gardens. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " I am glad to know that some of you have already begun 
     <lb/>
     to build and to plant ; and I would like on behalf of the Queen 
     <lb/>
     to give each band that desires it a home of their own ; I want 
     <lb/>
     to act in this matter while it is time. The country is wide and 
     <lb/>
     you are scattered, other people will come in. Now unless the 
     <lb/>
     places where you would like to live are secured soon there might 
     <lb/>
     be difliculty. The white man might come and settle on the 
     <lb/>
     very place where you would like to be. Now what I and my 
     <lb/>
     brother Commissioners would like to do is this: we wish to 
     

            <pb n="205"

     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties at Forts Carlton and Pitt</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">205</fw>
     

     give each band who will accept of it a place where they may 
     <lb/>
     live ; we wish to give you as much or more land than you need ; 
     <lb/>
     we wish to send a man that surveys the land to mark it off, so 
     <lb/>
     you will know it is your own, and no one will interfere with 
     <lb/>
     you. What I would propose to do is what we have done in 
     <lb/>
     other places. For every family of five a reserve to themselves 
     <lb/>
     of one square mile. Then, as you may not all have made up your 
     <lb/>
     minds where you would like to live, I will tell you how that 
     <lb/>
     will be arranged : we would do as has been done with happiest 
     <lb/>
     results at the North-West Angle. We would send next year a 
     <lb/>
     surveyor to agree with you as to the place you would like. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "There is one thing I would say about the reserves. The 
     <lb/>
     land I name is much more than you will ever be able to farm, 
     <lb/>
     and it may be that you would like to do as your brothers where 
     <lb/>
     I came from did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "They, when they found they had too much land, asked the 
     <lb/>
     Queen to it sell for them ; they kept as much as they could want, 
     <lb/>
     and the price for which the remainder was sold was put away 
     <lb/>
     to increase for them, and many bands now have a yearly income 
     <lb/>
     from the land. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "But understand me, once the reserve is set aside, it could 
     <lb/>
     not be sold unless with the consent of the Queen and the In<lb break="no"/>dians ; as long as the Indians wish, it will stand there for their 
     <lb/>
     good ; no one can take their homes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " Of course, if when a reserve is chosen, a white man had 
     <lb/>
     already settled there, his rights must be respected. The rights 
     <lb/>
     and interests of the whites and half-breeds are as dear to the 
     <lb/>
     Queen as those of the Indians. She deals justly by all, and I 
     <lb/>
     am sure my Indian brothers would like to deal with others as 
     <lb/>
     they would have others to deal with them. I think you can 
     <lb/>
     now understand the question of homes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " When the Indians settle on a reserve and have a sufficient 
     <lb/>
     number of children to be taught, the Queen would maintain a 
     <lb/>
     school. Another thing, that affects you all, some of you have 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     or used in the reserve. Then before I leave the question of 
     <lb/>
     reserves I will tell you how we will help you to make your 
     <lb/>
     homes there. We would give to every family actually cultivat<lb break="no"/>ing the soil the following articles; viz., two hoes, one spade, 
     <lb/>
     one scythe, one axe, and then to help in breaking the land, 
     <lb/>
     one plough and two harrows for every ten families ; and to help 
     <lb/>
     you to put up houses we give to each Chief for his band, one 
     <lb/>
     chest of carpenter's tools, one cross-cut saw, five hand saws, one 
     <lb/>
     pit saw and files, five augers and one grindstone. Then if a 
     <lb/>
     band settles on its reserves the people will require something to 
     <lb/>
     aid them in breaking the soil. They could not draw the ploughs 
     <lb/>
     themselves, therefore we will give to each Chief for the use of 
     <lb/>
     his band one or two yokes of oxen according to the number in 
     <lb/>
     the band. In order to encourage the keeping of cattle we would 
     <lb/>
     give each band a bull and four cows ; having all these things we 
     <lb/>
     would give each band enough potatoes, oats, barley and wheat 
     <lb/>
     for seed to plant the land actually broken. This would be done 
     <lb/>
     once for all to encourage them to grow for themselves.

     laws ; she expects them to live at peace with other Indians 
     <lb/>
     and with the white men ; the Chiefs and Councillors should

     this matter: last year an unforeseen calamity came upon the

     <lb/>
     crops. There is no treaty between the people of Red River

     and the Queen except that they are her subjects. There was 
     <lb/>
     no promise to help them, but I sent down and said that unless 
     <lb/>
     help came some of the people would die from want of food, and 
     <lb/>
     that they had nothing wherewith to plant. The Queen's 
     <lb/>
     Councillors at once gave money to feed the people, and seed 
     <lb/>
     that they might plant the ground; but that was something out 
     <lb/>
     of and beyond every-day life, and therefore I say that some

     great sickness or famine stands as a special case. You may

     for each family. Two axes, two hay forks, two reaping hooks,

     <lb/>
     which were already promised. You are like other Indians I 
     <lb/>
     have met, you can ask very well. You are right in asking, 
     <lb/>
     because you are saying what is in your minds. I have had 
     <lb/>
     taken down a list of what you have asked, and I will now con<lb break="no"/>sult with my brother Commissioners and give you my answer 
     <lb/>
     in a little while."

            </p>

            <p>
     After consultation, the Governor again had the Indians 
     <lb/>
     assembled, and said—" I am ready now to answer you, but 
     <lb/>
     understand well, it is not to be talked backwards and forwards. 
     <lb/>
     I am not going to act like a man bargaining for a horse for 
     <lb/>
     you. I have considered well what you have asked for, and 
     <lb/>
     my answer will be a final one. I cannot grant everything you 
     <lb/>
     ask, but as far as I can go I will, and when done I can only 
     <lb/>
     say you will be acting to your own interests if you take my

     hand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " I will speak of what you asked yesterday and to-day. I 
     <lb/>
     told you yesterday that if any great sickness or general famine 
     <lb/>
     overtook you, that on the Queen being informed of it by her 
     <lb/>
     Indian agent, she in her goodness would give such help as she 
     <lb/>
     thought the Indians needed. You asked for help when you 
     <lb/>
     settled on your reserves during the time you were planting. 
     <lb/>
     You asked very broadly at first. I think the request you make 
     <lb/>
     now is reasonable to a certain extent ; but help should be given 
     <lb/>
     after you settle on the reserve for three years only, for after 
     <lb/>
     that time you should have food of your own raising, besides

     all the things that are given to you; this assistance would only 
     <lb/>
     be given to those actually cultivating the soil. Therefore, I 
     <lb/>
     would agree to give every spring, for three years, the sum of 
     <lb/>
     one thousand dollars to assist you in buying provisions while 
     <lb/>
     planting the ground. I do this because you seem anxious to 
     <lb/>
     make a living for yourselves, it is more than has been done 
     <lb/>
     anywhere else; I must do it on my own responsibility, and 
     <lb/>
     trust to the other Queen's councillors to ratify it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " I will now answer what you had written down and asked 
     <lb/>
     to-day. I expect you to be reasonable, none of us get all our 
     <lb/>
     own way. You asked first for four hoes, two spades, two 
     <lb/>
     scythes and Whetstone, two axes, two hay forks and two reap<lb break="no"/>ing hooks for every family. I am willing to give them to 
     <lb/>
     every family actually cultivating the soil, for if given to all it 
     <lb/>
     would only encourage idleness. You ask a plough and harrow 
     <lb/>
     for every three families; I am willing to give them on the 
     <lb/>
     same conditions. The carpenters' tools, as well as the seed 
     <lb/>
     grain, were already promised. I cannot undertake the respon<lb break="no"/>sibility of promising provision for the poor, blind and lame. In 
     <lb/>
     all parts of the Queen's dominions we have them; the poor 
     <lb/>
     whites have as much reason to be helped as the poor Indian; 
     <lb/>
     they must be left to the charity and kind hearts of the people. 
     <lb/>
     If you are prosperous yourselves you can help your unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     brothers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "You ask for school teachers and ministers. With regard 
     <lb/>
     to ministers I cannot interfere. There are large societies 
     <lb/>
     formed for the purpose of sending the gospel to the Indians. 
     <lb/>
     The Government does not provide ministers anywhere in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I had already promised you that when you settled 
     <lb/>
     down, and there were enough children, schools would be main<lb break="no"/>tained You see missionaries here on the ground, both Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic and Protestant; they have been in the country for

     it with your hunt. In regard to bridges and scows on which

     <lb/>
     in it; it is true that what has been done this morning is good.

     What has been overlooked I will speak about. The one that 
     <lb/>
     is next to the Chief (first head man) should have had a horse

     as well. I want the Governor to give us somebody to build

     our houses, we cannot manage it ourselves, for my own part

     you see my crippled hand. It is true the Governor says he

     takes the responsibility on himself in granting the extra 
     <lb/>
     requests of the Indians, but let him consider on the quality of 
     <lb/>
     the land he has already treated for. There is no farming land 
     <lb/>
     whatever at the north-west angle, and he goes by what he has 
     <lb/>
     down there. What I want, as he has said, is twenty-five dollars 
     <lb/>
     to each Chief and to his head men twenty dollars. I do not 
     <lb/>
     want to keep the lands nor do I give away, but I have set the 
     <lb/>
     value. I want to ask as much as will cover the skin of the 
     <lb/>
     people, no more nor less. I think what he has offered is too 
     <lb/>
     little. When you spoke you mentioned ammunition, I did 
     <lb/>
     not hear mention of a gun; we will not be able to kill anything 
     <lb/>
     simply by setting fire to powder. I want a gun for each Chief 
     <lb/>
     and head man, and I want ten miles around the reserve where

     place where they belonged, that they could not be paid at Fort

     your letter last night and was glad to learn that you wanted to 
     <lb/>
     accept the terms I had offered, and which had been accepted by 
     <lb/>

     sent you one asking you to meet me here where we are now,

     coat, but it is only worn by those who stand as the Queen's

     Councillors; her soldiers and her officers wear red, and all the

     other Chiefs of the Queen wear the coats we have brought, and 
     <lb/>
     the good of this is that when the Chief is seen with his uniform

     September) at an early hour. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There were already assembled near the fort and on the banks

     of the Saskatchewan over one hundred lodges, and as more 
     <lb/>
     were immediately expected they requested postponement of ne<lb break="no"/>gotiations until the 7th September.

     and most respected of the Cree Chiefs, with about thirty of his 
     <lb/>
     chief men, who had left their hunt and come in to Fort Pitt 
     <lb/>
     purposefully  to attend the treaty negotiations, called on the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor to express their satisfaction at his coming and their plea<lb break="no"/>sure in seeing him; the greeting which was certainly affectionate, 
     <lb/>
     consisted in the embrace of both arms about the neck and a 
     <lb/>
     fraternal kiss on either cheek ; after a short conversation the 
     <lb/>
     Governor told them he expected them to be ready to meet him 
     <lb/>
     at his tent in the morning, time was rapidly passing and he 
     <lb/>
     had a long journey yet before him ; he trusted their Councils 
     <lb/>
     would be wise and the results would be beneficial to them.

     The Hon. Jas. McKay arrived from Battle River in the 
     <lb/>
     evening, and reported that he had met there a number of 
     <lb/>
     Indians, principally Saulteaux, who had been in camp at that 
     <lb/>
     place for <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>. They said there had been about seventy 
     <lb/>
     lodges altogether but as the buffalo were coming near, the 
     <lb/>
     poorer ones had started out to hunt, leaving only about ten 
     <lb/>
     lodges there. The remaining ones expressed good feeling and 
     <lb/>
     said they would like to have waited until the time appointed 
     <lb/>
     (September 15th) to meet the Governor and take the treaty, 
     <lb/>
     yet as the buffalo hunt was of so much importance to them they 
     <lb/>
     could not afford to lose the time, knowing that the Governor 
     <lb/>
     had to go Fort Pitt and return before they could see him, 
     <lb/>
     consequently the whole band went out to the plains. This 
     <lb/>
     band was composed, it was afterwards ascertained, of the 
     <lb/>
     Saulteaux of Jack Fish Lake and of some Crees under the Yel<lb break="no"/>low Sky Chief, and were favorably disposed though unable to 
     <lb/>
     remain. They numbered in all sixty-seven tents.

     At ten in the morning the Governor and Commissioners, 
     <lb/>
     escorted by the Mounted Police, proceeded to the treaty tent 
     <lb/>
     a short distance from the fort. About eleven o'clock the 
     <lb/>
     Indians commenced to gather, as at Carlton, in a large semi<lb break="no"/>circle. In front were the young men, galloping about on their 
     <lb/>
     horses, then the Chiefs and head men, followed by the main 
     <lb/>
     body of the band to the number of two or three hundred. As 
     <lb/>
     they approached the manoeuvres of the horsemen became more 
     <lb/>
     and more excited and daring, racing <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> about so rapidly as 
     <lb/>
     to be barely distinguishable; unfortunately, from some mis<lb break="no"/>chance, two horses and their riders came into collision with such 
     <lb/>
     tremendous force as to throw both horses and men violently to 
     <lb/>
     the ground; both horses were severely injured and one of the 
     <lb/>
     Indians had his hip put out of joint; fortunately, Dr. Kittson 
     <lb/>
     of the police, was near by and speedily gave relief to the poor 
     <lb/>
     sufferer. The ceremonies, however, still went on; four pipe- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     stems were carried about and presented to be stroked in token 
     <lb/>
     of good feeling and amity (during this performance the band 
     <lb/>
     of the Mounted Policd played "God save the Queen), bles<lb break="no"/>sings invoked on the whole gathering, the dances performed by 
     <lb/>
     the various bands and finally the pipes of peace smoked by 
     <lb/>
     the Governor and Commissioners in turn. The stems, which 
     <lb/>
     were finely decorated, were placed with great solemnity on the 
     <lb/>
     table in front of the Governor, to be covered for the bearers 
     <lb/>
     with blue cloth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Chiefs and head men now seated themselves in front of 
     <lb/>
     the tent, when the Governor addressed them :

     and her Councillors have the good of the Indian at heart, be<lb break="no"/>cause you are the Queen's children and we must think of you 
     <lb/>for to-day and to-morrow; the condition of the Indians and 
     <lb/>their future has given the Queen's Councillors much anxiety. 
     <lb/>In the old provinces of Canada from which I came we have 
     <lb/>many Indians, they are growing in numbers and are as a rule 
     <lb/>happy and prosperous; for a hundred years red and white 
     <lb/>hands have been clasped together in peace. The instructions 
     <lb/>of the Queen are to treat the Indians as brothers, and so we 
     <lb/>ought to be. The Great Spirit made this earth we are on. He 
     <lb/>planted the trees and made the rivers flow for the good of all 
     <lb/>his people, white and red; the country is very wide and there 
     <lb/>is room for all. It is six years since the Queen took back into 
     <lb/>her own hands the government of her subjects, red and white, 
     <lb/>in this country; it was thought her Indian children would be 
     <lb/>better cared for in her own hand. This is the seventh time 
     <lb/>in the last five years that her Indian children have been 
     <lb/>called together for this purpose; this is the fourth time that 
     <lb/>I have met my Indian brothers, and standing here on this 
     <lb/>bright day with the sun above us, I cast my eyes to the East 
     <lb/>down to the great lakes and I see a broad road leading from 
     <lb/>there to the Red River, I see it stretching on to Ellice, I 
     <lb/>see it branching there, the one to Qu'Appelle and Cypress Hills, 
     <lb/>the other by Pelly to Carlton; it is a wide and plain trail. 
     <lb/>Anyone can see it, and on that road, taking for the Queen, the 
     <lb/>hand of the Governor and Commissioners I see all the Indians. 
     <lb/>I see the Queen's Councillors taking the Indian by the hand 
     <lb/>saying we are brothers, we will lift you up, we will teach you, 
     <lb/>if you will learn, the cunning of the white man. All along 
     <lb/>that road I see Indians gathering. I see gardens growing and 
     <lb/>houses building; I see them receiving money from the Queen's 
     <lb/>Commissioners to purchase clothing for their children; at the 
     <lb/>same time I see them enjoying their hunting and fishing as 
     <lb/>before, I see them retaining their old mode of living with the 
     <lb/>Queen's gift in addition.

     "I met the Crees at Carlton, they heard my words there, 
     <lb/>
     they read my face, and through that my heart, and said my 
     <lb/>
     words were true, and they took my hand on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     Queen. What they did I wish you to do; I wish you to travel 
     <lb/>
     on the road I have spoken of, a road I see stretching out broad 
     <lb/>
     and plain to the Rocky Mountains. I know you have been 
     <lb/>
     told many stories, some of them not true; do not listen to the 
     <lb/>
     bad voices of men who have their own ends to serve, listen 
     <lb/>
     rather to those who have only your good at heart. I have 
     <lb/>
     come a long way to meet you; last year I sent you a message 
     <lb/>
     that you would be met this year, and I do not forget my 
     <lb/>
     promises. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "I went to Ottawa, where the Queen's Councillors have their 
     <lb/>
     council chamber, to talk, amongst other things, about you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "I have come seven hundred miles to see you. Why should 
     <lb/>
     I take all this trouble? For two reasons, first, the duty was 
     <lb/>
     put upon me as one of the Queen's Councillors, to see you with 
     <lb/>
     my brother Commissioners, Hon. W. J. Christie and Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Jas. McKay. The other reason is a personal one, because 
     <lb/>
     since I was a young man my heart was warm to the Indians, 
     <lb/>
     and I have taken a great interest in them 5 for more than 
     <lb/>
     twenty-five years I have studied their condition in the present 
     <lb/>
     and in the future. I have been many years in public life, but 
     <lb/>
     the first words I spoke in public were for the Indians, and in 
     <lb/>
     that vision of the day I saw the Queen's white men under<lb break="no"/>standing their duty; I saw them understanding that they had 
     <lb/>
     no right to wrap themselves up in a cold mantle of selfishness, 
     <lb/>
     that they had no right to turn away and say, 'Am I my 
     <lb/>
     brother's keeper ?' On the contrary, I saw them saying, the 
     <lb/>
     Indians are our brothers, we must try to help them to make a 
     <lb/>
     living for themselves and their children. I tell you, you must 
     <lb/>
     think of those who will come after you. As I came here I saw 
     <lb/>
     tracks leading to the lakes and water-courses, once well beaten, 
     <lb/>
     now grown over with grass; I saw bones bleaching by the 
     <lb/>
     wayside; I saw the places where the buffalo had been, and I 
  

            <pb n="233"

     thought what will become of the Indian. I said to myself, we 
     <lb/>
     must teach the children to prepare for the future; if we do 
     <lb/>
     not, but a few suns will pass and they will melt away like 
     <lb/>
     snow before the sun in spring-time. You know my words are 
     <lb/>
     true; you see for yourselves and know that your numbers are 
     <lb/>
     lessening every year. Now the whole burden of my message 
     <lb/>
     from the Queen is that we wish to help you in the days that 
     <lb/>
     are to come, we do not want to take away the means of living 
     <lb/>
     that you have now, we do not want to tie you down; we want 
     <lb/>
     you to have homes of your own where your children can be 
     <lb/>
     taught to raise for themselves food from the mother earth. 
     <lb/>
     You may not all be ready for that, but some, I have no doubt, 
     <lb/>
     are, and in a short time others will follow. I am here to talk 
     <lb/>
     plainly, I have nothing to hide; I am here to tell you what we 
     <lb/>
     are ready to do. Your tribe is not all here at the present time, 
     <lb/>
     some of the principal Chiefs are absent, this cannot be avoided, 
     <lb/>
     the country is wide and when the buffalo come near you must 
     <lb/>
     follow them; this does not matter, for what I have to give is 
     <lb/>
     for the absent as well as for the present. Next year if the 
     <lb/>
     treaty is made, a Commissioner will be sent to you, and you will 
     <lb/>
     be notified of the times and places of meeting, so that you will 
     <lb/>
     not have long journeys; after that, two or three servants of the 
     <lb/>
     Queen will be appointed to live in the country to look after 
     <lb/>
     the Indians, and see that the terms of the treaty are carried 
     <lb/>
     out.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "I have not yet given you my message. I know you have 
     <lb/>
     heard what your brothers did at Carlton, and I expect you to 
     <lb/>
     do the same here, for if you do not you will be the first Indians 
     <lb/>
     who refused to take my hand. At Carlton I had a slight diffi<lb break="no"/>culty; one of the Chiefs dreamt that instead of making the 
     <lb/>
     treaty at the camp of the great body of the Indians, I made it 
     <lb/>
     at his, and so his people stood aside. I was sorry for him and 
     <lb/>
     his people. I did not wish to go and leave them out. I sent 
     <lb/>
     him word after I had made the treaty, and brought him in 
     <lb/>
     with the others. When I went to North-VVest Angle I met

     the Chippewa nation; they were not all present, but the absent 
     <lb/>
     ones were seen the next year. I told them the message from 
     <lb/>
     the Queen, and what she wished to do for them; in all four 
     <lb/>
     thousand Indians accepted the Treaty, and now, I am glad to say, 
     <lb/>
     many of them have homes and gardens of their own. The next 
     <lb/>
     year I went to Qu'Appelle and saw the Crees and Chippewas, 
     <lb/>
     and there five thousand understood us and took our hands. 
     <lb/>
     Last summer I went with Mr. McKay to Lake Winnipeg, and 
     <lb/>
     there all the Swampy Crees accepted the Queen's terms. Now 
     <lb/>
     I have stroked the pipe with your brothers at Carlton as with 
     <lb/>
     you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "Three years ago a party of Assiniboines were shot by 
     <lb/>
     American traders; men, women and children were killed; we 
     <lb/>
     reported the affair to Ottawa; we said the time has come when 
     <lb/>
     you must send the red-coated servantsof the Queen to the 
     <lb/>
     North-West to protect the Indian from fire-water, from being 
     <lb/>
     shot down by men who know no law, to preserve peace between 
     <lb/>
     the Indians, to punish all who break the law, to prevent whites 
     <lb/>
     from doing wrong to Indians, and they are here today to do 
     <lb/>
     honor to the office which I hold. Our Indian Chiefs wear 
     <lb/>
     red coats, and wherever they meet the police they will know 
     <lb/>
     they meet friends. I know that you have been told that if 
     <lb/>
     war came you would be put in the front, this is not so. Your 
     <lb/>
     brothers at Carlton asked me that they might not be forced to 
     <lb/>
     fight, and .I. tell you, as I assured them, you will never be asked 
     <lb/>
     to fight against your will; and I trust the time will never 
     <lb/>
     come of war between the Queen and the great country near us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "Again, I say, all we seek is your good; I speak openly, as 
     <lb/>
     brother to brother, as a father to his children, and I would 
     <lb/>
     give you a last advice, hear my words, come and join the 
     <lb/>
     great band of Indians who are walking hand-in-hand with us 
     <lb/>
     on the road I spoke of when I began—a road, I believe in my 
     <lb/>
     heart, will lead the Indian on to a much more comfortable 
     <lb/>
     state than he is in now. My words, when they are accepted, 
     <lb/>
     are written down, and they last, as I have said to the others, as

     long as the sun shines and the river runs. I expect you are 
     <lb/>
     prepared for the message I have to deliver, and I will wait to 
     <lb/>
     see if any of the Chiefs wish to speak before I go further." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WEEK1">Sweet Grass</persName>, the principal Cree Chief, rose, and taking the 
     <lb/>
     Governor by the hand, said, "We have heard what the 
     <lb/>
     Governor has said, and now the Indians want to hear the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the treaty, after which they will all shake hands with the 
     <lb/>
     Governor and Commissioners, we then want to go to our camp 
     <lb/>
     to meet in council." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Governor then very carefully and distinctly explained 
     <lb/>
     the terms and promises of the treaty as made at Carlton; this 
     <lb/>
     was received by the Indians with loud assenting exclamations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 8th the Indians sent a message that they required 
     <lb/>
     further time for deliberation, and the meeting was put off until 
     <lb/>
     the 9th. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the morning of the 9th the Indians were slow in gather<lb break="no"/>ing, as they wished to settle all difliculties and misunderstand<lb break="no"/>ings amongst themselves before coming to the treaty tent, this 
     <lb/>
     was apparently accomplished about eleven a.m., when the whole 
     <lb/>
     body approached and seated themselves in good order, when 
     <lb/>
     the <persName ref="pers:MORR1">Governor</persName> said :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " Indian children of the Great Queen, we meet again on a 
     <lb/>
     bright day; you heard many words from me the other day; I 
     <lb/>
     delivered you my message from the Queen; I held out my hand in 
     <lb/>
     the Queen's name, full of her bounty. You asked time to consult 
     <lb/>
     together; I gave it to you very gladly, because I did not come 
     <lb/>
     here to surprise you. I trust the Great Spirit has put good 
     <lb/>
     thoughts into your hearts, and your wise men have found my 
     <lb/>
     words good. I am now ready to hear whether you are pre<lb break="no"/>pared to do as the great body of the Indian people have 
     <lb/>
     done; it is now for the Indians to speak through those whom 
     <lb/>
     they may choose; my heart is warm to you, and my ears are 
     <lb/>
     open." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KIHE1">Ku-ye-win</persName> (The Eagle) addressed the Indians, telling them 
     <lb/>
     not to be afraid, that the Governor was to them as a brother; 
     

            <pb n="236"

     that what the Queen wished to establish through him was for 
     <lb/>
     their good, and if any of them wished to speak to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After waiting some time the Governor said, "I had hoped 
     <lb/>
     the Indians would have taken me at my word, and taken me 
     <lb/>
     as a brother and a friend. True, I am the Queen's Governor; 
     <lb/>
     that I am here to-day shows me to be your friend. Why can 
     <lb/>
     you not open your hearts to me? I have met many Indians 
     <lb/>
     before, but this is the first time I have had all the talking to 
     <lb/>
     do myself. Now, cast everything behind your backs, and 
     <lb/>
     speak to me face to face. I have offered as we have done to 
     <lb/>
     the other Indians. Tell me now whether you will take my 
     <lb/>
     hand and accept it; there is nothing to be ashamed of, nothing 
     <lb/>
     to be afraid of; think of the good of your children and your 
     <lb/>
     children's children. Stand up now like wise men and tell me 
     <lb/>
     if you will take what I offered. I cannot believe it to be 
     <lb/>
     possible that you would throw my hand back. Speak and do 
     <lb/>
     not be afraid or ashamed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WEEK1">WEE-KAS-KOO-KEE-SAY-YIN</persName> (Sweet Grass)—" I thank you for 
     <lb/>
     this day, and also I thank you for what I have seen and 
     <lb/>
     heard, I also thank the Queen for sending you to act for our 
     <lb/>
     good. I am glad to have a brother and friend in you, which 
     <lb/>
     undoubtedly will raise us above our present condition. I am 
     <lb/>
     glad for your offers, and thank you from my heart. I speak 
     <lb/>
     this in the presence of the Divine Being. It is all for our

     good, I see nothing to be afraid of, I therefore accept of it 
     <lb/>
     gladly and take your hand to my heart, may this continue as 
     <lb/>
     long as this earth stands and the river flows. The Great King, 
     <lb/>
     our Father, is now looking upon us this day, He regards all 
     <lb/>
     the people equal with one another; He has mercy on the whole 
     <lb/>
     earth; He has opened a new world to us. I have pity on all 
     <lb/>
     those who have to live by the buffalo. If I am spared until 
     <lb/>
     this time next year I want this my brother to commence to act 
     <lb/>
     for me, thinking thereby that the buffalo may be protected. 
     <lb/>
     It is for that reason I give you my hand. If spared, I shall 
     <lb/>
     commence at once to clear a small piece of land for myself,

     and others of my kinsmen will do the same. We will com<lb break="no"/>mence hand in hand to protect the buffalo. When I hold 
     <lb/>
     your hand I feel as if the Great Father were looking on us 
     <lb/>
     both as brothers. I am thankful. May this earth here never 
     <lb/>
     see the white man's blood spilt on it. I thank God that we 
     <lb/>
     stand together, that you all see us; I am thankful that I can 
     <lb/>
     raise up my head, and the white man and red man can stand 
     <lb/>
     together as long as the sun shines. When I hold your hands 
     <lb/>
     and touch your heart, as I do now (suiting his action to the 
     <lb/>
     words), let us be as one. Use your utmost to help me and 
     <lb/>
     help my children, so that they may prosper."

            <p>
     The Chief's remarks were assented to by the Indians by 
     <lb/>
     loud ejaculations.

     <persName ref="pers:MORR1">GOVERNOR</persName>—"I rise with a glad heart; we have come

     together and understood each other. I am glad that you have

     to-day will stand as the hills. What we have said and done

     he commenced he and his brothers drew the plough themselves,

     and they pulled up roots and used them for hoes. Mr.
