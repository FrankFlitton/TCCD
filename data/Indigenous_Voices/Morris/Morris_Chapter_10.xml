     TREATY NUMBER SEVEN; OR THE BLACKFEET TREATY. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     THE making of this treaty, which completed the series of 
     <lb/>
     treaties, extending from Lake Superior to the slopes of 
     <lb/>
     the Rocky Mountains, was entrusted, by the Privy Council, to 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. David Laird (who, after the effecting of the Carlton 
     <lb/>
     and Fort Pitt Treaties, had, in 1876, been appointed Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Governor of the North-West Territories, subsequently to the 
     <lb/>
     erection of these territories into a distinct Government) and 
     <lb/>
     Lieut.-Col. McLeod, of the Mounted Police Force. The neces<lb break="no"/>sity which had arisen for making the treaty is thus stated by 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. the Minister of the Interior, the <persName ref="pers:MILL4">Hon. David Mills</persName>, 
     <lb/>
     in his Annual Report for 1877 : 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>" The conclusion, in 1876, of the treaty with the Crees, Assini. 
     <lb/>boine and Saulteaux Indians (being the sixth of the series of 
     <lb/>treaties up to that time negotiated with the Indians of the 
     <lb/>North-West) left but a small portion of the territory lying 
     <lb/>between the boundary line and the 54th parallel of latitude 
     <lb/>unsurrendered. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     " The unsurrendered portion of the territory, including about 
     <lb/>
     fifty thousand square miles, lies at the south-west angle of the 
     <lb/>
     territories, north of the boundary line, east of the Rocky Moun<lb break="no"/>tains, south of Red River (Treaty Number Six) and west of the 
     <lb/>
     Cypress Hills, or Treaty Number Four. This portion of the 
     <lb/>
     North-West is occupied by the Blackfeet, Blood, and Sarcees 
     <lb/>
     or Piegan Indians, some of the most warlike and intelligent 
     <lb/>
     but intractable bands of the North-West. These bands have 
     <lb/>
     for years past been anxiously expecting to be treated with, and 
     <lb/>
     have been much disappointed at the delay of negotiations. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     " In last year's report, I stated that His Honor Lieut.-Gov. 
     <lb/>
     Morris, very strongly recommended that no further delay should 
     <lb/>
     take place in entering into negotiations with these Indians. 
     <lb/>
     His Honor reported, in effect, "that there was a general con<lb break="no"/>sent of opinion amongst the missionaries settled in that terri<lb break="no"/>tory, and others who are acquainted with these Indians, as to 
     <lb/>
     the desirableness of having such a treaty made at the earliest 
     <lb/>
     possible date, with a view to preserving the present friendly 
     <lb/>
     disposition of these tribes, which might easily give place to 
     <lb/>
     feelings of an unfriendly or hostile nature, should the treaty 
     <lb/>
     negotiations be much longer delayed." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     "In view of these facts, and in order to satisfy these import<lb break="no"/>ant tribes, and to prevent the difficulties which might hereafter 
     <lb/>
     arise through the settlement of whites, who are already flocking 
     <lb/>
     into Fort McLeod and other portions of this territory, Your 
     <lb/>
     Excellency decided that these Indians should be treated with 
     <lb/>
     this year, and the Indians were notified accordingly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "His Honor Mr. Laird, the Lieutenant-Governor of the 
     <lb/>
     North-West Territories and Lieut.-Col. James F. McLeod, 
     <lb/>
     C.M.G., were selected by Your Excellency to negotiate the 
     <lb/>
     treaty. The former of these gentlemen, had assisted in 1874 
     <lb/>
     in negotiating Treaty Number Four, with the Cree and Saul<lb break="no"/>teaux Indians, and the latter, during his residence for some 
     <lb/>
     years past at Fort McLeod, as Commandant of the Mounted 
     <lb/>
     Police Force, had acquired the entire confidence and good will 
     <lb/>
     of the Indian tribes proposed to be dealt with." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Besides all this, the Chiefs of the Blackfeet, in 1876, sent to 
     <lb/>
     the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, a letter, 
     <lb/>
     with regard to a treaty, and also by a messenger, in whom 
     <lb/>
     they had confidence, a message, to a similar effect. The Black<lb break="no"/>feet Indians are a bold and warlike race. When the Sioux 
     <lb/>
     war with the United States was about being initiated, the 
     <lb/>
     Sioux invited them to join in the war, but they promptly 
     <lb/>
     refused. They are unlikely to become farmers, but as the coun<lb break="no"/>try they inhabit presents unusual facilities for that industry,

     they may be induced to adopt a pastoral life. They already pos<lb break="no"/>sess large herds of horses, and may be taught to raise cattle also. 
      </p>

            <p>I requested the Rev. C. Scollen, who had for many years 
     <lb/>been a missionary among the Plain Crees, and latterly, for sev<lb break="no"/>eral years, among the Blackfeet, to make a report to me of the 
     <lb/>character, habits and condition of this nation, with which re<lb break="no"/>quest he willingly complied. I now give place to this report, 
     <lb/>which gives a vivid view of the character of this bold and war<lb break="no"/>like race, and shews the benefits they had, so far back as 1876, 
     <lb/>derived from the presence of the Mounted Police, the prohibi<lb break="no"/>tion of liquor, and the establishment of law and order in the 
     <lb/>North-West Territories, under Canadian rule. I may here 
     <lb/>remark, that another great benefit has resulted from the judi<lb break="no"/>cious steps taken by the Canadian Government, and that is the 
     <lb/>cessation of warfare between the various tribes, which was 
     <lb/>before of constant occurrence. An intelligent Ojibbeway Indian 
     <lb/>trader told me, that the change was wonderful. "Before," he 
     <lb/>said, "the Queen's Government came, we were never safe, and 
     <lb/>now," he said, "I can sleep in my tent anywhere, and have no 
     <lb/>fear. I can go to the Blackfeet, and Cree camps, and they 
     <lb/>treat me as a friend." The report of Mr. Scollen is as follows:

     TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR OF MANITOBA. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     EXCELLENT GOVERNOR,—Having had some years of experience as a mis<lb break="no"/>sionary amongst the Cree and Blackfeet Indians of the North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tory, I humbly undertake to submit to your consideration a few details regard<lb break="no"/>ing the latter tribe of Her Majesty's Indian subjects. I do this with all the 
     <lb/>
     more confidence as the successful way in which you conducted the treaty 
     <lb/>
     with the Carlton Indians (a treaty including no small difficulties), has con<lb break="no"/>vinced me of your thorough knowledge of the character of this people. 
     <lb/>
     But, although the general character of all the tribes may be nearly the same, 
     <lb/>
     yet in their social dispositions they sometimes materially differ, and this, I 
     <lb/>
     think, will be found to be the case with the Crees and Blackfeet when com<lb break="no"/>pared on that point. The Crees have always looked upon the white man as a 
     <lb/>
     friend, or, to use their own language, as a brother. They have never been 
     <lb/>
     afraid of him. nor have they given him any cause to be afraid of them. The 
     <lb/>
     Blackfeet have acted somewhat differently; they have regarded the white man 
     <lb/>
     as a demi-god, far superior to themselves in intelligence, capable of doing them

     good or evil, according as he might be well or ill-disposed towards them, unscru<lb break="no"/>pulous in his dealings with others, and consequently a person to be flattered, 
     <lb/>
     feared and shunned, and even injured, whenever this could be done with 
     <lb/>
     impunity. I am not now describing the Blackfeet of the present day, but 
     <lb/>
     those of fifteen years ago, when I first saw them. They were then a proud, 
     <lb/>
     haughty, numerous people (perhaps ten thousand on the British side of the 
     <lb/>
     line), having a regular politico-religious organization by which their thirst 
     <lb/>
     for blood and their other barbarous passions were constantly fired to the high<lb break="no"/>est pitch of frenzy. Since that time their number has decreased to less than 
     <lb/>
     one half, and their systematic organizations have fallen into decay ; in fact 
     <lb/>
     they have been utterly demoralized as a people. This sudden decadence 
     <lb/>
     was brought on by two causes : 1. About ten years ago the Americans 
     <lb/>
     crossed the line and established themselves on Pelly River, where they 
     <lb/>
     carried on to an extraordinary extent the illicit traffic in intoxicating 
     <lb/>
     liquor to the Blackfeet. The fiery water flowed as freely, if I may use the 
     <lb/>
     metaphor, as the streams running from the Rocky Mountains, and hundreds 
     <lb/>
     of the poor Indians fell victims to the white man's craving for money, some 
     <lb/>
     poisoned, some frozen to death whilst in a state of intoxication, and many 
     <lb/>
     shot down by American bullets. 2. Then in 1870 came that disease so 
     <lb/>
     fatal to Indians, the small-pox, which told upon the Blackfeet with terrible 
     <lb/>
     effect, destroying between six hundred and eight hundred of them. Sur<lb break="no"/>viving relatives went more and more for the use of alcohol; they endea<lb break="no"/>voured to drown their grief in the poisonous beverage. They sold their 
     <lb/>
     robes and their horses by the hundred for it, and now they began killing one 
     <lb/>
     another, so that in a short time they were divided into several small parties, 
     <lb/>
     afraid to meet. Fortunately for them the Government were aware of the 
     <lb/>
     state of affairs in the country and did not remain indifferent to it ; and, as I 
     <lb/>
     have heard yourself explain to the Indians, Her Gracious Majesty has at 
     <lb/>
     heart the welfare of even the most obscure of her subjects. In the sum<lb break="no"/>mer of 1874, I was travelling amongst the Blackfeet. It was painful to me 
     <lb/>
     to see the state of poverty to which they had been reduced. Formerly they 
     <lb/>
     had been the most opulent Indians in the country, and now they were 
     <lb/>
     clothed in rags, without horses and without guns. But this was the year of 
     <lb/>
     their salvation ; that very summer the Mounted Police were struggling 
     <lb/>
     against the difficulties of a long journey across the barren plains in order to 
     <lb/>
     bring them help. This noble corps reached their destination that same fall, 
     <lb/>
     and with magic effect put an entire stop to the abominable traffic of whiskey 
     <lb/>
     with the Indians. Since that time the Blackfeet Indians are becoming 
     <lb/>
     more and more prosperous. They are now well clothed and well furnished 
     <lb/>
     with horses and guns. During the last two years I have calculated that they 
     <lb/>
     have bought two thousand horses to replace those they had given for whiskey. 
     <lb/>
     They are forced to acknowledge that the arrival of the Red Coats has been 
     <lb/>
     to them the greatest boon. But, although they are externally so friendly to 
     <lb/>
     the Police and other strangers who now inhabit their country, yet under<lb break="no"/>neath this friendship remains hidden some of that dread which they have 
    

            <pb n="249"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_10_Page_249.jpg"/>
          
     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Blackfeet Treaty</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">249</fw> 
     

     always had of the white man's intention to cheat them; and here, excellent 
     <lb/>
     Governor, I will state my reasons for believing that a treaty should be con<lb break="no"/>cluded with them also at the earliest possible date. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1st. The Blackfeet are extremely jealous of what they consider their coun<lb break="no"/>try, aud never allowed any white men, Half- breeds, or Crees to remain in 
     <lb/>
     it for any length of time ; the only reason that they never drove the Amer<lb break="no"/>icans off, apart from their love for whiskey, was their dread of the Henri 
     <lb/>
     rifle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2nd. They have an awful dread of the future. They think that the 
     <lb/>
     Police are in the country not only to keep out whiskey traders, but also to 
     <lb/>
     protect white people against them, and that this country will be gradually 
     <lb/>
     taken from them without any ceremony. This I can certify, for although 
     <lb/>
     they may not say so to others yet they do not hide it from me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3rd. Numbers of people are settling around Fort McLeod and Fort Cal<lb break="no"/>gary in order to farm, raise stock, etc. This will probably drive the buffalo 
     <lb/>
     away through time from the ordinary hunting grounds, and if so, the Black<lb break="no"/>feet, being the most helpless Indians in the country, and unaccustomed to 
     <lb/>
     anything else but hunting buffalo, would suffer extremely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4th. The settlers also are anxious that a treaty he made as soon as pos<lb break="no"/>sible, so that they may know what portions of land they can hold without 
     <lb/>
     fear of being molested. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     5th. The Blackfeet themselves are expecting to have a mutual understand<lb break="no"/>ing with the Government, because they have been told of it by several per<lb break="no"/>sons, and namely by Gen. Smythe last year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Such are the principal reasons which occur to my mind for making a 
     <lb/>
     treaty with the Blackfeet. It remains for you, excellent Governor, to weigh 
     <lb/>
     their value. Of course you would find the same prejudices amongst the 
     <lb/>
     Blackfeet that you have found amongst the Crees, but you would have 
     <lb/>
     no greater difficulty in dispelling them. You would have four clans 
     <lb/>
     to treat with, viz. : the Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans, all of the same 
     <lb/>
     tribe, and the Sarcees, a branch of the Peace River Indians called Beavers. 
     <lb/>
     As to the place of rendezvous there would be no difficulty whatever, the 
     <lb/>
     Blackfeet live in large camps under their respective Chiefs, and could go 
     <lb/>
     to any point after due notice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It remains for me now, excellent Governor, to beg you to excuse the many 
     <lb/>
     defects of this communication, and to accept the assurance of sincere esteem 
     <lb/>
     and profound respect of 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     In order to effect a treaty, Lieut.-Gov. Laird, and Lieut-Col. 
     <lb/>
     James F. McLeod, met the Blackfeet, at the Blackfoot crossing, 
     <lb/>
     on the Bow River, on the 17th day of September, 1877, which 
     <lb/>
     day had been selected for the time of meeting. Gov. Laird 
     <lb/>
     proceeded from the temporary seat of the Government of the 
     <lb/>
     North-West Territories at Swan River, and Col. McLeod from 
     <lb/>
     Fort McLeod, the head-quarters of the Mounted Police, to the 
     <lb/>
     appointed rendezvous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners met the Indians on that day, and after 
     <lb/>
     five days of tedious negotiations, the treaty was satisfactorily 
     <lb/>
     concluded, and signed by the Chiefs and head men present. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The total number of the Indians, represented at the making 
     <lb/>
     of the treaty, and who were paid the gratuity under it, was 
     <lb/>
     four thousand three hundred and ninety-two. The terms of the 
     <lb/>
     treaty, were substantially the same as those contained in 
     <lb/>
     the North-West Angle and Qu'Appelle treaties, except that 
     <lb/>
     as some of the bands were disposed to engage in pastoral pur<lb break="no"/>suits, it was arranged to give them cattle instead of agricultural 
     <lb/>
     implements. The Minister of the Interior well observes in his 
     <lb/>
     report "that the conclusion of this treaty with these warlike 
     <lb/>
     and intractable tribes, at a time when the Indian tribes, imme<lb break="no"/>diately across the border, were engaged in open hostilities with 
     <lb/>
     the United States troops, is certainly a conclusive proof of the 
     <lb/>
     just policy of the Government of Canada toward the aboriginal 
     <lb/>
     population," and, I add, of the confidence of the Indians in the 
     <lb/>
     promises and just dealing of the servants of the British Crown, 
     <lb/>
     in Canada ; a confidence that can only be kept up by the strict<lb break="no"/>est observance of the stipulations of the treaties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I now append the interesting despatch of Lieut.-Gov. Laird, 
     <lb/>
     giving a detailed account of the negotiation of the treaty, and 
     <lb/>
     a report of the speeches of the Commissioners and Indians, 
     <lb/>
     extracted from a report in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> newspaper, dated October 
     <lb/>
     4th, 1877, which, though not authentic, I believe, gives a 
     <lb/>
     general view of what passed during the negotiations.

     BATTLEFORD, NORTH-WEST TERRIRTORY. 
                </p>
   
            <p>
     SIR,—I have the honor to inform you that on the 4th August I received 
     <lb/>
     at Swan River your telegram dated on the first of that month. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It notified me that a Commission appointing Lieut.-Col. James F. 
     <lb/>
     McLeod, C.M.G., and myself, Commissioners to negotiate a treaty with the 
     <lb/>
     Blackfeet and other Indians of the unsurrendered parts of the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territories adjoining the United States boundary, had been forwarded to 
     <lb/>
     Fort McLeod. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I immediately made preparations for the journey.     These occupied me a 
     <lb/>
     week, as arrangements had to be made for the removal of furniture and 
     <lb/>
     other property to Battle River, where the Government House for the ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, in course of construction, would probably be ready for occupation 
     <lb/>
     on my return from the treaty negotiations.    On the 11th August I left Swan 
     <lb/>
     River for Fort McLeod, <hi rendition="simple:italic">via</hi> Battleford, proposing to go from the latter place 
     <lb/>
     by Cypress Hills to my destination.      I took the Quill Lake trail and came 
     <lb/>
     to the telegraph line, about four miles from Big Stone Lake.    Thence 
     <lb/>
     I followed that line until I came to the trail at the elbow of the North 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan leading to Battle River.     Where the telegraph crosses the 
     <lb/>
     South Saskatchewan I found an excellent ferry scow, and a ferryman 
     <lb/>
     placed there by the Public Works Department.   I arrived at the ferry about 
     <lb/>
     noon on the 20th, and though a high wind rendered it difficult to manage 
     <lb/>
     the scow, the horses, with the vehicles and their contents, were safely fer<lb break="no"/>ried before sunset. On the following evening I reached the Elbow, and the 
     <lb/>
     morning thereafter before leaving camp, Inspector Walker, of Battleford, 
     <lb/>
     drove up, on his way to Carlton, to arrange for the distribution of certain 
     <lb/>
     of the articles intended for the Indians of Treaty Number Six, which had 
     <lb/>
     not arrived when he paid the annuities at that post in the early part of the 
     <lb/>
     month.     Some of the Indians had not dispersed since they received their 
     <lb/>
     payments, and interested parties were causing dissatisfaction among them 
     <lb/>
     by reporting that the provisions intended for them, while assembled to 
     <lb/>
     receive their annuities, having now arrived, should be distributed to them, 
     <lb/>
     as well as the agricultural implements and other articles promised. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I advised Inspector Walker to distribute to those Indians still around 
     <lb/>Carlton their share of the presents, and to give them a small quantity of 
     <lb/>provisions from the Government supplies, to enable them to proceed with<lb break="no"/>out delay to their hunting grounds.     I then continued my journey to Battle<lb break="no"/>ford, which I reached on Monday, the 24th, at noon. Here I was happy to 
     <lb/>meet Major Irvine, who had come straight from Fort McLeod, across the 
     <lb/>Great Plains, to conduct me on my journey, and to inform me that for 
     <lb/>satisfactory reasons adduced by Crowfoot, the leading chief of the Blackfeet, 
     <lb/>Lieut.-Col. McLeod, my associate Commissioner, had consented that the 
     <lb/>meeting of the treaty should be held at the Blackfoot crossing of the Bow<lb/>River, instead of at Fort McLeod.  Major Irvine had reached Battleford only

    a few hours before me, and having a Blackfoot Indian as guide, I abandoned 
     <lb/>my intention of going to Fort McLeod by Cypress Hills, and resolved to 
     <lb/>take the more direct and much shorter course by which that officer came. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     On Friday I had interviews with several parties on business, among whom 
     <lb/>
     were Red Pheasant, the Chief of the Battle River Crees, and a portion of 
     <lb/>
     his band. He desired explanations about the articles promised in the 
     <lb/>
     treaty of last year, and the reason they were so late in being forwarded. I 
     <lb/>
     explained that the unusually heavy rains in Manitoba and the eastern portion 
     <lb/>
     of the territories had made the travelling so bad that the freighters had not 
     <lb/>
     been able to overtake the journey in the time which they expected ; that 
     <lb/>
     the Government were very sorry at the disappointment, as it was their 
     <lb/>
     desire to faithfully carry out all their promises. The officers here had done 
     <lb/>
     their best to meet the difficulty and satisfy the Indians, though at no little 
     <lb/>
     expense to the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Chief appeared to be quite satisfied with the explanation, and after 
     <lb/>
     some further conversation about the reserve, which he desires to be located 
     <lb/>
     at Eagle Hills, he and his companions retired to their lodges, situated for 
     <lb/>
     the present close to the south side of Battle River, under the bank in front 
     <lb/>
     of Government House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Inspector Walker having kindly given instructions to the non-commis<lb break="no"/>sioned officer in charge of the Mounted Police in his absence, that every 
     <lb/>
     assistance in his power was to be afforded to me for continuing my journey, 
     <lb/>
     I was enabled to leave Battleford for Fort McLeod with Major Irvine, on 
     <lb/>
     the 25th August. Besides us two, the party consisted of four police con<lb break="no"/>stables, my personal servant and the guide. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For the first day we followed a trail leading southward, but afterwards 
     <lb/>
     our course was across the trackless plains until we approached near our 
     <lb/>
     destination. On the third day out we first sighted buffalo, and every day sub<lb break="no"/>sequently that we travelled, except the last, we saw herds of the animals. 
     <lb/>
     Most of the herds, however, were small, and we remarked with regret that 
     <lb/>
     very few calves of this season were to be seen. We observed portions of 
     <lb/>
     many buffalo carcasses on our route, from not a few of which the peltries 
     <lb/>
     had not been removed. From this circumstance, as well as from the fact that 
     <lb/>
     many of the skins are made into parchments and coverings for lodges, and 
     <lb/>
     are used for other purposes, I concluded that the export of buffalo robes 
     <lb/>
     from the territories does not indicate even one-half the number of those 
     <lb/>
     valuable animals slaughtered annually in our country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Antelope, though not very abundant, are widely scattered over the plains. 
     <lb/>
     The numerous lakelets abound with water fowl. Some of the pools contain 
     <lb/>
     alkali, but we experienced no inconvenience on the journey from scarcity of 
     <lb/>
     fresh water. The grass in many places is short and thin, but in the hollows 
     <lb/>
     feed for horses is easily obtained. Altogether, though the plains are per<lb break="no"/>fectly treeless, not even a shrub being visible, a journey across them in fine 
     <lb/>
     weather, such as we experienced, when the " buffalo chips " are sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     dry to make a good camp fire, is not disagreeable. </p>

            <p>
      On the afternoon of the 29th we reached the lowest ford of the Red Deer 
     <lb/>
       River, one hundred and sixty-eight miles, by our course, from Battleford. 
     <lb/>
      On the north side of the river at this ford there is quicksand. The water 
     <lb/>
       too, in mid-stream, was deep enough to flow over the side-boards of our 
     <lb/>
       waggons, and at one place the current was dangerously rapid. After re<lb break="no"/>peated trials by some of the men on horseback to find the best footing, we 
     <lb/>
       made the attempt, and the whole party got safely across by night-fall. On 
     <lb/>
      Saturday evening, the 1st of September, we arrived at the Blackfoot cross<lb break="no"/>ing of the Bow River, one hundred and eighteen miles from where we forded 
     <lb/>
       the Red Deer River. The Bow River is a noble stream. The current is 
     <lb/>
       pretty rapid, but at this "ridge under the water"  (which is the literal 
     <lb/>
       translation of the Blackfoot name for the ford) the bed of the river is pebbly 
     <lb/>
      and the footing consequently good. Though we found the water almost as 
     <lb/>
      deep as at the Red Deer River, yet under the guidance of Mr. French, a 
     <lb/>
       small trader who lives near the ford, we, without almost any delay, crossed 
     <lb/>
      bravely over and camped until Monday morning on the south bank of the 
     <lb/>
      for river. 
      </p>

            <p>  At this crossing, where the Indians had latterly been notified to assemble 
     <lb/>for the treaty, there is a beautiful river bottom on the south side of the 
     <lb/> river.    It extended about one mile back from the river, and is some three 
     <lb/>  miles in length.    The river, as far as the eye can reach, is skirted close to 
     <lb/> the water by a narrow belt of cotton-wood and other trees. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>  When I surveyed the clear waters of the stream, the fuel and shelter 
     <lb/>  which the wood afforded, the excellent herbage on hill and dale, and 
     <lb/>the Indians camped in the vicinity crossing and re-crossing the river on 
     <lb/> the "ridge" with ease and safety, I was not surprised that the Blackfeet 
     <lb/>  were attached to the locality, and desired that such an important event in 
     <lb/>  their history as concluding a treaty with Her Majesty's Commissioners 
     <lb/> should take place at this spot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>  On Saturday evening and Sunday several of the Indians called to shake 
     <lb/>  hands with me, among whom was the Rainy Chief of the North  Bloods. Here 
     <lb/> also I met Monsieur Jean L. Heureux, a French Canadian, who had spent 
     <lb/>  nearly twenty years of his life among the Blackfeet. From him I obtained 
     <lb/>  much valuable information respecting the numbers and wishes of the Indians, 
     <lb/>  together with an elaborate list of the different Chiefs and minor Chiefs of 
     <lb/>  the Blackfeet, Bloods, Piegans, and Sarcees, with the principal families of 
     <lb/>their respective tribes and clans of divisions. This list the Commissioners 
     <lb/>  found very useful in enabling them to understand the relative influence of 
     <lb/> the several Chiefs and the strength of their bands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>  On our journey, while within the limits of Treaty Number Six, we met 
     <lb/> scarcely any Indians, but after we crossed Red Deer River we met a few 
     <lb/>  Crees and Half-breeds, and several hunting parties of Blackfeet. The for<lb break="no"/>mer generally use carts in travelling, but the Blackfeet and their associates 
     <lb/> are always on horseback. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Crees appeared friendly, but were not so demonstrative as the Black<lb break="no"/>

    feet, who always rode up at once with a smile on their countenances and 
     <lb/>shook hands with us. They knew the uniform of the Mounted Police at a 
     <lb/>distance, and at once recognized and approached them as their friends. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     We resumed our journey on Monday and arrived at Fort McLeod on the 
     <lb/>
     Old Man's River, on Tuesday the 4th September. The distance between 
     <lb/>
     the Blackfoot crossing of the Bow River and the Fort is about seventy-nine 
     <lb/>
     miles, thus making the length of our journey from Battleford three hundred 
     <lb/>
     and sixty-five miles, as measured by Major Irvine's odometer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A few miles from Fort McLeod I was met by the Commissioners of the 
     <lb/>
     Mounted Police and a large party of the Force, who escorted me into the 
     <lb/>
     Fort, while a salute was fired by the artillery company from one of the hills 
     <lb/>
     overlooking the line of march. The men, whose horses were in excellent 
     <lb/>
     condition, looked exceedingly well, and the officers performed their duties 
     <lb/>
     in a most efficient manner. The villagers presented me with an address 
     <lb/>
     of welcome, and altogether my reception at Fort McLeod was such as to 
     <lb/>
     satisfy the most fastidious lover of display, and more than enough to satisfy 
     <lb/>
     the writer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At Fort McLeod, on my arrival, I received your despatch of first August, 
     <lb/>
     covering the Commission relating to the Treaty and a copy of the Order in 
     <lb/>
     Council of 12th July, in terms of which the commission was issued. Also 
     <lb/>
     your letter of 27th July, informing me that it had been thought desirable to 
     <lb/>
     place the services of the Rev. Father Lacombe at the disposal of the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners while negotiating the treaty. A few days afterwards I was sorry 
     <lb/>
     to learn by telegraph that the reverend gentleman had been taken by ill<lb break="no"/>ness on the journey and would be unable to be present at the meeting with 
     <lb/>
     the Indians. Here, however, I was happy to meet Rev. Father Scollen, a 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic missionary, who has labored for some years among the 
     <lb/>
     Crees and Blackfeet in the western portion of the territories. He kindly 
     <lb/>
     furnished me such information as he possessed, and afterwards went to the 
     <lb/>
     treaty, where his assistance was of some value, particularly in dealing with 
     <lb/>
     the Crees present. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While at the fort I had interviews with several of the Blood Chiefs, who 
     <lb/>
     called upon me to inquire if they could not be treated with there instead of 
     <lb/>
     at Bow River. I explained that hereafter the Government would endeavor 
     <lb/>
     to pay them their annuities at places most convenient for them, but that 
     <lb/>
     on the occasion of making a treaty it was desirable that the several Chiefs 
     <lb/>
     and their principal head men should meet together to talk over the matter, 
     <lb/>
     so that all might feel that they had been consulted as to the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     agreement. They went away satisfied, said they would do as the Great 
     <lb/>
     Father advised, and go to Bow River. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I cannot speak too highly of the kind manner in which the officers and 
     <lb/>
     men of the Mounted Police at Fort McLeod treat their Indian visitors. 
     <lb/>
     Though the red man is somewhat intrusive. I never heard a harsh word 
     <lb/>
     employed in asking him to retire. The beneficial effects of this treatment, 
     <lb/>
     of the exclusion of intoxicants from the country, and of impartially admin<lb break="no"/>
              

            <pb n="255"

     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Blackfeet Treaty</hi>.</fw>   <fw type="num">255</fw>
     
     istering justice to whites and Indians alike, were apparent in all my inter<lb break="no"/>views with  the Indians.    They always spoke of the officers of the Police in 
     <lb/>
     the highest terms, and of the Commander of the Force, Lieut.-Col. 
     <lb/>
     McLeod, especially as their great benefactor.     The leading Chiefs of the 
     <lb/>
     Blackfeet and kindred tribes, declared publicly at the treaty that had it 
     <lb/>
     not been for the Mounted Police they would have all been dead ere this time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         Having rested a week after my tedious journey of over seven hundred 
     <lb/>
     miles, I then occupied myself for a few days in viewing the surrounding 
     <lb/>
     country. In the village I found some excellent stores, supplied with almost 
     <lb/>
     every article of dry goods, hardware and groceries, that any inland com<lb break="no"/>munity requires.     Notably among these were the stores of J. G. Baker &amp; 
     <lb/>
     Co. and Messrs. T. C. Power &amp;, Bro. There is also a good blacksmith's 
     <lb/>
     shop in the village, in which coal is used from the Pelly River, at a place 
     <lb/>
     some twenty miles distant from Fort McLeod. I was told by the propri<lb break="no"/>etor of the shop that the coal answers tolerably well for blacksmithing pur<lb break="no"/>poses, and in the fort it is extensively used for fuel. It burns nearly as 
     <lb/>
     well in a stove as some varieties of Pictou coal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         The land around the fort, and indeed for almost the whole distance be<lb break="no"/>tween the Bow and Old Man's Rivers, is well adapted for grazing ; and 
     <lb/>
     where cultivation has been fairly attempted this season, grain and vege<lb break="no"/>tables have been a success. In short, I have very little doubt that this 
     <lb/>
     portion of the territories, before many years, will abound in herds of 
     <lb/>
     cattle, and be dotted with not a few comfortable homesteads. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Lieut.-Col. McLeod having attended to forwarding the supplies to Bow <lb/> River,
                     which had been previously delivered at the fort, left for the Black<lb
                     break="no"/>foot crossing with some eighty officers and men of the Police
                     Force, on <lb/> Wednesday, the 12th September. I followed on Friday, and
                     reached Bow <lb/> River on Sunday morning. The Police having arrived on
                     Saturday, the <lb/> Commissioners were fully prepared for business on Monday,
                     the 17th, the <lb/> day which I had from the first appointed for the opening of
                     the treaty <lb/> negotiations. <lb/> </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners were visited by Crowfoot, the principal Chief of the 
     <lb/>
     Blackfeet, shortly after their arrival. He desired to know when he and his 
     <lb/>people might meet us. We ascertained that most of the Indians on the<lb/>
    ground were Blackfeet and Assiniboines or Stonies, from the upper part of 
     <lb/>Bow River. But as the 17th was the day named, the Commissioners deter<lb break="no"/>mined to adhere to the appointment, and sent a messenger early in the 
     <lb/>morning to invite the Indians camped around to meet them at the council 
     <lb/>tent at two o'clock, p.m. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Half an hour before the time appointed a gun was fired as a signal for the 
     <lb/>Indians to assemble. The meeting was well attended. The Chiefs came 
     <lb/>forward first and were introduced to the Commissioners, and their followers, 
     <lb/>on being invited, sat up close to the tent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

    

            <p>
     I addressed them, stating that the Queen's Government had last year 
     <lb/>
     promised that they would this year be visited by Commissioners to invite 
    
            <pb n="256"

     <fw type="num">256</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw> 
    

     them to make a treaty. That months ago I had named this very day to 
     <lb/>
     meet them, and that in accordance with the promises made, the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners were now here to discuss the terms of a treaty. Yet as we had 
     <lb/>
     learned that very few of the Bloods, Sarcees or Piegans had arrived, we 
     <lb/>
     would not unduly press forward the negotiations, but wait until Wednesday 
     <lb/>
     to give the others time to arrive. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Indians listened attentively to what was said, and several of the 
     <lb/>
     Chiefs expressed their satisfaction at not being asked to meet us on the 
     <lb/>
     morrow. The Commissioners then told them there were rations provided 
     <lb/>
     for them by the Government, and that those who were in need of pro<lb break="no"/>visions might apply to certain of the Police officers detailed to see to their 
     <lb/>
     proper distribution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Stonies and one Blood Chief applied for flour, tea, sugar and tobacco, 
     <lb/>
     but said they were not then in need of beef. Crowfoot and some other 
     <lb/>
     Chiefs under his influence would not accept any rations until they would 
     <lb/>
     hear what terms the Commissioners were prepared to offer them. He ap<lb break="no"/>peared to be under the impression that if the Indians were fed by the 
     <lb/>
     bounty of the Government they would be committed to the proposals of the 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners, whatever might be their nature. Though I feared this 
     <lb/>
     refusal did not augur well for the final success of the negotiations, yet I 
     <lb/>
     could not help wishing that other Indians whom I have seen, had a little 
     <lb/>
     of the spirit in regard to dependence upon the Government exhibited on this 
     <lb/>
     occasion by the great Chief of the Blackfeet. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Among the visitors at the treaty I was pleased to meet the Rev. John 
     <lb/>
     McDougall, Wesleyan missionary at Morley Ville, and son of the late 
     <lb/>
     lamented Rev. George McDougall, so well and favourably known in con<lb break="no"/>nection with Indian affairs in the North-West. Mr. McDougall was 
     <lb/>
     present at the first interview the Commissioners held with the Indians, 
     <lb/>
     and acted as interpreter for the Stonies, who do not understand the Black<lb break="no"/>foot language. He, as well as the Rev. C. Scollen, rendered the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners all the assistance in their power. Traders, with large supplies of 
     <lb/>
     goods, were arriving on the ground. They desired to erect buildings of logs 
     <lb/>
     to protect their property, but as some of the Indian Chiefs objected to the 
     <lb/>
     trees along the river being cut down for such a purpose until after the 
     <lb/>
     treaty, the Commissioners deemed it prudent, to prevent complications, to 
     <lb/>
     ask the traders to erect only temporary stanchions sufficient to support 
     <lb/>
     canvas coverings. They complied with our wishes, and the Indians gave us 
     <lb/>
     no further trouble on the subject. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the evening of Monday I also received a message from Bobtail, a Cree 
     <lb/>
     Chief, who, with the larger portion of the band, had come to the treaty 
     <lb/>
     grounds. He represented that he had not been received into any treaty. 
     <lb/>
     He, however, had not attended the meeting that day, because he was un<lb break="no"/>certain whether the Commissioners would be willing to receive him along 
     <lb/>
     with the Blackfeet. I asked him and his band to meet the Commissioners 
     <lb/>
     separate from the other Indians on the following day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <pb n="257"

            <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Blackfeet Treaty</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">257</fw>   
     
            <p>
     On Tuesday, at two o'clock, the Cree Chief and his band assembled ac<lb break="no"/>cording to appointment. The Commissioners ascertained from him that he 
     <lb/>
     had frequented for some time the Upper Bow River country, and might 
     <lb/>
     fairly be taken into the present treaty, but he expressed a wish to have his 
     <lb/>
     reserve near Pigeon Lake, within the limits of Treaty Number Six, and 
     <lb/>
     from what we could learn of the feelings of the Blackfeet toward the Crees, 
     <lb/>
     we considered it advisable to keep them separate as much as possible. We 
     <lb/>
     therefore informed the Chief that it would be most expedient for him to 
     <lb/>
     give in his adhesion to the treaty of last year, and be paid annually, on the 
     <lb/>
     north of Red Deer River, with the other Cree Chiefs. He consented. We 
     <lb/>
     then told him that we could not pay him until after the Blackfeet had been 
     <lb/>
     dealt with, as it might create jealousy among them, but that in the mean<lb break="no"/>time his band could receive rations. He said it was right that he should 
     <lb/>
     wait until we had settled with the Blackfeet, and agreed to come and sign 
     <lb/>
     his adhesion to Treaty Number Six at any time I was prepared to receive 
     <lb/>
     him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During Tuesday, several parties of Indians came in, but the principal 
     <lb/>
     Blood Chiefs had not yet arrived. According to appointment, however, the 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners met the Indians at two o'clock on Wednesday. An outline 
     <lb/>
     was given of the terms proposed for their acceptance. We also informed 
     <lb/>
     them we did not expect an answer that day, but we hoped to hear from them 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That day we again intimated to the Indians that rations would be delivered 
     <lb/>
     to such as applied for them. We told them the provisions were a present, 
     <lb/>
     and their acceptance would not be regarded as committing the Chiefs to the 
     <lb/>
     terms proposed by the Commissioners. Most of the Chiefs at once applied 
     <lb/>
     for flour, tea, sugar and tobacco, and in a day or two they also asked for 
     <lb/>
     meat. Even Crowfoot, at last thankfully accepted his share of the rations, 
     <lb/>
     and the beef cattle began to decrease rapidly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On Tuesday we met the Indians at the usual hour. We further explained 
     <lb/>
     the terms outlined to them yesterday, dwelling especially upon the fact that 
     <lb/>
     by the Canadian Law their reserves could not be taken from them, occupied 
     <lb/>
     or sold, without their consent. They were also assured that their liberty of 
     <lb/>
     hunting over the open prairie would not be interfered with, so long as they 
     <lb/>
     did not molest settlers and others in the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We then invited the Chiefs to express their opinions. One of the minor 
     <lb/>
     Blood Chiefs made a long speech. He told us the Mounted Police had been 
     <lb/>
     in the country for four years, and had been destroying a quantity of wood. 
     <lb/>
     For this wood he asked the Commissioners should make the Indians a present 
     <lb/>
     payment of fifty dollars a head to each Chief, and thirty dollars a head to 
     <lb/>
     all others. He said the Blackfeet, Bloods, Sarcees and Piegans were all one; 
     <lb/>
     but he asked that the Crees and Half-breeds should be sent back to their 
     <lb/>
     own country. The Queen, he remarked, had sent the police to protect them; 
     <lb/>
     they had made it safe for Indians to sleep at night, and he hoped she would 
     <lb/>
     not soon take these men away. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Crowfoot said he would not speak until to-morrow. Old Sun, another 
     <lb/>
     influential Blackfoot Chief, said the same. Eagle Tail, the head Chief of 
     <lb/>
     the Piegans, remarked that he had always followed the advice the officers 
     <lb/>
     of the Mounted Police gave him. He hoped the promise which the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners made would be secured to them as long as the sun shone and 
     <lb/>
     water run. The Stony Chiefs unreservedly expressed their willingness to 
     <lb/>
     accept the terms offered. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Fearing that some of the Indians might regard the demands of the Blood 
     <lb/>
     Chief who had spoken, if not promptly refused, as agreed to, I told them he 
     <lb/>
     had asked too much. He had admitted the great benefit the Police had been  
     <lb/>
     to the Indians, and yet he was so unreasonable as to ask that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment should pay a large gratuity to each Indian for the little wood their 
     <lb/>
     benefactors had used. On the contrary, I said, if there should be any pay 
     <lb/>
     in the matter it ought to come from the Indians to the Queen for sending 
     <lb/>
     them the Police. Hereupon, Crowfoot and the other Chiefs laughed heartily 
     <lb/>
     at the Blood orator of the day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I also said the Commissioners could not agree to exclude the Crees and 
     <lb/>
    Half-breeds from the Blackfoot country ; that they were the Great Mother's 
     <lb/>children as much as the Blackfeet and Bloods, and she did not wish to see 
     <lb/>any of them starve. Of course the Crees and Half-breeds could be prose<lb break="no"/>cuted for trespassing on their reserves. In this the Indian Act secured them. 
     <lb/>The Local Government had passed a law to protect the buffalo. It would 
     <lb/>have a tendency to prevent numbers from visiting their country in the close 
     <lb/>season. But to altogether exclude any class of the Queen's subjects, as long 
     <lb/>as they obeyed the laws, from coming into any part of the country, was con<lb break="no"/>trary to the freedom which she allowed her people, and the Commissioners 
     <lb/>would make no promise of the kind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     On the following morning there was a rumor that the Indians in their own 
     <lb/>
     Councils could not agree, that a small party was opposed to making a treaty. 
     <lb/>
    The opposition, however, could not have been very formidable. The prin<lb break="no"/>cipal Chiefs seemed fully to understand the importance of accepting some 
     <lb/>terms. About noon, Crowfoot, with Mr. L'Heureux, as interpreter, came 
     <lb/>to my tent and asked for explanations on some points, which I cheerfully  
     <lb/>gave him. During the forenoon a large party of Bloods came in, among 
     <lb/>whom was Bad Head, an aged minor Blood Chief, of considerable influence, 
     <lb/>who attended the meeting in the afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

            <p>
     When the Commissioners intimated that they were ready to hear what 
     <lb/>
     the Chiefs had to say, Crowfoot was the first to speak. His remarks were 
     <lb/>
     few, but he expressed his gratitude for the Mounted Police being sent to 
     <lb/>
     them, and signified his intention to accept the treaty. The Blood Chief 
     <lb/>
     who made the large demands on the previous day said he would agree with 
     <lb/>
     the other Chiefs. Old Sun, head Chief of the North Blackfeet, said Crow<lb break="no"/>foot spoke well. We are not going to disappoint the Commissioners. He 
     <lb/>
     was glad they were all agreed to the same terms. They wanted cattle, guns, 
     <lb/>
     ammunition, tobacco, axes and money. Bull's Head, the principal Chief of 
   

            <pb n="259"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_10_Page_259.jpg"/>
          
     <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Blackfeet Treaty</hi>.</fw>   <fw type="num">259</fw>
     

     the Sarcees, said, we are all going to take your advice. Eagle Head, the 
     <lb/>
     Piegan head Chief, remarked, "I give you my hand.  We all agree to what 
     <lb/>
     Crowfoot says." Rainy Chief, head of the North Bloods, said he never went 
     <lb/>
     against the white man's advice. Some of the minor Chiefs spoke to the 
     <lb/>
     same effect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners expressed their satisfaction at the unanimity among 
     <lb/>
     the Indians, and said they would prepare the treaty and bring it to-morrow 
     <lb/>
     for signature. The only difficult matter then to be arranged was the reserves. 
     <lb/>
     The Commissioners thought it would take unnecessary time to discuss this 
     <lb/>
     question in open meeting, and resolved that one of them should visit the 
     <lb/>
     head Chiefs at their camps, and consult them separately as to the localities 
     <lb/>
     they might desire to select. Lieut.-Col. McLeod undertook this duty, while 
     <lb/>
     I attended to the preparation of the draft treaty. He succeeded so well in 
     <lb/>
     his mission that we were able to name the places chosen in the treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On Saturday, 22nd September, we met the Indians to conclude the treaty. 
     <lb/>
     Mekasto, or Red Crow, the great Chief of the South Bloods, had arrived the 
     <lb/>
     previous evening, or morning, on the ground, and being present, came for<lb break="no"/>ward to be introduced to the Commissioners. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The assemblage of Indians was large. All the head Chiefs of the several 
     <lb/>
     tribes were now present ; only two Blackfeet and two Blood minor Chiefs 
     <lb/>
     were absent. The representation was all that could be expected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners had previously informed the Indians that they would 
     <lb/>
     accept the Chiefs whom they acknowledged, and now close in front of the 
     <lb/>
     tent sat those who had been presented to the Commissioners as the recog<lb break="no"/>nized Chiefs of the respective bands.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The conditions of the treaty having been interpreted to the Indians, some 
     <lb/>
     of the Blood Chiefs, who had said very little on the previous day, owing to 
     <lb/>
     Red Crow's absence, now spoke, he himself in a few kind words agreeing to 
     <lb/>
     accept the treaty. Crowfoot then came forward and requested his name to 
     <lb/>
     be written to the treaty. The Commissioners having first signed it, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     L'Heureux, being familiar with the Blackfoot language, attached the Chiefs' 
     <lb/>
     names to the document at their request and witnessed to their marks. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While the signing was being proceeded with a salute was fired from the 
     <lb/>
     field guns in honor of the successful conclusion of the negotiations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I may mention in this connection that on Saturday also I was waited 
     <lb/>
     upon by a deputation of Half-breeds, who presented me with a petition, 
     <lb/>
     expressing the hope that the buffalo law might not be stringently enforced 
     <lb/>
     during the approaching winter, and praying that they might receive some 
     <lb/>
     assistance to commence farming. With respect to the buffalo ordinance, I 
     <lb/>
     told them that the notice having been short, the law would not be very 
     <lb/>
     strictly enforced for the first winter, and in regard to their prayer for assis<lb break="no"/>tance to farm, I said I would make it known at Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On Monday, the 24th, the Commissioners met the Indians at ten a.m. 
     <lb/>
     Some minor Chiefs who had not remained until the close of the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     on Saturday signed the treaty this morning. The Chiefs were then asked 
    

            <pb n="260"
                facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_10_Page_260.jpg"/>
            
   <fw type="num">260</fw>   <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw> 
     

     to stand up in a body, their names were read over and the Indians once 
     <lb/>
     more asked to say whether they were their recognized Chiefs. Heavy 
     <lb/>
     Shield, a brother of  Old Sun, at the request of the latter, took the place of 
     <lb/>
     head Chief of his band. It was, however, ascertained that this arrange<lb break="no"/>ment caused dissatisfaction, and Old Sun was restored to his position, and 
     <lb/>
     the band adhering to his brother, was called the " Middle Blackfoot Band." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After their names were called over, I gave the head Chiefs of the Black<lb break="no"/>feet, Blood, Piegans, and Sarcees their flags and uniforms, and invested 
     <lb/>
     them with their medals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While I was shaking hands with them, acknowledging their Chiefs in the 
     <lb/>
     name of the Great Mother, the band played  " God Save the Queen." The 
     <lb/>
     payments were then immediately begun by the officers of the Mounted 
     <lb/>
     Police, one party taking the Blackfeet, and another the Bloods, while a 
     <lb/>
     third was detailed to pay the Assiniboines, or Stonies, near their encamp<lb break="no"/>ment some two miles up the river. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners went in the afternoon with the latter party, and be<lb break="no"/>fore the payments were commenced, presented the Chiefs with their medals, 
     <lb/>
     flags and uniforms. The Stonies received us with quite a demonstration. 
     <lb/>
     They are a well-behaved body of Indians. The influence of the Christian 
     <lb/>
     missionary in their midst is apparent, polygamy being now almost wholly 
     <lb/>
     a thing of the past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On Tuesday I took the adhesion of Robtail, the Cree Chief, and his 
     <lb/>
     band, to Treaty Number Six, and they were paid out of the funds which I 
     <lb/>
     had brought with me from Swan River. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the invitation of the Blackfeet, Blood, and kindred Chiefs, the Com<lb break="no"/>misioners went on Wednesday to the Council tent to receive an address of 
     <lb/>
     thanks. A large number of Indians were present. Mr. L'Heureux spoke 
     <lb/>
     on their behalf, and expressed their gratitude to the Commissioners gener<lb break="no"/>ally for the kind manner in which they conducted the negotiations, to me 
     <lb/>
     personally for having come so far to meet them, and to Lieut.-Col. McLeod 
     <lb/>
     for all that he and the Mounted Police had done for them since their arrival 
     <lb/>
     in the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To this address the Commissioners feelingly replied, and expressed their 
     <lb/>
     confidence that the Indians before them would not regret having agreed to 
     <lb/>
     the treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Cree Chief and his band also waited upon us in the evening at my 
     <lb/>
     tent, and through Father Scollen, as interpreter, thanked us for the manner 
     <lb/>
     in which we had treated them. The presents sent for the Indians were 
     <lb/>
     distributed to each band, after payment. On Wednesday also the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners drove to see the coal seam about five miles east of the Blackfoot 
     <lb/>
     crossing. Under the guidance of Mr. French, they found an outcrop of the 
     <lb/>
     seam at a coulee some three miles south of the river. The seam there is 
     <lb/>
     from three to ten feet in thickness, and the coal, some of which was burned 
     <lb/>
     every day in the officers' mess tent at the treaty, is of a very fair quality. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     About noon on Friday the payments were completed, and the Commis<lb break="no"/>
      
             
            <pb n="261"

     sioners proceeded to close the accounts. They found that the number of 
     <lb/>
     Indians paid, who had accepted the terms of the new treaty, was as

     The Crees who gave in their adhesion to Treaty Number Six were only

     paid the gratuity, this year's annuity being still due them. These were paid

            <p>
     The officers of the Police Force who conducted the payments, discharged 
     <lb/>
     this duty in a most efficient manner. Not in regard to the payments alone 
     <lb/>
     were the services of the officers most valuable. With respect to the whole 
     <lb/>
     arrangements, Lieut.-Col. McLeod, my associate Commissioner, both in 
     <lb/>
     that capacity and as Commander of the Police, was indefatigable in his 
     <lb/>
     exertions to bring the negotiations to a successful termination. The same 
     <lb/>
     laudable efforts were put forth by Major Irvine and the other officers of 
     <lb/>
     the Force, and their kindness to me, personally, I shall never fail to re<lb break="no"/>member. The volunteer band of the Police at Fort McLeod deserve more 
     <lb/>
     than a passing notice, as they did much to enliven the whole proceedings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners at first had not a good interpreter of the Blackfoot 
     <lb/>
     language, but on Wednesday they secured the services of Mr. Bird, a brother 
     <lb/>
     of the late Dr. Bird, of Winnipeg. He has been many years among the 
     <lb/>
     Piegans and Blackfeet, and is a very intelligent interpreter. Mr. L'Heureux 
     <lb/>
     also rendered good service in this respect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The accounts being closed and certified to by the Commissioners, I com<lb break="no"/>menced my return journey on the evening of the 28th September. I came 
     <lb/>
     by a crossing of the Red Deer River some fifteen miles east of the Hand 
     <lb/>
     Hills, travelled across the prairies further west than my former route, and 
     <lb/>
     arrived at Battleford on the evening of Saturday, the 6th of October. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I transmit herewith the treaty as signed by the Commissioners and 
     <lb/>
     Chiefs, and also the adhesion of the Cree Chief to Treaty Number Six. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In conclusion I beg to offer a few observations on the treaty, and sub<lb break="no"/>jects connected therewith. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. With respect to the reserves, the Commissioners thought it expedient 
     <lb/>
     to settle at once their location, subject to the approval of the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council. By this course it is hoped that a great deal of subsequent trouble 
     <lb/>
     in selecting reserves will be avoided. The object of the ten years' reserve on 
    

            <pb n="262"

     the south side of Bow River is to keep hunters from building winter 
     <lb/>
     shanties on the river bottom. This practice has a tendency to alarm the 
     <lb/>
     buffalo, and keep them from their feeding grounds on the lower part of the 
     <lb/>
     river. After ten years it is feared the buffalo will have become nearly ex<lb break="no"/>tinct, and that further protection will be needless. At any rate by that 
     <lb/>
     time the Indians hope to have herds of domestic cattle. The country on 
     <lb/>
     the upper part of the Bow River is better adapted for settlement than most 
     <lb/>
     of that included in the Blackfeet reserve, consequently the Commissioners 
     <lb/>
     deemed it advisable to agree that a belt on the south side of the river should 
     <lb/>
     be exempt from general occupation for ten years, particularly as the Indians 
     <lb/>
     set great value on the concession. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. The articles promised in addition to the money payments may to some 
     <lb/>
     appear excessive. The Stonies are the only Indians adhering to this treaty 
     <lb/>
     who desired agricultural implements and seed. The promises, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     respecting these things may be understood as merely applicable to that 
     <lb/>
     tribe. The Blackfeet and Bloods asked for nothing of this kind ; they 
     <lb/>
     preferred cattle, and  the Commissioners being fully of opinion that such 
     <lb/>
     were likely to be much more serviceable to them than seed and implements, 
     <lb/>
     encouraged them in their request. The number of cattle promised may 
     <lb/>
     appear large ; but when it is considered that cows can be readily purchased 
     <lb/>
     at Fort McLeod for twenty or twenty-five dollars per head, and their de<lb break="no"/>livery to the Indians will cost an inconsiderable sum, the total expense of 
     <lb/>
     supplying the articles promised by this treaty will, I am convinced, cost less 
     <lb/>
     than those under either Treaty Number Four or Number Six. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. I would urge that the officers of the Mounted Police be entrusted to 
     <lb/>
     make the annual payments to the Indians under this treaty. The Chiefs 
     <lb/>
     themselves requested this, and I said I believed the Government would 
     <lb/>
     gladly consent to the arrangement. The Indians have confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     Police, and it might be some time before they would acquire the same respect 
     <lb/>
     for strangers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. The organization of the Blackfeet bands is somewhat different from 
     <lb/>
     that of the Saulteaux and Crees. They have large bands with head and 
     <lb/>
     minor Chiefs, and as they preferred that this arrangement should remain 
     <lb/>
     unchanged, the Commissioners gladly acceded to their desire, as expense 
     <lb/>
     would be saved to the Government in clothing, were councillors and head 
     <lb/>
     men not named. The Stonies, however, asked to be allowed councillors 
     <lb/>
     and their request was granted to the extent of two to each Chief. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     5. Copies of the treaty printed on parchment should be forwarded to 
     <lb/>
     Fort McLeod in good time to be delivered to each head and minor Chief at 
     <lb/>
     next year's payment of annuities. 
     <lb/>

     The treaty with the Blackfeet nation has been concluded 
     <lb/>
     satisfactorily, and was signed by the Chiefs of the Blackfeet, 
     <lb/>
     Blood, Piegan and Sarcee tribes, in the presence of the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners—Governor Laird and Col. McLeod, C.M.G., and of 
     <lb/>
     Major Irvine, Assistant Commissioner, North-West Mounted 
     <lb/>
     Police, and officers of the Police Force, at the Council House, 
     <lb/>
     near " Ridge under the Water, " or " The Blackfoot Crossing " 
     <lb/>
     the Great Bow River, on the 22nd September last. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the morning of the 4th of September Col. McLeod 
     <lb/>
     received information from the ubiquitous Indian that the 
     <lb/>
     Queen's father (Lieut.-Gov. Laird) was at Little Bow River, 
     <lb/>
     thirty miles north from McLeod, and was accompanied by the 
     <lb/>
     "Buffalo Bull" (Major Irvine), and that they would arrive 
     <lb/>
     before the sun sank below the western horizon. At three 
     <lb/>
     p.m. the Commissioner left Fort McLeod, accompanied by a 
     <lb/>
     guard of honor of one hundred mounted men, to meet and 
     <lb/>
     escort the representative of Vice-Royalty to the first white 
     <lb/>
     settlement in the Blackfeet country. The Governor was met 
     <lb/>
     three miles north of Willow Creek, and expressed his surprise 
     <lb/>
     and pleasure at the splendid appearance of the well-mounted, 
     <lb/>
     well-equipped, well-drilled body of men who formed the guard 
     <lb/>
     of honour. When the head of the column forming the escort 
     <lb/>
     wound round the bend of Willow Creek, and the extensive 
     <lb/>
     wooded valley on which McLeod is built appeared in view, 
     <lb/>
     the guns, which had been unlimbered and placed in position on 
     <lb/>
     the highest of the bluffs which girdle the north side of Old 
     <lb/>
     Man's River, fired a salute of thirteen guns. On the arrival 
     <lb/>
     of the cortege at the upper or south end of the village, the 
     <lb/>
     police band took the lead and welcomed the Governor with its 
     <lb/>

     GENTLEMEN,—I thank you for your kind address, and for the hearty wel<lb break="no"/>come you have extended to me on my first visit to this pioneer settlement of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian North-West. After roughing it for the last twenty-four days

     on the broad unsettled prairies, you have surprised me by a reception which

     betokens all the elements of civilization.

            <p>

            <p>
     Permit me to express the conviction that in return for that diligence and 
     <lb/>
     care on the part of the Police Force which you so highly and justly value, 
     <lb/>
     you will always be found conducting yourselves as becomes worthy subjects

     of that illustrious Sovereign whom I have the distinguished honour to repre<lb break="no"/>sent in these territories.

     by your address that I feel unequal to making an appropriate reply ; but 
     <lb/>
     the agreeableness of the surprise will tend to heighten the pleasure of my

     During his stay at Fort McLeod, which extended to the

     14th of the month, the Lieutenant-Governor reviewed the

     garrison, which consisted of troops C and D, and two divisions

     <lb/>
     and His Honor expressed his unqualified admiration of the 
     <lb/>
     splendid form of the men.  He was especially pleased with the 
     <lb/>
     artillery, whose horses and equipments were in beautiful condi<lb break="no"/>tion, and requested Col. McLeod to convey to the officers and 
     <lb/>
     men his surprise and pleasure at finding the force at this post

     so perfectly drilled and acquainted with their duties.

     miles along the Big Bow. It is a lovely spot, this "Ridge

     This was the day appointed for the opening of the Treaty,

     date, and as her Councillors always keep their promises, they

     have appointed Col. McLeod and myself to meet you here now.

     We appointed this day, and I have come a very long distance

     <lb/>
     speech : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " The Great Spirit has made all things—the sun, the moon, 
     <lb/>
     and the stars, the earth, the forests, and the swift running 
     <lb/>
     rivers. It is by the Great Spirit that the Queen rules over 
     <lb/>
     this great country and other great countries. The Great 
     <lb/>
     Spirit has made the white man and the red man brothers, and 
     <lb/>
     we should take each other by the hand. The Great Mother 
     <lb/>
     loves all her children, white man and red man alike; she 
     <lb/>
     wishes to do them all good. The bad white man and the bad 
     <lb/>
     Indian she alone does not love, and them she punishes for 
     <lb/>
     their wickedness. The good Indian has nothing to fear from 
     <lb/>
     the Queen or her officers. You Indians know this to be true. 
     <lb/>
     When bad white men brought you whiskey, robbed you, and 
     <lb/>
     made you poor, and, through whiskey, quarrel amongst your 
     <lb/>
     selves, she sent the Police to put an end to it. You know how 
     <lb/>
     they stopped this and punished the offenders, and how much 
     <lb/>
     good this has done. I have to tell you how much pleased the 
     <lb/>
     Queen is that you have taken the Police by the hands and 
     <lb/>
     helped them, and obeyed her laws since the arrival of the 
     <lb/>
     Police. She hopes that you will continue to do so, and you 
     <lb/>
     will always find the Police on your side if you keep the Queen's 
     <lb/>
     laws. The Great Mother heard that the buffalo were being 
     <lb/>
     killed very fast, and to prevent them from being destroyed her 
     <lb/>
     Councillors have made a law to protect them. This law is for 
     <lb/>
     your good. It says that the calves are not to be killed, so that 
     <lb/>
     they may grow up and increase ; that the cows are not to be 
     <lb/>
     killed in winter or spring, excepting by the Indians when they 
     <lb/>
     are in need of them as food. This will save the buffalo, and

     <lb/>
     that the Queen and her Councillors wish you well.

            </p>

     " Many years ago our Great Mother made a treaty with the 
     <lb/>
     Indians far away by the great waters in the east. A few years 
     <lb/>
     ago she made a treaty with those beyond the Touchwood Hills 
     <lb/>
     and the Woody Mountains. Last year a treaty was made with 
     <lb/>
     the Crees along the Saskatchewan, and now the Queen has sent 
     <lb/>
     Col. McLeod and myself to ask you to make a treaty. But in 
     <lb/>
     a very few years the buffalo will probably be all destroyed, and 
     <lb/>
     for this reason the Queen wishes to help you to live in the future 
     <lb/>
     in some other way. She wishes you to allow her white children 
     <lb/>
     to come and live on your land and raise cattle, and should you 
     <lb/>
     agree to this she will assist you to raise cattle and grain, and 
     <lb/>
     thus give you the means of living when the buffalo are no more. 
     <lb/>
     She will also pay you and your children money every year, which 
     <lb/>
     you can spend as you please. By being paid in money you 
     <lb/>
     cannot be cheated, as with it you can buy what you may think 
     <lb/>
     proper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " The Queen wishes us to offer you the same as was accepted 
     <lb/>
     by the Crees. I do not mean exactly the same terms, but 
     <lb/>
     equivalent terms, that will cost the Queen the same amount of 
     <lb/>
     money. Some of the other Indians wanted farming implements, 
     <lb/>
     but these you do not require, as your lands are more adapted 
     <lb/>
     to raising cattle, and cattle, perhaps, would be better for you. 
     <lb/>
     The Commissioners will give you your choice, whether cattle or 
     <lb/>
     farming implements. I have already said we will give you 
     <lb/>
     money, I will now tell you how much. If you sign the treaty 
     <lb/>
     every man, woman and child will get twelve dollars each ; the 
     <lb/>
     money will be paid to the head of each family for himself, 
     <lb/>
     women and children ; every year, for ever, you, your women 
     <lb/>
     and your children will get five dollars each. This year Chiefs 
     <lb/>
     and Councillors will be paid a larger sum than this ; Chiefs will 
     <lb/>
     get a suit of clothes, a silver medal, and flag, and every third 
     <lb/>
     year will get another suit. A reserve of land will be set apart 
     <lb/>
     for yourselves and your cattle, upon which none others will be

     permitted to encroach ; for every five persons one square mile 
     <lb/>
     will be allotted on this reserve, on which they can cut the trees 
     <lb/>
     and brush for firewood and other purposes. The Queen's officers 
     <lb/>
     will permit no white man or Half-breed to build or cut the 
     <lb/>
     timber on your reserves. If required roads will be cut through 
     <lb/>
     them. Cattle will be given to you, and potatoes, the same as 
     <lb/>
     are grown at Fort McLeod. The Commissioners would strongly 
     <lb/>
     advise the Indians to take cattle, as you understand cattle better 
     <lb/>
     than you will farming for some time, at least as long as you 
     <lb/>
     continue to move about in lodges. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " Ammunition will be issued to you each year, and as soon 
     <lb/>
     as you sign the treaty one thousand five hundred dollars' worth 
     <lb/>
     will be distributed amongst the tribes, and as soon as you 
     <lb/>
     settle, teachers will be sent to you to instruct your children to 
     <lb/>
     read books like this one (the Governor referred to a Bible), 
     <lb/>
     which is impossible so long as you continue to move from place 
     <lb/>
     to place. I have now spoken. I have made you acquainted 
     <lb/>
     with the principal terms contained in the treaty which you are 
     <lb/>
     asked to sign. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " You may wish time to talk it over in your council lodges ; 
     <lb/>
     you may not know what to do before you speak your thoughts 
     <lb/>
     in council. Go, therefore, to your councils, and I hope that 
     <lb/>
     you may be able to give me an answer to-morrow. Before you

     Your payments will be punctually made. You all know the

     been broken; they speak and act straight. You have perfect

     confidence in them, and by the past conduct of the Police 
     <lb/>
     towards you, you can judge of the future. I think I have now

     and the Police to put an end to the traffic in fire-water. I can

     it was only half the quantity, and the following years it grew

     tribe and throughout the country by driving away the whiskey 
     <lb/>
     traders, and now he wants us to pay the Chiefs fifty dollars 
     <lb/>
     and others thirty dollars per head, and to pay him for the 
     <lb/>
     timber that has been used. Why, you Indians ought to pay 
     <lb/>
     us rather, for sending these traders in fire-water away and 
     <lb/>
     giving you security and peace, rather than we pay you for the 
     <lb/>
     timber used. (Here the Indians indulged in a general hearty 
     <lb/>
     laugh at this proposition.) We cannot do you good and pay you

     too for our protection. Button Chief wants us to prevent the 
     <lb/>
     Crees and Half-breeds from coming in and killing the buffalo. 
     <lb/>
     They too are the Queen's children, as well as the Blackfeet and

     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     a treaty with you every year. We will give you something to 
     <lb/>
     eat each year, but not so much as you will receive now. He 
     <lb/>
     says the Americans at first gave the Indians many large sacks 
     <lb/>
     of four, and now they only receive a handful. From us you 
     <lb/>
     receive money to purchase what you may see fit ; and as your

     money would return to say that they had made a wrong count;

     one would discover that he had another wife, another two more

     They spoke in the most flattering and enthusiastic manner of

     the Commissioner, Assistant-Commissioner, officers, and the

     to adhere to the terms of the treaty, and abide by the laws of

     In reply, the Lieutenant-Governor said he was much pleased 
     <lb/>
     to receive this address from the Chiefs of the great Blackfeet 
     <lb/>
     nation, which in fact was to the Great Mother, as the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners were merely acting for her, and carrying out her 
     <lb/>
     wishes. He was certain she would be gratified to learn of 
     <lb/>
     the approval of the Chiefs and their acceptance of her offers. 
     <lb/>
     In return the Great Mother only required of them to abide by 
     <lb/>
     her laws.

     know what I said to them three years ago, when the Police 
     <lb/>
     first came to the country —that nothing would be taken away 
     <lb/>
     from them without their own consent. You all see to-day that 
     <lb/>
     what I told you then was true. I also told you that the 
     <lb/>
     Mounted Police were your friends, and would not wrong you or 
     <lb/>
     see you wronged in any way. This also you see is true. The 
     <lb/>
     Police will continue to be your friends, and be always glad to 
     <lb/>
     see you. On your part you must keep the Queen's laws, and 
     <lb/>
     give every information to them in order that they may see the 
     <lb/>
     laws obeyed and offenders punished. You may still look to 
     <lb/>
     me as your friend, and at any time when I can do anything for 
     <lb/>
     your welfare, I shall only be too happy to do so. You say that 
     <lb/>
     I have always kept my promises. As surely as my past prom<lb break="no"/>ises have been kept, so surely shall those made by the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners be carried out in the future. If they were broken 
     <lb/>
     I would be ashamed to meet you or look you in the face ; but 
     <lb/>
     every promise will be solemnly fulfilled as certainly as the sun 
     <lb/>
     now shines down upon us from the heavens. I shall always 
     <lb/>
     remember the kind manner in which you have today spoken of 
     <lb/>
     me."

            </p>

            <p>
     After this there was a great shaking of hands, and the Great 
     <lb/>
     Council ended.

     On Thursday afternoon the Lieutenant-Governor departed 
     <lb/>
     for Battleford. On leaving the grounds the usual honors 
     <lb/>
     were paid to him. The Commissioner left the following day 
     <lb/>
     for Fort Walsh to attend the Commission that was to meet the 
     <lb/>
     Sitting Bull.

            <p>
     The traders were notified that they were to cease trading and 
     <lb/>
     move off the reservation not later than the following Tuesday, 
     <lb/>
     at ten p.m. By this hour they had all departed, and at noon 
     <lb/>
     on the same day the Force commenced its return journey to 
     <lb/>
     McLeod, which was accomplished in two days and a half. All 
     <lb/>
     were glad to get back to headquarters, as the weather had 
     <lb/>
     been for some days intensely cold and the prairies covered with 
     <lb/>
     snow.
