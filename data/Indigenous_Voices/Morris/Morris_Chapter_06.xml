     THE QU'APPELLE TREATY, OR NUMBER FOUR. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     THIS treaty, is, so generally called, from having been made 
     <lb/>
    at the Qu'Appelle Lakes, in the North-West Territories. 
     <lb/>The Indians treated with, were a portion of the Cree and 
     <lb/>Saulteaux Tribes, and under its operations, about 75,000 
     <lb/>square miles of territory were surrendered. This treaty, was 
     <lb/>the first step towards bringing the Indians of the Fertile Belt 
     <lb/>into closer relations with the Government of Canada, and was a 
     <lb/>much-needed one. In the year 1871, Major Butler was sent 
     <lb/>into the North-West Territories by the Government of Canada, 
     <lb/>to examine into and report, with regard to the state of affairs 
     <lb/>there. He reported, to Lieutenant-Governor Archibald, that 
     <lb/>"law and order are wholly unknown in the region of the 
     <lb/>Saskatchewan, in so much, as the country is without any 
     <lb/>executive organization, and destitute of any means of enforcing 
     <lb/>the law." Towards remedying this serious state of affairs, the 
     <lb/>Dominion placed the North-West Territories under the rule 
     <lb/>of the Lieutenant-Governor and Council of the Territories, the 
     <lb/>Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, being, <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex officio</hi>, Governor 
     <lb/>of the Territories. This body, composed of representative 
     <lb/>men, possessed executive functions, and legislative powers. 
     <lb/>They entered upon their duties with zeal, and discharged them 
     <lb/>with efficiency. Amongst other measures, they passed a pro<lb break="no"/>hibitory liquor law, which subsequently was practically adopted 
     <lb/>by a Statute of the Dominion. They proposed the establishment 
     <lb/>of a Mounted Police Force, a suggestion which was given force 
     <lb/>to by the Dominion Cabinet, and they recommended, that, treaties 
     <lb/>should be made, with the Indians at Forts Qu'Appelle, Carlton 
     <lb/>

     and Pitt, recommendations, which, were all, eventually, carried 
     <lb/>
     out. In the report of the Minister of the Interior, for the 
     <lb/>
     year 1875, he states " that it is due to the Council to record the 
     <lb/>
     fact, that the legislation and valuable suggestions, submitted 
     <lb/>
     to your Excellency, from time to time, through their official 
     <lb/>
     head, Governor Morris, aided the Government not a little in 
     <lb/>
     the good work of laying the foundations of law and order, in 
     <lb/>
     the North-West, in securing the good will of the Indian tribes, 
     <lb/>
     and in establishing the <hi rendition="simple:italic">prestige</hi> of the Dominion Government, 
     <lb/>
     throughout that vast country." In accordance with these sug<lb break="no"/>gestions, the Government of the Dominion, decided, on effect<lb break="no"/>ing a treaty, with the plain Indians, Crees and Chippewas, who 
     <lb/>
     inhabit the country, of which, Fort Qu'Appelle, was a convenient 
     <lb/>
     centre, and entrusted the duty, to the Hon. Alexander Morris 
     <lb/>
     then Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba and the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territories, the Hon. David Laird, then Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior, and now Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territories, and the Hon. W. J. Christie, a retired factor of 
     <lb/>
     the Hudson's Bay Company, and a gentleman of large experi<lb break="no"/>ence, among the Indian tribes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In pursuance of this mission, these gentlemen left Fort 
     <lb/>
     Garry in August, 1874, and journeyed to Lake Qu'Appelle (the 
     <lb/>
     calling or echoing lake), where they met the assembled Indians, 
     <lb/>
     in September. The Commissioners, had an escort of militia, 
     <lb/>
     under the command of Lieut.-Col. Osborne Smith, C.M.G. This 
     <lb/>
     force marched to and from Qu'Appelle, acquitted themselves 
     <lb/>
     with signal propriety, and proved of essential service. Their 
     <lb/>
     return march was made in excellent time. The distance, three 
     <lb/>
     hundred and fifty miles having been accomplished in sixteen 
     <lb/>
     and a half days. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners encountered great difficulties, arising, 
     <lb/>
     from the excessive demands of the Indians, and from the jeal<lb break="no"/>ousies, existing between the two Nations, Crees and Chip<lb break="no"/>pawas, but by perseverance, firmness and tact, they succeeded 
     <lb/>
     in overcoming the obstacles, they had to encounter, and 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="79" facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_06_Page_079.jpg"/>
            <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Qu'Appelle Treaty</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">79</fw>
     
eventually effected a treaty, whereby the Indian title was ex<lb break="no"/>tinguished in a tract of country, embracing 75,000 square 
     <lb/>miles of territory. After long and ammated discussions the 
     <lb/>Indians, asked to be granted the same terms as were accorded 
     <lb/>to the Indians of Treaty Number Three, at the North-West 
     <lb/>Angle, hereinbefore mentioned. The Commissioners assented 
     <lb/>to their request and the treaty was signed accordingly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the return, of the Commissioners to Fort Ellice, they met 
     <lb/>
     there, the Chippawas of that vicinage, and made a supple<lb break="no"/>mentary treaty with them. These Indians were included in 
     <lb/>
     the boundaries of Treaty Number Two, but had not been 
     <lb/>
     treated with, owing to their distance from Manitoba House, 
     <lb/>
     where that treaty was made. In 1875, the Hon. W. J. 
     <lb/>
     Christie, and Mr. M. G. Dickieson, then of the Department of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior, and subsequently, Assistant Superintendent of 
     <lb/>
     Indian affairs, in the North-West Territories, were appointed 
     <lb/>
     to make the payments of annuities, to the Indians, embraced 
     <lb/>
     in the Treaty Number Four, and obtain the adhesion of other 
     <lb/>
     bands, which had not been present at Qu'Appelle, the previous 
     <lb/>
     year. They met, the Indians, at Qu'Appelle (where six Chiefs 
     <lb/>
     who had been absent, accepted the terms. of the treaty) and at 
     <lb/>
     Fort Pelly and at Shoal River, where two other Chiefs, with 
     <lb/>
     their bands, came into the treaty stipulations. A gratifying 
     <lb/>
     feature connected with the making of this, and the other, 
     <lb/>
     North-Western Treaties, has been the readiness, with which 
     <lb/>
     the Indians, who were absent, afterwards accepted the terms 
     <lb/>
     which had been settled for them, by those, who were able to 
     <lb/>
     attend. I close these observations, by annexing, the reports of 
     <lb/>
     Lieutenant-Governor Morris, to the Honorable the Secretary 
     <lb/>
     of State of Canada, of date 17th October, 1874, giving, an 
     <lb/>
     account, of the making of the treaties at Qu'Appelle and Fort 
     <lb/>
     Ellice, and an extract, from that of Messrs. Christie and Dickie<lb break="no"/>son, dated 7th October, 1875, describing its further completion, 
     <lb/>
     and I also insert, accurate short-hand reports of the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     at Qu'Appelle and Fort Ellice, which, were made, at the time,

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir,—I have the honor to inform you that in compliance with the request 
     <lb/>
     of the Government, I proceeded to Lake Qu'Appelle in company with the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. David Laird, in order to act with him and W. J. Christie, Esq., as 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners to negotiate a treaty with the tribes of Indians in that 
     <lb/>
     region. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Laird and I left Fort Garry on the 26th of August, and arrived at 
     <lb/>
     Lake Qu'Appelle on the 8th of September, Mr. Christie having gone in 
     <lb/>
     advance of us to Fort Pelly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We were accompanied on arriving by the escort of militia under the 
     <lb/>
     command of Lieut. Col. W. Osborne Smith, who had preceded us, but 
     <lb/>
     whom we had overtaken. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The escort took up their encampment at a very desirable situation on the 
     <lb/>
     edge of the lake, the Indians being encamped at some distance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners were kindly provided with apartments by W. J. 
     <lb/>
     McLean, Esq., the officer in charge of the Hudson Bay Company's Post. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After our arrival, the Commissioners caused the Indians to be summoned, 
     <lb/>
     to meet them, in a marquee tent adjoining the encampment of the militia. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Crees came headed by their principal Chief "Loud Voice," and a 
     <lb/>
     number of Saulteaux followed, without their Chief, Coté. The Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners, having decided that it was desirable that there should be only one 
     <lb/>
     speaker on behalf of the Commissioners, requested me owing to my previous 
     <lb/>
     experience with the Indian tribes and my official position as Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Governor of the North-West Territories, to undertake the duty, which I 
     <lb/>
     agreed to do. Accordingly, I told the Indians the object of our coming and 
     <lb/>
     invited them to present to us their Chiefs and headmen. " Loud Voice " 
     <lb/>
     stated that they were not yet ready and asked for a delay till next day, to 
     <lb/>
     which we assented. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     0n the 9th, four Indian soldiers were sent to the Commissioners to ask 
     <lb/>
     for two days delay, but we replied that when they met us in conference 
     <lb/>
     they could prefer any reasonable request, but that we expected them to 
     <lb/>
     meet us as agreed on the previous day, and further that the Saulteaux had 
     <lb/>
     not conducted themselves with proper respect to the Commissioners, as 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the Crown, as their principal Chief Coté had not met us. 
     <lb/>
     Eventually, both the Crees and the Saulteaux met us, with their Chiefs, 
     <lb/>
     when I addressed them. They asked time to deliberate and we appointed 
     <lb/>
     the 11th at ten o'clock for the next conference. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
          
            <pb n="81" facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_06_Page_081.jpg"/>
            <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Qu'Appelle Treaty</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">81</fw> 
       
            <p>
     The Crees then left the tent suddenly, under constraint of the Indian 
     <lb/>
     soldiers, who compelled the Chiefs to go. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 11th we sent a bugler round to summon the Indians to the appointed 
     <lb/>
     conference, but they did not come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Instead the Saulteaux sent word that they could not meet us except in 
     <lb/>
     their own soldiers tent, distant about a mile from the militia encampment, 
     <lb/>
     but we refused to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Crees were ready to proceed to the marquee, but were prevented by 
     <lb/>
     the Saulteaux, a section of whom displayed a turbulent disposition and 
     <lb/>
     were numerically the strongest party. We sent our interpreter Charles 
     <lb/>
     Pratt, a Cree Indian, who was educated at St. John's College here, and who 
     <lb/>
     is a catechist of the Church of England, to tell the Indians that they must 
     <lb/>
     meet us as agreed upon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In consequence, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the Crees led by 
     <lb/>
     " Loud Voice," came to the conference, but the Saulteaux kept away, though 
     <lb/>
     a number were sent to hear and report. On behalf of the Commissioners, I 
     <lb/>
     then explained to the Crees the object of our mission and made our proposals 
     <lb/>
     for a treaty, but as they were not ready to reply, we asked them to return to 
     <lb/>
     their tents and meet us next day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 12th the Crees and Saulteaux sent four men from the soldiers tent 
     <lb/>
     or council, which they had organized, to ask that the encampment of the 
     <lb/>
     militia and the conference tents should be removed half way, towards their 
     <lb/>
     encampment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In consequence, we requested Lieut.-Col. Smith to proceed to the Indian 
     <lb/>
     encampment and ascertain the meaning of this demand, authorizing him, if 
     <lb/>
     necessary, to arrange for the pitching of the conference tent nearer the 
     <lb/>
     Indians, if that would give them any satisfaction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He reported, on his return, that the Indians wished the militia to encamp 
     <lb/>
     with them, and that they objected to meet us anywhere on the reserve of 
     <lb/>
     the Hudson Bay Company, as they said they could not speak freely there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He refused to remove the militia camp, as it was a very desirable place 
     <lb/>
     where it had been placed, but with the assent of the Indians selected a spot 
     <lb/>
     adjoining the reserve and at a suitable distance from the Indian tents, on 
     <lb/>
     which the conference tent was to be daily erected, but to be removed after 
     <lb/>
     the conferences closed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We then summoned the Indians to meet us at one o'clock, which they did 
     <lb/>
     at the appointed place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After the formal hand shaking, which ceremony they repeat at the be<lb break="no"/>ginning and close of every interview, the Commissioners submitted their 
     <lb/>
     terms for a treaty, which were in effect similar to those granted at the 
     <lb/>
     North-West Angle, except that the money present offered was eight dollars 
     <lb/>
     per head, instead of twelve dollars as there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Indians declined, however, to talk about these proposals, as they said 
     <lb/>
     there was something in the way. They objected to the reserve having been 
     <lb/>
     surveyed for the Hudson Bay Company, without their first having been 
     <lb/>

     consulted, and claimed that the £300,000 paid to the Company should be paid 
     <lb/>
     to them. They also objected to the Company's trading in the Territory, 
     <lb/>
     except only at their posts. The Commissioners refused to comply with their 
     <lb/>
     demands, and explained to them how the Company had become entitled to 
     <lb/>
     the reserve in question, and the nature of the arrangement,that had resulted 
     <lb/>
     in the payment by the Government of Canada of the £300,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The conference adjourned to Monday the 14th, on which day the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners again met them, but the Cree Chief "Loud Voice" asked for 
     <lb/>
     another day to consider the matter, and " Coté " or "Meemay " the 
     <lb/>
     Saulteaux Chief, from Fort Pelly, asked to be treated with, at his own place. 
     <lb/>
     They demanded, that the Company should only be allowed to trade at their 
     <lb/>
     own posts, and not to send out traders into the Territory—which was of course 
     <lb/>
     refused, it being explained to them that all Her Majesty's subjects had 
     <lb/>
     equal right of trading. The Commissioners then agreed to grant a final 
     <lb/>
     delay of another day, for further consideration. Up to this period the 
     <lb/>
     position was very unsatisfactory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Crees were from the first ready to treat, as were the Saulteaux from 
     <lb/>
     Fort Pelly, but the Saulteaux of the Qu'Appelle District were not disposed 
     <lb/>
     to do so and attempted to coerce the other Indians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They kept the Chiefs "Loud Voice" and "Coté" under close surveillance, 
     <lb/>
     they being either confined to their tents or else watched by " soldiers," and 
     <lb/>
     threatened if they should make any overtures to us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Saulteaux cut down the tent over the head of one of the Cree Chiefs 
     <lb/>
     and conducted themselves in such a manner, that " Loud Voice " applied to 
     <lb/>
     the Commissioners for protection, and the Crees purchased knives and 
     <lb/>
     armed themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Saulteaux, one day went the length of placing six "soldiers," armed 
     <lb/>
     with rifles and revolvers, in the conference tent to intimidate the other 
     <lb/>
     Indians, a step which was promptly counteracted by Lieut.-Col. Smith, 
     <lb/>
     calling in six of the militiamen who were stationed in the tent. In this 
     <lb/>
     connection. I must take the opportunity of stating that the results proved 
     <lb/>
     the wisdom of the course taken by the Commissioners in obtaining the escort 
     <lb/>
     of the militia, as their presence exerted great moral influence, and I am 
     <lb/>
     persuaded, prevented the jealousies and ancient feud between the Crees and 
     <lb/>
     Saulteaux culminating in acts of violence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The conduct of the whole force was excellent and, whether on the march or 
     <lb/>
     in the encampment ground, they conducted themselves in a most creditable 
     <lb/>
     manner. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Resuming, however, my narrative, on the 15th of September, the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners again met the Indians at eleven o'clock in the forenoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Crees had, in the interval, decided to treat with us independently, 
     <lb/>
     and the Saulteaux, finding this, came to a similar conclusion. After a 
     <lb/>
     protracted interview, the Indians asked to be granted the same terms as 
     <lb/>
     were given at the North-West Angle. The Commissioners took time to 
     <lb/>
     consider and adjourned the conference until three o'clock. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            
            <pb n="83" facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_06_Page_083.jpg"/>
            <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Qu'Appelle Treaty</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">83</fw> 
       
            <p>
     In the interval, the Commissioners, being persuaded that a treaty could 
     <lb/>
     not otherwise be made, determined on acceding to the request of the 
     <lb/>
     Indians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Indians, having again met the Commissioners in the afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     presented their Chiefs to them, when they asked to be informed what the 
     <lb/>
     terms granted at the North-West Angle were. These were fully and 
     <lb/>
     carefully explained to them, but after a request that all the Indians owed to 
     <lb/>
     the Hudson Bay Company should be wiped out and a refusal of the Com<lb break="no"/>missioners to entertain their demands, they then asked that they should be 
     <lb/>
     paid fifteen dollars per annum per head, which was refused, and they were 
     <lb/>
     informed that the proposals of the Commissioners were final, and could not 
     <lb/>
     be changed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Chiefs then agreed to accept the terms offered and to sign the treaty, 
     <lb/>
     having first asked that the Half-breeds should be allowed to hunt, and 
     <lb/>
     having been assured that the population in the North-West would be treated 
     <lb/>
     fairly and justly, the treaty was signed by the Commissioners and the Chiefs, 
     <lb/>
     having been first fully explained to them by the interpreter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Arrangements were then made to commence the payments and distribution 
     <lb/>
     of the. presents the next day, a duty which was discharged by Mr. Christie 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Dickieson, Private Secretary of the Hon. Mr. Laird. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I forward you to form an appendix to this despatch, a report marked "A" 
     <lb/>
     and " B " extended from notes taken in short hand, by Mr. Dickieson, of the 
     <lb/>
     various conferences and of the utterances of the Commissioners and the 
     <lb/>
     Indians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is obvious that such a record will prove valuable, as it enables any 
     <lb/>
     misunderstanding on the part of the Indians, as to what was said at the 
     <lb/>
     conference, to be corrected, and it, moreover, will enable the council better 
     <lb/>
     to appreciate the character of the difficulties that have to be encountered in 
     <lb/>
     negotiating with the Indians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 11th I left for Fort Ellice, in company with Mr. Laird, Mr. Christie 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Dickieson remaining to complete the payments, which were satis<lb break="no"/>factorily disposed of. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before leaving, the Chiefs "Loud Voice " and Cote called on us to tender 
     <lb/>
     their good wishes, and to assure us that they would teach their people to 
     <lb/>
     respect the treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners received every assistance in their power from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McDonald of Fort Ellice, in charge of the Hudson Bay Company District 
     <lb/>
     of Swan River, and from Mr. McLean, in charge of the Qu'Appelle Post, —I 
     <lb/>
     also add, that the Half-breed population were I believe generally desirous 
     <lb/>
     of seeing the treaty concluded and used the influence of their connection 
     <lb/>
     with the Indians in its favor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I forward in another despatch a copy of an address I received from the 
     <lb/>
     Metis, or Half-breeds, together with my reply thereto. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The treaty was taken charge of by the Hon. Mr. Laird, and will be by him 
     <lb/>
     placed on record in his Department and submitted to council for approval. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     SIR,—Referring to my despatch of the 17th inst., (No. 211) I have the 
     <lb/>
     honor to report that Mr. Laird and I arrived at Fort Ellice from Qu'Appelle 
     <lb/>
     Lakes, on Saturday the 19th of September. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On Monday, we met the band of Saulteaux Indians, who make their 
     <lb/>
     headquarters at Fort Ellice, and who had remained there, instead of going 
     <lb/>
     to Qu'Appelle at our request. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This band have been in the habit of migrating between the region covered 
     <lb/>
     by the Second Treaty and that comprehended in the Fourth, but had not 
     <lb/>
     been treated with. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We proposed to them to give their adhesion to the Qu'Appelle Treaty and 
     <lb/>
     surrender their claim to lands, wherever situated, in the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territories, on being given a reserve and being granted the terms on which 
     <lb/>
     the treaty in question was made. We explained fully these terms and asked 
     <lb/>
     the Indians to present to us their Chief and headmen. As some of the band 
     <lb/>
     were absent, whom the Indians desired to be recognized as headmen, only 
     <lb/>
     the Chief and one headman were presented. These, on behalf of the Indians 
     <lb/>
     accepted the terms and thanked the Queen and the Commissioners for their 
     <lb/>
     care of the Indian people. A supplement to the treaty was then submitted 
     <lb/>
     and fully explained to them, by our acting interpreter, Joseph Robillard, 
     <lb/>
     after which it was signed by Mr. Laird and myself, and by the Chief and  
     <lb/>
     head man. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The original of the supplementary treaty will be submitted for approval 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Laird, but I annex a printed Copy of it, as an appendix to this 
     <lb/>
    despatch.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I also annex, notes of the conference with these Indians, extended from 
     <lb/>the short hand report taken of the proceedings by Mr. Dickieson, Private 
     <lb/>Secretary to the Hon. Mr. Laird. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In the afternoon, Mr. Christie and Mr. Dickieson arrived from Lake 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="85" facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_06_Page_085.jpg"/>

     Qu'Appelle, and shortly afterwards proceeded to make the payments to the 
     <lb/>
     Indians, under the treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was satisfactory to have this band dealt with, as they asserted claims 
     <lb/>
     in the region covered by the Manitoba Post Treaty, but had not been 
     <lb/>
     represented at the time it was made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the 22nd of September the Commissioners left Fort Ellice and arrived 
     <lb/>
     at Fort Garry on the afternoon of the 26th of that month, having been 
     <lb/>
     absent a little over a month.

     SIR,—We have now the honor to submit, for your information, our final 
     <lb/>
     report in connection with our missions to the Indians included in Treaty No. 4. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As former reports have made you fully acquainted with the arrangements 
     <lb/>
     that had been entered into previous to our departure from this place, any 
     <lb/>
     further reference to them is unnecessary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having left Winnipeg on the 19th August, we arrived at Fort Ellice on 
     <lb/>
     the 24th, the day appointed for the meeting the Indians of that place. The 
     <lb/>
     same evening we had an interview with, and fully explained the terms and 
     <lb/>
     conditions of the treaty to some of the Indians who were net present when 
     <lb/>
     the treaty was concluded last year. Next morning, by appointment, we met 
     <lb/>
     all the Indians and explained to them the object of our mission, and, after 
     <lb/>
     considerable discussion, made arrangements to commence paying the 
     <lb/>
     annuities next day. This, however, was prevented by heavy rains, which 
     <lb/>
     continued more or less to retard our operations on the two following days, 
     <lb/>
     the 27th and 28th, but everything was satisfactorily concluded with this 
     <lb/>
     band on the evening of the latter day, and on the following morning we 
     <lb/>
     started for the Qu'Appelle Lakes, accompanied by an escort of fifteen men 
     <lb/>
     of the Mounted Police Force, under the command of Sub-Inspector McIllree, 
     <lb/>
     which had arrived at Fort Ellice on the evening of the 26th, and reached 
     <lb/>
     our destination on the forenoon of the 2nd September. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As you are aware, we had heard before leaving Winnipeg, that the number 
     <lb/>
     of Indians assembled at the Qu'Appelle Lakes would be very large, but we 
     <lb/>
     did not anticipate that so many as we found (nearly five hundred lodges) 
     <lb/>
     would be congregated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We at once saw that the funds at our disposal to pay the annuities and 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="86" facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_06_Page_086.jpg"/>
           
     <fw type="num">86</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw> 
     
     gratuities would be inadequate, and availed ourselves of the opportunity 
     <lb/>
    presented by the return of Major Irvine to Winnipeg, to forward a telegram 
     <lb/>on the 5th September, requesting a further amount of six thousand dollars. 
     <lb/>to be placed to our credit; and we may state here, though out of the order of 
     <lb/>time, as we found after the first two days payments that we had still under<lb break="no"/>estimated the number of Indians present, we transmitted a telegram to 
     <lb/>Winnipeg by special messenger, on the 9th September, for a further credit 
     <lb/>of fifteen thousand dollars. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
            <p>
     On the 3rd September we met the Indians and explained the object of our 
     <lb/>
     mission, and, for the benefit of those who were absent last year. the terms 
     <lb/>
     and conditions of the treaty, and stated that we were now ready to fulfil so 
     <lb/>
     many of the obligations therein contained as the Gpvernment were bound 
     <lb/>
     to execute this year. The Indians declined saying anything on this occasion, 
     <lb/>
     but wished to meet and confer with us the following day, as they had some<lb break="no"/>thing they wished to speak about. They accordingly met us on the 4th, and 
     <lb/>
     made several demands, one of which was that the annuities be increased to 
     <lb/>
     twelve dollars per head. We replied that the treaty concluded last year 
     <lb/>
     was a covenant between them and the Government, and it was impossible 
     <lb/>
     to comply with their demands; that all we had to do was to carry out the 
     <lb/>
     terms of the treaty in so far as the obligations of the same required. An 
     <lb/>
     idea seemed prevalent among the Indians who were absent last year 
     <lb/>
     that no treaty had been concluded then; that all which had been done at 
     <lb/>
     that time was merely preliminary to the making of the treaty in reality, 
     <lb/>
     which they thought was to be performed this year. The prevalence of this 
     <lb/>
     opinion amongst them operated very prejudicially to the furthering of our 
     <lb/>
     business, and we saw that until this was done away with it would be 
     <lb/>
     impossible to do anything towards accomplishing the real object of our 
     <lb/>
     mission. After a great deal of talking on their part, and explanation on 
     <lb/>
     ours, the meeting adjourned until Monday morning, as it was necessary that 
     <lb/>
     provisions should be issued to the different bands that evening for the 
     <lb/>
     following day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On Monday (the 6th) we again met the Indians, and as they evidently 
     <lb/>
     wished to have another day's talking to urge the same demands they had 
     <lb/>
     made on Saturday, we assured them all further discussion on the subject 
     <lb/>
     was useless; that if they declined to accept the terms of the treaty we must 
     <lb/>
     return and report to the Government that they had broken the promise made 
     <lb/>
     last year. They then asked that we should report to the Government what 
     <lb/>
     they had demanded. This we agreed to do. After some further explana<lb break="no"/>tion to those Chiefs who had not signed the treaty, the payment of the 
     <lb/>
     annuities and gratuities was commenced and continued by Messrs. Dickieson 
     <lb/>
     and Forsyth on this and the three following days until completed, during 
     <lb/>
     which time Mr. Christie conferred with the Chiefs as to the locality of their 
     <lb/>
     reserves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Six Chiefs who had not been present last year when the treaty was con<lb break="no"/>cluded, agreed to accept the terms of the same, and signed their adhesion

     FIRST DAY'S CONFERENCE.

            <p>
     At four o'clock the Commissioners entered the marquee erected 
     <lb/>
     for the accommodation of themselves, and the Indians, who in 
     <lb/>
     in a short time arrived, shook hands with the Commissioners, 
     <lb/>
     the officers of the guard, and other gentlemen who were in the 
     <lb/>
     tent, and took their seats. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It having been noticed that Cote, "the Pigeon" a leading 
     <lb/>
     Chief of the Saulteaux tribe, had not arrived but that several of 
     <lb/>
     his band were present and claimed that they had been sent to 
     <lb/>
     represent him, His Honor the Lieut.-Governor instructed the 
     <lb/>
     (acting) interpreter, William Daniel, to enquire why their 
     <lb/>
     Chief had not come to meet the Commissioners, the white 
     <lb/>
     chiefs ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To this question they answered, that he had given no reason. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     His Honor, through the interpreter, told them that the

     Queen had sent him and the other Commissioners to see their 
     <lb/>
    Chief and their nation, and that the least a loyal subject could 
     <lb/>do would be to meet the messengers of the Queen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     His Honor then addressed the Crees as follows: "The Com<lb break="no"/>missioners having agreed that as Lieut.-Governor he should 
     <lb/>
     speak to them, as we are sent here by the Queen, by the Great 
     <lb/>
     Mother—the Queen has chosen me to be one of her Councillors, 
     <lb/>
     and has sent me here to represent her and has made me Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor of all her Territories in the N orth-West. She has sent 
     <lb/>
     another of her Councillors who has come all the way from 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa. She has also sent with us Mr. Christie, whom you all 
     <lb/>
     know, who has lived for a long time in this country, but who 
     <lb/>
     had gone away from it to live in another part of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. The Queen loves her Red children; she has always 
     <lb/>
     been friends with them ; she knows that it is hard for them to 
     <lb/>
     live, and she has always tried to help them in the other parts 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion. Last year she sent me to see her children at 
     <lb/>
     the Lake of the Woods. I took her children there by the hand, 
     <lb/>
     and the white man and the red man made friends for ever. We 
     <lb/>
     have come here with a message from the Queen and want to 
     <lb/>
     tell you all her mind. We want to speak to you about the 
     <lb/>
     land and what the Queen is willing to do for you, but before 
     <lb/>
     we tell you, we want you to tell us, who your Chiefs and head<lb break="no"/>men are who will speak for you, while we Speak for the Queen, 
     <lb/>
     and we want to know what bands of Crees are here and who 
     <lb/>
     will speak for them. We wish to know if. the Crees are ready 
     <lb/>
     to speak with us now ?"

            <p>
     RA-KU-SHI-WAY, THE LOUD VOICE,—Said in reply: "I do 
     <lb/>
     not wish to tell a lie. I cannot say who will speak for us ; it 
     <lb/>
     will only be known after consultation."

     HIS HONOR THE LIEUT.-GOV.—" By to-morrow you will

     probably have chosen whom you will have to speak for you and 
     <lb/>
     the Commissioners will be glad to meet you after you have 
     <lb/>
     chosen your spokesmen, and will meet you at ten o'clock. We 
     <lb/>
     want you to tell us openly what you want and we will speak to

     you for the Queen in the same way. The Colonel will send a

     man round to sound a bugle at ten o'clock to let you know." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To the Saulteaux His Honor said: "We are here with a 
     <lb/>
     message from the Great Mother and want you to open my 
     <lb/>
     mouth so that I can tell you what I have to say. If you and 
     <lb/>
     your Chiefs will meet together in council and talk it over we 
     <lb/>
     will be glad to meet you, if you bring your Chief to-morrow. 
     <lb/>
     You must also choose your speakers who will come with your 
     <lb/>
     Chief and speak for you." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     LOUD VOICE—" I will tell the message that is given me to 
     <lb/>
     tell. I have one thing to say, the first word that came to them 
     <lb/>
     was for the Saulteaux tribe to choose a place to pitch their 
     <lb/>
     tents."
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HIS HONOR—"This place was chosen because it is a good 
     <lb/>
     place for my men—for the soldiers—there is plenty of water 
     <lb/>
     and grass, and I will meet you here to-morrow. That is all at 
     <lb/>
     present."

            </p>

            <p>
     After the departure of the main body of Cree Indians, Sault<lb break="no"/>eaux, from the Cypress Hills, entered the tent saying that they 
     <lb/>
     had no Chief, and did not want to go with the main body of the 
     <lb/>
     nation, that they had plenty of friends on the plains. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     the rest of the Indians.

     The Indians, both Crees, Saulteaux and their Chiefs having 
     <lb/>
     arrived, His Honor Lieut.-Governor Morris said: "I am glad 
     <lb/>
     to see so many of the Queen's red children here this morn<lb break="no"/>ing, I told those I saw yesterday that I was one of the Queen's 
     <lb/>
     councillors, and had another councillor with me from Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     and that the Queen had sent Mr. Christie who used to live 
     <lb/>
     amongst you to help us. Yesterday the Cree nation with 
     <lb/>
    their Chief were here, the Saulteaux did not come to meet the

     Queen's servants, their Chief was not here. I thought that 
     <lb/>
     the Saulteaux could not have understood that the Queen had  
     <lb/>
     sent her servants to see them, or they would have come to  
     <lb/>
     meet them. If Loud Voice or any other Chief came down 
     <lb/>
     to Fort Garry to see me, and I sent one of my servants to 
     <lb/>
     meet them instead of shaking hands with them, would they 
     <lb/>
     be pleased? I wanted you to meet me here to-day because I 
     <lb/>
     wanted to speak to you before the Great Spirit and before the 
     <lb/>
     world. I want both Crees and Saulteaux to know what I say. 
     <lb/>
     I told those who were here yesterday that we had a message 
     <lb/>
     from the Queen to them. Last year I made a treaty with the 
     <lb/>
     Indians, 4,000 in number, at the Lake of the Woods. To-day 
     <lb/>
     the Queen sends us here. I told you yesterday that she loves 
     <lb/>
     her red children, and they have always respected her and 
     <lb/>
     obeyed her laws. I asked you yesterday, and ask you now, to 
     <lb/>
     tell me who would speak for you, and how many bands of each 
     <lb/>
     nation are represented here. I have heard that you are not 
     <lb/>
     ready to speak to me yet but do not know it, and I want you 
     <lb/>
     to say anything you have to say before all, and I will speak in 
     <lb/>
     the same way. What I have to talk about concerns you, your 
     <lb/>
     children and their children, who are yet unborn, and you must 
     <lb/>
     think well over it, as the Queen has thought well over it. What 
     <lb/>
     I want, is for you to take the Queen's hand, through mine, and 
     <lb/>
     shake hands with her for ever, and now I want, before I say 
     <lb/>
     any more, to hear from the Chiefs if they are ready with their 
     <lb/>
     men to speak for them, and if they are not ready if they will 
     <lb/>
     be ready to-morrow."

     <lb/>
     (the Indians signified their consent.) "I heard you were to 
     <lb/>
     come here, that was the reason that all the camps were collected

     together, I heard before-hand too where the camp was to be

     placed, but I tell you that I am not ready yet. Every day 
     <lb/>
     there are other Indians coming and we are not all together. 
     <lb/>
     Where I was told to pitch my tent that is where I expected to 
     <lb/>
     see the great men in the camp. That is all."

            <p>
     HIS HONOR— "With regard to the camp, the Queen sent one 
     <lb/>
     of her chief men of our soldiers with us, and he selected the best 
     <lb/>
     place for the men, the place where we are now, and I think it 
     <lb/>
     is a good place. At first he thought to have encamped across 
     <lb/>
     the river, but he thought this was better ground and chose it. 
     <lb/>
     I think it just as well that our tents should be at a little dis<lb break="no"/>tance from your braves and your camp. 1 want to say to the 
     <lb/>
     Indian children of the Queen that if their people are coming in, 
     <lb/>
     that our men have walked a long way here, and must go back 
     <lb/>
     again to Fort Garry, and I have other things to do. Mr. Laird 
     <lb/>
     has to go back again to look after other things for the Queen

     speak to me face to face. I am ready now with my friends 
     <lb/>
     here to give you the Queen's message. Are your ears open to 
     <lb/>
     hear? Have you chosen your speakers ?"

            </p>

            <p>
     HIS HONOR—" You have had time enough to select your 
     <lb/>
     men to answer and I will give you the Queen's message. The 
     <lb/>
     Queen knows that you are poor ; the Queen knows that it is 
     <lb/>
     hard to find food for yourselves and children; she knows that 
     <lb/>
     the winters are cold, and your children are often hungry ; she 
     <lb/>
     has always cared for her red children as much as for her white. 
     <lb/>
     Out of her generous heart and liberal hand she wants to do 
     <lb/>
     something for you, so that when the buffalo get scarcer, and 
     <lb/>
     they are scarce enough now, you may be able to do something 
     <lb/>
     for yourselves." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     THE LOUD VOICE (to the Indians)—"I wonder very much 
     <lb/>
     at your conduct. You understand what is said and you under<lb break="no"/>stand what is right and good. You ought to listen to that and 
     <lb/>
     answer it, every one of you. What is bad you cannot answer." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HIS HONOR—" What the Queen and her Councillors would 
     <lb/>
     like is this, she would like you to learn something of the cun<lb break="no"/>ning of the white man. When fish are scarce and the buffalo 
     <lb/>
     are not plentiful she would like to help you to put something 
     <lb/>
     in the land ; she would like that you should have some money 
     <lb/>
     every year to buy things that you need. If any of you would 
     <lb/>
     settle down on the land, she would give you cattle to help you; 
     <lb/>
     she would like you to have some seed to plant. She would like 
     <lb/>
     to give you every year, for twenty years, some powder, shot, 
     <lb/>
     and twine to make nets of. I see you here before me to-day. 
     <lb/>
     I will pass away and you will pass away. I will go where my 
     <lb/>
     fathers have gone and you also, but after me and after you will 
     <lb/>
     come our children. The Queen cares for you and for your 
     <lb/>
     children, and she cares for the children that are yet to be born. 
     <lb/>
     She would like to take you by the hand and do as I did for her 
     <lb/>
     at the Lake of the Woods last year. We promised them and 
     <lb/>
     we are ready to promise now to give five dollars to every man,

     woman and child, as long as the sun shines and water flows. 
     <lb/>
     We are ready to promise to give $1,000 every year, for twenty 
     <lb/>
     years, to buy powder and shot and twine, by the end of which 
     <lb/>
     time I hope you will have your little farms. If you will settle 
     <lb/>
     down we would lay off land for you, a square mile for every

     family of five. Whenever you go to a Reserve, the Queen will

     be ready to give you a school and schoolmaster, and the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment will try to prevent fire-water from being sent among 
     <lb/>
     you. If you shake hands with us and make a treaty, we are 
     <lb/>
     ready to make a present at the end of the treaty, of eight dollars 
     <lb/>
     for every man, woman and child in your nations. We are ready 
     <lb/>
     also to give calico, clothing and other presents. We are ready 
     <lb/>
     to give every recognized Chief, a present of twenty-five dollars, 
     <lb/>
     a medal, and a suit of clothing. We are also ready to give the 
     <lb/>
     Chief's soldiers, not exceeding four in each band, a present of 
     <lb/>
     ten dollars, and next year and every year after, each chief will 
     <lb/>
     be paid twenty-five dollars, and his chief soldiers not exceeding 
     <lb/>
     four in each band, will receive ten dollars. Now I think that 
     <lb/>
     you see that that the Queen loves her red children, that she 
     <lb/>
     wants to do you good, and you ought to show that you think 
     <lb/>
     so. I cannot believe that you will be the first Indians, the 
     <lb/>
     Queen's subjects, who will not take her by the hand. The 
     <lb/>
     Queen sent one of her councillors from Ottawa, and me, her 
     <lb/>
     Governor, to tell you her mind. I have opened my hands 
     <lb/>
     and heart to you. It is for you to think of the future of 
     <lb/>
     those who are with you now, of those who are coming after 
     <lb/>
     you, and may the Great Spirit guide you to do what is right. 
     <lb/>
     I have only one word more to say. The last time I saw you I 
     <lb/>
     was not allowed to say all I wanted to say until you went away. 
     <lb/>
     What I wanted to say is this, I have put before you our mes<lb break="no"/>sage, I want you to go back to your tents and think over what 
     <lb/>
     I have said and come and meet me to-morrow. Recollect that 
     <lb/>
     we cannot stay very long here. I have said all."

     FOURTH DAY'S CONFERENCE.</p>  
   
<p rendition="simple:right">
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">September 12, 1874</hi>. 
     </p>

            <p>
     In the morning four Indians, two Crees and two Saulteaux, 
     <lb/>
     waited on the Commissioners and asked that they should meet 
     <lb/>
     the Indians half way, and off the Company's reserve, and that 
     <lb/>
     the soldiers should remove their camps beside the Indian 
     <lb/>
     encampment, that they would meet the Commissioners then 
     <lb/>
     and confer with them ; that there was something in the way 
     <lb/>
     of their speaking openly where the marquee had been pitched. 
     <lb/>
     Their request was complied with as regarded the place of meet<lb break="no"/>ing only, and the spot for the conference selected by Col. Smith  
     <lb/>and the Indians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The meeting was opened by the Lieut.-Governor, who said, 
     <lb/>
     "Crees and Saulteaux,—I have asked you to meet us here to<lb break="no"/>day. We have been asking you for many days to meet us and 
     <lb/>
     this is the first time you have all met us. If it was not my 
     <lb/>
     duty and if the Queen did not wish it, I would not have taken 
     <lb/>
     so much trouble to speak to you. We are sent a long way to 
     <lb/>
     give you her message. Yesterday I told the Crees her message, 
     <lb/>
     and I know that the Saulteaux know what it was, but that there 
     <lb/>
     may be no mistake, I will tell it to you again and I will tell 
     <lb/>
     you more. When I have given my message understand that 
     <lb/>
     you will have to answer it, as I and my friends will have to 
     <lb/>
     leave you. You are the subjects of the Queen, you are her 
     <lb/>
     children, and you are only a little band to all her other children. 
     <lb/>
     She has children all over the world, and she does right with 
     <lb/>
     them all. She cares as much for you as she cares for her white 
     <lb/>
     children, and the proof of it is that wherever her name is spoken 
     <lb/>
     her people whether they be red or white, love her name and are 
     <lb/>
     ready to die for it, because she is always just and true. What 
     <lb/>
     she promises never changes. She knows the condition of her 
     <lb/>
     people here ; you are not her only red children ; where I come 
     <lb/>
     from, in Ontario and in Quebec, she has many red children, and 
     <lb/>
     away beyond the mountains she has other red children, and she 
     <lb/>

           <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Qu'Appelle Treaty</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">95</fw>

     wants to care for them all. Last year I was among the Saul<lb break="no"/>teaux ; we have the Saulteaux where I came from. They were 
     <lb/>
     my friends. I was the son of a white Chief who had a high 
     <lb/>
     place among them, they told him they would do his work, they 
     <lb/>
     called him Shekeisheik. I learned from him to love the red man, 
     <lb/>
     and it was a pleasant duty and good to my heart when the 
     <lb/>
     Queen told me to come among her Saulteaux children and I 
     <lb/>
     expect the Crees and the Saulteaux to take my hand as they did 
     <lb/>
     last year. In our hands they feel the Queen's, and if they take 
     <lb/>
     them the hands of the white and red man will never unclasp. 
     <lb/>
     In other lands the white and red man are not such friends as 
     <lb/>
     we have always been, and why? Because the Queen always 
     <lb/>
     keeps her word, always protects her red men. She learned last 
     <lb/>
     winter that bad men from the United States had come into her 
     <lb/>
     country and had killed some of her red children, What did 
     <lb/>
     she say? This must not be, I will send my men and will not suffer 
     <lb/>
     these bad men to hurt my red children, their lives are 
     <lb/>
     very dear to me. And now I will tell you our message. The 
     <lb/>
     Queen knows that her red children often find it hard to live. 
     <lb/>
     She knows that her red children, their wives and children, are 
     <lb/>
     often hungry, and that the buffalo will not last for ever and she 
     <lb/>
     desires to do something for them. More than a hundred years 
     <lb/>
     ago, the Queen's father said to the red men living in Quebec 
     <lb/>
     and Ontario, I will give you land and cattle and set apart 
     <lb/>
     Reserves for you, and will teach you. What has been the result? 
     <lb/>
     There the red men are happy; instead of getting fewer 
     <lb/>
     in number by sickness they are growing in number ; their chil<lb break="no"/>dren have plenty. The Queen wishes you to enjoy the same 
     <lb/>
     blessings, and so I am here to tell you all the Queen's mind, 
     <lb/>
     but recollect this, the Queen's High Councillor here from 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, and I, her Governor, are not traders ; we do not come 
     <lb/>
     here in the spirit of traders ; we come here to tell you 
     <lb/>
     openly, without hiding anything, just what the Queen will do 
     <lb/>
     for you, just what she thinks is good for you, and I want you 
     <lb/>
     to look me in the face, eye to eye, and open your hearts to me 
     <lb/>

     as children would to a father, as children ought to do to a 
     <lb/>
     father, and as you ought to the servants of the great mother of 
     <lb/>
     us all. I told my friends yesterday that things changed here, 
     <lb/>
     that we are here to-day and that in a few years it may be we 
     <lb/>
     will not be here, but after us will come our children. The 
     <lb/>
     Queen thinks of the children yet unborn. I know that there 
     <lb/>
     are some red men as well as white men who think only of to<lb break="no"/>day and never think of to-morrow. The Queen has to think of 
     <lb/>
     what will come long after to-day. Therefore, the promises we 
     <lb/>
     have to make to you are not for to-day only but for to-morrow, 
     <lb/>
     not only for you but for your children born and unborn, and 
     <lb/>
     the promises we make will be carried out as long as the sun 
     <lb/>
     shines above and the water flows in the ocean. When you are 
     <lb/>
     ready to plant seed the Queen's men will lay off Reserves so as 
     <lb/>
     to give a square mile to every family of five persons, and on 
     <lb/>
     commencing to farm the Queen will give to every family culti<lb break="no"/>vating the soil two hoes, one spade, one scythe for cutting the 
     <lb/>
     grain, one axe and plough, enough of seed wheat, barley, oats 
     <lb/>
     and potatoes to plant the land they get ready. The Queen 
     <lb/>
     wishes her red children to learn the cunning of the white man 
     <lb/>
     and when they are ready for it she will send schoolmasters on 
     <lb/>
     every Reserve and pay them. We have come through the 
     <lb/>
     country for many days and we have seen hills and but little 
     <lb/>
     wood and in many places little water, and it may be a long 
     <lb/>
     time before there are many white men settled upon this land, 
     <lb/>
     and you will have the right of hunting and fishing just as you 
     <lb/>
     have now until the land is actually taken up. (His Honor 
     <lb/>
     repeated the offers which had been given to the Saulteaux on the 
     <lb/>
     previous day.) I think I have told you all that the Queen is 
     <lb/>
     willing to do for you. It ought to show you that she has 
     <lb/>
     thought more about you than you have about her. I will be 
     <lb/>
     glad now to have those whom you have selected speak for you 
     <lb/>
     and I again ask you to keep nothing back. This is the first 
     <lb/>
     time you have had white chiefs, officers of the Queen, so high 
     <lb/>
     in her Councils, so trusted by her among you. We have no 
     <lb/>

     object but your good at heart, and therefore we ask you to 
     <lb/>
     speak out to us, to open your minds to us, and believe that we 
     <lb/>
     are your true and best friends, who will never advise you badly, 
     <lb/>
     who will never whisper bad words in your ears, who only care 
     <lb/>
     for your good and that of your children. I have told you the 
     <lb/>
     truth, the whole truth, and now we expect to hear from the 
     <lb/>
     two nations and any other tribe who may be represented here. 
     <lb/>
     My friend Mr. Laird reminds me that he has come from an 
     <lb/>
     Island in the far off sea, that he has go back to Ottawa and 
     <lb/>
     then go to his own home, that he was asked specially to help 
     <lb/>
     me in speaking to you and advising me. He is obliged to go 
     <lb/>
     away as I am, and therefore we want you to answer us."

     COTE, or MEE-MAY (Saulteaux Chief)—" I cannot say any<lb break="no"/>thing to you. It is that man (pointing to Loud Voice) will

     speak."  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     LOUD VOICE (Cree Chief)—" If I could speak, if I could 
     <lb/>
     manage to utter my feelings there is reason why I should 
     <lb/>
     answer you back ; but there is something in my way, and that 
     <lb/>
     is all I can tell you. This man (the Gambler) will tell you.

     O-TA-KA-O-NAN, OR THE GAMBLER.—" This morning I saw the 
     <lb/>
     chief of the soldiers, who asked me what is in your way that  
     <lb/>
     you cannot come and meet the Queen's messengers ; then I told 
     <lb/>
     him what was in the way. And now that I am come in, what 
     <lb/>
     do I see ? You were rather slow in giving your hand. You 
     <lb/>
     said that the Queen spoke through you and spoke very plainly, 
     <lb/>
     but I cannot speak about what you said at present ; the thing 
     <lb/>
     that is in the way that is what I am working at."

            <p>
     LIEUT.-Gov. MORRIS—" We have come here for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of knowing what is in your mind. I held out my hand but 
     <lb/>
     you did not do as your nation did at the Angle. When I 
     <lb/>
     arrived there the Chief and his men came and gave me the 
     <lb/>
     pipe of peace and paid me every honor. Why ? Because I 
     <lb/>
     was the servant of the Queen. I was not slow in offering my 
     <lb/>
     hand, I gave it freely and from my heart, and whenever we 
     <lb/>
     found I could please you by coming here, we sent the chief of

     the soldiers to select a suitable place to meet you. You tell 
     <lb/>
     me there is something in your mind. If there is anything 
     <lb/>
     standing between us, how can we take it away or answer you  
     <lb/>
     unless we know what it is ?" 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     THE GAMBLER—" I told the soldier master you did not set 
     <lb/>
     your camp in order, you came and staid beyond over there, 
     <lb/>
     that is the reason I did not run in over there. Now when you 
     <lb/>
     have come here, you see sitting out there a mixture of Half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     breeds, Crees, Saulteaux and Stonies, all are one, and you were 
     <lb/>
     slow in taking the hand of a Half-breed. All these things are 
     <lb/>
     many things that are in my way. I cannot speak about them." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     LIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS—Why are you here to-day? because we 
     <lb/>
     asked you to come, because it was a good place to speak with 
     <lb/>
     them the reason we wished to see them. I am now quite will<lb break="no"/>ing to tell you all about Fort Pelly. The Queen heard that 
     <lb/>
     Americans had come into the country and were treating her 
     <lb/>
     Indian children badly. I myself sent her word that twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     five of her Indian children, men, women and children, had been 
     <lb/>
     shot down by the American traders, then she resolved to pro<lb break="no"/>tect her red children, for that reason she has determined to 
     <lb/>
     have a body of men on horses as policemen to keep all bad 
     <lb/>
     people, white or red, in order. She will not allow her red 
     <lb/>
     children to be made drunk and shot down again as some of 
     <lb/>
     them were a few months ago. Now you ought to be glad that 
     <lb/>
     you have a Queen who takes such an interest in you. What 
     <lb/>
     are they doing now up at Fort Pelly? The men must have 
     <lb/>
     some place to live in this winter, they cannot live out of doors, 
     <lb/>
     and some men have gone to Fort Pelly to build houses for 
     <lb/>
     them, and the Queen expects that you will do all you can to 
     <lb/>
     help them because they are your friends. There was a treaty 
     <lb/>
     before and Indians are paid under it, but we were told as we 
     <lb/>
     passed Fort Ellice that there were a few Indians there who 
     <lb/>
     were not included in that treaty, and had never been paid, and 
     <lb/>
     they agreed to meet us when we go back. I do not quite 
     <lb/>
     understand another point. We have here Crees, Saulteaux, 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="99" facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_06_Page_099.jpg"/>

     Assiniboines and other Indians, they are all one, and we have 
     <lb/>
     another people, the Half-breeds, they are of your blood and my 
     <lb/>
     blood. The Queen cares for them, one of them is here an 
     <lb/>
     officer with a Queen's coat on his back. At the Lake of the 
     <lb/>
     Woods last winter every Half-Breed who was there with me 
     <lb/>
     was helping me, and I was proud of it, and glad to take the 
     <lb/>
     word back to the Queen, and her servants, and you may rest 
     <lb/>
     easy, you may leave the Half-breeds in the hands of the Queen 
     <lb/>
     who will deal generously and justly with them. There was a 
     <lb/>
     Half-breed came forward to the table. He was only one of 
     <lb/>
     many here. I simply wanted to know whether he was autho<lb break="no"/>rized by you to take any part in the Council, as it is the Indians 
     <lb/>
     alone we are here to meet. He told me you wanted him here 
     <lb/>
     as a witness. We have plenty of witnesses here, but when I 
     <lb/>
     heard that, I welcomed him as I had done you, and shook 
     <lb/>
     hands with him, and he ought to have told you that. I have 
     <lb/>
     given our answer and I have always found this that it is good 
     <lb/>
     for men to try to understand each other, and to speak openly, 
     <lb/>
     if they do that and both are earnest, if their hearts are pure, 
     <lb/>
     they will and can understand each other." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     THE GAMBLER——" I have understood plainly before what he 
     <lb/>
     (the Hudson Bay Company) told me about the Queen. This 
     <lb/>
     country that he (H. B. Co.) bought from the Indians let him 
     <lb/>
     complete that. It is that which is in the way. I cannot 
     <lb/>
     manage to speak upon anything else, when the land was staked 
     <lb/>
     off it was all the Company's work. That is the reason I cannot

     Half-breeds, and for the whites. She will make no distinction. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever she promises she will carry out. The Company are 
     <lb/>
     are nothing to her except that they are carrying on trade in 
     <lb/>
     this country, and that they are subjects to her just as you are. 
     <lb/>
     You ask then why I went to the Company's house? I came 
     <lb/>
     here not at my own pleasure. I am not so strong as you are. 
     <lb/>
     I never slept in a tent in my life before and was only too glad 
     <lb/>
     to find a home to go to."

     THE GAMBLER—" I understand now. And now this Com<lb break="no"/>pany man. This is the Company man (pointing to Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Donald). This is the thing I cannot speak of. The Cree does  
     <lb/>
     not know, the Saulteaux does not know. It was never known 
     <lb/>
     when this was surveyed, neither by the Cree nor the Saulteaux."

     LIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS—"The Company are trading in this 
     <lb/>
     country and they require to have places to carry out their trade. 
     <lb/>
     If the Queen gives them land to hold under her she has a per<lb break="no"/>fect right to do it, just as she will have a perfect right to lay off  
     <lb/>
     lands for you if you agree to settle on them. I am sorry for 
     <lb/>
     you; I am afraid you have been listening to bad voices who 
     <lb/>
     have not the interests of the Indians at heart. If because of 
     <lb/>
     these things you will not speak to us we will go away with 
     <lb/>
     hearts sorry for you and for your children, who thus throw 
     <lb/>
     back in our faces the hand of the Queen that she has held out

     THE GAMBLER—" It is very plain who speaks; the Crees are 
     <lb/>
     not speaking, and the Saulteaux is speaking, if the Queen's men 
     <lb/>
     came here to survey the land. I am telling you plainly. I 
     <lb/>
     cannot speak any other thing till this is cleared up. Look at 
     <lb/>
     these children that are sitting around here and also at the tents, 
     <lb/>
     who are just the image of my kindness. There are different 
     <lb/>
     kinds of grass growing here that is just like those sitting 
     <lb/>
     around here. There is no difference. Even from the American 
     <lb/>
     land they are here, but we love them all the same, and when

     same. I am telling you what our love and kindness is. This 
     <lb/>
     is what I did when the white man came, but when he came

     back he paid no regard to me how he carried on."

     <lb/>
     the Company did. Perhaps he may know why he did so. 
     <lb/>
    Perhaps if I were to ask him now he would say. That is what 
     <lb/> I would think. This is the reason. I am so pleased at what 
     <lb/> I see here I cannot manage to speak because of the Company.

     <lb/> or the little child, she will do. The Company ought not to be a 
     <lb/>wall between you and us; you will make a mistake if you send

     never came here, and now I see the soldiers and the settlers

     the Great Spirit. The lands are the Queen's under the Great

     <lb/>
     father's hand had been given she could not take it back without 
     <lb/>
     the Company's consent; therefore she told the Company that 
     <lb/>
     the time had come when they should no longer be the great 
     <lb/>
     power in this country, that she would plant her own flag, that 
     <lb/>
     she would send her own Governor and soldiers, and that they 
     <lb/>
     must cease to have the only right to trade here (and I am 
     <lb/>
     glad to know that some of you are good traders), the Queen 
     <lb/>
     then told the Company that she would govern the country 
     <lb/>
     herself, and she told them she would give them some land. 
     <lb/>
     They had their forts, their places of trade where they raised 
     <lb/>
    cattle and grain, and she told them they could keep them, and 
     <lb/>she will no more break with them than she will with you. 
     <lb/>There is no reason why you should not talk to us. The 
     <lb/>Company have no more power, no more authority to govern 
     <lb/>this country than you have, it rests with the Queen."

     block the way to our understanding each other when the

     was worth money to you to say to this trader you shall not 
     <lb/>
     buy furs at any post, the Queen would not act unjustly to the 
     <lb/>
     Company. She would not take rights away from them any 
     <lb/>
     more than from you; and to settle the question, she took all 
     <lb/>
     the lands into her own hands and gave the Company a sum of 
     <lb/>
     money in place of the rights which she had taken from them. 
     <lb/>
     She is ready to deal with you justly. We are here to-day to 
     <lb/>
     make to you her good offers. We have nothing to hide, 
     <lb/>
    nothing to conceal. The Queen acts in daylight. I think it is 
     <lb/>time you are going to talk with us about the offers we have 
     <lb/>made. "

     our land we worship the Great Spirit, and do not work on 
     <lb/>
     Sunday. I am glad to see that you are going back into

     <lb/>
      single hearts desiring only to do what is right and trusting my  
     <lb/>
     words. On Monday morning we will be glad to meet you  
     <lb/>
     here and hope we will find then that your heart has come to  
     <lb/>
     ours, that you will see that it is for your children's good, to  
     <lb/>take our hands and the promises we have given. As I told you 
     <lb/>before we would be glad to stay longer with you, but we are 
     <lb/>obliged to go away. We ask you then to meet us on Mon<lb break="no"/>day morning and Mr. Pratt will tell you so that there may be

            <p> Both nations, Crees and Saulteaux, having assembled, His  
     <lb/>  Honor Lieut.-Governor Morris again addressed them :—  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> " Children of our Great Mother, I am glad to see you again 
     <lb/> after another day. How have you come to meet us ? I hope  
     <lb/> you have come to us with good thoughts, and hearts ready to  
     <lb/> meet ours. I have one or two words to say to you. It is  
     <lb/> twenty days to-day since we left the Red River. We want to turn  
     <lb/> our faces homewards. You told me on Saturday that some of 
     <lb/> you could eat a great deal. I have something to say to you 
     <lb/> about that. There are Indians who live here, they have their 
     <lb/> wives and children around them. It is good for them to be 
     <lb/> here, and have plenty to eat, but they ought to think of their 
     <lb/>brothers ; they ought to think that there are men here who 
     <lb/> have come from a distance, from Fort Pelly and beyond, whose 
     <lb/>very wives and children are not here to eat, and they want to be at 
     <lb/>home with them. It is time now that we began to understand

            <p>
     each other, and when there is something troubles us, I believe 
     <lb/>
     in telling it. When you told us you were troubled about the 
     <lb/>
     situation of this tent, we had it moved. Now we want you to 
     <lb/>
     take away our trouble, or tell us what you mean. We are 
     <lb/>
     troubled about this. We are servants of the Queen ; we have 
     <lb/>
     been here many days giving you our message, and we have not 
     <lb/>
     yet heard the voice of the nations. We have two nations here. 
     <lb/>
     We have the Crees, who were here first, and we have the 
     <lb/>
     Ojibbeways, who came from our country not many suns ago. 
     <lb/>
     We find them here ; we won't say they stole the land and the 
     <lb/>
     stones and the trees ; no, but we will say this, that we believe 
     <lb/>
     their brothers, the Crees, said to them when they came in here: 
     <lb/>
     "The land is wide, it is wide, it is big enough for us both ; let 
     <lb/>
     us live here like Brothers ;" and that is what you say, as you 
     <lb/>
     told us on Saturday, as to the Half-breeds that I see around. 
     <lb/>
     You say that you are one with them ; now we want all to be 
     <lb/>
     one. We know no difference between Crees and Ojibbeways. 
     <lb/>
     Now we want to ask you are you wiser, do you know more, 
     <lb/>
     than the Ojibbeway people that I met last year? You are a 
     <lb/>
     handful compared with them ; they came to me from the Lake 
     <lb/>
     of the Woods, from Rainy Lake, from the Kaministiquia, and 
     <lb/>
     from the Great Lake. I told them my message, as I have 
     <lb/>
     told you ; they heard my words and they said they were good, 
     <lb/>
     and they took my hand and I gave them mine and the presents ; 
     <lb/>
     but that is not all. There was a band of Ojibbeways who 
     <lb/>
     lived at Lake Seul, to the north of the Lake of the Woods, 
     <lb/>
     400 in number, and just before we came away we sent our 
     <lb/>
     messenger to them. He told them I had shaken hands for 
     <lb/>
     the Queen with all the Ojibbeways down to the Great Lake. 
     <lb/>
     He told them what we had done for these, and asked them if 
     <lb/>
     they found it good to take the Queen's hand through our 
     <lb/>
     messenger; they were pleased ; they signed the treaty ; they 
     <lb/>
     put their names to it, saying, We take what you promised to 
     <lb/>
     the other Saulteaux ; and our messenger gave them the money, 
     <lb/>
     just as our messengers will give your brothers who are not 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="109"

            <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Qu'Appelle Treaty</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">109</fw>
   
           
     here the money if we understand each other. Now, we ask 
     <lb/>
     you again, are you wiser than your brothers that I have seen 
     <lb/>
     before? I do not think that you will say you are, but we 
     <lb/>
     want you to take away our last trouble. What I find strange 
     <lb/>
     is this: we are Chiefs; we have delivered the message of our 
     <lb/>
     great Queen, whose words never change, whose tongue and 
     <lb/>
     the tongues of whose messengers are never forked ; and how is 
     <lb/>
     it that we have not heard any voice back from the Crees or 
     <lb/>
     Saulteaux, or from their Chiefs? I see before me two Chiefs ; 
     <lb/>
     we know them to be Chiefs, because we see you put them 
     <lb/>
     before you to shake hands with us. They must have been 
     <lb/>
     made Chiefs, not for anything we are talking about to-day, not 
     <lb/>
     for any presents we are offering to you, not because of the 
     <lb/>
     land ; then why are they chiefs? Because I see they are old 
     <lb/>
     men ; the winds of many winters have whistled through their 
     <lb/>
     branches. I think they must have learned wisdom ; the words 
     <lb/>
     of the old are wise ; why then, we ask ourselves—and this is 
     <lb/>
     our trouble—Why are your Chiefs dumb? They can speak. 
     <lb/>
     One of them is called "Loud Voice." He must have been 
     <lb/>
     heard in the councils of the nation. Then I ask myself, why 
     <lb/>
     do they not answer? It cannot be that you are afraid; you 
     <lb/>
     are not women. In this country, now, no man need be afraid. 
     <lb/>
     If a white man does wrong to an Indian, the Queen will 
     <lb/>
     punish them. The other day at Fort Ellice, a white man, it is 
     <lb/>
     said, stole some furs from an Indian. The Queen's policemen 
     <lb/>
     took him at once; sent him down to Red River, and he is 
     <lb/>
     lying in jail now ; and if the Indians prove that he did wrong, 
     <lb/>
     he will be punished. You see then that if the white man 
     <lb/>
     does wrong to the Indian he will punished ; and it will be the 
     <lb/>
     same if the Indian does wrong to the white man. The red 
     <lb/>
     and white man must live together, and be good friends, and 
     <lb/>
     the Indians must live together like brothers with each other 
     <lb/>
     and the white man. I am afraid you are weary of my talking. 
     <lb/>
     Why do I talk so much? Because I have only your good at 
     <lb/>
     heart. I do not want to go away with my head down, to send 
     <lb/>

     word to the Queen, "Your red children could not see that 
     <lb/>
     your heart was good towards them ; could not see as you see 
     <lb/>
     that it was for the good of themselves and their children's 
     <lb/>
     children to accept the good things you mean for them." I 
     <lb/>
     have done. Let us hear the voice of the people. Let us hear

     <lb/>
     by the voice of an orator I am glad. All we want is to hear 
     <lb/>
     the voice of the people, and I asked you at first to choose 
     <lb/>
     among yourselves those who would speak for you ; therefore I 
     <lb/>
     am glad to hear the man you have chosen, and I am glad to

     we met at such a time as this time, and again we said we 
     <lb/>
     would tell each other something ; now, then, we will report to 
     <lb/>
     each other a little again. This Company man that we were 
     <lb/>
     speaking about, I do not hate him; as I loved him before I 
     <lb/>
     love him still, and I also want that the way he loved me at 
     <lb/>
     first he should love me the same; still, I wish that the Com<lb break="no"/>pany would keep at his work the same as he did ; that I want 
     <lb/>
     to be signed on the paper. I want you to put it with your 
     <lb/>
     own hands. After he puts that there it is given to the 
     <lb/>
     Indians, then there will be another article to speak about. 
     <lb/>
     The Indians want the Company to keep at their post and 
     <lb/>
     nothing beyond. After that is signed they will talk about 
     <lb/>
     something else."

     LIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS—"I told you on Saturday that I had

     nothing to do with the Company. The Company have a right 
     <lb/>
     to trade. I cannot make them buy goods and bring them 
     <lb/>
     here, or stop them from bringing them. I dare say some of

     goods and sell them again, and I do not stop you. It is the 
     <lb/>
     same way with the Company. If they make money in bring<lb break="no"/>ing goods here they will bring them just as they used to do ; 
     <lb/>
     and I want you to understand it fully, the Company may have 
     <lb/>
     a little more money than the white traders, or the Half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     breeds, or the Indians, but they have no more right, they have 
     <lb/>
     no more privileges, to trade than the Indians, or the Half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     breeds, or the whites ; and that is written with a higher hand 
     <lb/>
     than ours, and we have no power to write anything, or to add 
     <lb/>
     anything, to what is written and remains in the Queen's house

     beyond the sea."

     THE GAMBLER—" I do not want to drive the Company any<lb break="no"/>where. What I said is, that they are to remain here at their 
     <lb/>
     house. Supposing you wanted to take them away, I would 
     <lb/>
     not let them go. I want them to remain here to have nothing 
     <lb/>
     but the trade. I do not hate them ; we always exchange with 
     <lb/>
     them, and would die if they went away."

            <p>
     LIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS—" I do not know whether we rightly

     <lb/>
     Company helps you to live, and they have a right to sell goods 
     <lb/>
     as other traders. I do not know that I understand you rightly, 
     <lb/>
     that you do not want them to sell goods anywhere except at 
     <lb/>
     the posts; to keep at their posts there. If that is what you 
     <lb/>
     mean, I cannot say yes to that ; they have the same right to 
     <lb/>
     sell goods anywhere that you have. They are no longer as 
     <lb/>
     they were once. The Government of the country, I think I 
     <lb/>
     told you that before—understand me distinctly—the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment have nothing to do with the Company, but the Company 
     <lb/>
     and all their servants are subjects of the Queen and love and 
     <lb/>
     obey her laws. The day has gone past when they made the 
     <lb/>
     laws. They have to hear the laws the Queen makes, and like

     whites have, just as the Half-breeds have, and we have no

     mind? Have you tried to be of one mind ?' Must we go back 
     <lb/>
     and say we have had you here so many days, and that you 
     <lb/>
     had not the minds of men—that you were not able to under<lb break="no"/>stand each other? Must we go back and tell the Queen that 
     <lb/>
     we held out our hands for her, and her red children put them 
     <lb/>
     back again? If that be the message that your conduct to-day 
     <lb/>
     is going to make us carry back, I am sorry for you, and fear it 
     <lb/>
     will be a long day before you again see the Queen's Councillors 
     <lb/>
     here to try to do you good. The Queen and her Councillors 
     <lb/>
     may think that you do not want to be friends, that you do not 
     <lb/>
     want your little ones to be taught, that you do not want when 
     <lb/>
     the food is getting scarce to have a hand in yours stronger 
     <lb/>
     than yours to help you. Surely you will think again before 
     <lb/>
     you turn your backs on the offers ; you will not let so little a 
     <lb/>
     question as this about the Company, without whom you tell me 
     <lb/>
     you could not live, stop the good we mean to do. I hope that 
     <lb/>
     I am perfectly understood ; when we asked the chief here we 
     <lb/>
     wanted to speak with him about his lands at his place ; when 
     <lb/>
     we asked "Loud Voice " here we wanted to speak with him 
     <lb/>
     about the land at his place ; so when we asked the other 
     <lb/>
     chiefs here we wanted to speak with them about the lands at 
     <lb/>
     their places. Why? because we did not want to do anything 
     <lb/>
     that you would not all know about, that there might be no 
     <lb/>
     bad feelings amongst you. We wanted you to be of one mind 
     <lb/>
     and heart in this matter, and that is the reason you are here 
     <lb/>
     to-day. Now it rests with you; we have done all we could. 
     <lb/>
     Have you anything more to say to us, or are we to turn our

     THE GAMBLER—" We do not understand you and what you 
     <lb/>
     are talking about. I do not keep it from you ; we have not 
     <lb/>
     chosen our Chiefs; we have not appointed our soldiers and 
     <lb/>
     councillors ; we have not looked around us yet, and chosen our 
     <lb/>
     land, which I understand you to tell us to choose. We do not 
     <lb/>
     want to play with you, but we cannot appoint our Chiefs and 
     <lb/>
     head men quickly; that is in the way. Now it is near mid<lb break="no"/>day, and we cannot appoint our Chiefs. This Chief who got 
     <lb/>
     up last—the Queen's name was used when he was appointed 
     <lb/>
     to be Chief—he wants to know where his land is to be and see 
     <lb/>
     it. what like it is to be, and to find the number of his children ; 
     <lb/>
     that is what is in his mind. He says he came from afar, he 
     <lb/>
     had a good mind for coming, and he takes the same good mind 
     <lb/>
     away with him. I have not heard him say to the Saulteaux to 
     <lb/>
     keep back their land." 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     LIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS—" I think I understand you. We do 
     <lb/>
     not want to separate in bad feeling, or to avoid any trouble in 
     <lb/>
     coming to an understanding with you ; because I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     that if we do not agree it will ever be my good fortune to 
     <lb/>
     endeavor to do so again. "Loud Voice," the Chief, has told us 
     <lb/>
     he wants a day to think it over. The Chief "Cote," from the 
     <lb/>
     north, would like to go home, but I am sure he will stop a day 
     <lb/>
     and try to understand his brothers, and agree as the others did 
     <lb/>
     at the Lake of the Woods. I put my name, and the Chiefs and 
     <lb/>
     the head men put theirs, and I gave the Chief a copy, and I 
     <lb/>
     told him when I went home to Red River I would have it all 
     <lb/>
     written out, a true copy made on skin, that could not be 
     <lb/>
     rubbed out, that I would send a copy to his people so that 
     <lb/>
     when we were dead and gone the letter would be there to 
     <lb/>
     speak for itself, to show everything that was promised ; and 
     <lb/>
     that was the right way to do. I did so, and sent a copy of the 
     <lb/>
     treaty written in letters of blue. gold, and black to the Chief 
     <lb/>
     "Maw-do-pe-nais," whom the people had told to keep it for

     them. He who speaks for the Saulteaux tells us they have 
     <lb/>
     not made up their minds yet about the land—he tells us they 
     <lb/>
     have not decided to refuse our hands. I am glad to hear him 
     <lb/>
     say that, and if it will please my Indian brethren here we will 
     <lb/>
     be glad to wait another day and meet them here to-morrow 
     <lb/>
     morning, if they will promise me with the words of men that 
     <lb/>
     they will look this matter straight in the face ; that they will 
     <lb/>
     lay aside every feeling except the good of their people, and try 
     <lb/>
     to see what is right, and that they will come back and say, 
     <lb/>
     'We have done our best, we have tried to be of one mind, and 
     <lb/>
     consideled what was best for now, and to-morrow, and the 
     <lb/>
     years that are to come when we have all passed away. This is 
     <lb/>
     our answer. We are very much in earnest about this matter.' 
     <lb/>
     The Chief said I was not very well, yet I am here. Why? 
     <lb/>
     Because the duty was laid upon me. I was afraid of the 
     <lb/>
     journey ; but when a Chief has a duty to do he tries to do it, 
     <lb/>
     and I felt that if I could do you any good, as I believed I 
     <lb/>
     could, I ought to be here. I tell you this, trust my words, 
     <lb/>
     they come from the heart of one who loves the Indian people, 
     <lb/>
     and who is charged by his Queen to tell them the words of 
     <lb/>
     truth."

     for you and for your children. When I met the Saulteaux last

     year we had not 4,000 there, but there were men like you who 
     <lb/>
     knew what was good for themselves, for their wives, for their 
     <lb/>
     children, and those not born. I gave to those who were there, 
     <lb/>
     and they took my hand and took what was in it, and I sent to 
     <lb/>
     those who were away, and I did for them just as I did for 
     <lb/>
     those who were present. It is the same to-day. What we are

     <lb/>
     What is good for you, what you think will be good for you

     will be good for them. It is for you to say, not for us ; we 
     <lb/>
     have done all that men who love their red brothers can do ; it 
     <lb/>
     is for you now to act, on you rests the duty of saying whether 
     <lb/>
     you believe our message or not, whether you want the Queen 
     <lb/>
     to help you or not, whether or not you will go away and let 
     <lb/>
     the days and the years go on, and let the food grow scarcer, and 
     <lb/>
     let your children grow up and do nothing to keep off the hunger 
     <lb/>
     and the cold that is before them. It is for you to say that, 
     <lb/>
     not for us; if we had not your good at heart we would not have

     been here, and we would not have labored these many days, if

     our hearts were not warm towards you, and if we did not

     away, and give you money every year afterwards, and help

     they understood that, and understood the full breadth and width 
     <lb/>
     of the Queen's goodness, they took what I offered, and I think 
     <lb/>
     if you are wise you will do the same."

     <lb break="yes"/>
     West Angle Treaty." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     LIEUT.-Gov. Morris—"Do we understand that you want 
     <lb/>
     the same terms which were given at the Lake of the Woods. 
     <lb/>
     (The Indians assented.) I have the Treaty here in a book. 
     <lb/>
     You must know that the steamboats had been running through 
     <lb/>
     their waters, and our soldiers had been marching through their 
     <lb/>
     country, and for that reason we offered the Ojibbeways a larger 
     <lb/>
     sum than we offered you. Last year it was a present, covering 
     <lb/>
     five years ; with you it was a present for this year only. I paid 
     <lb/>
     the Indians there a present in money down of twelve dollars 
     <lb/>
     per head. I have told you why we offered you less, and you 
     <lb/>
     will see there were reasons for it. That is the greatest differ<lb break="no"/>ence between what we offered you and what was paid them, 
     <lb/>
     but on the other hand there were some things promised you 
     <lb/>
     that were not given at the Lake of the Woods. (His Honor 
     <lb/>
     then explained the terms granted in that Treaty.) We 
     <lb/>
     promised there that the Queen would spend $1,500 per year to 
     <lb/>
     buy shot and powder, ball and twine. There were 4,000 of 
     

            <pb n="121"

            <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Qu'Appelle Treaty</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">121</fw> 
    
     them. I offered you $1,000 although you are only one-half 
     <lb/>
     the number, as I do not think you number more than 2,000. 
     <lb/>
     Your proportionate share would be $750 which you shallreceive. 
     <lb/>
     Then at the Lake of the Woods each Chief had their head men; 
     <lb/>
     we have said you would have four who shall have fifteen dol<lb break="no"/>lars each per year, and as at the Lake of the Woods each Chief 
     <lb/>
     and head man will receive a suit of clothing once in three 
     <lb/>
     years, and each Chief on signing the treaty will receive a medal 
     <lb/>
     and the promise of a flag. We cannot give you the flag now, 
     <lb/>
     as there were none to be bought at Red River, but we have 
     <lb/>
     the medals here. Now I have told you the terms we gave at 
     <lb/>
     the North-West Angle of the Lake of the Woods, and you 
     <lb/>
     will see that the only difference of any consequence between 
     <lb/>
     there and what we offered you is in the money payment that 
     <lb/>
     we give as a present, and I have told you why we made the 
     <lb/>
     difference, and you will see that it was just. We had to speak 
     <lb/>
     with them for four years that had gone away. We speak to 
     <lb/>
     you only for four days. It was not that we came in the spirit of 
     <lb/>
     traders, but because we were trying to do what was just 
     <lb/>
     between you and the Queen, and the other Indians who would 
     <lb/>
     say that we had treated you better than we had treated them 
     <lb/>
     because we put the children of this year on the same footing 
     <lb/>
     as these children through whose land we had been passing and 
     <lb/>
     running our steamboats for four years. You see when you ask 
     <lb/>
     us to tell you everything, we show you all that has been done, 
     <lb/>
     and I have to tell you again that the Ojibbeways at Lake 
     <lb/>
     Seul who number 400, when I sent a messenger this spring 
     <lb/>
     with a copy of those terms made at the North-West Angle 
     <lb/>
     with their nation, took the Queen's hand by my messenger and 
     <lb/>
     made the same treaty. I think I have told you all you want 
     <lb/>
     to know, and our ears are open again."

     LIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS—" I am afraid you are not talking

     <lb/>
     the terms given at the Lake of the Woods; you asked to know 
     <lb/>
     what they were, and the moment I told you, you ask three 
     <lb/>
     times as much for your children as I gave them. That would 
     <lb/>
     not be right; and it is well that you should know that we have 
     <lb/>
     not power to do so ; we can give you no more than we gave 
     <lb/>
     them. We hope you are satisfied. I have one word more to 
     <lb/>
     say, we are in the last hours of the day you asked us for and 
     <lb/>
     we must leave you. The utmost we can do, the furthest we 
     <lb/>
     can go or that we ought to go is, to do what you asked, to give 
     <lb/>
     you the terms granted last year at the Lake of the Woods. 
     <lb/>
     We can do no more, and you have our last words. It is

     you ready to accept the offer, the last offer we can make, you 
     <lb/>
     will see we have put you on the same footing as the Indians 
     <lb/>
     at the Lake of the Woods, and we think it is more than we 
     <lb/>
     ought to give, but rather than not close the matter we have 
     <lb/>
     given it, we have talked long enough about this. It is time

     we did something. Now I would ask, are the Crees and 
     <lb/>
     the Saulteaux and the other Indians ready to make the treaty 
     <lb/>
     with us. Since we went away we have had the treaty written 
     <lb/>
     out, and we are ready to have it signed, and we will leave a 
     <lb/>
     copy with any Chief you may select and after we leave we 
     <lb/>
     will have a copy written out on skin that cannot be rubbed 
     <lb/>
     out and put up in a tin box, so that it cannot be wet, so that

     you can keep it among yourselves so that when we are dead 
     <lb/>
    our children will know what was written." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>KAMOOSES—" Yes, we want each Chief to have a copy of 
     <lb/>the treaty, we ask that the Half-breeds may have the right of 
     <lb/>hunting." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     LIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS—" We will send a copy to each Chief. 
     <lb/>
     As to the Half-breeds, you need not be afraid ; the Queen will 
     <lb/>
     deal justly, fairly and generously with all her children." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Chiefs then signed the treaty, after having been assured 
     <lb/>
     that they would never be made ashamed of what they then 
     <lb/>
     did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One of the Chiefs on being asked to do so signed ; the second 
     <lb/>
     called on said he was promised the money when he signed, 
     <lb/>
     and returned to his seat without doing so. The Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Governor called him forward—held out his hand to him and 
     <lb/>
     said, take my hand ; it holds the money. If you can trust us 
     <lb/>
     forever you can do so for half an hour; sign the treaty. The 
     <lb/>
     Chief took the Governor's hands and touched the pen, and the 
     <lb/>
     others followed. As soon as the treaty was signed the Governor 
     <lb/>
     expressed the satisfaction of the Commissioners with the In<lb break="no"/>dians, and said that Mr. Christie and Mr. Dickieson, the Pri<lb break="no"/>vate Secretary of the Minister of the Interior, were ready to 
     <lb/>
     advance the money presents, but the Indians requested that 
     <lb/>
     the payment should be postponed till next morning, which was 
     <lb/>
     acceded to. The Chiefs then formally approached the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners and shook hands with them, after which the conference 
     <lb/>
     adjourned, the Commissioners leaving the place of meeting

     Report of the interview at Fort Ellice between the Indian

     Commissioners and certain Saulteaux Indians not present

     Lieut.-Governor Morris said he had been here before, and since 
     <lb/>
     that time he had met the Crees and Saulteaux nations, and had 
     <lb/>
     made a treaty with them. The Indians there were from Fort 
     <lb/>
     Pelly and as far distant as the Cypress Hills. He wished to 
     <lb/>
     know the number of the Saulteaux to be found in this locality.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Chief said there were about thirty tents who were not 
     <lb/>
     at Qu'Appelle, and ten who were there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     LIEUT.-Gov. MORRIS—The Commissioners here are represent<lb break="no"/>ing the Queen. I made a treaty with the Saulteaux last year at 
     <lb/>
     the Lake of the Woods. They were not a little handful; but 
     <lb/>
     there were 4,000 of them—and now we have made a treaty 
     <lb/>
     with the Crees and Saulteaux at Qu'Appelle. There is not much 
     <lb/>
     need to say much—it is good for the Indians to make treaties 
     <lb/>
     with the Queen—good for them and their wives and children. 
     <lb/>
     Game is getting scarce and the Queen is willing to help her 
     <lb/>
     children. Now we are ready to give you what we gave the 
     <lb/>
     Saulteaux at the Lake of the Woods and the Saulteaux and 
     <lb/>
     Crees at Qu'Appelle. It will be for you to say whether you 
     <lb/>
     will accept it or not." His Honor then explained the treaty 
     <lb/>
     to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     " What we offer will be for your good, as it will help you, and

     not prevent you from hunting.
