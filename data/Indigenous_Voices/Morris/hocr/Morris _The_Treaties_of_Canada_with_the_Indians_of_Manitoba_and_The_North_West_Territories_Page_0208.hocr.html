               <br />
               which were already promised. You are like other Indians I 
               <br />
               have met, you can ask very well. You are right in asking, 
               <br />
               because you are saying what is in your minds. I have had 
               <br />
               taken down a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">list</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span> you have asked, and I will now con- 
               <br />
               sult with my brother Commissioners and give you my answer

               After consultation, the Governor again had the Indians 
               <br />
               assembled, and said—“ 1 am ready now to answer you, but 
               <br />
               understand well, it is not to be talked backwards and forwards. 
               <br />
               I am not going to act like a man bargaining for a horse for 
               <br />
               you. I have considered well what you have asked for, and 
               <br />
               my answer will be a ﬁnal one. I cannot grant everything you 
               <br />
               ask, but as far as I can go I will, and when done I can only 
               <br />
               say you will be acting to your own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests</span> if you take my

               “I will speak of what you asked yesterday and to-day. I 
               <br />
               told you yesterday that if any great sickness or general famine 
               <br />
               overtook you, that on the Queen being informed of it by her 
               <br />
               Indian agent, she in her goodness would give such help as she 
               <br />
               thought the Indians needed. You asked for help when you 
               <br />
               settled on your reserves during the time you were planting. 
               <br />
               You asked very broadly at ﬁrst. I think the request you make 
               <br />
               now is reasonable to a certain extent; but help should be given 
               <br />
               after you settle on the reserve for three years only, for after 
               <br />
               that time you should have food of your own raising, besides
