               N the year 1871 the Privy Council of Canada issued a joint 
               <br />
               I commission to Messrs. W. M. Simpson, S. J. Dawson and 
               <br />
               W. J. Pether, authorizing them to treat with the Ojibbeway 
               <br />
               Indians for the surrender to the Crown of the lands they in- 
               <br />
               habited—covering the area from the watershed of Lake Superior 
               <br />
               to the north-west angle of the Lake of the \Voods, and from the 
               <br />
               American border to the height of land from which the streams 
               <br />
               ﬂow towards the Hudson’s Bay. This step had become neces- 
               <br />
               sary in order to make the route known as “the Dawson route,” 
               <br />
               extending from Prince Arthur’s Landing on Lake Superior to 
               <br />
               the north-west angle of the Lake of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Voods,</span> which was then 
               <br />
               being opened up, “secure for the passage of emigrants and of 
               <br />
               the people of the Dominion generally,” and also to enable the

               land which might be susceptible of improvement and proﬁtable 
               <br />
               occupation. The Commissioners accepted the appointment, and 
               <br />
               in July, 1871, met the Indians at Fort Francis.

               The tribes preferred claims for right of way through their 
               <br />
               country. The Commissioners reported “that they had admitted 
               <br />
               these to a limited extent and had made them presents in pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               in money, it being fully and distinctly understood by the 
               <br />
               Indians that these presents and clothing were accepted by them 
               <br />
               as an equivalent for all past claims whatever.” The Commis-
