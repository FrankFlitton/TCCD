               here the money if we understand each other. Now, we ask 
               <br />
               you again, are you wiser than your brothers that I have seen 
               <br />
               before? I do not think that you will say you are, but we 
               <br />
               want you to take away our last trouble. What I ﬁnd strange 
               <br />
               is this: we are Chiefs; we have delivered the message of our 
               <br />
               great Queen, whose words never change, whose tongue and 
               <br />
               the tongues of whose messengers are never forked ; and how is 
               <br />
               it that we have not heard any voice back from the Crees or 
               <br />
               Saulteaux, or from their Chiefs? I see before me two Chiefs ; 
               <br />
               we know them to be Chiefs, because we see you put them 
               <br />
               before you to shake hands with us. They must have been 
               <br />
               made Chiefs, not for anything we are talking about to-day, not 
               <br />
               for any presents we are offering to you, not because of the 
               <br />
               land ; then why are they chiefs? Because I see they are old 
               <br />
               men ; the winds of many winters have whistled through their 
               <br />
               branches. I think they must have learned wisdom ; the words 
               <br />
               of the old are wise ; why then, we ask ourselves—and this is 
               <br />
               our trouble—Why are your Chiefs dumb? They can speak. 
               <br />
               One of them is called “Loud Voice.” He must have been 
               <br />
               heard in the councils of the nation. Then I ask myself, why 
               <br />
               do they not answer? It cannot be that you are afraid; you 
               <br />
               are not women. In this country, now, no man need be afraid. 
               <br />
               If a white man does wrong to an Indian, the Queen will 
               <br />
               punish them. The other day at Fort Ellice, a white man, it is 
               <br />
               said, stole some furs from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lidian.</span> The Queen’s policemen 
               <br />
               took him at once; sent him down to Red River, and he is 
               <br />
               lying in jail now ; and if the Indians prove that he did wrong, 
               <br />
               he will be punished. You see then that if the white man 
               <br />
               does wrong to the Indian he will punished ; and it will be the 
               <br />
               same if the Indian does wrong to the white man. The red 
               <br />
               and white man must live together, and be good friends, and 
               <br />
               the Indians must live together like brothers with each other 
               <br />
               and the white man. I am afraid you are weary of my talking. 
               <br />
               Why do I talk so much? Because I have only your good at 
               <br />
               heart. 1 do not want to go away with my head down, to send 
               <br />
