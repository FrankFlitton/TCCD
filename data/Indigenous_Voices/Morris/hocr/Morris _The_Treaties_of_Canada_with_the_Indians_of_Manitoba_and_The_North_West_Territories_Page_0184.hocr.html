               boines to speak for them. I explained to him what had been done at Carl-

               <br />
               talk to me. I then said we would not remove until the next day, which

               On the 13th, Sweet Grass and all the other Chiefs and Councillors came

               <br />
               were as a barrier before what he would have to say.

               Let there be no barrier, as it is with great difﬁculty that this was brought

               when I heard he was to come, I said I will request him to save me from 
               <br />
               what I most dread—hanging ; it was not given to us to have the rope about 
               <br />
               our necks.” I replied, that God had given it to 11s to punish murder by 
               <br />
               death, and explained the protection the police force afforded the Indians.
