               earth,” to use their own phraseology. A Chief at Fort Pitt 
               <br />
               said to me,—“I got a plough from Mr. Christie of the Com- 
               <br />
               pany twelve years ago. I have no cattle; I put myself and 
               <br />
               my young men in front of it in the spring, and drag it through 
               <br />
               the ground. I have no hoes; I make them out of the roots 
               <br />
               of trees. Surely, when the Great Mother hears of our needs, 
               <br />
               she will come to our help.”* Such a disposition as this should 
               <br />
               be encouraged. Induce the Indians to erect houses on their 
               <br />
               farms, and plant their “ gardens ” as they call them, and then 
               <br />
               while away on their hunts, their wives and children will have 
               <br />
               houses to dwell in, and will care for their patches of corn and 
               <br />
               grain and potatoes. Then, too, the cattle given them will ex- 
               <br />
               pand into herds. It is true that the number assigned to each 
               <br />
               band is comparatively limited, and the Government are not 
               <br />
               bound to extend the number. This was done ad\ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">isedly,</span> by the 
               <br />
               successive Governments of Canada, and the Commissioners, 
               <br />
               acting under their instructions; for it was felt, that it was 
               <br />
               an experiment to entrust them with cattle, owing to their in- 
               <br />
               experience with regard to housing them and providing fodder 
               <br />
               for them in winter, and owing, moreover, to the danger of 
               <br />
               their using them for food, if short of buffalo meat or game. 
               <br />
               Besides, it was felt, that as the Indian is, and naturally so, 
               <br />
               always asking, it was better, that if the Government saw their 
               <br />
               way safely to increase the number of cattle given to any band, 
               <br />
               it should be, not as a matter of right, but of grace and favor, 
               <br />
               and as a reward for exertion‘ in the care of them, and as an in- 
               <br />
               centive to industry. Already, the prospect of many of the 
               <br />
               bands turning their attention to raising food from the soil is 
               <br />
               very hopeful. In the reserve of St. Peter’s, in Manitoba, the 
               <br />
               Church of England has for many years had a church and mis- 
               <br />
               sion, and long before the advent of Canada as ruler of the 
               <br />
               lands, the Indians of the Indian settlement had their houses and 
               <br />
               gardens, the produce of which, went to supplement the results of
