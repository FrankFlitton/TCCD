               to undertake it, and then to the Crees, who listened to it in 
               <br />
               silence. One of them at length arose, and pointing to the 
               <br />
               River Saskatchewan, said, “Can you stop the ﬂow of that river?” 
               <br />
               The answer was, “No,” and the rejoinder was “No more can 
               <br />
               you stop the progress of the Queen’s Chief.” When the Com- 
               <br />
               missioners arrived at the Saskatchewan, a messenger from the 
               <br />
               Crees met them, proffering a safe convoy, but it was not needed. 
               <br />
               About a hundred traders’ carts were assembled at the crossing, 
               <br />
               and Kissowayis, a native Indian trader, had the right of pas- 
               <br />
               sage, which he at once waived, in favor of Messrs. Christie and 
               <br />
               Morris, the Commissioners. The other Commissioner. Mr. 
               <br />
               McKay, met them at Duck Lake next day, having proceeded by 
               <br />
               another route, and there they encountered Chief Beardy, who at 
               <br />
               once asked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the:</span> Lieutenant-Governor to make the treaty at the 
               <br />
               hill, near the lake. On his guard, however, he replied, that he 
               <br />
               would meet the Cree nation wherever they desired, but must 
               <br />
               ﬁrst go on and see them at Carlton, as he had appointed. An 
               <br />
               escort of Mounted Police also met the Commissioners at Duck 
               <br />
               Lake, having been sent from Carlton, in consequence of the 
               <br />
               information given by the Crees of the threatened interference 
               <br />
               with their progress. After several days’ delay the Commissioners 
               <br />
               were obliged to meet the Crees without the Willow Crees. But 
               <br />
               after the conference had opened, the Beardy sent a message 
               <br />
               asking to be informed of the terms the Commissioners intended 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> in advance. The reply was that the messenger could 
               <br />
               sit with the other Indians, and report to his Chief what he 
               <br />
               heard, as it was his own fault that the Chief was not there to 
               <br />
               take part in the proceedings. The negotiations <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then</span> went on 
               <br />
               quietly and deliberately, the Commissioners giving the Indians 
               <br />
               all the time they desired. The Indians were apprehensive of 
               <br />
               their future. They saw the food supply, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buffalo,</span> passing 
               <br />
               away, and they were anxious and distressed. They knew the 
               <br />
               large terms granted to their Indians by the United States, 
               <br />
               but they had conﬁdence in their Great Mother, the Queen, 
               <br />
               and her benevolence. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span>
