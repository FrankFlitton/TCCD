               children. Often when I thought of the future of the Indian 
               <br />
               my heart was sad within me. I saw that the large game was 
               <br />
               getting scarcer and scarcer, and I feared that the Indians would 
               <br />
               melt away like snow in spring before the sun. It was my

               planted and wood cut for more houses. Understand me, I do

               not want to interfere with your hunting and ﬁshing. I want

               you to pursue it through the country, as you have heretofore
