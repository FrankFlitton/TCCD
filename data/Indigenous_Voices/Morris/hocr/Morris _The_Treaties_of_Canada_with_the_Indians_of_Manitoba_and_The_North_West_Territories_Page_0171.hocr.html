               the ﬁrst stage of the journey to Fort Carlton, about two hundred and 
               <br />
               twenty miles. After crossing the river, I was overtaken by a party of the 
               <br />
               Sioux who have settled on the reserve assigned to them at Bird Tail Creek, 
               <br />
               and was detained the greater part of the day.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I am sanguine that this settlement will prove a success, as these Sioux 
               <br />
               are diaplaying a laudable industry in cutting hay for their own use and for 
               <br />
               sale, and in breaking up ground for cultivation. I resumed my journey in 
               <br />
               the afternoon, but a storm coming on, I was obliged to encamp at the 
               <br />
               Springs, having only travelled eight miles in all during the day. 
               <br />

               On the 5th I left the Springs, and after traversing much ﬁne country, 
               <br />
               with excellent prairie, good soil, clumps of wood, lakelets, and hay 
               <br />
               swamps, in the Little and Great Touchwood Hills and File Mountain 
               <br />
               region, I arrived at the South Saskatchewan, at Dumont’s crossing, twenty 
               <br />
               miles from Fort Carlton, on the afternoon of the 14th of August.

               Here I found over one hundred carts of traders and freighters, waiting to 
               <br />
               be ferried across the river. The scow was occupied in crossing the carts 
               <br />
               and effects of Kis-so-wais, an enterprising Chippewa trader, belonging to 
               <br />
               the Portage la Prairie band, who at once came forward and gave up to me 
               <br />
               his right of crossing. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I met, also, a young Cree who had been sent by the Crees to hand me a 
               <br />
               letter of welcome in the name of their nation. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The reason of this step being taken was, that a few wandering Saulteaux 
               <br />
               or Chippewa, from Quill Lake, in Treaty Number Four, had come to the 
               <br />
               Crees and proposed to them to unite with them and prevent me from cros- 
               <br />
               sing the river and entering the Indian country. The Crees promptly re- 
               <br />
               fused to entertain the proposal, and sent a messenger, as above stated, to 
               <br />
               welcome me. '

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I also received from their messenger a letter from Lawrence Clarke, Esq., 
               <br />
               Chief Factor of the Hudson’s Bay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Company</span> at Carlton, offering the Com-

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I sent replies in advance, thanking the Crees for their action, and accept- 
               <br />
               ing the kind offer of Mr. Clarke, to the extent of the use of rooms in the

               It was late in the evening before our party crossed the river, so that we 
               <br />
               encamped on the heights near it. 
               <br />

               On the morning of the 15th we left for Fort Carlton, Mr. Christie pre- 
               <br />
               ceding me to announce my approaching arrival at Duck Lake. About 
               <br />
               twelve miles from Carlton I found the Hon. James McKay awaiting me, 
               <br />
               having travelled by way of Fort Pelly. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Here also a Chief, Beardy of the Willow Crees, came to see me.

               He said that his people were encamped near the lake, and that as there 
               <br />
               were ﬁne meadows for their horses they wished the treaty to be made there. 
               <br />

               I was at once on my guard, and replied to him, that after I reached 
               <br />
               Carlton, which was the place appointed, I would meet the Indians where- 
               <br />
               ever the great body of them desired it.
