               pation of the advent of Canadian power. He made a lease for three years 
               <br />
               of their rights, assuring them that before that time the Canadian Govern- 
               <br />
               ment would make a treaty with them and recognize the temporary arrange- 
               <br />
               ment, and in consquence the settlers were unmolested. The question was 
               <br />
               not raised at the “ Stone Fort ” Treaty, and I told them I had not known 
               <br />
               of it before, but supposed the Government would hold that the treaty had 
               <br />
               covered it, and that the extra two dollars would compensate for it, but that 
               <br />
               I would represent their views and give them an answer. They complained 
               <br />
               of the mode of payment, as my predecessor assured them that their child- 
               <br />
               ren who were absent should be paid when they presented themselves, and 
               <br />
               that they only got two years payment instead of the full amount. As these 
               <br />
               were Mr. Provencher’s instructions I promised to report it. They express- 
               <br />
               ed themselves quite satisfied with the arrangements as to the outside pro- 
               <br />
               mises, and would gladly accept of it, if the reserve question was settled, but 
               <br />
               that they could not receive that as surveyed. I took the opportunity of ex- 
               <br />
               plaining to them that the “President of the United States ” had no power 
               <br />
               here, and that the Queen and Her Councillors were the only authorities 
               <br />
               they had to deal with, and that I would state their wishes as fullv as 
               <br />
               they could do themselves. They asked if I would come back, but I said 
               <br />
               not this year, but next year either I or some other Commissioner would 
               <br />
               meet them. Eventually they cheerfully agreed to accept the three dollars 
               <br />
               annuity as usual, and to defer a ﬁnal adjustment of the question between us 
               <br />
               until next year, and promised to accompany any one I sent to select the 
               <br />
               reserve and agree on its locality. They again thanked me for my kindness 
               <br />
               and patience with them, and I took leave of them. I regard the result as 
               <br />
               very satisfactory, as I left the band contented, and you are aware of their 
               <br />
               intimate relation with the “Plain Indians,” and the difﬁculty their mes- 
               <br />
               sage to Qn’Appelle, “ that the white man had not kept his promises,‘.” 
               <br />
               caused us then, and it is very important that they should be satisﬁed. I re- 
               <br />
               turned to the Portage, and Mr. Provencher proceeded to Totogan, and paid 
               <br />
               the White Mud section of the band, numbering one hundred and thirty, 
               <br />
               who are nominally included in it, but do not recognize Yellow Quill’s 
               <br />
               authority, the usual annuities, which they accepted without demur. 
               <br />
               I would now make the following recommendations : 
               <br />
               1st. That you should write to Yellow Quill declining to entertain his 
               <br />
               demands for the large reserve, but offering to them a reserve including the 
               <br />
               “ Eagle’s Nest” on the north side of the river, and laid off in the terms of 
               <br />
               the treaty, with the land comprised in the one hundred and sixty acres for 
               <br />
               each family, surrounded by the belt mentioned in the treaty, in the manner 
               <br />
               suggested in the enclosed rough sketch “B, ” reserving the rights of navi- 
               <br />
               gation and access to the river. The land is of inferior quality to that 
               <br />
               already offered them. 
               <br />
               2nd. I would propose that the young chief should be recognized as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">head</span> of 
               <br />
               the section of the band adhering to him. He and his section are ready to 
               <br />
               accept the terms and the reserve as described in the treaty. Theybehaved 
               <br />
