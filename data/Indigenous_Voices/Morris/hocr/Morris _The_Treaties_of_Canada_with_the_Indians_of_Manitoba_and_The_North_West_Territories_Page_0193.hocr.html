               Let me give you a proof it. Years ago there was war between 
               <br />
               the British and the Americans; there wasa great battle ; there 
               <br />
               were two brave Chief warriors on the British side, one were 
               <br />
               the red coat, the other dressed as you do, but they fought 
               <br />
               side by side as brothers ; the one was Brock and the other was 
               <br />
               Teeumseth whose memory will never die; the blood of both 
               <br />
               watered the ground; the bones of Tecumseth were hid by his 
               <br />
               friends ; the remains of Brock by his, and now a great pile of 
               <br />
               stone stands up toward heaven in his memory. And now the 
               <br />
               white man is searching for the remains of Tecumseth, and when 
               <br />
               found they will build another monument in honour of the Indian.

               <br />
               the whites are as much your friends in these days of peace, as

               <br />
               the Grand Council of the Six Nation Indians was held a month 
               <br />
               ago; they now number six thousand souls. They met to thank 
               <br />
               the Queen and to say that they were content, and why are they 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">content?</span> Because many years ago the Queen’s Councillors saw 
               <br />
               that the Indians that would come after, must be cared for, they 
               <br />
               saw that the means of living were passing away from the 
               <br />
               Indians, they knew that women and children were sometimes 
               <br />
               without food ; they sent men to speak to the Indians, they said 
               <br />
               your children must be educated, they must be taught to raise 
               <br />
               food for themselves. The Indians heard them, the Councillors 
               <br />
               gave them seed, land, food, taught their children and let them 
               <br />
