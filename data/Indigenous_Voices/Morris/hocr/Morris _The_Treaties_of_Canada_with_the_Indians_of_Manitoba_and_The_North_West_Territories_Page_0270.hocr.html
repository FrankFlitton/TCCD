               ported to the Council, that the main body of the Sioux on the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the settlement, but in the summer of 1866, the advice 
               <br />
               was disregarded. A band of Sioux came to Fort Garry 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the settlement from the United States, and ﬁve of them were 
               <br />

               The Council apprehended that the Sioux might congregate

               <br />
