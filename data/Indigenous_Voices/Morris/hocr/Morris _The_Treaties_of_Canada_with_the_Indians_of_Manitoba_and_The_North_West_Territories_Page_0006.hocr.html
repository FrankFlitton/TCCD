               The chiefs from Lake Superior desired to treat separately for their terri-

               that I would have the treaty ready on the following morning, and I immedi- 
               <br />
               ately proceeded to prepare it; and, as agreed upon, they signed it cheerfully 
               <br />
               at the time appointed.

               I then told the chiefs from Lake Huron (who were all present when the

               others signed) that I should have a similar treaty ready for their signature, 
               <br />
               the next morning, when those who signed it would receive their money ; and 
               <br />
               that as a large majority of them had agreed to my terms I should abide by

               I accordingly prepared the treaty and proceeded on the morning of the

               <br />
               ence of proper witnesses—all the chiefs and others were present. I told them 
               <br />
               I was then ready to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rbceive</span> their signatures; the two chiefs, Shinguacouse 
               <br />
               and Nebennigoebing, repeated their demand of ten dollars a head by way of 
               <br />
               annuity, and also insisted that I should insert in the treaty a condition 
               <br />
               securing to some sixty half-breeds a free grant of one hundred acres of land 
               <br />
               each. I told them they already had my answer as to a larger annuity, and 
               <br />
               that I had no power to give them free grants of land. The other chiefs came 
               <br />
               forward to sign the treaty and seeing this the two who had resisted up to this 
               <br />
               time also came to the table and signed ﬁrst, the rest immediately following.
