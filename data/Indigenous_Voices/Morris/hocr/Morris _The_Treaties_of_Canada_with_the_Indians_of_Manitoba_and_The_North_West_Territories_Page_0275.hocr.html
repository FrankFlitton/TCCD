               ever taken, and messengers sent to them, by the Lieuten-

               Turtle Mountains, and another large party in the bounds of 
               <br />
               the Qu’Appelle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Treaty.‘</span> In 1876 the latter sent their Chiefs to

               <br />

               case would be represented to the Canadian authorities. In 
               <br />
               1877, the Sioux at the Turtle Mountains, sent two deputations
