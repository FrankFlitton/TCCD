               wants to care for them all. Last year I was among the Saul- 
               <br />
               teaux ; we have the Saulteaux where I came from. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> They were 
               <br />
               my friends. I was the son of a white Chief who had a high 
               <br />
               place among them, they told him they would do his work, they 
               <br />
               called him Shekcisheik. I learned from him to love the red man, 
               <br />
               and it was a pleasant duty and good to my heart when the 
               <br />
               Queen told me to come among her Saulteaux children <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and.</span> I 
               <br />
               expect the Crees and the Saulteaux to take my hand as they did 
               <br />
               last year. In our hands they feel the Queen’s, and if they take 
               <br />
               them the hands of the white and red man will never unclasp. 
               <br />
               In other lands the white and red man are not such friends as 
               <br />
               we have always been, and why? Because the Queen always 
               <br />
               keeps her word, always protects her red men. She learned last 
               <br />
               winter that bad men from the United States had come into her 
               <br />
               country and had killed some of her red children, What did 
               <br />
               she say? This must not be, I will send my men and will not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffer</span> these bad men to hurt my red children, their lives are 
               <br />
               very dear to me. And now I will tell you our message. The 
               <br />
               Queen knows that her red children often ﬁnd it hard to live. 
               <br />
               She knows that her red children, their wives and children, are 
               <br />
               often hungry, and that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buffalo</span> will not last for ever and she 
               <br />
               desires to do something for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theta.</span> More than a hundred years 
               <br />
               ago, the Queen’s father said to the red men living in Q <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'ebec</span> 
               <br />
               and Ontario, I will give you land and cattle and set apart 
               <br />
               Reserves for you, and will teach you. What has been the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">result?</span> There the red men are happy; instead of getting fewer 
               <br />
               in number by sickness they are growing in number ; their chil- 
               <br />
               dren have plenty. The Queen wishes you to enjoy the same 
               <br />
               blessings, and so I am here to tell you all the Queen’s mind, 
               <br />
               but recollect this, the Queen’s High Councillor here from 
               <br />
               Ottawa, and I, her Governor, are not traders ; we do not come 
               <br />
               here in the spirit of traders ; we come here to tell you 
               <br />
               openly, without hiding anything, just what the Queen will do 
               <br />
               for you, just what she thinks is good for you, and I want you 
               <br />
               to look me in the face, eye to eye, and open your hearts to me
