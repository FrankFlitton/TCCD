               <br />
               directed to proceed to the Dog Head Point and Berens River, on Lake Winni-

               With afair wind and ﬁne weather we reached the Narrows on Monday 
               <br />
               afternoon, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">24th,</span> at half-past four. Mr. Howard called at the Hud- 
               <br />
               son’s Bay Company’s post to see about the provisions stored there, where he 
               <br />
               found Thickfoot and the J ack-Fish Head Indians encamped, about twenty- 
               <br />
               ﬁve families in all, and learned from them that they were desirous to meet 
               <br />
               and speak to us where they were, and not across the Narrows at the Dog 
               <br />
               Head ; but as the place of meeting was distinctly ﬁxed, Mr. Howard 
               <br />
               informed them that they would have to move their camps.

               <br />
               with Mr. Howard’s arrival there, the Indians belonging to Thickfoot and the

               <br />
               representative from all the bands except Thickfoot’s, and they desired to 
               <br />
               know when we would be prepared to have a conference; and, having told 
               <br />
               them that the following day, the 25th, was the day appointed, and that we 
               <br />
               would meet them at eleven o’clock in the morning, we gave them some pro- 
               <br />
               visions and they withdrew. Thickfoot subsequently called upon us and 
               <br />
               stated that he was prepared at any time to meet us and sign the treaty, 
               <br />
               that he had learned that it was our intention to make only one Chief for all 
               <br />
               the Indians gathered there ; that he had felt when the paper was placed in 
               <br />
               his hands last year by the Governor, that he was making him the Chief ; 
               <br />
               that he had notiﬁed all the Indians that were there as he had agreed, and 
               <br />
               that they had threatened him with violence for saying he was to be Chief, 
               <br />
               and that he was afraid now to join them in any way, and that he and his 
               <br />
               band wished to be spoken to by themselves. Upon hearing this, we informed 
               <br />
               him that he need not be afraid of violence, that the paper the Governor 
               <br />
               gave him merely stated that he was a principal Indian, and we would cer- 
               <br />
               tainly recognize him as such, and if the Indians desired him to be their Chief 
               <br />
               it would be a great pleasure to us.
