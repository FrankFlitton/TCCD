               The meeting was ppened by the Lieut.-Governor, who said, 
               <br />
               “Crees and Saulteaux,—I have asked you to meet us here to- 
               <br />
               day. We have been asking you for many days to meet us and 
               <br />
               this is the ﬁrst time you have all met us. If it was not my 
               <br />
               duty and if the Queen did not wish it, I would not have taken 
               <br />
               so much trouble to speak to you. We are sent a long way to 
               <br />
               give you her message. Yesterday I told the Crees her message, 
               <br />
               and I know that the Saulteaux know what it was, but that there 
               <br />
               may be no mistake, I will tell it to you again and I will tell 
               <br />
               you more. When I have given my message understand that 
               <br />
               you will have to answer it, as I and my friends will have to 
               <br />
               leave you. You are the subjects of the Queen, you are her 
               <br />
               children, and you are only a little band to all her other children. 
               <br />
               She has children all over the world. and she does right with 
               <br />
               them all. She cares as much for you as she cares for her white 
               <br />
               children, and the proof of it is that wherever her name is spoken 
               <br />
               her people whether they be red or white, love her name and are 
               <br />
               ready to die for it, because she is always just and true. What 
               <br />
               she promises never changes. She knows the condition of her 
               <br />
               people here ; you are not her only red children ; where I come 
               <br />
               from, in Ontario and in Quebec, she has many red children, and 
               <br />
               away beyond the mountains she has other red children, and she
