               <br />
               Company, and on default of payment of a ﬁne, had been sent to 
               <br />
               prison. The Lieutenant-Governor, as a matter of favor, ordered 
               <br />
               the release of these prisoners, and the sky became clear. Next 
               <br />
               day the Indians met again and declared that they would never 
               <br />
               again raise their voice against the enforcement of the law, but 
               <br />
               much difﬁculty was experienced in getting them to understand

               <br />
               of the Province as a reserve. Eventually on the 3rd of August, 
               <br />
               1871, a treaty was concluded, its principal features being the 
               <br />
               relinquishment to Her Majesty of the Indian title; the reserving 
               <br />
               of tracts of land for the Indians, sufﬁcient to furnish 160 acres 
               <br />
               of land to each family of ﬁve ,' providing for the maintenance of 
               <br />
               schools, and prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors on the 
               <br />
               reserves ; a present of three dollars per head to the Indians and 
               <br />
               the payment to them of an annuity of three dollars per bead.* 
               <br />

               <br />
               disposed to accept the terms of the treaty made at the Stone 
               <br />
               Fort, with which they had already become familiar, so that 
               <br />
               little time was lost in effecting a treaty with them as they had
