               the Governor and Commissioners turn their backs on you than 
               <br />
               some of you will say this thing and that thing was promised

               <br />

               from here it must be understood, and it must be in writing, all 
               <br />
               that you are promised by the Governor and Commissioners, and 
               <br />
               I hope you will not leave until you have thoroughly understood

               you, and we are not here to make peace as we would to hostile 
               <br />
               Indians, because you are the children of the Great Queen as we

               GOVERNOR—“I have another word to say to the Indians on 
               <br />
               this matter: last year an unforeseen calamity came upon the 
               <br />
               people of Red River, the grasshoppers came and ate all their 
               <br />
               crops. There is no treaty between the people of Red River 
               <br />
               and ihe Queen except that they are her subjects. There was 
               <br />
               no promise to help them, but I sent down and said that unless 
               <br />
               help came some of the people would die from want of food, and 
               <br />
               that they had nothing wherewith to plant. The Queen’ s 
               <br />
               Councillors at once gave money to feed the people, and seed 
               <br />
               that they might plant the ground; but that was something out 
               <br />
               of and beyond every-day life, and therefore 1 say that some 
               <br />
               great sickness or famine stands as a special case. You may 
               <br />
               rest assured that when you go to your reserves you will be 
               <br />
               followed by the watchful eye and sympathetic hand of the 
               <br />
               Queen’s Councillors.”
