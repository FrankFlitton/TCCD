               each other, and when there is something troubles us, I believe 
               <br />
               in telling it. When you told us you were troubled about the 
               <br />
               situation of this tent, we had it moved. Now we want you to 
               <br />
               take away our trouble, or tell us what you mean. We are 
               <br />
               troubled about this. We are servants of the Queen ; we have 
               <br />
               been here many days giving you our message, and we have not 
               <br />
               yet heard the voice of the nations. We have two nations here. 
               <br />
               We have the Crees, who were here ﬁrst, and we have the 
               <br />
               Ojibbeways, who came from our country not many suns ago. 
               <br />
               We ﬁnd them here ; we won’t say they stole the land and the 
               <br />
               stones and the trees; no, but we will say this, that we believe 
               <br />
               their brothers, the Crees, said to them when they came in here: 
               <br />
               “The land is wide, it is wide, it is big enough for us both ; let 
               <br />
               us live here like Brothers ;” and that is what you say, as you 
               <br />
               told us on Saturday, as to the Half-breeds that I see around. 
               <br />
               You say that you are one with them ; now we want all to be 
               <br />
               one. We know no difference between Crees and Ojibbeways. 
               <br />
               Now we want to ask you are you wiser, do you know more, 
               <br />
               than the Ojibbeway people that I met last year? You are a 
               <br />
               handful compared with them ; they came to me from the Lake 
               <br />
               of the Woods, from Rainy Lake, from the Kaministiquia, and 
               <br />
               from the Great Lake. I told them my message, as I have 
               <br />
               told you ; they heard my words and they said they were good, 
               <br />
               and they took my hand and I gave them mine and the presents ; 
               <br />
               but that is not all. There was a band of Ojibbeways who 
               <br />
               lived at Lake Seul, to the north of the Lake of the Woods, 
               <br />
               400 in number, and just before we came away we sent our 
               <br />
               messenger to them. He told them I had shaken hands for 
               <br />
               the Queen with all the Ojibbeways down to the Great Lake. 
               <br />
               He told them what we had done for these, and asked them if 
               <br />
               they found it good to take the .Queen’s hand through our 
               <br />
               messenger; they were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pleased;</span> they signed the treaty; they 
               <br />
               put their names to it, saying, We take what you promised to 
               <br />
               the other Saulteaux ; and our messenger gave them the money, 
               <br />
               just as our messengers will give your brothers who are not 
               <br />
