               “ The presence of Sitting Bull and his warriors in Canada is 
               <br />
               a source of anxiety both to the Government of Canada and the 
               <br />
               United States. These Indians harbor feelings of ﬁerce hostility 
               <br />
               towards, and thorough distrust of, the United States people and 
               <br />
               Government. These feelings may be traced to two principal 
               <br />
               causes, the dishonesty of Indian agents and the failure of the 
               <br />
               Federal authorities to protect the Indian reservations from being 
               <br />
               taken possession of by an adventurous and somewhat lawless 
               <br />
               white population. The oﬂicers of the North—West Mounted 
               <br />
               Police have been instructed to impress upon Sitting Bull and 
               <br />
               his warriors the necessity of keeping the peace towards the 
               <br />
               people of the United States, and there is no reason fo. suppos-

               ing they will not heed the warnings which have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> given

               them. It is not, however, desirable to encourage them to 
               <br />
               remain on Canadian territory, and Col. McLeod has been 
               <br />
               accordingly instructed to impress them with their probable 
               <br />
               future hardships after the failure of the buffalo, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> they

               <br />
               States and his Cabinet are upright men, willing and anxious to 
               <br />
               do justice to the Indians; and should they return peacefully 
               <br />
               they will be properly cared for, and any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trepiy</span> made with them 
               <br />
               will be honestly fulﬁlled. It is desirable that as wards of the 
               <br />
               United States they should return to that country, upon the 
               <br />

               <br />
               responsibility of their civilization.”
