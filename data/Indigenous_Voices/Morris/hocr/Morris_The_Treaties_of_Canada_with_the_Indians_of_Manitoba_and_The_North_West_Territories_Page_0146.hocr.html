               At three o’clock <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pm,</span> we were notiﬁed that the Indians had again gath- 
               <br />
               ered, when we proceeded to the place of meeting, and were presented 
               <br />
               to the Chief and two of his Councillors. Ka-tuk-e-pin-ais, the third Coun- 
               <br />
               cillor, coming forward, said his band did not want him to act as Councillor; 
               <br />
               that he had seen the Governor the other day, and had been told by him that 
               <br />
               he would be the Chief of the Island Indians. VVhereupon we informed him 
               <br />
               that no such promise had been made by you, and that we could only recog- 
               <br />
               nize the choice of the majority. He then desired to withdraw from the 
               <br />
               negotiations, and wait until he saw you, before signing the treaty ; but as 
               <br />
               we had learned that out of the twenty-two families that were in his 
               <br />
               band, all, with one or two exceptions, had received the annuity since 1870, 
               <br />
               with the St. Peter’s Band, we made them sit by themselves, and then 
               <br />
               explained that by receiving the annuity as a large number of them had done, 
               <br />
               they had really agreed to the treaty, and that we were there only to deal 
               <br />
               with those of the band that had at no time received money from the Queen. 
               <br />
               Ka-tuk-e-pin-ais then said that there were very few of his Indians that had 
               <br />
               not received money from the Queen, but that he never had ; that he was 
               <br />
               quite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared</span> to sign the treaty now, only some of his people did not want 
               <br />
               him to do so, unless we agreed to give them the Big Island for a reserve. 
               <br />
               This we at once refused. and at the same time told them that unless he and 
               <br />
               all his band agreed to the terms we offeredthem without further delay, they 
               <br />
               might return to their homes. Hearing this, they all withdrew, but soon 
               <br />
               returned, when Ka-tuk-e-pin-ais said one or two of his pcople did not want 
               <br />
               .him to sign any treaty, but most of them did, and that he was going to do 
               <br />
               so. He then took his seat along with the Chiefs and other Councillors, and 
               <br />
               we proceeded to explain the terms of the treaty. When we came to the 
               <br />
               clause referring to the reserves, each band was anxious that the places where 
               <br />
               they are in the habit of living should be granted them as reserves, and the 
               <br />
               locations of the same mentioned in the treaty ; but as our instructions were 
               <br />
               positive on this point, we refused, but assured them that the names of the 
               <br />
               places they asked for, we would certainly forward with our report to you, 
               <br />
               and we stated that with the exception of the location asked for by the 
               <br />
               Sandy Bar Indians, we felt sure the Government would grant their request, 
               <br />
               and give them their reserves where they desired. The following were the 
               <br />
