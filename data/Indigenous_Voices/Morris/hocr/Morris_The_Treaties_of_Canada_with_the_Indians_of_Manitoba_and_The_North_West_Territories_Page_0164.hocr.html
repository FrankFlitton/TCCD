               moderate in their demands. Believing this to be the fact, I resolved to visit 
               <br />
               every camp and read them your message, and in order that your Honor may 
               <br />
               form a correct judgment of their disposition towards the Government, I will

               give you a synopsis of their speeches after the message was read. Mistah- 
               <br />
               wahsis, head Chief of the Carlton Indians, addressing the principal Chief 
               <br />
               of the Assiniboines and addressing me, said '. “That is just it, that is all 
               <br />
               we wanted.” The Assiniboines addressing me, said: “My heart is full of 
               <br />
               gratitude, foolish men have told us that the Great Chief would send his 
               <br />
               young men to our country until they outnumbered us, and that then he 
               <br />
               would laugh at us, but this letter assures us that the Great Chief will act 
               <br />
               justly towards us.” 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Beardy, or the Hairy Man, Chief of the Willow Indians, said : “ If I had 
               <br />
               heard these words spoken by the Great Queen I could not have believed 
               <br />
               them with more implicit faith than I do now.” The Sweet Grass was absent 
               <br />
               from camp when I reached the Plain Crees, but his son and the principal 
               <br />
               men of the tribe requested me to convey to the Great Chief, at Red River, 
               <br />
               their thanks for the presents received, and they expressed the greatest 
               <br />
               loyalty to the government. In a word, I found the Crees reasonable in their 
               <br />
               demands, and anxious to live in peace with the white men. I found the Big 
               <br />
               Bear, a Saulteaux, trying to take the lead in their council. He formerly lived 
               <br />
               at Jack Fish Lake, and for years has been regarded as atroublesome fellow. 
               <br />
               In his speech he said : “We want none of the Queen’s presents ; when we 
               <br />
               set a fox-trap we scatter pieces of meat all round, but when the fox gets into 
               <br />
               the trap we knock him on the head ; we want no bait, let your Chiefs come 
               <br />
               like men and talk to us.” These Saulteaux are the mischief-makers through 
               <br />
               all this western country, and some of them are shrewd men.

               A few weeks since, a land speculator wished to take a claim at the cross- 
               <br />
               ing on Battle River and asked the consent of the Indians, one of my Saul- 
               <br />
               teaux friends sprang to his feet, and pointing to the east, said: “Do you 
               <br />
               see that great white man (the Government) coming?” “ No,” said the 
               <br />
               speculator. “ I do,” said the Indian, “and I hear the tramp of the multi- 
               <br />
               tude behind him, and when he comes you can drop in behind him and take 
               <br />
               up all the land claims you want; but until then I caution you to put up no 
               <br />
               stakes in our country.” It was very fortunate for me that Big Bear and his 
               <br />
               party were a very small minority in camp. The Crees said they Would have 
               <br />
               driven them out of camp long ago, but were afraid of their medicines, as 
               <br />
               they are noted conjurers.

               The topics generally discussed at their council and which will be brought 
               <br />
               before the Commissioner are as follows in their own language. “Tell the 
               <br />
               Great Chief that we are glad the traders are prohibited bringing spirits into 
               <br />
               our cofmtry ; when we see it we want to drink it, and it destroys us ; when 
               <br />
               we do not see it we do not think about it. Ask for us a strong law, prohibi- 
               <br />
               ting the free use of poison (strychnine). It has almost exterminated the 
               <br />
               animals of our country, and often makes us had friends with our white 
               <br />
               neighbors. We further request, that a law be made, equally applicable to 
               <br />
