               <br />

               <br />
               intimidation and threats of violence prevented any open expression of opinion 
               <br />

               were disposed to continue the negotiations would remain while those who 
               <br />

               of the nature of the proposition the undersigned intended to submit, namely,

               to exclude that part of the island eastwardly of the Manitoulin Gulf and
