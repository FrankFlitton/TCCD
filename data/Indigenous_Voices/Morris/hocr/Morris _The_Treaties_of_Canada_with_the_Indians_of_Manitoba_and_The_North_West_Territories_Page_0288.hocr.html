               For my own part, I can frankly say, that I always had the 
               <br />
               conﬁdence, support and active co-operation of the Half-breeds of 
               <br />
               all origins, in my negotiations with the Indian tribes, and I owe 
               <br />
               them this full acknowledgment thereof. The Half-breeds in 
               <br />
               the territories are of three classes—1st, those who, as at St. 
               <br />
               Laurent, near Prince Albert, the Qu’Appelle Lakes and Edmon- 
               <br />
               ton, have their farms and homes; 2nd, those who are entirely 
               <br />
               identiﬁed with the Indians, living with them, and speaking their 
               <br />
               language ; 3rd, those who do not farm, but live after the habits 
               <br />
               of the Indians, by the pursuit of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buffalo</span> and the chase.

               As to the ﬁrst class, the question is an easy one. They will, 
               <br />
               of course, be recognized as possessors of the soil, and con- 
               <br />
               ﬁrmed by the Government in their holdings, and will continue 
               <br />
