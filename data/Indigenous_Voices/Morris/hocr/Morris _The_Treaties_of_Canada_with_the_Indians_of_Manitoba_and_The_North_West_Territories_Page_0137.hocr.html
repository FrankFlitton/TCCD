               The steamer left the landing at ﬁve o’clock on the 18th September, but 
               <br />
               owing to the prevalence of a gale of northerly wind was compelled to be 
               <br />
               anchored at the three channels of the Red River, inside of the bar which 
               <br />
               obstructs the entrance of the lake. The wind continued during the 18th 
               <br />
               and 19th, but on the afternoon of the latter day, Captain Hackland, a sailor 
               <br />
               of much practical experience on the Northern Seas, decided to risk going 
               <br />
               out, as the water on the bar was running down so fast that he feared that 
               <br />
               the steamer would be unable to cross over the bar. I may remark that 
               <br />
               the wind causes the waters of the lake to ebb and ﬂow into the river with 
               <br />
               great rapidity, and that the bar is so serious an obstruction to an important 
               <br />
               navigation, that it ought to be examined with a view to ascertain the cost 
               <br />
               and practicability of its removal. Leaving our anchorage, We crossed the 
               <br />
               bar at three in the afternoon with difﬁculty, and proceeded on our voyage_; 
               <br />
               anchored opposite the mouth of the Berens River on Monday, the 20th. at 
               <br />
               nine a.m., to await the arrival of a pilot, as no steamer had ever before 
               <br />
               entered the river. Under the pilotage of a Chief and a Councillor, we 
               <br />
               reached Berens River Post, the Indians greeting us with volleys of ﬁrearms, 
               <br />
               and at once summoned the Indians to meet us in the \Vesleyan Mission 
               <br />
               School House, which the Rev. Mr. Young kindly placed at our disposal. 
               <br />
               We met the Indians at four o’clock, and explained the object of our visit. 
               <br />
               The question of reserves was one of some difﬁculty, but eventually this 
               <br />
               was arranged, and the Indians agreed to accept our offer, and the indenture 
               <br />
               of treaty was signed by the Chiefs and head men about eleven p.m. The 
               <br />
               payment of the present of ﬁve dollars per head, provided by the treaty, was 
               <br />
               immediately commenced by Mr. McKay and the Hon. Thomas Howard, 
               <br />
               who accompanied me as Secretary and Pay Master, and was continued 
               <br />
               until one a.m., when the payment was concluded.

               The steamer left next day, the 21st, for Norway House, but the captain 
               <br />
               was obliged to anchor at George’s Island in the evening, owing to the stormy 
               <br />
               weather. The Colvz'lle remained at anchor all the next day, the 22nd, but 
               <br />
               left at midnight for Nelson River. We sighted the Mossy and Montreal 
               <br />
               points, at the mouth of that river, about nine a.m. on the 23rd, and arrived

               at the old or abandoned Norway House at eleven o’clock, under the guid-
