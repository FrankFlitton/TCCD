               But the Churches too have their duties to fulﬁl. There is a 
               <br />
               common ground between the Christian Churches and the In- 
               <br />
               dians, as they all believe as we do, in a Great Spirit. The 
               <br />

               Many of them appeal for missionaries, and utter the Mace- 
               <br />
               donian cry, “come over and help us.” The Churches have 
               <br />
               already done and are doing much. The Church of Rome has 
               <br />
               its bishops and clergy, who haVe long been laboring assiduously 
               <br />
               and actively. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Church</span> of England has its bishops and 
               <br />
               clergy on the shores of the Hudson’s Bay, in the cold region of 
               <br />
               the Mackenzie and the dioceses of Rupert’s Land and Saskat- 
               <br />
               chewan. The Methodist Church has its missions on Lake 
               <br />
               \Vinnipeg, in the Saskatchewan Valley, and on the slopes of 
               <br />
               the Rocky Mountains. The Presbyterians have lately com- 
               <br />
               menced a work among the Chippewas and Sioux. There is 
               <br />
               room enough and to spare, for all, and the Churches should 
               <br />
               expand and maintain their work. Already many of the mis- 
               <br />
               sionaries have made records which will live in history: among 
               <br />
               those of recent times, Archbishop Tache, Bishop Grandin, Pere 
               <br />
               Lacombe, and many others of the Catholic Church; Bishops 
               <br />
               Machray, Bompas, Archdeacons Cochran and Cowley of the 
               <br />
               Church of England; Revs. Messrs. Macdougall of the Wes- 
               <br />
               leyan and Nisbet of the Presbyterian Churches, have lived and 
               <br />
               labored, and though some of them have gone to their rest, they 
               <br />
               have left and will leave behind them a record of self-denial, un- 
               <br />
               tiring zeal, and many good results. Let the Churches persevere 
               <br />
               and prosper.

               And now I close. Let us have Christianity and civilization
