               suspicion and jealousy of all kinds should be allayed. The fact of the Com-

               <br />
               Her Majesty’s Government, and it seemed better to await the arrival of all

               <br />
               absent. This, however, entailed the necessity of feeding those who were

               It is customary in dealing with Indians to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do‘</span> so, and in this case it was 
               <br />
               absolutely necessary, for, obviously, it would have been impossible to invite 
               <br />
               those people from a distance, and then leave them to starve at our doors, or, 
               <br />
               in search of food, to plunder the neighborhood into which they had been 
               <br />
               introduced. At that season of the year the Indians were not engaged in 
               <br />
               ﬁshing or hunting, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequently</span> large numbers of men, women and 
               <br />
               children attended at the place of meeting, for all of whom food was provided. 
               <br />
               The price of provisions, even at the lowest price for which they could be 
               <br />
               obtained, was high, pork being ﬁfty dollars a barrel, and ﬂour twenty shil- 
               <br />
               lings sterling per hundred, and such cattle as I was able to purchase £16 per 
               <br />
               head; so that the expense of keeping the Indians during the negotiation of 
               <br />
               treaty and payment of the gratuity, which lasted eleven days, forms no small 
               <br />
               share of the total expenditure. In addition to this expense, it was thought 
               <br />
               necessary by the Lieutenant~Governor that Major Irvine, commanding the 
               <br />
               troops at Fort Garry, should be requested to furnish a guard at the Stone 
               <br />
               Fort during the negotiations, and that there should be at hand, also, a force 
               <br />
               of constabulary, for the purpose of preventing the introduction of liquor 
               <br />
               amongst the Indian encampments. Other expenses of a somewhat similar 
               <br />
               nature were incurred, which would be totally unnecessary upon any future 
               <br />
               occasion of payment being made to the Indians of Manitoba. I may here 
               <br />
               refer to the apparently prolonged duration of the ﬁrst negotiation, and 
               <br />
               explain, in reference thereto, the causes, or some of them, that entailed the 
               <br />
               loss of time and attendant expense. For some time a doubt has existed 
               <br />
               whether the Chief. nominally at the head of the Indians of the Indian settle- 
               <br />
               ment, possessed the good will and conﬁdence of that band; and I thought it 
               <br />
               advisable to require that the several bands of Indians should select such 
               <br />
               Chiefs as they thought proper, and present these men as their authorized 
               <br />
               Chiefs, before anything was said as to the terms of a treaty. The Indians 
               <br />
               having acquiesced in this proposal, forthwith proceeded to such election; but 
               <br />
               the proceeding apparently involved discussion and consideration amongst 
               <br />
               themselves, and two days elapsed before the men chosen were presented for 
               <br />
               recognition, and the business of the meeting commenced.
