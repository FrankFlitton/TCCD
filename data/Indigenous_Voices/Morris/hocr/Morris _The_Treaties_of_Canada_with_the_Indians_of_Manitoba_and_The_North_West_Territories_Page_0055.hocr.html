               will agree to give two hoes, one spade, one scythe, and one axe

               wheat and oats to plant the land they have actually broken 
               <br />

               <br />
               to be given them on their commencing to do so, once for all.

               There is one thing that I have thought over, and I think it is 
               <br />
               a wise thing to do. That is to give you ammunition, and twine 
               <br />
               for making, nets, to the extent of $1,500 per year, for the whole 
               <br />
               nation, so that you can have the means of procuring food.— 
               <br />
               Now, I will mention the last thing that I can do. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I.</span> think 
               <br />
               that the sum I have offered you to be paid after this year for 
               <br />
               every man, woman and child now, and for years to come, is 
               <br />
               right and is the proper sum. I will not make any change in 
               <br />
               that, but we are anxious to show you that we have a great 
               <br />
               desire to understand you—that we wish to do the utmost in our 
               <br />
               power to make you contented, so that the white and the red 
               <br />
               man will always be friends. This year, instead of ten dollars we 
               <br />
               will give you twelve dollars, to be paid you at once as soon as we 
               <br />
               sign the treaty. This is the best I can do for you. I wish you to 
               <br />
               understand we do not come here as traders, but as representing 
               <br />
               the Crown, and to do what we believe is just and right. We 
               <br />
               have asked in that spirit, and I hope you will meet me in that 
               <br />
               spirit and shake hands with me-day and make a treaty for 
               <br />
