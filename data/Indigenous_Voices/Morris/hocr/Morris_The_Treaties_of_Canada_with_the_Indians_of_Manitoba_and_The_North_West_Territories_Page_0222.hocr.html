               At ten in the morning the Governor and Commissioners, 
               <br />
               escorted by the Mounted Police, proceeded to the treaty tent 
               <br />
               a short distance from the fort. About eleven o’clock the 
               <br />
               Indians commenced to gather, as at Carlton, in a large semi- 
               <br />
               circle. In front were the young men, galloping about on their 
               <br />
               horses, then the Chiefs and head men, followed by the main 
               <br />
               body of the band to the number of two or three hundred. As

               chance, two horses and their riders came into collision with such 
               <br />
               tremendous force as to throw both horses and men violently to 
               <br />
               the ground; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">both</span> horses were severely injured and one of the

               of the police, was near by and speedily gave relief to the poor

               sufferer. The ceremonies, however, still went on; four pipe- 
               <br />
               stems were carried about and presented to be stroked in token 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Governor and Commissioners in turn. The stems, which 
               <br />
               were ﬁnely decorated, were placed with great solemnity on the 
               <br />
