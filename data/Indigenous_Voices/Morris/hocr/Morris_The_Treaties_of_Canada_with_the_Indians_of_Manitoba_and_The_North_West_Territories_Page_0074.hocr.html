               On the 3rd September we met the Indians and explained the object of our 
               <br />
               mission, and, for the beneﬁt of those who were absent last year. the terms 
               <br />
               and conditions of the treaty, and stated that we were now ready to fulﬁl so 
               <br />
               many of the obligations therein contained as the Government were bound 
               <br />
               to execute this year. The Indians declined saying anything on this occasion, 
               <br />
               but wished to meet and confer with us the following day, as they had some- 
               <br />
               thing they wished to speak about. They accordingly met us on the 4th, and 
               <br />
               made several demands, one of which was that the annuities be increased to 
               <br />
               twelve dollars per head. We replied that the treaty concluded last year 
               <br />
               was a covenant between them and the Government, and it was impossible 
               <br />
               to comply with their demands; that all we had to do was to carry out the 
               <br />
               . terms of the treaty in so far as the obligations of the some required. An 
               <br />
               idea seemed prevalent among the Indians who were absent last year 
               <br />
               that no treaty had been concluded then; that all which had been done at 
               <br />
               that time was merely preliminary to the making of the treaty in reality, 
               <br />
               which they thought was to be performed this year. The prevalence of this 
               <br />
               opinion amongst <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> operated very prejudicially to the furthering of our 
               <br />
               business, and we saw that until this was done away with it would be 
               <br />
               impossible to do anything towards accomplishing the real object of our 
               <br />
               mission. After a great deal of talking on their part, and explanation on 
               <br />
               ours, the meeting adjourned until Monday morning, as it was necessary that 
               <br />
               provisions should be issued to the different bands that evening for the 
               <br />
               following day.

               On Monday (the 6th) we again met the Indians, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as:they</span> evidently 
               <br />
               wished to have another day’s talking to urge the same demands they had 
               <br />
               made on Saturday, we assured them all further discussion on the subject 
               <br />
               was useless; that if they declined to accept the terms of the treaty we must 
               <br />
               return and report to the Government that they had broken the promise made 
               <br />
               last year. They then asked that we should report to the Government what 
               <br />
               they had demanded. This we agreed to do. After some further explana-
