               with regard to the buffalo, the North-West Council were considering the

               <br />
               shook hands with Mr. Christie and myself, each addressing me words of

               wards the Bear came to see me again, fearing I had not fully understood 
               <br />
               him, and assured me that he accepted the treaty as if he had signed it, and 
               <br />

               We crossed the river, and left for Battle River in the afternoon, where we 
               <br />
               arrived on the afternoon of the 15th. We found no Indians there except 
               <br />
               Red Pheasant and his band, whom we had already met at Carlton.

               On the 16th, the Red Pheasant saw the Commissioners. He said he was 
               <br />
               a Battle River Indian ; his fathers had lived there before him, but he was 
               <br />
               glad to see the Government coming there, as it would improve his means of 
               <br />
               living. He wished the claims of the Half-breeds who had settled there 
               <br />
               before the Government came to be respected, as for himself he would go 
               <br />
               away and seek another home, and though it was hard to leave the home of 
               <br />
               his people, yet he would make way for the white man, and surely, he said, 
               <br />
               “ if the poor Indian acts thus, the Queen, when she hears of this, will help 
               <br />
               him.” He asked, that a little land should be given him to plant potatoes 
               <br />
               in next spring, and they would remove after digging them, to their reserve, 
               <br />
               which he thought he would wish to have at the Eagle Hills.

               I expressed my satisfaction with their conduct and excellent spirit, and 
               <br />
               obtained the cheerful consent of Mr. Fuller, of the Paciﬁc telegraph line, 
               <br />
               who is in occupation of a large cultivated ﬁeld, that the band should use
