               effected a preliminary arrangement with the Indians of Rainy Lake, the

               particulars of which I have already had the honor of reporting to you in my 
               <br />
               Report, dated July 11th, 1871, I proceeded by the Lake of the Woods and 
               <br />
               Dawson Road to Fort Garry, at which place I arrived <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> the 16th July.

               Bearing in mind your desire that I should confer with the Lieutenant- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(iovernor</span> of Manitoba, I called upon Mr. Archibald, and learned from him 
               <br />
               that the Indians were anxiously awaiting my arrival, and were much excited 
               <br />
               on the subject of their lands being occupied without attention being ﬁrst 
               <br />
               given to their claims for compensation. Amongst the settlers, also, an 
               <br />
               uneasy feeling existed, arising partly from the often-repeated demands of 
               <br />
               the Indians for a treaty with themselves, and partly from the fact that 
               <br />
               certain settlers in the neighborhood of Portage .7 Prairie and other parts of 
               <br />
               the Province, had been warned by the Indians <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1;,</span> to cut wood or otherwise 
               <br />
               take possession of the lands upon which they were squatting. The Indians, 
               <br />
               it appeared, consented to their remaining on their holdings until sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               time had been allowed for my arrival, and the conclusion of a treaty; but 
               <br />
               they were unwilling to allow the settlers the free use of the country for 
               <br />
               themselves'or their cattle. Mr. Archibald, and those residents in the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba with whom I conversed on the subject, appeared to think 
               <br />
               that no time should be lost in meeting the Indians, as some assurances had 
               <br />
               already been given them that a treaty would be made with them during the 
               <br />
               summer of 1871; and I therefore, at once, issued notices calling certain of 
               <br />
               the Indians together, naming two places at which I would meet them. The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst meeting, to which were asked the Indians of the Province and certain 
               <br />
               others on the eastern side, was to be held on the 25th of July, at the Stone 
               <br />
               Fort, a Hudson’s Bay Company’s Post, situated on the Red River, about 
               <br />
               twenty miles northward of Fort Garry—a locality chosen as being the most 
               <br />
               central for those invited. The second meeting was appointed to be held on 
               <br />
               August 17th, at Manitoba Post, a Hudson’s Bay Company’s Post, at the 
               <br />
               north-west extremity of Lake Manitoba, as it was deemed that such of the 
               <br />
               hands of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Indians</span> residing without the limits of the Province of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               as I purposed to deal with at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(present,</span> would meet there more readily than 
               <br />
               elsewhere.
