               <br />
               Messrs. Morris and McKay proceeded by carriage to Lake 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and thence in a sail boat, where they met the

               bands of Treaties One and Two, except that of the Portage 
               <br />
               band, who were not summoned to any of the conferences, a 
               <br />
               fruitful source of dissension and difﬁculty. The experience 
               <br />
               derived from this misunderstanding, proved however, of 
               <br />

               <br />

               treaties thoroughly and fully explained to the Indians, and

               <br />
               them and the Crown, The arrangement, however, of the 
               <br />
               matter with the Portage band was one of more difﬁculty. This 
               <br />
               band had always been troublesome. In 1870, they had warned 
               <br />

               make terms for three years with them for the admission of 
               <br />
               settlers. In 1874, they twice sent messengers with tobacco 
               <br />
               (the usual Indian credentials for such messengers) to 
               <br />
