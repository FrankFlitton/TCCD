               <br />
               instructions, a copy of which I hereunto annex, I proceeded, accompanied by 
               <br />
               Mr. Reid, to the Dog Head and Berens River on Lake \Vinnipeg, and there 
               <br />
               successfully secured the adhesion of the Island and Grand Rapids of Berens 
               <br />
               River Bands of ludians to Treaty Number Five, and, having 'paid the 
               <br />
               annuities to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Berens</span> River Indians, returned to the Stone Fort. As 
               <br />
               mentioned in the joint report submitted to you by Mr. Reid and myself, I 
               <br />
               had the greatest difﬁculty in procuring a boat to take me on my mission, 
               <br />
               and only through the kindness of Mr. Flett. of the Hudson’s Bay Company, 
               <br />
               at the Stone Fort, was I able to obtain even the loan of one as far as Berens 
               <br />
               River, from where I had to return it. . . 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I left the Stone Fort for the Grand Rapids, on the morning of the 17th of 
               <br />
               August, and after a ver,yfast though rough and dangerous passage, reached 
               <br />
               the mouth of the Saskatchewan river, early on the morning <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the 26th. I 
               <br />
               found, on entering the river, that the Indians were encamped near its 
               <br />
               mouth, on the south bank, where I landed, and arranged to meet them at 
               <br />
               noon that day. As the provisions were stored at the Hudson’s Bay Company’s 
               <br />
               post, about a mile and a half up the river, I decided to camp at the foot of 
               <br />
               the road leading across the four-mile Portage, and having done so, and in 
               <br />
               the meantime sent the provisions to the Indian camp, I returned there at 
               <br />
               the time agreed upon.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The band having assembled, I stated to them the object of my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mission—</span> 
               <br />
               that I had been directed to pay them the annuity and deliver some of the 
               <br />
               tools and implements granted them by the treaty, and also to distribute 
               <br />
               amongst those that formerly had houses and gardens on the north bank of 
               <br />
               the river, and had moved to where they were then living, as stipulated in 
               <br />
               the treaty, the sum of ﬁve hundred dollars.

               To my surprise, the Chief at once expressed his astonishment at my saying

               that the treaty had been mude last year, and said he had only a talk then
