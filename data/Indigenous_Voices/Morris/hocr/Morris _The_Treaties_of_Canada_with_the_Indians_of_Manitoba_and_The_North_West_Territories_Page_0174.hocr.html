               that I should tell them the terms of the Treaty. I replied that if the

               Chiefs and people had joined the others they would have heard what I had 
               <br />

               <br />
               messenger could remain and hear what I had to say. He expressed himself 
               <br />
               satisfied and took his seat with the others. I then fully explained to them 
               <br />
               the proposals I had to make, that we did not wish to interfere with their 
               <br />
               present mode of living, but would assign them reserves and assist them as 
               <br />
               was being done elsewhere, in commencing to farm, and that what was done 
               <br />
               would hold good for those that were away.

               The Indians listened most attentively, and on the close of my remarks 
               <br />
               Mist-ow-as-is arose, took me by the hand, and said that “when a thing was 
               <br />
               thought of quietly, it was the best way,” and asked “ this much, that we go 
               <br />
               and think of his words.”

               wisely, and thus closed the second day.

               On Monday, 21st, the head Chiefs sent word that, as the previous day 
               <br />
               was Sunday, they had not met in council, and wished to have the day for 
               <br />
               consultation, and if ready would meet me on Tuesday morning. I cheerfully 
               <br />
               granted the delay from the reasonableness of the request; but I was also

               aware that the head Chiefs were in a position of great difﬁculty.

               <br />
               averse to make a treaty or desirous of making extravagant demands. The 
               <br />
               head Chiefs were men of intelligence, and anxious that the people should 
               <br />
