               In 1876, the Government again requested Mr. Morris to 
               <br />
               meet. these Indians and endeavor to arrange the long pending 
               <br />
               dispute with them, and in July he travelled to the Long Plain 
               <br />
               on the Assiniboine with that object in view. He had pre- 
               <br />
               viously summoned the band to meet there, and had also sum- 
               <br />
               moned a portion of the band known as the White Mud River 
               <br />
               Indians, dwelling on the shores of Lake Manitoba, who were 
               <br />
               nominally under the chieftainship of Yellow Quill, and were, 
               <br />
               as such, entitled to a portion of the original reserve, but did 
               <br />
               not recognize the Chief. Mr. Morris was accompanied by 
               <br />
               Mr. Graham, of the Indian Department, Secretary and Pay- 
               <br />
               master. On arrival at his destination, the Lieutenant-Governor 
               <br />
               found the Indians assembled, but in three camps. Those 
               <br />

               Reid, Surveyor, was also present, to explain the extent and 
               <br />
               exact dimensions of the proposed reserve.

               The next day the Indians were assembled, and the confer- 
               <br />
               ence lasted for two days. The Yellow Quill band were still 
               <br />
               obstructive. but the other two sections were disposed to accept 
               <br />
               the terms. The question of the reserve was the main difﬁculty. 
               <br />
               The Yellow Quill band still desired a reserve for the whole. 
               <br />
               The others wished to remain, the Bear’s party at the Round 
               <br />
               Plain, and the \Vhite Mud River Indians at Lake Manitoba, 
               <br />
               where they resided and had. houses and farms. In the interval 
               <br />
               from the previous year, the Bear’s band had built several 
               <br />
               houses, and made enclosures for farming. Eventually, the 
               <br />
               Indians were made to comprehend the extent of land they 
               <br />
               were really entitled to, but the Governor intimated that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">U</span>

               land was for all, and that he would divide the band into three,
