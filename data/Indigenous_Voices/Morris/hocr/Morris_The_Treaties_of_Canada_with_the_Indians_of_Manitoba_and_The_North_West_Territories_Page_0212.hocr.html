               J <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">osnru</span> TIIOMA proposed to speak for The Red Pheasant, 
               <br />
               Chief of Battle River Indians—“This is not my own desire 
               <br />
               that I speak now, it is very hard we cannot all be of one 
               <br />
               mind. You know some were not present when the list of 
               <br />
               articles mentioned was made, there are many things overlooked 
               <br />
               in it; it is true that what has been done this morning is good. 
               <br />
               What has been overlooked I will speak about. The one that 
               <br />
               is next to the Chief (ﬁrst head man) should have had a horse 
               <br />
               as well. I want the Governor to give us somebody to build 
               <br />
               our houses, we cannot manage it ourselves, for my own part 
               <br />
               you see my crippled hand. It is true the Governor says he 
               <br />
               takes the responsibility on himself in granting the extra 
               <br />
               requests of the Indians, but let him consider on the quality of 
               <br />
               the land he has already treated for. There is no farming land 
               <br />
               whatever at the north-west angle, and he goes by what he has 
               <br />
               down there. What I want, as he has said, is twenty-ﬁve dollars 
               <br />
               to each Chief and to his head men twenty dollars. I do not 
               <br />
               want to keep the lands nor do I give away, but I have set the 
               <br />
               value. I want to ask as much as will cover the skin of the 
               <br />
               people, no more nor less. I think what he has offered is too 
               <br />
               little. When you spoke you mentioned ammunition, I did 
               <br />
               not hear mention of a gun; we will not be able to kill anything 
               <br />
               simply by setting ﬁre to powder. I want a gun for each Chief 
               <br />
               and head man, and I want ten miles around the reserve where 
               <br />
               I may be settled. I have told the value I have put on my 
               <br />
               land.”
