               <br />
               same bounties would be extended to them as were being extended to their 
               <br />
               brethren of Norway House and Cross Lake, and also whether they could 
               <br />
               obtain a reserve on Lake Winnipeg, as the country in which they were 
               <br />
               living was totally unﬁt for cultivation, and that they had the greatest 
               <br />
               difﬁculty in procuring a livelihood. I told them that I had no idea what 
               <br />
               were the intentions of the Government with regard to those Indians living 
               <br />
