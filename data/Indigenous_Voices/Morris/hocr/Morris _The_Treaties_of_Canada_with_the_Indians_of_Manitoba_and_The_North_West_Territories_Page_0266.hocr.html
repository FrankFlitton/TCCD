               Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were occupied in paying

               <br />

               On Wednesday the Chiefs presented an address to the Com-

               <br />
               been carried out. They tendered their well-wishes to the

               Queen, the Governor, Col. McLeod, and the Police Force. 
               <br />
               They spoke in the most ﬂattering and enthusiastic manner of 
               <br />
               the Commissioner, Assistant—Commissioner, ofﬁcers, and the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Great Mother. Potts, the interpreter at Fort McLeod, 
               <br />
               said he never heard Indians speak out their minds so freely in

               the approval of the Chiefs and their acceptance of her offers. 
               <br />
               In return the Great Mother only required of them to abide by
