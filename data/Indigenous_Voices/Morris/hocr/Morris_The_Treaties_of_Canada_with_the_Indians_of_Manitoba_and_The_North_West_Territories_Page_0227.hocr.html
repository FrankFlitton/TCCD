               <br />
               delivered you my message from the Queen; I held out my hand in 
               <br />
               the Queen’s name, full of her bounty. You asked time to consult 
               <br />

               <br />
               here to surprise you. I trust the Great Spirit has put good 
               <br />
               thoughts into your hearts, and your wise men have found my 
               <br />
               words good. I am now ready to hear whether you are pre-

               pared to do as the great body of the Indian people have 
               <br />

               <br />
               they may choose; my heart is warm to you, and my ears are
