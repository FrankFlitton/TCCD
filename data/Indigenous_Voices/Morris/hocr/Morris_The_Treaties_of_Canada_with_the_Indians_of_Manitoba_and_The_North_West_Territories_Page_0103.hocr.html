               He has as much right to be here as another Indian. We 
               <br />
               cannot go there and ask the people of the two great tribes to 
               <br />
               meet in one place as they have done when they were asked to 
               <br />
               meet us. You have had many days to talk together. If the 
               <br />
               Saulteaux are determined that they want an agreement to pre- 
               <br />
               vent the Company from trading, it cannot be given. I think 
               <br />
               the Chief here spoke wisely. He says he is in trouble because 
               <br />
               you do not understand each other. Why are you not of one 
               <br />
               mind? Have you tried to be of one mind ?‘ Must we go back 
               <br />
               and say we have had you here so many days, and that you 
               <br />
               had not the minds of men—that you were not able to under- 
               <br />
               stand each other? Must we go back and tell the Queen that 
               <br />
               we held out our hands for her, and her red children put them 
               <br />
               back again? If that be the message that your conduct to-day 
               <br />
               is going to make us carry back, I am sorry for you, and fear it 
               <br />
               will be a long day before you again see the Queen’s Councillors 
               <br />
               here to try to do you good. The Queen and her Councillors 
               <br />
               may think that you do not want to be friends, that you do not 
               <br />
               want your little ones to be taught, that you do not want when 
               <br />
               the food is getting scarce to have a hand in yours stronger 
               <br />
               than yours to help you. Surely you will think again before 
               <br />
               you turn your backs on the offers ; you will not let so little a 
               <br />
               question as this about the Company, without whom you tell me 
               <br />
               you could not live, stop the good we mean to do. I hope that

               I am perfectly understood _; when we asked the chief here we 
               <br />
               wanted to speak with him about his lands at his place ; when 
               <br />
               we asked “Loud Voice ” here we wanted to speak with him 
               <br />
               about the land at his place; so when we asked the other 
               <br />
               chiefs here we wanted to speak with them about the lands at 
               <br />
               their places. Why? because we did not want to do anything 
               <br />
               that you would not all know about, that there might be no 
               <br />
               bad feelings amongst you. We wanted you to be of one mind 
               <br />
               and heart in this matter, and that is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'</span> reason you are here 
               <br />
               to-day. Now it rests with you; we have done all we could. 
               <br />
               Have you anything more to say to us, or are we to turn our 
               <br />
