               <br />
               same evening we had an interview with, and fully explained the terms and 
               <br />

               <br />
               all the Indians and explained to them the object of our mission, and, after 
               <br />
               considerable discussion, made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an’angements</span> to commence paying the

               annuities next day. This, however, was prevented by heavy rains, which 
               <br />
