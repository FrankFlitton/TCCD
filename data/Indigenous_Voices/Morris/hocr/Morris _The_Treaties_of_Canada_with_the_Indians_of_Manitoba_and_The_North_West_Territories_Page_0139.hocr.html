               0n the 27th we met the Indians near the Chief’s house in the open air, at 
               <br />
               a spot where a large ﬁre had been lighted by them, as the weather was cold. 
               <br />
               We took a similar course as at Norway House in severing the question of 
               <br />
               terms of the treaty and reserves, and with like satisfactory results. After a 
               <br />
               lengthy discussion the Indians agreed to accept the terms, and we then 
               <br />
               entered upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> question of the reserves. They complained of the 
               <br />
               Hudson’s Bay Campany’s reserve, and wished to have the land covered by 
               <br />
               it, but we explained whatever had been promised the Company would be 
               <br />
               given just as promises made to them would be kept. They said the Com- 
               <br />
               pany’s reserve should be at the abandoned post at the mouth of the river, 
               <br />
               and not at the end of the portage. We informed them that we would inquire 
               <br />
               as to this. They then claimed a reserve on both sides of the river of large 
               <br />
               extent, and extending up to the head of the Grand Rapids, but this we 
               <br />
               declined to accede to. Eventually, as the locality they had hitherto occu- 
               <br />
               pied is so important a point, controlling as it does the means of communi- 
               <br />
               cation between the mouth of the river. and the head of the rapids, and 
               <br />
               where a “ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tramnway</span> ” will no doubt ere long require to be constructed, pre- 
               <br />
               aenting also deep-water navigation and excellent wharfage, and evidently 
               <br />
               being moreover the site where a town will spring up, we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> them 
               <br />
               reserve on the south side of the river. They objected, that they had their 
               <br />
               houses and gardens on the north side of the river, but said that as the 
               <br />
               Queen’s Government were treating them so kindly, that they would go to 
               <br />
               south side of the river, if a small sum was given them to assist in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">removing“</span> 
               <br />
               their houses, or building others, and this as will be seen by the terms of the 
               <br />
               treaty, we agreed to do, believing it to be alike in the interests of the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to have the control of so important a point as the mouth of the 
               <br />
               great internal river of the Saskatchewan, and yet only just to the Indians, 
               <br />
               who were making what was to them so large a concession to the wishes of 
               <br />
               the Commissioners. On our agreeing to the proposal, the treaty was cheer- 
               <br />
               fully signed by the Chief and head men, and the payment of the present was 
               <br />
               made to them, together with a distribution of some provisions. I enclose a 
               <br />
               tracing of the mouth of the river, copied from a sketch thereof kindly made 
               <br />
               for me by Mr. Ross, which will enable you to understand the actual
