               ()n the 24th we met the Indians inalarge store-house of the Hudson’s Bay 
               <br />
               Company, and asked them to present their Chiefs and head men. We 
               <br />
               found that there were tWo distinct bands of Indians, the Christian Indians 
               <br />
               of Norway House, and the W ood or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pagan</span> Indians of Cross Lake. Each 
               <br />
               elected their Chiefs by popular vote in a most business-like manner, and 
               <br />
               the Chiefs, after consulting the bands, selected the head men. We then 
               <br />
               accepted the Chiefs, and I made an explanation of the object of our visit in 
               <br />
               English, and the Hon. James McKay in the Indian dialect. We severed the 
               <br />
               questions of terms and reserves, postponing the latter till we had disposed 
               <br />
               of the former. The Indians gratefully accepted of the offered terms, and 
               <br />
               We adjourned the conference to enable them to consult as to reserves. On 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rte-assembling,</span> the Christian Chief stated that as they could no longer count 
               <br />
               on employment in heating for the Hudson’s Bay Company, owing to the 
               <br />
               introduction of steam navigation, he and a portion of his band wished to 
               <br />
               migrate to Lake <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Winnipeg,</span> where they could obtain a livelihood by farm-- 
               <br />
               ing and ﬁshing. \Ve explained why we could not grant them a reserve for 
               <br />
               that purpose at the Grassy Narrows as they wished, owing to the proposed 
               <br />
               Icelandic settlement there, but offered to allot them a reserve at Fisher 
               <br />
               River, about forty miles north of the Narrows, and this they accepted. It 
               <br />
               is supposed that some eighty or ninety families will remove there in spring, 
               <br />
               and it was arranged that those who remain, instead of receiving a reserve, 
               <br />
               should retain their present houses and gardens. The Chief of the Pagan 
               <br />
               band, who has, however, recently been baptized, stated that the Wood 
               <br />
               Indians wished to remain at Cross Lake, and we agreed that a reserve 
               <br />
               should be allotted them there. The treaty was then signed and the medals 
               <br />
               and uniforms presented. The Chiefs, on behalf of their people, thanked 
               <br />
               Her Majesty and her ofﬁcers for their kindness to the Indian people, which 
               <br />
               I suitably acknowledged, and the payment of the presents was commenced 
               <br />
               by Messrs. McKay and Howard, and completed on the 15th.

               We left that day at half-past three amidst cheering by the Indians and a

               salute of ﬁre-arms, and came to anchor in Play Green Lake, at Kettle 
               <br />

               <br />
               river, has been abandoned, and a new one established on their reserve, some 
               <br />
               six miles higher up the river, at the head of the portage, which the river 
               <br />
               steamer descends to. The Colm’llc, at our request ran up to the Chief’s 
               <br />
               house, situated on the shore of a deep bay, and was moored and gangways 
               <br />
               laid out to the shore. We found an Indian village on the north side, and 
               <br />
               also the Chief’s house, which was built on the only spot where good and in- 
               <br />
               expensive wharfage can be had, and ascertained afterwards that the Indians 
               <br />
               claimed the whole north shore for a reserve.
