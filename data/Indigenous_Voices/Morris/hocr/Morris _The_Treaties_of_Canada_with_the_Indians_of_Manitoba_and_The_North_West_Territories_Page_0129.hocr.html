               On our way we met some carts sent by the Indians to relieve my waggons 
               <br />
               of the tents and baggage, the Indian trail being almost impracticable ; but 
               <br />
               instead of so using them I sent them on toward the Portage to meet the 
               <br />
               loaded carts, and was thus enabled to get the temporary supply of pro- 
               <br />
               visions to the Plain, which was fortunate, as the Indians were without 
               <br />
               food. The evening of my arrival the Councillors of Yellow Quill came to 
               <br />
               talk with me, but I declined to do so, telling them that the Chief had not 
               <br />
               come, and I would only speak with him. I acted thus, in consequence of 
               <br />
               the conduct of their head men, last year, when they controlled the Chief and 
               <br />
               coerced the whole band. In a. short time Yellow Quill came with them to 
               <br />
               see me, and ﬁnding that they had come about provisions, I referred them to 
               <br />
               Mr. Graham, who, I informed them, had charge of the provisions and pay- 
               <br />
               ments. The incident had a marked effect in giving tone to the following 
               <br />
               negotiations. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               On Monday I met the Indians, who ranged themselves in three parties. I 
               <br />
               explained to them the proposed arrangement of the outside promises very 
               <br />
               fully, and told them that as they were willing to accept of the settlement 
               <br />
               last year, I did so for their information only. I then took up the question 
               <br />
               of the reserve, read the terms in which it was referred to in the Stone Fort 
               <br />
               Treaty, explained to them that they were getting double the land any other 
               <br />
               Indians in Treaties Numbers One and Two were doing, but told them the 
               <br />
               reserve belonged to all of them, and not to Yellow Quill’s band alone. I 
               <br />
               then called on them to speak to me, asking Yellow Quill ﬁrst. He said he 
               <br />
               did not understand the extent of the reserve. I then asked Mr. Reid to 
               <br />
               shew them a diagram of it, and to explain to them its length in ordinary 
               <br />
               miles, and otherwise, which he did very satisfactorily, and at length they 
               <br />
               comprehended it. I then called on Short Bear’s band to express their 
               <br />
               views. They said they wanted a reserve at the Long Plain, if it was only 
               <br />
               a little piece 0f land ; that they liked the place, that they had built houses 
               <br />
               and planted gardens, had cut oak to build more houses, and wished to farm 
               <br />
               there. I then called on the White Mud Indians. They said that they 
               <br />
               were Christians and had always lived at the White Mud River ; that they 
               <br />
               did not wish to join either Yellow Quill’s or Short Bear’s reserve, but 
               <br />
               desireda reserve at the Big Point. I told them they could not have it 
               <br />
               there, as there were settlers, and the Government wished them to join one 
               <br />
               of the other bands, and explained to them that their holdings would be 
               <br />
               respected, except where inadvertently sold. I took this course, as I had 
               <br />
               ascertained that the plan of Yellow Quill’s head men was to make no settle- 
               <br />
               ment this year, and that they had induced the other Indians to agree to 
               <br />
               act in that way. I accordingly so shaped my opening speech and my deal- 
               <br />
               ings with the Indians as to defeat this project, by securing the support of 
               <br />
               Short Bear’s and the White Mud Indians, which I succeeded in doing, 
               <br />
               though Yellow Quill’s spokesman taunted the others with having broken 
               <br />
               their agreement. As the conference proceeded, Yellow Quill’s councillors 
               <br />
               said they did not want the band broken up, as they wished all to live 
               <br />
