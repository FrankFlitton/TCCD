               The Commissioners, in the discharge of their task, had to 
               <br />
               travel through the prairie district in going to their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">destination</span> 
               <br />
               and returning to Winnipeg, a distance of over 1,800 miles.

               They ﬁrst met the Indians in the vicinity of Fort Carlton, on

               the Saskatchewan, in the month of August, 1876, and eventu-

               ally succeeded on the 23rd day of that month, in effecting a 
               <br />
               treaty with the Plain and Wood Crees, and on. the 28th 
               <br />
               of the same month with the tribe of Willow Crees. The 
               <br />
               negotiations were diﬂicult and pretracted. The Hon. David 
               <br />
               Mills, then Minister of the Interior, in his Annual Report 
               <br />
               thus characterizes them :-—“ In View of the temper of the 
               <br />
               Indiansof the Saskatchewan, during the past year, and of the 
               <br />
               extravagant demands which they were induced to prefer on 
               <br />
               certain points, it needed all the temper, tact, judgment and 
               <br />
               discretion, of which the Commissioners were possessed, to bring 
               <br />
               the negotiations to a satisfactory issue.” The difﬁculties were 
               <br />
               encountered chieﬂy at Carlton. The main body of the Crees 
               <br />
               were honestly disposed to treat, and their head Chiefs, Misto- 
               <br />
               wasis and Ah-tuk-uh-koop, shewed sound judgment, and an earn- 
               <br />
               est desire to come to an understanding. 
               <br />

               They were embarrassed, however, by the action of the Wil- 
               <br />
               low Crees, who, under the guidance of one of their Chiefs, 
               <br />
               Beardy, interposed every obstacle to the progress of the treaty, 
               <br />
               and refused to attend the Council, unless it was held at the top 
               <br />
               of a hill some miles off, where the Chief pretended it had been 
               <br />
               revealed to him in a vision that the treaty was to be made. 
               <br />
               The Willow Crees were, moreover, under the inﬂuence of a 
               <br />
               wandering band of Saulteaux, the chief portion of whom resided 
               <br />
               within the limits of the other treaties, and who were dis- 
               <br />
               posed to be troublesome. Before the arrival of the Commis- 
               <br />
               sioners, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saulteaux</span> conceived the idea of forming a combina-

               tion of the French Half-breeds, the Crees, and themselves, to 
               <br />
               prevent the crossing of the Saskatchewan by the Lieutenant- 
               <br />
               Governor, and his entrance into the Indian territories. They 
               <br />
               made the proposal ﬁrst to the French Half-breeds, who declined
