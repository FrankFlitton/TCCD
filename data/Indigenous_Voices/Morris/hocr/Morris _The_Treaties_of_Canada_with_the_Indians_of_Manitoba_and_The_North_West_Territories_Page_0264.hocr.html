               Bear’s Paw said that he was pleased with the treaty, the 
               <br />
               Police, and the prospect of getting provisions and money, and 
               <br />

               as much as possible, and that as speedily as possible. This

               On this day the Indians accepted the terms of the treaty,

               and several of the Chiefs made speeches. The ﬁrst speaker

               was Crowfoot.

               <br />
               to speak for my people, who are numerous, and who rely upon 
               <br />
               me to follow that course which in the future will tend to their 
               <br />
               good. The plains are large and wide. We are the children 
               <br />
               of the plains, it is our home, and the buffalo has been our food 
               <br />
               always. I hope you look upon the Blackfeet, Bloods and 
               <br />
               Sarcees as your children now, and that you will be indulgent 
               <br />
               and charitable to them. They all expect me to speak now for 
               <br />
               them, and I trust the Great Spirit will put into their breasts to 
               <br />
               be a good people—into the minds of the men, women and 
               <br />
               children, and their future generations. The advice given me 
               <br />
               and my people has proved to be very good. If the Police had 
               <br />
               not come to the country, where would we be all now? Bad 
               <br />
               men and whiskey were killing us so fast that very few, indeed, 
               <br />
               of us would have been left to-day. The Police have protected us 
               <br />
               as the feathers of the bird protect it from the frosts of wmter. 
               <br />
               I wish them all good, and trust that all our hearts will increase 
               <br />
               in goodness from this time forward. I am satisﬁed. I will 
               <br />
               Sign the treaty.”
