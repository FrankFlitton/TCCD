               Pecheto, (another of whose sons was the spokesman at Qu’Appelle, as you 
               <br />
               will recollect) he came <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the Long Plains to advise the band to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">come.to</span> 
               <br />
               terms. He remained at my request until the negotiations were concluded, 
               <br />
               and exerted a most beneficial inﬂuence over Yellow Quill’s band. I call 
               <br />
               your attention to the request of Yellow Quill’s Councillors, that they should 
               <br />
               be paid. As in Treaties Three, Four and Five, they are paid, and as the 
               <br />
               expense would not be large, I am of opinion that before the Superintendent 
               <br />
               of Indian Affairs for the Superintendency of Manitoba proceeds to make 
               <br />
               the payments in Treaties One and Two, he should be authorized to pay the 
               <br />
               head men. It will be difﬁcult to explain why the difference is made, and it 
               <br />
               will secure in every hand, men who will feel that they are officers of the 
               <br />
               Crown and remunerated as such. I returned to Fort Garry on the 23rd 
               <br />
               inst., encountering on the way a very severe thunder storm, which com- 
               <br />
               pelled me to take advantage of the very acceptable shelter of the kindly 
               <br />
               proffered residence of the Hon. Mr. Breland, at White Horse Plains, 
               <br />
               instead of a tent on the thoroughly-drenched prairie. I congratulate you 
               <br />
               that with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">successful</span> issue of this negotiation is closed, in Treaties One 
               <br />
               and Two, the vexed question of the open promises. I forward by this ' 
               <br />
               mail a copy of the agreement I have above alluded to, retaining the original 
               <br />
               for the present, and will be pleased to hear of its speedy approval <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.by</span> the
