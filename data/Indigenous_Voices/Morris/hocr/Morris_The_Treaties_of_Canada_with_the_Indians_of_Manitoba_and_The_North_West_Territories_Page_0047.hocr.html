               of those you have seen before. We think it a great thing to

               meet you here. What we have heard yesterday, and as you 
               <br />
               represented yourself, you said the Queen sent you here, the 
               <br />
               way we understood you as a representative of the Queen. All 
               <br />
               this is our property where you have come. We have under- 
               <br />
               stood you yesterday that Her Majesty has given you the same 
               <br />
               power and authority as she has, to act in- this business; you 
               <br />
               said the Queen gave you her goodness, her charitableness in 
               <br />
               your hands. This is what we think, that the Great Spirit has

               planted us on this ground where we are, as you were where 
               <br />
               you came from. We think where we are is our property. I

               will tell you what he said to us when he he planted us here;

               the rules that we should follow—us Indians—He has given us

               rules that we should follow to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern</span> us rightly. We have

               understood you that you have opened your charitable heart to

               to this gentleman (Mr. Dawson). When he understood rightly

               what we heard from you yesterday, in regard to the money

               want to talk about the rules that we had laid down before. It 
               <br />
               is four years back since we have made these rules. The 
               <br />
               rules laid down are the rules that they wish to follow—a
