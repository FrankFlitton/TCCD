               They were told that they had no claim on the Queen, as 
               <br />
               they were not British Indians, unless she chose to help them 
               <br />
               out of her benevolence. This they cheerfully admitted, but 
               <br />
               hoped that they would be helped. They were further in- 
               <br />
               formed, that if a reserve was granted them, it could not be 
               <br />
               near the boundary line as they wished, and that they must 
               <br />
               avoid all interference with the American trouble with their 
               <br />
               nation. This they willingly promised, and said “they had 
               <br />
               already taken care to have nothing to do with the matter.”

               These Sioux were very intelligent and superior Indians, and 
               <br />
               were well dressed. A reserve was subsequently allotted to 
               <br />
               them in the year 1876, in the vicinity of Oak Lake, about 
               <br />
               ﬁfty miles due north of Turtle Mountains, allowing them the' 
               <br />
               same quantity of land, which had been given the Manitoba 
               <br />
               Sioux, viz., 80 acres to each band of ﬁve persons, and they will 
               <br />
               doubtless follow the example of their brethren <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on'the</span> other 
               <br />
               two reserves. With regard to the Sioux to whom reserves 
               <br />
               have been assigned, the then Minister of the Interior, the Hon. 
               <br />
               David Mills, thus reported in 187 7 : “The report of the Deputy 
               <br />
               Superintendent-General in l 77 gives some details respecting 
               <br />
               the operations of the Manitoba Sioux on their reserves, during 
               <br />
               the past year. He says: ‘Upon the whole, they appear to 
               <br />
               have made fair progress in cultivating the land, and their pros- 
               <br />
               pects for the future, had they the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advice</span> and assistance of some 
               <br />
               good farmers, for a few years, would be encouraging. Indeed, 
               <br />
               the Sioux generally, who are resident in Canada, appear to 
               <br />
               be more intelligent, industrious, and self-reliant, than the other 
               <br />
               Indian bands in the North-VVest.’ ”

               While the authorities were thus successfully dealing with the 
               <br />
               problem of how to provide a future for these wandering Sioux, 
               <br />
               a grave difﬁculty presented itself by the incursion into the
