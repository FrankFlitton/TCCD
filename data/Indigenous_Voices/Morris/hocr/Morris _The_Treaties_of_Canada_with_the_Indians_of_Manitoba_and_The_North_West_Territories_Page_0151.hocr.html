               On Wednesday morning, he 30th, I left for the Pas. From the Grand 
               <br />
               Rapids to the Narrows, before entering Cedar Lake, a distance of eighteen 
               <br />
               or twenty miles, a continuous rapid extends, and it is only by tracking and 
               <br />
               poling simultaneously that you are at all able to ascend the river. The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst day I made only nine miles on my way and camped at the Demi 
               <br />
               Charge, and it was late in the evening on the second day when I reached 
               <br />
               Cedar Lake. This lake is about thirty-ﬁve miles in length and is very 
               <br />
               shallow and dangerous in stormy weather. I was fortunate enough to have 
               <br />
               very calm weather, and, therefore, crossed it without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> delay and entered 
               <br />
               the Saskatchewan again at the Che-ma-wa-win or “Seining place,” early 
               <br />
               on Saturday morning, September 2nd. Noticing a large encampment of 
               <br />
               Indians there, I landed and found they were part of the Moose Lake band. 
               <br />
               They desired that I should treat with them Where they were, and not bring 
               <br />
               them to the Pas, but upon my telling them that I could only treat with 
               <br />
               them at the appointed place of meeting, they readily assented to follow me 
               <br />
               up, and having given them some provisions to take them there, and secured 
               <br />
               the services of one of them to act as guide, I again started on my journey.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I was then three days and two nights ascending the river, and on Tues- 
               <br />
               day morning, the 5th September, the day appointed for me to meet the 
               <br />
               Indians, I arrived at the Pas or Devon Mission, on my way up having been 
               <br />
               passed by the Indians from the Che-ma-wa-win.

               On entering the river after leaving Cedar Lake the whole aspect of the 
               <br />
               country changes, and from there to the Pas, and, I understand, for fully 
               <br />
               one hundred miles above it, nothing but marsh can be seen; so much so 
               <br />
               that it was difﬁcult along the bank of the river to ﬁnd a spot dry enough to 
               <br />
               camp upon, and I was, consequently, obliged to eat and sleep in my boat. 
               <br />
               The dreariness of this voyage can hardly be realized, and it was with feelings 
               <br />
               of delight that I landed at the Mission at the Pas where the Rev. Mr. 
               <br />
               Cochrane received me.

               <br />
               were on the look-out for us, he returned with them in their canoe and
