               “The Great Spirit has made all things—tho sun, the moon, 
               <br />
               and the stars, the earth, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forests,</span> and the swift running 
               <br />
               rivers. It is by the Great Spirit that the Queen rules over 
               <br />
               this great country and other great countries. The Great 
               <br />
               Spirit has made the white man and the rod man brothers, and 
               <br />
               we should take each other by the hand. The Great Mother 
               <br />
               loves all her children, white man and red man alike; she 
               <br />
               wishes to do them all good. The bad white man and the bad 
               <br />
               Indian she alone does not love, and them she punishes for 
               <br />
               their wickedness. The good Indian has nothing to fear from 
               <br />
               the Queen or her ofﬁcers. You Indians know this to be true. 
               <br />
               When bad white men brought you whiskey, robbed you, and 
               <br />
               made you poor, and, through whiskey, quarrel amongst your 
               <br />
               selves, she sent the Police to put an end to it. You know how 
               <br />
               they stopped this and punished the offenders, and how much 
               <br />
               good this has done. I have to tell you how much pleased the 
               <br />
               Queen is that you have taken the Police by the hands and 
               <br />
               helped them, and obeyed her laws since the arrival of the 
               <br />
               Police. She hopes that you will continue to do so, and you 
               <br />
               will always ﬁnd the Police on your side if you keep the Queen’s 
               <br />
               laws. The Great Mother heard that the buffalo were being 
               <br />
               killed very fast, and to prevent them from being destroyed her 
               <br />
               Councillors have made a law to protect them. This law is for 
               <br />
               your good. It says that the calves are not to be killed, so that 
               <br />
               they may grow up and increase ; that the cows are not to be 
               <br />
               killed in winter or spring, excepting by the Indians when they 
               <br />
               are in need of them as food. This will save the buffalo, and 
               <br />
