               <br />
               for you and for your children. When I met the Saulteaux last 
               <br />
               year we had not 4,000 there, but there were men like you who 
               <br />
               knew what was good for themselves, for their wives, for their 
               <br />
               children, and those not born. I gave to those who were there,

               <br />
               those who were away, and I did for them just as I did for

               <br />
               will be good for them. It is for you to say, not for us ; we

               is for you now to act, on you rests the duty of saying whether 
               <br />
               you believe our message or not, whether you want the Queen 
               <br />
               to help you or not, whether or not you will go away and let 
               <br />
               the days and the years go on, and let the food grow scarcer, and 
               <br />
               let your children grow up and do nothing to keep off the hunger 
               <br />
               and the cold that is before them. It is for you to say that, 
               <br />
               not for us; if we had not your good at heart we would not have 
               <br />
               been here, and we would not have labored these many days, if 
               <br />
               our hearts were not warm towards you, and if we did not 
               <br />
               believe what we are doing, would be for your good as children
