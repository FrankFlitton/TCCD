               The Council broke up at this point, and it was extremely 
               <br />
               doubtful whether an agreement could be come to or not. The 
               <br />
               Rainy River Indians were careless <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">about“</span> the treaty, because 
               <br />
               they could get plenty of money for cutting wood for the boats, 
               <br />
               but the northern and eastern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"Lands</span> were anxious for one. The 
               <br />
               Governor decided that he would make a treaty with those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bands</span> 
               <br />
               that were willing to accept his terms, leaving out the few dis' 
               <br />
               affected ones. A Council was held by the Indians in the even- 
               <br />
               ing, at which Hon. James McKay, Pierre Leveillée, Charles 
               <br />
               Nolin, and Mr. Genton were present by invitation of the 
               <br />
               Chiefs. After a very lengthy and exhaustive discussion, it was 
               <br />
               decided to accept the Governor’s terms, and the ﬁnal meeting 
               <br />
               was announced for Friday morning. Punctually at the appointed 
               <br />
               time proceedings were opened by the Fort Francis Chiefs 
               <br />
               announcing to His Excellency that they were all of one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mind,</span> 
               <br />
               and would accept his terms, with a few modiﬁcations. The 
               <br />
               discussion of these terms occupied ﬁve hours, and met every 
               <br />
               possible contingency so fully that it would be impossible to do 
               <br />
               justice to the negotiators otherwise than by giving a full report 
               <br />
               of the speeches on both sides ; but want of space compels us to 
               <br />
               lay it over until next week.

               The treaty was ﬁnally closed on Friday afternoon, and signed 
               <br />
               on Saturday ; after which a large quantity of provisions, ammu-

               When the council broke up last (Thursday) night, 3rd Octo- 
               <br />
               ber, it looked very improbable that an understanding could he

               arrived at, but the ﬁrmness of the Governor, and the prospect

               that he would make a treaty with such of the bands as were 
               <br />
               willing to accept his terms, to the exclusion of the others, led 
               <br />
               them to reconsider their demands. The Hon. James McKay, 
               <br />
               and Messrs. N olin, Genton, and Leveillée were invited in to their 
               <br />
               council, and after a most exhaustive discussion of the circum- 
               <br />
               stance in which they were placed, it was resolved to accept the 
               <br />
               Governor’s terms, with some modiﬁcations. Word was sent to
