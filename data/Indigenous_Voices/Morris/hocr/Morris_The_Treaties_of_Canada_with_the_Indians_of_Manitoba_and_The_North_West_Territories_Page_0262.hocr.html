               <br />
               was broken; now I can sleep sound and am not afraid. The

               Great Mother sent you to this country, and we hope she will 
               <br />
               be good to us for many years. I hope and expect to get plenty; 
               <br />
               we think we will not get so much as the Indians receive from 
               <br />
               the Americans 011 the other side; they get large presents of 
               <br />
               ﬂour, sugar, tea, and blankets. The Americans gave at ﬁrst 
               <br />
               large bags of ﬂour, sugar, and many blankets; the next year 
               <br />
               it was only half the quantity, and the following years it grew 
               <br />
               less and less, and now they give only a handful of ﬂour. We 
               <br />
               want to get ﬁfty dollars for the Chiefs and thirty dollars each 
               <br />
               for all the others, men, women, and children, and we want the 
               <br />
               same every year for the future. We want to be paid for all 
               <br />
               the timber that the Police and whites have used since they ﬁrst 
               <br />
               came to our country. If it continues to be used as it is, there 
               <br />
               will soon be no ﬁrewood left for the Indians. I hope, Great
