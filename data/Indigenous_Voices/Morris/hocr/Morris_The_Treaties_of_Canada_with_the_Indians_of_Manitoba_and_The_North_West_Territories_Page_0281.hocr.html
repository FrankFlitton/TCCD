               <br />
               were Half-breeds, the other a Canadian. One night, one of 
               <br />
               the Half-breeds shot the Canadian, and attempted to kill the 
               <br />
               other Half-breed, who ﬂed to an Indian camp in the vicinity. 
               <br />
               The Chief of the band was there, and he at once took his

               young men with him, proceeded to the scene of the murder,

               The culprit was subsequently tried in Manitoba, convicted of
