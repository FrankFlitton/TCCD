               and had the adhesion read to them and signed. I then presented the medals 
               <br />
               and clothing to the Chiefs and Councillors, with which they were greatly 
               <br />

               <br />
               when the funds at my disposal being exhausted, I directed them to meet me 
               <br />
               again the following morning at nine o’clock, which they did, and I completed 
               <br />
               the payments the same evening at ﬁve o’clock. Ithen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distribrtrd</span> the balance

               had been unable to bring from Grand Rapids, my boat being very heavily 
               <br />
               laden ; but Mr. Belanger, of the Hudson’s Bay Company, kindly promised to 
               <br />
               have them brought up free of charge in a boat that was going to the Grand 
               <br />
               Rapids in a few days ; I therefore gave the Chief of the Pas band an order 
               <br />
               for the chest of tools and the implements.

               <br />
               from the Indians gathered, I left the Pas at half-past two o’clock p.m., and 
               <br />
               with rowing and ﬂoating alternately during the afternoon and night, reached 
               <br />
               the Che-ma-wa-win on Sunday evening; crossed Cedar Lake on Monday, 
               <br />
               and landed at the head of Grand Rapids on Tuesday morning. I then ran 
               <br />
               the rapids and hoisted the sail at the mouth of the river at two p.m., having 
               <br />
               called upon Mr. Matheson and seen the Chief of the Indians there on my 
               <br />
               way down. I then made all haste to return here, but, owing to contrary 
               <br />
               winds, only succeeded in reaching the Stone Fort on the 20th September, yet, 
               <br />
               having made a very quick trip, unprecedented in fact, and in carrying out 
               <br />
               the mission entrusted to me, travelled in an open boat, thirteen hundred miles.

               <br />
               schools, under the charge of the Church Missionary Society, have been in 
               <br />
               existence some years. The Indians belonging to the bands I have named

               desired that the assistance promised should be given as soon as possible.
