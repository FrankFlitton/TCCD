               About three o ’,clock we were informed that the Indians had gathered, so 
               <br />
               we at once proceeded to meet them. The place we had chosen for the con- 
               <br />
               ference was on agranite plateau, and at one end our crews had erected a 
               <br />
               covering with boughs; a more suitable spot for the meeting could not be

               After inquiring if they had all gathered, and, being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ass'urred</span> that they 
               <br />
               had, we began to explain the object of our mission, but immediately saw 
               <br />
               that the bands were determined to be considered distinct and wished to be 
               <br />
               treated with separately, when we informed them that only one Chief would 
               <br />
               be allowed, and that before we could proceed any further we would require 
               <br />
               them all to meet together in council and there select one Chief and three 
               <br />
               Councillors, and be prepared to present them to us on the following day. 
               <br />
               This evidently gave great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfaction</span> to the Island Band, of which Ka-tuk- 
               <br />
               e-pin-ois was head man, but they all withdrew ; before doing so, agreeing to 
               <br />
               be ready the next day at noon to meet us. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Before the hour appointed for the meeting the next day, another dele- 
               <br />
               gation came over and informed us that the Indians were not yet prepared, 
               <br />
               that they could not come to any decision as to who should be Chief, and 
               <br />
               again asked to have the hour of meeting extended to three o’clock, which 
               <br />
               we did upon the understanding that if they were not then prepared we 
               <br />
               would return and report the facts to you. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Shortly after, we noticed Thickfoot and his Indians sitting near our tents, 
               <br />
               and evidently taking no part in the selection of a Chief, so we called him 
               <br />
               over and found him still disinclined to join the other Indians. He stated , 
               <br />
               that they would not have him as Chief, and that he would therefore remain 
               <br />
               away. We then explained that he could he head man of his band <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by,"</span> 
               <br />
               being elected a Councillor to whoever would be appointed Chief, and at last 
               <br />
               prevailing upon him to go with his Indians to the Council tent, we requested 
               <br />
               the Rev. Mr. Cochrane to proceed to the Indian encampment and state to 
               <br />
               them that from each band other than the one from which the chief was 
               <br />
               chosen, a Councillor would have to be taken. By this means we saw our 
               <br />
               way to satisfy all the bands, and Mr. Cochrane having notiﬁed the Indians 
               <br />
               accordingly, we felt conﬁdent the choice of a chief would soon be made ; but 
               <br />
               in this we were disappointed, as a messenger shortly after arrived and said 
               <br />
               no choice could be made, as Ka-tuk-e-pin-ais would do nothing unless he 
               <br />
               was chosen Chief. 0n hearing this Mr. Cochrane decided to visit the 
               <br />
               Indians in Council, and, having done so, proposed to them that they should 
               <br />
               elect a Chief by ballot, and having got them all to agree to this proposition, 
               <br />
               they proceeded to the election. Several ballots had to be taken, and at last 
               <br />
               resulted in favor of the chief Indian of the Blood Vein River band, Sa-ha- 
               <br />
               oha-way-us, and the Councillors elected were the head men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from.</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Big</span>
