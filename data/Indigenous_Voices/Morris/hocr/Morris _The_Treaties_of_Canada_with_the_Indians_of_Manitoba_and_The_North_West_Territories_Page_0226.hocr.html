               <br />
               ones were seen the next year. I told them the message from 
               <br />
               the Queen, and what she wished to do for them; in all four 
               <br />
               thousand Indians accepted the Treaty, and now, I am glad to say, 
               <br />
               many of them have homes and gardens of their own. The next 
               <br />
               year I went to Qu’Appelle and saw the Crees and Chippewas, 
               <br />
               and there five thousand understood us and took our hands.

               Last summer I went with Mr. McKay to Lake <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vinnipeg,</span> and

               there all the Swampy Crees accepted the Queen’s terms. Now

               “Three years ago a party of Assiniboines were shot by 
               <br />
               American traders; men, women and children were killed; we 
               <br />
               reported the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affair</span> to Ottawa; we said the tim has come when 
               <br />
               you must send the red-coated servantsof the Queen to the 
               <br />
               North-West to protect the Indian from ﬁre-water, from being 
               <br />
               shot down by men who know no law, to preserve peace between 
               <br />
               the Indians, to punish all who break the law, to prevent whites 
               <br />
               from doing wrong to Indians, and they are here today to do 
               <br />
               honor to the ofﬁce which I hold. Our Indian Chiefs wear 
               <br />
               red coats, and wherever they meet the police they will know 
               <br />
               they meet friends. I know that you have been told that if 
               <br />
               war came you would be put in the front, this is not so. Your 
               <br />
               brothers at Carlton asked me that they might not be forced to 
               <br />
               ﬁght, and .I. tell you, as I assured them, you will never be asked 
               <br />
               to fight against your will; and I trust the time will never 
               <br />
               come of war between the Queen and the great country near us.

               give you a last advice, hear my words, come and join the
