               they read my. face, and- through that my heart, and said my 
               <br />
               words were true, and they took my hand on behalf of the 
               <br />
               Queen. What they did I wish you to do; I wish you to travel 
               <br />

               and plain to the Rocky Mountains. I know you have been

               told many stories, some of them not true; do not listen to the 
               <br />
               bad voices of men who have their own ends to serve, listen 
               <br />
               rather to those who have only your good at heart. I have 
               <br />
               come a long way to meet you ; last year I sent you a message 
               <br />
               that you would be met this year, and I do not forget my

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">niece</span> I was a young man my heart was warm to the Indians,

               and I have taken a great interest in them 5 for more than 
               <br />
               twenty-ﬁve years I have studied their condition in the present 
               <br />
               and in the future. I have been many years in public life, but 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst words I spoke in public were for the Indians, and in

               that vision of the day I saw the Queen’s white men under- 
               <br />
               standing their duty; I saw them understanding that they had 
               <br />
               no right to wrap themselves up in a cold mantle of selﬁshness, 
               <br />
               that they had no right to turn away and say, ‘Am I my 
               <br />
               brother’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">keeper?’</span> On the contrary, I saw them saying, the 
               <br />
               Indians are our brothers, we must try to help them to make a 
               <br />
               living for themselves and their children. I tell you, you must 
               <br />
               think of those who will come after you. As I came here I saw 
               <br />
               tracks leading to the lakes and water-courses, once well beaten, 
               <br />
               now grown over with grass; I saw bones bleaching by the 
               <br />
               wayside; I saw the places where the buffalo had been, and _I
