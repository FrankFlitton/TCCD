               The Indians treated with, were a portion of the Cree and 
               <br />
               Saulteaux <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'gTribes,</span> and under its operations, about 75,000 
               <br />
               square miles of territory were surrendered. This treaty, was 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst step towards bringing the Indians of the Fertile Belt 
               <br />
               into closer relations with the Government of Canada, and was a 
               <br />
               much-needed one. In the year 1871, Major Butler was sent 
               <br />
               into the North-West Territories by the Government of Canada, 
               <br />
               to examine into and report, with regard to the state of affairs 
               <br />
               there. He reported, to Lieutenant-Governor Archibald, that 
               <br />
               “law and order are wholly unknown in the region of the 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, in so much, as the country is without any 
               <br />
               executive organization, and destitute of any means of enforcing 
               <br />
               the law.” Towards remedying this serious state of affairs, the 
               <br />
               Dominion placed the N orth-West Territories under the rule 
               <br />
               of the Lieutenant-Governor and Council of the Territories, the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, being, ex oﬁcio, Governor 
               <br />
               of the Territories. This body, composed of representative 
               <br />
               men, possessed executive functions, and legislative powers. 
               <br />
               They entered upon their duties with zeal, and discharged them 
               <br />
               with efﬁciency. Amongst other measures, they passed a pro- 
               <br />
               hibitory liquor law, which subsequently was practically adopted 
               <br />
               by a Statute of the Dominion. They proposed the establishment 
               <br />
               of a Mounted Police Force, a suggestion which was given force 
               <br />
               to by the Dominion Cabinet, and they recommended, that, treaties 
               <br />
               should be made, with the Indians at Forts Qu’Appelle, Carlton
