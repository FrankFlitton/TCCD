               a few hours before me, and having aBlackfoot Indian as guide, I abandoned 
               <br />
               my intention of going to Fort McLeod by Cypress Hills, and resolved to 
               <br />
               take the more direct and much shorter course by which that oﬂicer came.

               On Friday I had interviews with several parties on business, among whom 
               <br />
               were Red Pheasant, the Chief of the Battle River Crees, and a portion of 
               <br />
               his band. He desired explanations about the articles promised in the 
               <br />
               treaty of last year, and the reason they were so late in being forwarded. I 
               <br />
               explained that the unusually heavy rains in Manitoba and the eastern portion 
               <br />
               of the territories had made the travelling so bad that the freighters had not 
               <br />
               been able to overtake the journey in the time which they expected; that 
               <br />
               the Government were very sorry at the disappointment, as it was their 
               <br />
               desire to faithfully carry out all their promises. The ofﬁcers here had done 
               <br />
               their best to meet the difﬁculty and satisfy the Indians, though at no little 
               <br />
               expense to the country.

               The Chief appeared to be quite satisﬁed with the explanation, and after 
               <br />
               some further conversation about the reserve, which he desires to be located 
               <br />

               Inspector Walker having kindly given instructions to the non-commis-

               sioned ofﬁcer in charge of the Mounted Police in his absence, that every

               assistance in his power was to be afforded to me for continuing my journey, 
               <br />
               I was enabled to leave Battleford for Fort McLeod with Major Irvine, on 
               <br />
               the 25th August. Besides us two, the party consisted of four police con- 
               <br />
               stables, my personal servant and the guide.

               For the ﬁrst day we followed a trail leading southward, but afterwards 
               <br />
               our course was across the trackless plains until we approached near our 
               <br />
               destination. On the third day out we ﬁrst sighted buffalo, and every day sub- 
               <br />
               sequently that we travelled, except the last, we saw herds of the animals. 
               <br />
               Most of the herds, however, were small, and we remarked with regret that 
               <br />
               very few calves of this season were to be seen. We observed portions of 
               <br />
               many buffalo carcasses on our route, from not a few of which the peltries 
               <br />
               had not been removed. From this circumstance, as well as from the fact that 
               <br />
               many of the skins are made into parchments and coverings for lodges, and 
               <br />
               are used for other purposes, I concluded that the export of buffalo robes 
               <br />
               from the territories does not indicate even one-half the number of those 
               <br />
               valuable animals slaughtered annually in our country.

               Antelope, though not very abundant, are widely scattered over the plains. 
               <br />
               The numerous lakelets abound with water fowl. Some of the pools contain 
               <br />
               alkali, but we experienced no inconvenience on the journey from scarcity of 
               <br />
               fresh water. The grass in many places is short and thin, but in the hollows 
               <br />
               feed for horses is easily obtained. Altogether, though the plains are per- 
               <br />
               fectly treeless, not even a shrub being visible, a journey across them in ﬁne 
               <br />
               weather, such as we experienced, when the “ buffalo chips ” are sufﬁciently 
               <br />
               dry to make a good camp ﬁre, is not disagreeable.
