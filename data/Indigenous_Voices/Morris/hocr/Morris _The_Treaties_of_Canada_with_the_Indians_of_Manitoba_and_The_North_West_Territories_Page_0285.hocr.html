               Another had just begun farming, built six houses, two stables 
               <br />
               and a barn, and possess seven head of cattle. Still another 
               <br />
               had twenty-three houses and one hundred and ﬁfty acres under 
               <br />
               tillage, raising barley, wheat, potatoes and vegetables, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               instances, of the aptitude, the Indians are exhibiting, within so 
               <br />
               recent a period after the completion of the treaties, to avail 
               <br />
               themselves of obtaining their subsistence from the soil. Their 
               <br />
               desire to do so, should be cultivated to the fullest extent. 
               <br />
               They are, of course, generally ignorant of the proper mode of 
               <br />
               farming. In the year 1876, I reported to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister</span> of the 
               <br />
               Interior, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> David Mills, after my return from the 
               <br />
               negotiation of the treaties at Forts Carlton and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pitt,</span> “that 
               <br />
               measures ought to be taken to instruct the Indians in farming 
               <br />
               and building.” 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I said “that their present mode of living is passing away; 
               <br />
               the Indians are tractable, docile and willing to learn. I think 
               <br />
               that advantage should be taken of this disposition to teach 
               <br />
               them to become self-supporting, which can best be accomplished 
               <br />
               by the aid of a few practical farmers and carpenters to instruct 
               <br />
               them in farming and house-building.” 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               This view was corroborated by my succeSsor, Lieutenant- 
               <br />
               Governor Laird, who in 1878 reported from Battleford “that 
               <br />
               if it were possible to employ a few good, practical men to aid 
               <br />
               and instruct the Indians at seed time, I am of opinion that 
               <br />
               most of the bands on the Saskatchewan would soon be able to 
               <br />
               raise sufﬁcient crops to meet their most pressing wants.” 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It is satisfactory to know, that the Government of Canada, 
               <br />
               decided to act on these suggestions, at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">least</span> in part, and have 
               <br />
               during the past summer sent farm instructors into the Plain 
               <br />
               country. It is to be hoped, that this step may prove as fruit- 
               <br />
               ful of good results, as the earnest desire of the Indians to farm 
               <br />
               would lead us to believe it may be.
