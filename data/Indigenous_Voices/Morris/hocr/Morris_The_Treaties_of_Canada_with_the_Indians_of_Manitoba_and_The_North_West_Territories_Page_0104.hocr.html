               chosen our Chiefs; we have not appointed our soldiers and 
               <br />
               councillors ; we have not looked around us yet, and chosen our 
               <br />
               land, which I understand you to tell us to choose. We do not 
               <br />
               want to play with you, but we cannot appoint our Chiefs and 
               <br />
               head men quickly; that is in the way. Now it is near mid- 
               <br />
               day, and we cannot appoint our Chiefs. This Chief who got 
               <br />
               up last—the Queen’s name was used when he was appointed 
               <br />
               to be Chief—he wants to know where his land is to be and see 
               <br />
               it. what like it is to be, and to ﬁnd the number of his children; 
               <br />
               that is what is in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hisi</span> mind. He says he came from afar, he 
               <br />
               had a good mind for coming, and he takes the same good mind 
               <br />
               away with him. I have not heard him say to the Saulteaux to 
               <br />
               keep back their land.”

               <br />

               that if we do not agree it will ever be my good fortune to 
               <br />
               endeavor to do so again. “Loud Voice,” the Chief, has told us 
               <br />
               he wants a day to think it over. The Chief “Cote,” from the 
               <br />
               north, would like to go home, but I am sure he will stop a day 
               <br />
               and try to understand his brothers, and agree as the others did 
               <br />
               at the Lake of the Woods. I put my name, and the Chiefs and

               the head men put theirs, and I gave the Chief a copy, and I

               <br />
               written out, a true copy made on skin, that could not be

               rubbed out, that I would send a copy to his people so that 
               <br />
               when we were dead and gone the letter would be there to 
               <br />
               speak for itself, to show everything that was promised; and 
               <br />
               that was the right way to do. I did so, and sent a copy of the
