               In allowing the Indians to retain reservations of land for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their,own</span> use I 
               <br />
               was governed by the fact that they in most cases asked for such tracts as they 
               <br />
               had heretofore been in the habit of using for purposes of residence and culti- 
               <br />
               vation, and by securing these to them and the right of hunting and ﬁshing 
               <br />
               over the ceded territory, they cannot say that the Government takes from 
               <br />
               their usual means of subsistence and therefore have no claims for support, 
               <br />
               which they no doubt would have preferred, had this not been done. The 
               <br />
               reservation at Garden River is the largest and perhaps of most value, but as 
               <br />
               it is occupied by the most numerous band of Indians, and from its locality 
               <br />
               (nine miles from the Sault) is likely to attract others <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tofit,</span> I think it was 
               <br />
               right to grant what they expressed a desire to retain. There are two mining

               locations at this place, which should not be ﬁnally disposed of unless by the 
               <br />
               full consent of Shinguacouse and his band; they are in the heart of the vil- 
               <br />
               lage and shew no indications of mineral wealth, they are numbered 14 and 
               <br />
               15 on the small map appended to Messrs. Anderson and Vidal’s report. I 
               <br />
               pledged my word on the part of the Government that the sale of these loca- 
               <br />
               tions should not be completed, and as the locatees have not, I believe, com- 
               <br />
               plied with the conditions of the Crown Lands Department there can be no 
               <br />
               difﬁculty in cancelling the transaction.

               The chiefs are desirous that their several reservations should be marked

               <br />
               would probably send some one next spring for that purpose. As I know 
               <br />
               many of the localities I shall be able to give the necessary information when

               When at Sault Ste. Marie last May, I took measures for ascertaining as 
               <br />
               nearly as possible the number of Indians inhabiting the north shore of the 
               <br />
               two lakes; and was fortunate enough to get a very correct_census, particu- 
               <br />
               larly of Lake Superior. I found this information very useful at the council, 
               <br />
               as it enabled me successfully to contradict the assertion (made by those who 
               <br />
               were inciting the chiefs to resist my offers) that there were on Lake Superior 
               <br />
               alone, eight thousand Indians. The number on that lake, including eighty- 
               <br />
               four half-breeds, is only twelve hundred and forty—and on Lake Huron, 
               <br />
               about fourteen hundred and twenty-two, including probably two-hundred 
               <br />
               half-breeds; and when I paid the Indians they acknowledged they knew of 
               <br />
               no other families than those on my list. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The number paid, as appears on the pay list, does not show the whole 
               <br />
               strength of the different bands, as I was obliged <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">atZtheir</span> own request to 
               <br />
               omit some members of the very large families. I have annexed to this 
               <br />
               Report the names of the chiefs, their localities, and number of souls in each 
               <br />
               band as recognized by me in apportioning the money, thinking it will be use- 
               <br />
               ful when paying the annuity hereafter.

               This information may I believe be fully relied on for Lake Superior, but the
