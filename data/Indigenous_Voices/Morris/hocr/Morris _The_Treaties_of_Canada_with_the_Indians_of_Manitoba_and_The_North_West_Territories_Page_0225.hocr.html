               thought what will become of the Indian. I said to myself, we 
               <br />
               must teach the children to prepare for the future; if we do 
               <br />
               not, but a few suns will pass and they will melt away like 
               <br />
               snow before the sun in spring-time. You know my words are 
               <br />
               true; you see for yourselves and know that your numbers are 
               <br />
               lessening every year. Now the whole burden of my message 
               <br />
               from the Queen is that we wish to help you in the days that 
               <br />
               are to come, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> do not want to take away the means of living 
               <br />
               that you have now, we do not want to tie you down; we want 
               <br />
               you to have homes of your own where your children can be 
               <br />
               taught to raise for themselves food from the mother earth. 
               <br />
               You may not all be ready for that, but some, I have no doubt, 
               <br />
               are, and in a short time others will follow. I am here to talk 
               <br />
               plainly, I have nothing to hide; I am here to tell you what we 
               <br />
               are ready to do. Your tribe is not all here at the present time, 
               <br />
               some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the principal Chiefs are absent, this cannot be avoided, 
               <br />
               the country is wide and when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buffalo</span> come near you must 
               <br />
               follow them ; this does not matter, for what I have to give is 
               <br />
               for the absent as well as for the present. Next year if the 
               <br />
               treaty is made, a Commissioner will be sent to you, and you will 
               <br />
               be notiﬁed of the times and places of meeting, so that you will 
               <br />
               not have long journeys; after that, two or three servants of the 
               <br />
               Queen will be appointed to live in the country to look after 
               <br />
               the Indians, and see that the terms of the treaty are carried 
               <br />
               out. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i</span>

               “I have not yet given you my message. I know you have

               heard What your brothers did at Carlton, and I expect you to 
               <br />
               do the same here, for if you do not you will be the ﬁrst Indians 
               <br />
               who refused to take my hand. At Carlton I had a slight difﬁ- 
               <br />
               culty; one of the Chiefs dreamt that instead of making the 
               <br />
               treaty at the camp of the great body of the Indians, I made it 
               <br />
               at his, and so his people stood aside. I was sorry for him and 
               <br />
               his people. I did not wish to go and leave them out. I sent 
               <br />
               him word after I had made the treaty, and brought him in 
               <br />
               with the others. When I went to N orth-VVest Angle I met
