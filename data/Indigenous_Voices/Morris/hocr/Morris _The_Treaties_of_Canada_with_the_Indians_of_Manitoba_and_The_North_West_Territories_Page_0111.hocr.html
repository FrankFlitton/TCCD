               them. I offered you $1,000 although you are only one-half 
               <br />
               the number, as I do not think you number more than 2,000. 
               <br />
               Your proportionate share would be $750 which you shallreceive.

               Then at the Lake of the Woods each Chief had their head men; 
               <br />
               we have said you would have four who shall have ﬁfteen dol-

               <br />
               years, and each Chief on signing the treaty will receive a medal 
               <br />
               and the promise of a ﬂag. We cannot give you the ﬂag now, 
               <br />
               as there were none to be bought at Red River, but we have 
               <br />
               the medals here. Now I have told you the terms we gave at 
               <br />
               the North-West Angle of the Lake of the Woods, and you 
               <br />

               <br />
               we give as a present, and I have told you why we made the 
               <br />
               difference, and you will see that it was just. We had to speak 
               <br />
               with them for four years that had gone away. We speak to 
               <br />
               you only for four days. It was not that we came in the spirit of 
               <br />
               traders, but because we were trying to do What was just 
               <br />
               between you and the Queen, and the other Indians who would

               say that we had treated you better than we had treated them 
               <br />
               because we put the children of this year on the same footing 
               <br />
               as these children through whose land we had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> passing and 
               <br />
               running our steamboats for four years. You see when you ask 
               <br />
               us to tell you everything, we show you all that has been done, 
               <br />
               and I have to tell you again that the Ojibbeways at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lake</span>

               with a copy of those terms made at the North-West Angle 
               <br />
               with their nation, took the Queen’s hand by my messenger and 
               <br />
               made the same treaty. I think I have told you all you want
