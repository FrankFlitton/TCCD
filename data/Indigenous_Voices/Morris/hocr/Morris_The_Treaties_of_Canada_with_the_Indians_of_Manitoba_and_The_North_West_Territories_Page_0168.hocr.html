               Eventually the Commissioners made them an offer. They 
               <br />
               asked this to be reduced to writing, which was done, and they 
               <br />
               asked time to consider it, which was of course granted. When 
               <br />
               the conference resumed, they presented a written counter- 
               <br />
               proposal. This the Commissioners considered, and gave full 
               <br />
               and deﬁnite answers of acceptance or refusal to each demand, 
               <br />
               which replies were carefully interpreted, two of the Commis- 
               <br />
               sioners, Messrs. Christie and McKay, being familiar with the 
               <br />
               Cree tongue, watching how the answers were rendered, and 
               <br />
               correcting when necessary. The food question, was disposed 
               <br />

               <br />
               lence such aid as the Crown saw ﬁt would be extended to them, 
               <br />
               and that for three years after they settled on their reserves, 
               <br />
               provisions to the extent of $1,000 per annum would be granted 
               <br />

               The other terms were analogous to those of the previous 
               <br />
               treaties. The Crees accepted the revised prOposals. The treaty 
               <br />
               was interpreted to them carefully, and was then signed, and 
               <br />
               the payment made in accordance therewith. After the con- 
               <br />
               clusion of the treaty, the Comissioners were unwilling that 
               <br />
               the Willow Crees should remain out of the treaty, and sent a 
               <br />
               letter to them by a messenger, Pierre Levailler, that they would 
               <br />
               meet them half way, at the camp of the Hon. James McKay, 
               <br />
               and give them the opportunity of accepting the terms of the 
               <br />
               treaty already concluded. The letter was translated to the 
               <br />
               Indians by the Rev. Pere André, a Catholic missionary, who, 
               <br />
               as well as M. Levailler, urged the Indians to accede to the 
               <br />
               proposal made to them, which they agreed to do. The Com- 
               <br />
               missioners met the Indians accordingly, at the place proposed, 
               <br />
               and received, after a full discussion, the adhesion of the three 
               <br />
               Chiefs and head men of the Willow Crees to the treaty, and 
               <br />
               the payments were then made to them.
