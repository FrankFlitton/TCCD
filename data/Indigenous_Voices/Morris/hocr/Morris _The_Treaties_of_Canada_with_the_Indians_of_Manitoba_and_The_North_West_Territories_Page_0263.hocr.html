               GOVERNOR-——“ I fear Button Chief is asking too much. He 
               <br />
               has told us of the great good the Police have done for him and his 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trii,.-e</span> and throughout the country by driving away the whiskey 
               <br />
               traders, and now he wants us to pay the Chiefs fifty dollars 
               <br />
               and others thirty dollars per head, and to pay him for the 
               <br />
               timber that has been used. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vhy,</span> you Indians ought to pay 
               <br />
               us rather, for sending these traders in lire-water away and 
               <br />
               giving you security and peace, rather than we pay you for the 
               <br />
               timber used. (Here the Indians indulged in a general hearty 
               <br />
               laugh at this proposition.) \Ve cannot do you good and pay you 
               <br />
               too for our protection. Button Chief wants us to prevent the 
               <br />
               Crees and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I—Ialf-breeds</span> from coming in and killing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buffalo.</span> 
               <br />
               They too are the Queen’s children, as well as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Blackfeet</span> and 
               <br />
               Crecs. We have done all we can do in preventing the slay— 
               <br />
               ing of the young buffalo, and this law will preserve the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buli‘alo</span> 
               <br />
               for many years. Button Chief wishes to get the same every 
               <br />
               year as this year ; this we cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promise.</span> We cannot make 
               <br />
               a treaty with you every year. We will give you something to 
               <br />
               eat each year, but not so much as you will receive now. He 
               <br />
               says the Americans at ﬁrst gave the Indians many large sacks 
               <br />
               of ﬂour, and now they only receive a handful. From us you 
               <br />
               receive money to purchase what you may see fit ; and as your 
               <br />
               children increase yearly, you will get the more money in the 
               <br />
               future, as you are paid so much per head.
