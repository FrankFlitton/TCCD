               who were willing to treat, but that I would advise them to return to the 
               <br />
               council and reconsider their determination before next morning, when, if 
               <br />
               not, I should certainly leave. This brought matters to a crisis. The Chief 
               <br />
               of the Lac Seul band came forward to speak. The others tried to prevent 
               <br />
               him, but he was secured a hearing. He stated that he represented four 
               <br />
               hundred people in the north ; that they wished a treaty ; that they wished a 
               <br />
               school-master to be sent them to teach their children the knowledge of the 
               <br />
               white man; that they had begun to cultivate the soil and were growing 
               <br />
               potatoes and Indian corn, but wished other grain for seed and some 
               <br />
               agricultural implements and cattle. This Chief spoke under evident 
               <br />
               apprehension as to the Course he was taking in resisting the other Indians, 
               <br />
               and displayed much good sense and moral courage. He was followed by the 
               <br />
               Chief ‘ ‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Blackstone,”</span> who urged the other Chiefs to return to the council and 
               <br />
               consider my proposals, stating that he was ready to treat, though he did not 
               <br />
               agree to my proposals nor to those made to me. I then told them that I had 
               <br />
               known all along they were not united as they had said ; that they ought not 
               <br />
               to allow a few Chiefs to prevent a treaty, and that I wished to treat with 
               <br />
               them as a nation and not with separate bands, as they would otherwise 
               <br />
               compel me to do; and therefore urged them to return to'their council, 
               <br />
               promising to remain another day to give them time for consideration. They 
               <br />
               spent the night in council, and next morning having received a message 
               <br />
               from M. Charles Nolin, a French half-breed, that they were becoming more 
               <br />
               amenable to reason, I requested the Hon. James McKay (who went to the 
               <br />
               Angle three times to promote this treaty), Charles Nolin and Pierre Levaillier 
               <br />
               to go down to the Indian Council, and as men of their own blood, give them 
               <br />
               friendly advice. They accordingly did so, and were received by the Indians, 
               <br />
               and in about half an hour afterwards were followed by Messrs. Provencher 
               <br />
               and St. John, who also took part in the interview with the Council of Chiefs. 
               <br />
               The Chiefs were summoned to the conference by the sound of a bugle and 
               <br />
               again met us, when they told me that the determination to adhere to their 
               <br />
               demandshad been so strong a bond that they did not think it could be 
               <br />
               broken, but they had now determined to see if I would give them anything 
               <br />
               more. 
               <br />

               The Commissioners had had a conference, and agreed previously to offer 
               <br />
               a small sum for ammunition and twine for nets, yearly--a few agricultural 
               <br />
               implements and seeds, for any band actually farming or commencing to 
               <br />
               farm, and to increase the money payment by two dollars per head if it should 
               <br />
               be found necessary in order to secure a treaty, maintaining a permanent 
               <br />
               annuities at the sum ﬁxed. The Indians on the other hand had determined 
               <br />
               on asking ﬁfteen dollars, with some other demands. In ﬁxing the ten 
               <br />
               dollars the Commissioners had done so as a sum likely to be accepted in view 
               <br />
               of three dollars per head having been paid the Indians the ﬁrst year the 
               <br />
               Dawson route was used, and that they had received nothing since. In reply 
               <br />
               to the Indians, I told them I was glad that they had reconsidered their 
               <br />
               decision, and that as they had done so, being desirous of inducing them to
