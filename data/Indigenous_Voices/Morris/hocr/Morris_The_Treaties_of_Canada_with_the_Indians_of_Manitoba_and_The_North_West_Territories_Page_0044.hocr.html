               very happy to help in carrying out our great schemes. He 
               <br />
               was, he continued, one of the Commission employed by the 
               <br />
               Government to treat with them and devise a scheme whereby 
               <br />
               both white men and Indians would be beneﬁtted. We made 
               <br />
               to the Indians the proposals we were authorized to make, and 
               <br />
               we have carried out these proposals in good faith. This was 
               <br />
               three years ago. What <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'we</span> were directed to offer we did offer, 
               <br />
               but the Indians thought it was too little, and negotiations were 
               <br />
               broken <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off.</span> Since this I have done what was in my power to 
               <br />
               bring about this meeting with new terms, and consider it a very 
               <br />
               happy day that you should be assembled to meet the Governor 
               <br />
               of the Territory as representative of Her Majesty. He would 
               <br />
               explain to them the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposals</span> he had to make. He had lived 
               <br />
               long amongst them and would advise them as a friend to take 
               <br />
               the opportunity of making arrangements with the Governor. 
               <br />
               When we arrange the general matters in question, should you 
               <br />
               choose to ask anything, I shall be most happy to explain it, as 
               <br />
               I am here all the time.

               The Chief in reply said his head men and young men were 
               <br />
               of one mind, and determined not to enter upon the treaty until 
               <br />
               the promises made in the past were fulﬁlled, they were tired 
               <br />
               of- waiting. What the Commissioners called “small matters” 
               <br />
               were great to them, and were what they wished to have settled. 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               The route that had been built through the country proved 
               <br />
               this, and the Commissioners promised something which they 
               <br />
               now wanted. 
               <br />

               This was taking the Commissioners on a new tack, but Mr. 
               <br />
               Dawson promptly undertook to answer the objections. He 
               <br />
               said all these questions had been discussed before; but if he 
               <br />
               had made any promises that remained unfulﬁlled, he would be 
               <br />
               happy to learn their nature. The Chief replied that all the 
               <br />
               houses on the line, and all the big boats on the waters, were 
               <br />
               theirs, and they wanted to be recompensed for them.
