               On Thursday, pursuant to appointment, we again met the Indians, when 
               <br />
               the Chiefs and head men- of the several bands present were named and pre- 
               <br />
               sented. I then explained to them the nature of Indian reserves, and desired 
               <br />
               them to determine, in council among themselves, the locality in which they 
               <br />
               desired their reserves to be laid out.

               On Saturday, the 29th, we again met them, all having by this time arrived.

               When the subject of reserves came up, it was found that the Indians had 
               <br />
               misunderstood the object of these reservations, for their demands in this 
               <br />
               respect were utterly out of the question. After a prolonged discussion with 
               <br />
               them, I consulted with the Lieutenant~Governor, and determined to let 
               <br />
               them at once understand the terms that I was prepared to offer, and I pointed 
               <br />
               out that the terms offered were those which would receive Her Majesty’s 
               <br />
               consent. On further explanation of the subject, the Indians appeared to be 
               <br />
               satisﬁed, and willing to acquiesce in our arrangements as hereinafter men- 
               <br />
               tioned; and having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">givenl</span> them diagrams showing the size of the lots they 
               <br />
               would individually become possessed of, and having informed them of the 
               <br />
               amount of their annuity, it was ﬁnally settled that they should meet on 
               <br />
               Monday, the 31st, and acquaint me with their decision.
