               GOVERNOR—“ I have heard what has been said on behalf of 
               <br />
               the Red Pheasant. I ﬁnd fault that when there was handed 
               <br />
               me a list from the Indians, the Red Pheasant sat still and led 
               <br />
               me to believe he was a party to it. What I have offered was 
               <br />
               thought of long before I saw you; it has been accepted by 
               <br />
               others more in number than you are. I am glad that so many 
               <br />
               are of our mind. I am surprised you are not all. I hold out 
               <br />
               a full hand to you, and it will be a bad day for you and your 
               <br />
               children if I have to return and say that the Indians threw 
               <br />
               away my hand. I cannot accede to the requests of the Red 
               <br />
               Pheasant. I have heard and considered the wants of Mist-ow- 
               <br />
               asis and Ah-tuck~ah-coop, and when the people were spoken 
               <br />
               to I understood they were pleased. As for the little band who 
               <br />
               are not of one mind with the great body, I am quite sure that 
               <br />
               a week will not pass on leaving this before they will regret it. 
               <br />
               I want the Indians to understand that all that has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> 
               <br />
               is a gift, and they still have the same mode of living as before.”
