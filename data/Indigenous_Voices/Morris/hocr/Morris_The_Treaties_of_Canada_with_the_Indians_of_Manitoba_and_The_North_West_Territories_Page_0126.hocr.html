               I charged Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">McKay</span> to deliver it to them in their Council, which he 
               <br />
               did, when they denied having meant to send the message in the terms in 
               <br />
               which it was, and disclaimed all intended offence. The message had its

               desired effect, but their disclaimer was not correct, as Mr. Setter informs 
               <br />
               me that he had originally written a welcome to me, which they caused 
               <br />

               ing this, Yellow Quill and his Councillors came to Mr. McKay, and asked 
               <br />
               if I would not see them again, to which I consented. On proceeding to 
               <br />
               Mr. Provencher’s pay tent, I met the Chief, Yellow Quill. His spokesman 
               <br />
               rose, saying “ that they were glad to have met me, that they had found my 
               <br />
               words good; that they had not desired to offend the Queen or me, and were 
               <br />
               sorry ; that God had watched us during two days, and He was again look- 
               <br />
               ing on." I accepted their apology, and then proceeded to practical business.

               the whole tone and demeanor of the Indians being changed, having become 
               <br />
               cordial and friendly. I may mention here, that Yellow Quill reproached his 
               <br />
               Councillors for their conduct. He also informed Mr. McKay privately, 
               <br />
               that he could not act otherwise as he was in danger of his life from some of 
               <br />
               his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">own</span> “braves.” He was guarded all the time bya man armed with a 
               <br />
               bow and steel-pointed arrows. I promised to state their claims as to the 
               <br />
               reserve, but told them it would not be granted, but that I Would change the 
               <br />
               location of the reserve, as it had been selected without their approval, and 
               <br />
               would represent their view as to its locality, and as to crossing the river, 
               <br />
               the navigation of which, however, could not be interfered with. They
