               with the Governor preliminary to making the treaty this year, and that they 
               <br />
               were only then prepared to be treated with. I explained to the band how 
               <br />
               I had been present myself when it was made, and that I would have it read 
               <br />
               to them. I accordingly requested Mr. Cochrane to do so, explaining it 
               <br />
               thoroughly; yet, it was only after a great deal of talking on their part, 
               <br />
               during which they made most unreasonable demands, and many explanations 
               <br />
               on my part, that the Indians were satisﬁed that a treaty had been made, 
               <br />
               when they requested me to go on with the payments; at the same time a 
               <br />
               number of them stated that they had been misled by one of the counsellors, 
               <br />
               Joseph Atkinson by name. I then paid the annuity, distributed the 
               <br />
               provisions, tools, implements, etc., and gave the Chief a copy of the treaty, 
               <br />
               and, arranging to meet them again on Monday, the 28th, I returned to my 
               <br />
               camp at midnight. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               On Monday, I met them as agreed, and at once began and made inquiries 
               <br />
               as to who had houses and gardens on the north bank and had moved their 
               <br />
               houses to the south bank, and I found that all those that had formerly lived 
               <br />
               on the north bank had removed from there. I noticed that great feeling 
               <br />
               existed amongst them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alltas</span> to the division of the ﬁve hundred dollars 
               <br />
               granted. All <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{the</span> band congregated round me and the large majority 
               <br />
               desired that the amount should be divided equally between them all, and 
               <br />
               claimed that every one belonging to the band was entitled to participate in 
               <br />
               the division; so I thought it best to leave it to themselves to decide how the 
               <br />
               amount should be distributed, and they only succeeded in doing so after a 
               <br />
               great deal of talking, and, I regret to say, quarrelling; but they at last 
               <br />
               arranged it, and I was requested by the Chief and Councillors to divide it 
               <br />
               amongst the whole band in such proportions as I thought right, so I 
               <br />
               proceeded at once to what turned out to be a long and troublesome under- 
               <br />
               taking; but having as I considered made a fair and equitable distribution 
               <br />
               of the amount, I paid the same, had the document witnessed by the Chief 
               <br />
               and Councillors, and only got back to my camp again at midnight. As I 
               <br />
               before said, all the Indians had removed to the south bank of the river, but 
               <br />
               had made no preparations to build, and were merely living in tents. Close 
               <br />
               to the encampment, at the mouth of the river, the Church Missionary 
               <br />
               Society have put up a large building to answer the purposes of a church and 
               <br />
               school-house. Care must be taken and strict watch kept over this band. 
               <br />
               Living as they do on the bank of a navigable river, where people are 
               <br />
               constantly passing, they can give great trouble and annoyance, and, I am 
               <br />
               sorry to say, are inclined to do so. Several complaints were made to me 
               <br />
               while there, and I spoke to the Indians regarding them. They promised me 
               <br />
               to abide faithfully by the terms of the treaty henceforth and not give any 
               <br />
               further annoyance.

               While occupied paying the Indians there, my crew were engaged in taking 
               <br />
               my boat and supplies across the Portage. They left the camp early on 
               <br />
               Monday morning, and with the assistance kindly rendered them by Mr. 
               <br />
               Matheson, of the Hudson’s Bay Company, succeeded in reaching the north end
