               LIEUT.-GOV. MORRIS—Why are you here to-day? because we . 
               <br />
               asked you to come, because it was a good place to speak with 
               <br />
               them the reason we wished to see them. I am now quite will- 
               <br />
               ing to tell you all about Fort Pclly. The Queen heard that 
               <br />
               Americans had come into the country and were treating her 
               <br />
               Indian children badly. I myself sent her word that twenty- 
               <br />
               ﬁve of her Indian childien, men, women and children, had been. 
               <br />
               shot down by the American traders, then she resolved to pro- 
               <br />
               tect her red children, for that reason she has determined to 
               <br />
               have a body of men on horses as policemen to keep all bad 
               <br />
               people, white or red, in order. She will not allow her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">red'_</span> 
               <br />
               children to be made drunk and shot down again as some of . 
               <br />
               them were a few months ago. Now you ought to be glad that 
               <br />
               you have a Queen who takes such an interest in you. What 
               <br />
               are they doing now up at Fort Pelly? The men must have 
               <br />
               some place to live in this winter, they cannot live out of doors, 
               <br />
               and some men have gone to Fort Pelly to build houses for 
               <br />
               them, and the Queen expects that you will do all you can to 
               <br />
               help them because they are your friends. There was a treaty 
               <br />
               before and Indians are paid under it, but we were told as we 
               <br />
               passed Fort Ellice that there were a few Indians there who 
               <br />
               were not included in that treaty, and had never been paid, and 
               <br />
               they agreed to meet us when we go back. I do not quite 
               <br />
               understand another point. We have here Crees, Saulteaux,
