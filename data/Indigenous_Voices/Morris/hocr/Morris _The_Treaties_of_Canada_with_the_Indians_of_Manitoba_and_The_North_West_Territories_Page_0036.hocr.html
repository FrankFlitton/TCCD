               also an Indian reporter, whose duty was to commit to memory all that was

               Chene, to take notes in French of the negotiations, a copy of which notes I 
               <br />
               obtained from him and herewith enclose. The spokesmen informed me they 
               <br />
               would not treat as to the land until we settled with them as to the Dawson 
               <br />

               <br />
               which had not been kept, and that they had not been paid for the wood used 
               <br />
               in building the steamers, nor for the use of the route itself. Mr. Dawson 
               <br />
               explained that he had paid them for cutting wood, but had always asserted 
               <br />
               a common right to the use of wood and the water way. He asked them 
               <br />
               what promise had not been kept, and pointed out that the Government had 
               <br />
               twice before endeavored to treat with them for a settlement of all matters. 
               <br />
               He referred them to me as to the general question of the use of the route. 
               <br />
               They Were unable to name <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> promises which had not been kept. Thereupon 
               <br />
               I told them I came on behalf of the Queen and the Government of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada to treat with them with regard to the lands and all 
               <br />
               other matters, but that they refused to hear what I had to say; they had 
               <br />
               closed my mouth; and as we would not treat except for the settlement of all 
               <br />
               matters past and future I could not speak unless they asked me to do so.

               They conferred among themselves, and seeing that we were quite ﬁrm, the 
               <br />
               spokesman came forward and said that they would not close my mouth, after 
               <br />
               which they would make their demands. The Commissioners had had a 
               <br />
               conference and agreed, as they found there was no hope of a treaty for a less 
               <br />
               sum, to offer five dollars per head, a present of ten dollars, and reserves of 
               <br />
               farming and other lands not exceeding one square mile per family of ﬁve, or 
               <br />
               in that proportion, sums within the limits of our instructions, though I had 
               <br />
               private advices if possible not to give the maximum sum named, as the 
               <br />
               Government had been under a misapprehension as to amounts given to the 
               <br />
               bands in the United States. The Chiefs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heardpmy</span> proposal, and the meeting 
               <br />
               adjourned until next day. On the 3rd October the Chiefs again assembled 
               <br />
               and made a counter proposition, of which I enclose a copy, being the demand 
               <br />
               they have urged since 1869. I also enclose an estimate I had made of the 
               <br />
               money value of the demand, amounting to $125,000 per annum. On behalf 
               <br />
               of the Commissioners I at once peremptorily refused the demand. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Spokesmen</span> returned to the Chiefs, who were arranged 011 benches, the people 
               <br />
               sitting on the ground behind them, and 011 their return they informed me 
               <br />
               that the Chiefs, warriors and braves were of one mind, that they would 
               <br />
               make a treaty only if we acceded to their demand. I told them if so the 
               <br />
               conference was over, that I would return and report that they had refused 
               <br />
               to make a reasonable treaty, that hereafter I Would treat with those bands
