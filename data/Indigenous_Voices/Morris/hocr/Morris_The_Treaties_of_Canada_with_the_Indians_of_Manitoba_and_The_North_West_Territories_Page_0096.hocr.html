               LIEUT.-G0v. MORRIs-“ I wish our Indian brother had 
               <br />
               spoken before what was in his mind. He has been going here 
               <br />
               and there, and we never knew what he meant. I told you that 
               <br />
               many years ago the Queen’s father’s father gave the Company 
               <br />
               the right to trade in the country from the frozen ocean to the 
               <br />
               United States boundary line, and from the Atlantic Ocean to 
               <br />
               the Paciﬁc. The Company grew strong and wanted no one 
               <br />
               to trade in the country but themselves. The Queen’s people 
               <br />
               said, “no, the land is not yours, the Queen’s father’s father 
               <br />
               gave you rights to trade, it is time those rights should stop.” 
               <br />
               You may go on and trade like any other merchant, but as it 
               <br />
               was worth money to you to say to this trader you shall not 
               <br />
               buy furs at any post, the Queen would not act unjustly to the 
               <br />
               Company. She would not take rights away from them any 
               <br />
               more than from you; and to settle the question, she took all 
               <br />
               the lands into her own hands and gave the Company a sum of 
               <br />
               money in place of the rights which she had taken from them. 
               <br />
               She is ready to deal with you justly. We are here to-day to 
               <br />
               make to you her good offers. We have nothing to hide,
