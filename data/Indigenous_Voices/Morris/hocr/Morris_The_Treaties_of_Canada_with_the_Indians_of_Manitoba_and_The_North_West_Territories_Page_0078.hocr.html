               Queen’s servants, their Chief was not here. I thought that 
               <br />
               the Saulteaux <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could,</span> not have understood that the Queen had _

               sent her servants to see them, or they would have come to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> 
               <br />
               meet them. If Loud Voice or any other Chief came down 
               <br />
               to Fort Garry to see me, and I sent one of my servants to 
               <br />
               meet them instead of shaking hands with them, would they 
               <br />
               be pleased? I wanted you to meet me here to-day because I 
               <br />
               wanted to speak to you before the Great Spirit and before the 
               <br />
               world. I want both Urees and Saulteaux to know what I say. 
               <br />
               I told those who were here yesterday that we had a message 
               <br />
               from the Queen to them. Last year I made a treaty with the 
               <br />
               Indians, 4,000 in number, at the Lake of the Woods. To-day 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Queen</span> sends us here. I told you yesterday that she loves 
               <br />
               her red children, and they have always respected her and 
               <br />
               obeyed her laws. I zisked you yesterday, and ask you new, to 
               <br />
               tell me who would speak for you, and how many bands of each 
               <br />
               nation are represented here. I have heard that you are not 
               <br />
               ready to speak to me yet but do not know it, and I want you 
               <br />
               to say anything you have to say before all, and I will speak in 
               <br />
               the same way. What I have to talk about concerns you, your 
               <br />
               children and their children, who are yet unborn, and you must 
               <br />
               think well over it, as the Queen has thought well over it. What 
               <br />
               I want, is for you to take the Queen’s hand, through mine, and 
               <br />
               shake hands with her for ever, and now I want, before I say 
               <br />
               any more, to hear from the Chiefs if they are ready with their 
               <br />
               men to speak for them, and if they are not ready if they will 
               <br />
               be ready to-morrow.”
