               <br />
               content even if warfare did not result. The Indians, have a 
               <br />
               strong attachment to the localities, in which they and their 
               <br />
               fathers have been accustomed to dwell, and it is desirable to 
               <br />
               to cultivate this home feeling of attachment to the soil. More-

               <br />
               are carefully observed. Besides, the fact of the reserves being 
               <br />
               scattered throughout the territories, will enable the Indians to 
               <br />
               obtain markets among the white settlers, for any surplus -pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               desirable, to assign to each family parts of the reserve for their 
               <br />
               own use, so as to give them a sense of property in it, but all 
               <br />
               power of sale or alienation of such lands should be rigidly pro- 
               <br />
               hibited. Any premature enfranchisement of the Indians, or 
               <br />
               power given them to part with their lands, would inevitably 
               <br />
               lead to the speedy breaking up of the reserves, and the 
               <br />
               return of the Indians to their wandering mode of life, and 
               <br />
               thereby to the re-creation of a difﬁculty which the assignment 
               <br />
               of reserves was calculated to obviate. There is no parallel 
               <br />
               between the condition of the North-Western Indians, and that 
               <br />
