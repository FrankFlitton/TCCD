               The Commissioners went in the afternoon with the latter party, and be- 
               <br />
               fore the payments were commenced, presented the Chiefs with their medals, 
               <br />
               ﬂags and uniforms. The Stonies received us with quite a demonstration. 
               <br />
               They are a well-behaved body of Indians. The influence of the Christian

               band, to Treaty Number Six, and they were paid out of the funds which I

               <br />
               thanks. A large number of Indians were present. Mr. L’Heureux spoke 
               <br />
               On their behalf, and expressed their gratitude to the Commissioners gener- 
               <br />
               ally for the kind manner in which they conducted the negotiations, to me 
               <br />

               To this address the Commissioners feelingly replied, and expressed their 
               <br />
               conﬁdence that the Indians before them would not regret having agreed to 
               <br />
               the treaty.

               The Cree Chief and his band also waited upon us in the evening at my 
               <br />
               tent, and through Father Seollen, as interpreter, thanked us for the manner 
               <br />
               in which we had treated them. The presents sent for the Indians were 
               <br />
               distributed to each band, after payment. On Wednesday also the Com- 
               <br />
               missioners drove to see the coal seam about ﬁve miles east of the Blackfoot 
               <br />
               crossing. Under the guidance of Mr. French, they found an outcrop of the 
               <br />
               seam at a coulee some three miles south of the river. The seam there is 
               <br />
               from three to ten feet in thickness, and the coal, some of which was burned 
               <br />
               every day in the oﬂicers’ mess tent at the treaty, is of a very fair quality.
