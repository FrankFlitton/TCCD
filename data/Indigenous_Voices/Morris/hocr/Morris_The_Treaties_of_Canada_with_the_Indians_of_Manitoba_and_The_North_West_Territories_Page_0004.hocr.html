               <br />
               Lakes Huron and Superior, the Government of the late Pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               duty to the late Honorable William B. Robinson, who discharged' 
               <br />
               his duties with great tact and judgment, succeeding in making 
               <br />
               two treaties, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which,</span> were the forerunners of the future treaties, 
               <br />
               and shaped their course. The main features of the Robinson 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Treaties—viz,</span> annuities, reserves for the Indians, and liberty to

               <br />
               been followed in these treaties. A special feature of the Robin‘- 
               <br />
               son Treaties, was the adjustment of a claim made by the Indians 
               <br />
               to be paid, the amount received, by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘the</span> Government, for the sale 
               <br />
               of mining locations. This was arranged, by Mr. Robinson, 
               <br />
               agreeing to pay them, the sum of £4,000 and an annuity of 
               <br />
               about £1,000, thus avoiding any dispute that might arise as 
               <br />
               to the amounts actually received by the Government. The 
               <br />
               number of Indians included in the treaties were stated by Mr. 
               <br />
               Robinson to be: on Lake Superior, 1240, including 84 half- 
               <br />
               breeds; and on Lake Huron 1422, including 200 half-breeds.* 
               <br />
               The relations of the Indians and half-breeds, have long been 
               <br />
               cordial; and in the negotiations as to these initial treaties, as 
               <br />
               in the subsequent ones, the claims of the half-breeds, to recog- 
               <br />
               nition, was urged by the Indians.
