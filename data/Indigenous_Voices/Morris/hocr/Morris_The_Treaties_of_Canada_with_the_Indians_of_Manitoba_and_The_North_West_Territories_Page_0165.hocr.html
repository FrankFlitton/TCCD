               <br />
               plain. Not many years ago we attributed a prairie ﬁre to the malevolence 
               <br />
               of an enemy, now every one is reckless in the use of ﬁre, and every year

               large numbers of valuable animals and birds perish in consequence. We 
               <br />
               would further ask that our chiefships be established by the Government. 
               <br />
               Of late years almost every trader sets up his own Chief and the result is we

               I will state in connection with this, some of the false reports I had 
               <br />
               to combat in passing through this country, all calculated to agitate th 
               <br />
               native mind. In the neighborhood of Carlton an interested <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">party</span> went to 
               <br />
               considerable trouble to inform the Willow Indians that I had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">33,000</span> for 
               <br />
               each band, as a present from the Government, and nothing in my long jour- 
               <br />
               ney gave me greater satisfaction than the manner in which these Indians 
               <br />
               received my explanation of the contents of my letter of instructions. At 
               <br />
               the Buffalo Lake I found both Indians and Half-breeds greatly agitated. A 
               <br />
               gentlemen passing through their country had told them that the Mounted 
               <br />
               Police had received orders to prevent all parties killing buffalo or other 
               <br />
               animals, except during three months in the year, and these are only samples 
               <br />
               of the false statements made by parties who would rejoice to witness a con

               ﬂict of races.

               <br />

               listening to 'the statements of all parties concerned, my opinion is, that an
