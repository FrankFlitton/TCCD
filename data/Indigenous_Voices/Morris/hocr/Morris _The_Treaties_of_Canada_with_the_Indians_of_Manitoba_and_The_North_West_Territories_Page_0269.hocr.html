               refused to go away—giving as a reason the inability of the old 
               <br />
               men, women and children, to travel in the winter. The Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor was in consequence authorized by the Council, to offer 
               <br />
               them the means of transport, for those who were unable to walk. 
               <br />
               The Indians then removed to White Horse Plains, a distance 
               <br />
               of twenty miles only from Fort Garry, and camped there. A 
               <br />
               supply of food was given them, but no ammunition. The 
               <br />
               United States military authorities in December, 1863, sent an 
               <br />
               envoy to see the Governor-in-Chief of Rupert’s Land, and the 
               <br />
               N orth-VVest Territories, with a view to ordering the Sioux to 
               <br />
               return to United States territory. The Governor was assured, 
               <br />
               that, though the American authorities would punish such of 
               <br />
               the Sioux as had actually been engaged in the massacre, they 
               <br />
               would furnish the innocent with all needful supplies of food 
               <br />
               and clothing for the winter, in the event of giving themselves 
               <br />
               up peaceably. The Council, on hearing this statement, author- 
               <br />
               ized the granting permission to the American authorities to 
               <br />
               enter into negotiations with the Sioux in the territories, on 
               <br />
               condition that they adopted no aggressive measures against 
               <br />
               them, and that in the event of the Americans accepting the 
               <br />
               proposed permission, they should protect themselves by a suf- 
               <br />
               ﬁcient guard to preclude the danger of attack from the In- 
               <br />
               dians, and to ensure the preservation of peace.

               In January, 1864, the Council considered a despatch from 
               <br />
               Major Hatch, in command of the American forces, represent- 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the barbarous scenes of 1862 and 1863, and asked author-

               not likely that a permission to cross our borders in pursuit of 
               <br />
               a ﬂying enemy would ever again be granted. It was conceded

               in exceptional circumstances by an irresponsible Government,

               its relations to the empire have become so intimate, that it
