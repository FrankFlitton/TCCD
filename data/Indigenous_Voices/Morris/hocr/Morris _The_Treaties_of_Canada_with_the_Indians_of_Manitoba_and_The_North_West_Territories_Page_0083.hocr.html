               woman and child, as long as the sun shines and water ﬂows. 
               <br />
               We are ready to promise to give $1,000 every year, for twenty 
               <br />
               years, to buy powder and shot and twine, by the end of which 
               <br />
               time I hope you will have your little farms. If you will settle 
               <br />
               down we would lay off land for you, a square mile for every 
               <br />
               family of ﬁve. Whenever you go to a Reserve, the Queen will 
               <br />
               be ready to give you a school and schoolmaster, and the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment will try to prevent ﬁre-water from being sent among 
               <br />
               you. If you shake hands with us and make a treaty, we are 
               <br />
               ready to make a present at the end of the treaty, of eight dollars 
               <br />
               for every man, woman and child in your nations. We are ready 
               <br />
               also to give calico, clothing and other presents. We are ready 
               <br />
               to give every recognized Chief, a present of twenty-ﬁve dollars, 
               <br />
               a medal, and a suit of clothing. We are also ready to give the 
               <br />
               Chief’s soldiers, not exceeding four in each band, a present of 
               <br />
               ten dollars, and next year and every year after, each chief will 
               <br />
               be paid twenty-ﬁve dollars, and his chief soldiers not exceeding 
               <br />
               four in each band, will receive ten dollars. Now I think that 
               <br />
               you see that that the Queen loves her red children, that she 
               <br />
               wants to do you good, and you ought to show that you think 
               <br />
               so. I cannot believe that you will be the ﬁrst Indians, the 
               <br />
               Queen’s subjects, who will not take her by the hand. The 
               <br />
               Queen sent one of her councillors from Ottawa, and me, her 
               <br />
               Governor, to tell you her mind. I have opened my hands 
               <br />
               and heart to you. It is for you to think of the future of 
               <br />
               those who are with you now, of those who are coming after 
               <br />
               you, and‘may the Great Spirit guide you to do what is right. 
               <br />
               I have only one word more to say. The last time I saw you I 
               <br />
               was not allowed to say all Lwanted to say until you went away. 
               <br />
               What I wanted to say is this, I have put before you our mes- 
               <br />
               sage, I want you to go back to your tents and think over what 
               <br />
               I have said and come and meet me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tomorrow.</span> Recollect that 
               <br />
               we cannot stay very long here. I have said all.”
