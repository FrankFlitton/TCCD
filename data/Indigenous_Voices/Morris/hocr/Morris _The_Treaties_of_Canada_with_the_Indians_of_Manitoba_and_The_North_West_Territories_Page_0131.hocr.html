               One of them then signed, but the other persistently refused. I repeated 
               <br />
               my warning, and at length he reluctantly came forward and said he wished 
               <br />
               to ask me a question, “ Would the head men be paid ?” I told him I had 
               <br />
               no authority to do so, but would report his request. He said he did not 
               <br />
               expect it this year, but hoped for it next. Eventually he signed the agree- 
               <br />
               ment. I then said I would recognize <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Short</span> Bear as a Chief, and asked him 
               <br />
               to select his Councillors and braves. He did so at once, making a judicious 
               <br />
               choice, and came forward to touch the pen, saying, “ I thank you for my 
               <br />
               people. ” His Councillors promptly followed, one of them asking for a part 
               <br />
               of the reserve on the other side of the river, which I refused. I then called 
               <br />
               on the White Mud River Indians to select a Chief and one Councillor, 
               <br />
               being under the impression at the time that they were the least numerous 
               <br />
               band, which, however, has turned out not to be the case, which they did at 
               <br />
               once, and on their being presented to me they signed the agreement. I 
               <br />
               then gave a medal to Yellow Quill, and promised to send the other two 
               <br />
               Chiefs medals when procured from Ottawa, the supply here being exhausted. 
               <br />
               To the Chiefs and Councillors suits of clothing were then distributed, Yel- 
               <br />
               low Quill and his head men having hitherto refused to accept either medals 
               <br />
               or coats, but now taking them. Yellow Quill then presented me with a 
               <br />
               skin coat, and said that he parted with the Other Indians as friends, and 
               <br />
               that there would be no hard feelings. The conference then broke up, and 
               <br />
               thus terminated a difﬁculty which has existed for several years, and the 
               <br />
               inﬂuence of which was felt as an obstacle, as you are aware, at Qu’Appelle

               when the treaty was made there. Mr. Graham at once commenced the 
               <br />
               payments, and during the evening the three Chiefs and their Councillors 
               <br />
               called on me, evidently being on the most friendly terms with each other, 
               <br />
               a state of things which had not existed for a considerable period. In the 
               <br />
               morning, as I was leaving for the Portage, the Indians assembled near my 
               <br />
               waggon and gave three checrs for the Queen and three for the Governor, 
               <br />
               and I then drove off amid a salute of ﬁrearms from all sections of the 
               <br />
               encampment. I left Mr. Graham to complete the payments, and here 
               <br />
               record my sense of the efﬁcient services he rendered me. He understands 
               <br />
               the Indian character, and gets on well with them. I requested Mr. Reid 
               <br />

               Yellow Quill is to go without delay to look up a reserve, and as there are 
               <br />
               no settlers in the region in question, I propose that if Mr. Reid sees no 
               <br />
               objection to the locality he should at once lay it off, so as to effectually ter-

               <br />
               telegram your approval of his doing so. The interpreters, Mr. Cummings
