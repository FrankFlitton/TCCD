               band of Saulteaux had assembled on the 26th, and met the Indians next day, 
               <br />
               explaining to them our mission, and telling them what I was empowered to 
               <br />
               promise them. This band, as you are aware, has always been dissatisﬁed, 
               <br />
               and have been difﬁcult to deal with. I found them in an intractable frame 
               <br />
               of mind, and the difﬁculty of the position was enhanced by a division 
               <br />
               amongst themselves.

               The original Chief of the Portage band was Pee-quah-kee-quah, who was 
               <br />
               a party to the treaty with Lord Selkirk. On his death he was succeeded 
               <br />
               by his son, who died some years ago, leaving a boy, who has now grown up. 
               <br />
               Yellow Quill was appointed chief by the Hudson’s Bay Company when 
               <br />
               Pee-quah-kee-quah’s son died. The grandson is now grown up and has 
               <br />
               returned from the plains, where he has been, and claims to be recognized as an 
               <br />
               hereditary chief, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> about half the band have followed his lead. After we 
               <br />
               had been in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.3</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mt;-</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> some time, an Indian rose and told me that when the 
               <br />
               chief of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1-</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eta-ye</span> died, he charged him to keep the land for his son, and 
               <br />
               that they wished a reserve at the Portage. Another rose and produced Pee- 
               <br />
               quah-kee-quah’s King George medal, and said the chief had placed it in his 
               <br />
               keeping and charged him to deliver it to his son, when he was old enough 
               <br />
               to be a chief, and then placed it round the neck of Kes-kee-maquah, or the 
               <br />
               Short Bear. They then asked that I should receive him as a chief, in place 
               <br />
               of Yellow Quill. I told them that could not be done. That Yellow Quill must 
               <br />
               remain a chief, but that I would report their request on behalf of the young 
               <br />
               chief to the Government at Ottawa and let them know their decision, but 
               <br />
               that they could get no reserve at the Portage, as only that mentioned in the 
               <br />
               treaty would be given, and with this they were satisﬁed. The conference 
               <br />
               then went on, the two parties sitting apart and holding no intercourse with 
               <br />
               each other. I spent two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">days.</span> with them, making no progress, as they 
               <br />
               claimed that a reserve thirt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mile-</span> by twenty was promised them, as shewn in 
               <br />
               the rough sketch <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enclosed,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1:.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ads,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> their dictation and marked ‘ ‘ A. ” I pro-

               duced the plan of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reserve.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as.</span> proposed to be allotted to them, containing 
               <br />
               34,000 acres, but Yellow Quill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> was not in the right place. and was not 
               <br />
               what was promised, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">morever</span> it was not surrounded by the belt of ﬁve 
               <br />
               miles, mentioned in the treaty, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span> was only partially so, and did not cross the 
               <br />
               river. I told them they could get no more land than was promised in the 
               <br />
               treaty. They appealed to Mr. McKay whether the Reserve was not pro- 
               <br />
               mised to be on both sides cf the river, and he admitted that it was. I told 
               <br />
               them it was not so written in the treaty, and that if the Government should 
               <br />
               allow it to cross the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rive":</span> the rights of navigation must be conserved, but I 
               <br />
               would consult the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Queen‘s</span> Councillors. They replied that they would go to 
               <br />
               the “ Grand Father ” and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gm;</span> him to intercede for them, meaning the “ Pre- 
               <br />
               sident of the United States.” as I afterwards discovered, an American 
               <br />
               Indian having persuaded them to take this course.
