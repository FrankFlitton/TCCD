               feared and shunned, and even injured, whenever this could be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">donehwith</span> 
               <br />
               impunity. I am not now describing the Blackfeet of the present day, but 
               <br />
               those of ﬁfteen years ago, when I ﬁrst saw them. They were then a proud, 
               <br />
               haughty, numerous people (perhaps ten thousand on the British side of the 
               <br />
               line), having a regular politico-religious organization by which their thirst 
               <br />
               for blood and their other barbarous passions were constantly ﬁred to the high- 
               <br />
               est pitch of frenzy. Since that time their number has decreased to less than 
               <br />
               one half, and their systematic organizations have fallen into decay ; in fact 
               <br />
               they have been utterly demoralized as a people. This sudden decadence 
               <br />
               was brought on by two causes: 1. About ten years ago the Americans 
               <br />
               crossed the line and established themselves on Pelly River, where they 
               <br />
               carried on to an extraordinary extent the illicit traﬂic in intoxicating 
               <br />
               liquor to the Blackfeet. The ﬁery water ﬂowed as freely, if I may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">use“</span> the 
               <br />
               metaphor, as the streams running from the Rocky Mountains, and hundreds 
               <br />
               of the poor Indians fell victims to the white man’s craving for money, some 
               <br />
               poisoned, some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">frozen</span> to death whilst in a state of intoxication, and many 
               <br />
               shot down by American bullets. 2. Then in 1870 came that disease so 
               <br />
               fatal to Indians, the small-pox, which told upon the Blackfeet with terrible 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect,</span> destroying between six hundred and eight hundred of them. Sur- 
               <br />
               viving relatives went more and more for the use of alcohol; they endea- 
               <br />
               voured to drown their grief in the poisonous beverage. They sold their 
               <br />
               robes and their horses by the hundred for it, and now they began killing one 
               <br />
               another, so that in a short time they were divided into several small parties, 
               <br />
               afraid to meet. Fortunately for them the Government were aware of the 
               <br />
               state of affairs in the country and did not remain indifferent to it ; and, as I 
               <br />
               have heard yourself explain to the Indians, Her Gracious Majesty has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> 
               <br />
               heart the welfare of even the most obscure of her subjects. In the sum- 
               <br />
               mer of 1874, I was travelling amongst the Blackfeet. It was painful to me 
               <br />
               to see the state of poverty to which they had been reduced. Formerly they 
               <br />
               had been the most opulent Indians in the country, and now they were 
               <br />
               clothed in rags, without horses and without guns. But this was the year of 
               <br />
               their salvation ; that very summer the Mounted Police were struggling 
               <br />
               against the difﬁculties of a long journey across the barren plains in order to 
               <br />
               bring them help. This noble corps reached their destination that same fall, 
               <br />
               and with magic effect put an entire stop to the abominable trafﬁc of whiskey 
               <br />
               with the Indians. Since that time the Blackfeet Indians are becoming 
               <br />
               more and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> prosperous. They are now well clothed and well furnished 
               <br />
               with horses and guns. During the last two years I have calculated that they 
               <br />
               have bought two thousand horses to replace those they had given for whiskey. 
               <br />
               They are forced to acknowledge that the arrival of the Red Coats has been 
               <br />
               to them the greatest boon. But, although they are externally so friendly to 
               <br />
               the Police and other strangers who now inhabit their country, yet under- 
               <br />
               neath this friendship remains hidden some of that dread which they have 
               <br />
