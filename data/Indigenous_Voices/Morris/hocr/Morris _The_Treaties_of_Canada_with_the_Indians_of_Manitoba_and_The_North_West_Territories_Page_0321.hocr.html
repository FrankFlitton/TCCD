               SIR,—I beg leave to inform you that, after the treaty had been concluded 
               <br />
               With certain bands of the Saulteaux tribe of the Ojibbeway Indians, at the 
               <br />
               north-west angle of the Lake of the Woods, by arrangements made with 
               <br />
               my associate Commissioners, His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba and the North-West Territories, and Mr. Provencher, I came eastward 
               <br />
               and convened the leading people of the remaining bands at Shebandowan 
               <br />
               where they also, through their Chiefs, accepted and signed the treaty. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I have much satisfaction in saying that these Indians were most friendly 
               <br />
               in their bearing, and desired me to convey to the Government their cordial 
               <br />
               expressions of loyalty to their Great Mother, Her Majesty the Queen. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               They took some time to deliberate over the provisions of the treaty and 
               <br />
               asked me occasionally to explain certain passages, more especially those in 
               <br />
               relation to the reserves. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Before signing it they comprehended perfectly the nature of the obligations 
               <br />
               into which they were about to enter, that the surrender of their territorial 
               <br />
               rights would be irrevocable. and that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Were</span> to stand forever afterwards
