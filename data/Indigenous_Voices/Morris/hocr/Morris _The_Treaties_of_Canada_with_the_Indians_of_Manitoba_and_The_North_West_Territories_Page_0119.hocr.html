               Indians, they had an additional grievance, which they pressed 
               <br />
               with much pertinacity. To obtain their adhesion to Treaty 
               <br />
               Number One, the Commissioners had given them preferential 
               <br />
               terms in respect to their reserve, and the wording in the treaty 
               <br />
               of these terms enhanced the difﬁculty. The language used was 
               <br />
               as follows: “And for the use of the Indians of whom Oo—za- 
               <br />
               we-kwan is Chief, so much land on the south and east side of 
               <br />
               the Assiniboine, as will furnish one hundred and sixty acres 
               <br />
               for each family of ﬁve, or in that proportion for larger or 
               <br />
               smaller families, reserving also a further tract enclosing said 
               <br />
               reserve, to contain an equivalent to twenty-ﬁve square miles 
               <br />
               of equal breadth, to be laid out around the reserve.” The 
               <br />
               enclosure around the homestead reserve led to extravagant 
               <br />
               demands by them. They did not understand its extent, and 
               <br />
               claimed nearly half of the Province of Manitoba under it. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The Indians constantly interviewed the Lieutenant-Governor 
               <br />
               on the subject, and when the Hon. Mr. Laird, then Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior, visited Manitoba, they twice pressed their 
               <br />
               demands upon him. The Government requested the Hon. 
               <br />
               Messrs. Morris and McKay to endeavor to settle the long 
               <br />
               pending dispute, and they proceeded to the Round Plain on 
               <br />
               the river Assiniboine with that view. They met the Indians, 
               <br />
               some ﬁve hundred in number, but without result. The Indians 
               <br />
               were divided among themselves. A portion of the band had 
               <br />
               forsaken Chief Yellow Quill and wished the recognition of the 
               <br />
               Great Bear, grandson of Pee-qual—kee-quash, a former chief of 
               <br />
               the band. The Yellow Quill band wanted the reserve assigned 
               <br />
               in one locality 3 the adherents of the Bear said that place was 
               <br />
               unsuited for farming, and they wished it to be placed at the 
               <br />
               Round Plain, where they had already commenced a settlement. 
               <br />
               The land to which they were entitled under the treaty was 
               <br />
               34,000 acres, but their demands were excessive. 
               <br />

               The Chief Yellow Quill was apprehensive of his own follow-

               <br />
               was imminent. The Commissioners ﬁnally intimated to the
