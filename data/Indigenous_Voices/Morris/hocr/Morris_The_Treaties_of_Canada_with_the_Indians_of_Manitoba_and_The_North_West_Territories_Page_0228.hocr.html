               After waiting some time the Governor said, “I had hoped 
               <br />
               the Indians would have taken me at my word, and taken me 
               <br />
               as a brother and a friend. True, I am the Queen’s Governor; 
               <br />
               that I am here to-day shows me to be your friend. Why can 
               <br />
               you not open your hearts to me? I have met many Indians 
               <br />
               before, but this is the ﬁrst time I have had all the talking to 
               <br />
               do myself. Now, cast everything behind your backs, and 
               <br />
               speak to me face to face. I have offered as we have done to 
               <br />
               the other Indians. Tell me now whether you will take my 
               <br />
               hand and accept it; there is nothing to be ashamed of, nothing 
               <br />
               to be afraid of; think of the good of your children and your 
               <br />
               children’s children. Stand up now like wise men and tell me 
               <br />
               if you will take what I offered. I cannot believe it to be 
               <br />
               possible that you would throw my hand back. Speak and do 
               <br />
               not be afraid or ashamed.

               WEE-KAs-Koo-KEE-SAY-YIN (Sweet Grass)——“ I thank you for 
               <br />
               this day, and also I thank you for what I have seen and 
               <br />
               heard, I also thank the Queen for sending you to act for our 
               <br />
               good. I am glad to have a brother and friend in you, which 
               <br />
               undoubtedly will raise us above our present condition. I am 
               <br />
               glad for your <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offers,</span> and thank you from my heart. I speak 
               <br />
               this in the presence of the Divine Being. It is all for our 
               <br />
               good, I see nothing to be afraid of, I therefore accept of it 
               <br />
               gladly and take your hand to my heart, may this continue as 
               <br />
               long as this earth stands and the river ﬂows. The Great King, 
               <br />
               our Father, is now looking upon us this day, He regards all 
               <br />
               the people equal with one another; He has mercy on the whole 
               <br />
               earth; He has opened a new world to us. I have pity on all 
               <br />
               those who have to live by the buffalo. If I am spared until 
               <br />
               this time next year I want this my brother to commence to act 
               <br />
               for me, thinking thereby that the buffalo may be protected. 
               <br />
               It is for that reason I give you my hand. If spared, I shall 
               <br />
               commence at once to clear a small piece of land for myself, 
               <br />
