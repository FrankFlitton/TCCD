               In the old provinces of Canada from which I came we have 
               <br />
               many Indians, they are growing in numbers and are as a rule 
               <br />
               happy and prosperous; for a hundred years red and white 
               <br />
               hands have been clasped together in peace. The instructions 
               <br />
               of the Queen are to treat the Indians as brothers, and so we 
               <br />
               ought to be. The Great Spirit made this earth we are on. He 
               <br />
               planted the trees and made the rivers ﬂow for the good of all 
               <br />
               his people, white and red; the country is very wide and there 
               <br />
               is room for all. It is six years since the Queen took back into 
               <br />
               her own hands the government of her subjects, red and white, 
               <br />
               in this country; it was thought her Indian children would be 
               <br />
               better cared for in her own hand. This is the seventh time 
               <br />
               in the last ﬁve years that her Indian children have been 
               <br />
               called together for this purpose; this is the fourth time that 
               <br />
               I have met my Indian brothers, and standing here on this 
               <br />
               bright day with the sun above us, I cast my eyes to the East 
               <br />
               down to the great lakes and I see a broad road leading from 
               <br />
               there to the Red River, I see it stretching on to Ellice, I 
               <br />
               see it branching there, the one to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Q'i.’Appelle</span> and Cypress Hills, 
               <br />
               the other by Pelly to Carlton; it is a wide and plain trail. 
               <br />
               Anyone can see it, and on that road, taking for the Queen, the 
               <br />
               hand of the Governor and Commissioners I see all the Indians. 
               <br />
               I see the Queen’s Councillors taking the Indian by the hand 
               <br />
               saying we are brothers, we will lift you up, we will teach you, 
               <br />
               if you will learn, the cunning of the white man. All along 
               <br />
               that road I see Indians gathering. I see gardens growing and 
               <br />
               houses building; I see them receiving money from the Queen’s 
               <br />
               Commissioners to purchase clothing for their children; at the 
               <br />
               same time I see them enjoying their hunting and fishing as 
               <br />
               before, I see them retaining their old mode of living with the 
               <br />
               Queen’s gift in addition. '
