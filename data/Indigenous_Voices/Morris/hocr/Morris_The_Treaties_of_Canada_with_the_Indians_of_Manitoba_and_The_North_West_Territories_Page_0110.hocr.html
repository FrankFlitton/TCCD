               the same terms which were given at the Lake of the Woods. 
               <br />
               (The Indians assented.) I have the Treaty here in a book. 
               <br />
               You must know that the steamboats had been running through 
               <br />
               their waters, and our soldiers had been marching through their 
               <br />
               country, and for that reason we offered the Ojibbeways a larger 
               <br />
               sum than we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> you. Last year it wasa present, covering 
               <br />
               ﬁve years ; with you it was a present for this year only. I paid 
               <br />
               the Indians there a present in money down of twelve dollars 
               <br />
               per head. I have told you why we offered you less, and you 
               <br />
               will see there were reasons for it. That is the greatest differ- 
               <br />
               ence between what we offered you and what was paid them, 
               <br />
               but on the other hand there were some things promised you 
               <br />
               that were not given at the Lake of the Woods. (His Honor 
               <br />
               then explained the terms granted in that Treaty.) We 
               <br />
               promised there that the Queen would spend $1,500 per year to 
               <br />
               buy shot and powder, ball and twine. There were 4,000 of
