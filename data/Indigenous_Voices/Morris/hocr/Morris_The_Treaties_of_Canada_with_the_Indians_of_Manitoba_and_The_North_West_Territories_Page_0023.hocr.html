               Garry, where I met His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor.

               <br />
               Swampies and Chippewas residing on what is known as the Indian Reserve, 
               <br />

               <br />
               meeting for the next day at twelve o’clock, for the purpose of ascertaining 
               <br />

               <br />
