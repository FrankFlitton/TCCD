               <br />
               have a brother and a friend who would help to lift them up above their pre-

               God was looking down on us that day, and had opened a new world to them.

               <br />
               that if spared until this time next year, he wanted, this my brother <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(tie.</span> the

               <br />

               Mr. Christie, then chief factor of the Hudson’s Bay Company, gave him

               <br />

               <br />
               trees. Mr. Christie also gave him a pit-saw and a grind-stone, and he 
               <br />
               was still using them. His heart was sore in spring when his children

               wanted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘plough</span> and had no implements. He asked for these as soon as

               possible, and referring to the Wesleyan mission at that place, he said by 
               <br />

               rights, it is the help of God that put it into her heart. He wished an ever-
