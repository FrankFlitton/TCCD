               <br />
               received their annuities, should be paid in full at once, but that a period of 
               <br />
               two years should be ﬁxed for those bona ﬁde members of the band to come in 
               <br />

               you wished, to survey the reserve. Owing to the prevalence of heavy rain

               the roads were in so bad a condition that I was four days in reaching the 
               <br />
               Long Plain, while we were also subjected to incovenience and expense by 
               <br />
               the detention of the provisions, owing to the same cause. Added to my 
               <br />
               other discomforts was the presence of mosquitoes in incredible numbers, so 
               <br />
