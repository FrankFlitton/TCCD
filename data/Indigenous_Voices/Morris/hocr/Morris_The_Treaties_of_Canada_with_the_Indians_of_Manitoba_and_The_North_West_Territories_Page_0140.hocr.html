               Head band of the West Shore, and explained to them the object of our visit. 
               <br />
               They told us they had heard of it, and had been waiting to see us. Thickfoot 
               <br />
               said the Island Indians at Big Islam], Black Island, \Vapang and the other 
               <br />
               islands in the vicinity had no chief ; that they numbered one hundred and 
               <br />
               twenty-eight, and those at Jack-Fish Head sixty. Thickfoot said he had 
               <br />
               cattle and would like to have a place assigned to his people on the main 
               <br />
               shore, where they could live by farming and ﬁshing. \Ve suggested Fisher 
               <br />
               River to them, which they approved of. Eventually we decided on paying 
               <br />
               these Indians—took Thickfoot’s adhesion to the treaty, of which I enclose a 
               <br />
               copy, and authorized him to notify the Indians to meet at the Dog Head 
               <br />
               Point next summer. at a time to be intimated to them, and to request them 
               <br />
               in the mean time to select a Chief and Councillors. Thickfoot expressed 
               <br />
               gratitude for the kindness of the Government, and his belief that Indians 
               <br />
               of the various Islands and of Jack Head Point would cheerfully accept the 
               <br />
               Queen’s benevolence and settle on a reserve. After paying this party, and 
               <br />
               distributing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asmalil</span> quantity of provisions among them, we resumed our 
               <br />
               voyage, and, owing to the character of the navigation, again came to anchor 
               <br />
               in George’s Channel at seven o’clock, p.m. On the 29th, we left our an- 
               <br />
               chorage at ﬁve o’clock a.m., and entered the mouth of the Red River at 
               <br />
               twelve o’clock, crossing the bar without difﬁculty, as the weather was calm. 
               <br />
               We arrived at the Stone Fort at three o’clock in the afternoon, but had to 
               <br />
               remain there till next day, awaiting the arrival of conveyances from Winni- 
               <br />
               peg. Mr. McKay and I left the Stone Fort on the 30th at seven a.m. leav- 
               <br />
               ing our baggage and a portion of the provisions which had not been used to 
               <br />
               be forwarded by the steamer Swallow, and reached Fort Garry at ten o’clock, 
               <br />
               thus terminating a journey of over one thousand miles, and having satisfac- 
               <br />
               torily closed a treaty with the Saulteaux and Swampy Crees, which will 
               <br />
               prove of much importance in view of the probable rapid settlement of the 
               <br />
               west coast of Lake Winnipeg. The journey, moreover, is of interest, as 
               <br />
               having been the ﬁrst occasion on which a steam vessel entered the waters of 
               <br />
               Berens River and of the Nelson River, the waters of which river fall into 
               <br />
               the Hudson’s Bay, and as having demonstrated the practicability of direct 
               <br />
               steam navigation through a distance of three hundred and sixty miles from 
               <br />
               the city of Winnipeg to Norway House. I may mention here that the pre- 
               <br />
               valence of timber suitable for fuel and building purposes, of lime and sand- 
               <br />
               stone, of much good soil, and natural hay lands on the west shore of the 
               <br />
               lake. together with the great abundance of white ﬁsh, sturgeon and other 
               <br />
               ﬁsh in the lake, will ensure, ere long, a large settlement.

               The east coast is much inferior to the west coast, as far as I could learn,
