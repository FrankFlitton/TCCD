               together. Itold Yellow Quill he would have his reserve on both sides of 
               <br />
               the river, reserving,the navigation, and that if they could agree to go to 
               <br />
               one reserve, I would be pleased; but if not, that I would settle the matter. 
               <br />
               Yellow Quill said his councillors were willing that the other Indians should 
               <br />
               have a separate reserve provided they retained the belt of twenty-ﬁve miles, 
               <br />
               in addition to their proportion of the reserve. I informed them this could 
               <br />
               not be done; the reserve belonged to all. They then asked for an adjourn- 
               <br />
               ment, in order that they might meet together and have a smoke over it, to 
               <br />
               assemble again when I hoisted my ﬂag. After a couple of hours interval I 
               <br />
               agnin convened them. The Short Bears and White Mud Indians adhered 
               <br />
               to what they stated to me, but Yellow Quill’s band insisted on one reserve 
               <br />
               for all, but admitted that the objections of Short Bear’s band to the place 
               <br />
               asked by them were well founded, and that it was sandy and unﬁt for 
               <br />
               farming, and that they would like to select a reserve higher up the 
               <br />
               River Assiniboine. I then adjourned the conference until morning, and 
               <br />
               asked them to meet together and be prepared for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settlement.</span>

               On Tuesday, the 20th June, the Indians again respOnded to the hoisting 
               <br />
               of my ﬂag, and met <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at19</span> o’clock. Yellow Quill told me that his band are 
               <br />
               now willing to separate from the others, and wished to select a reserve 
               <br />
               higher up the river. I informed them that I would accede to their request, 
               <br />
               but that they must do it at once, and on the approval thereof by the Privy 
               <br />
               Council it would be laid off. Short Bear’s band still desired a reserve at the 
               <br />
               Long Plain, to which I assented. The White Mud River Indians asked for 
               <br />
               a separate reserve where they could farm, and I informed them that under 
               <br />
               the discretionary powers I possessed I would have a reserve selected for them, 
               <br />
               giving them their proportion of the original reserve. The Indians then 
               <br />
               asked that the two dollars per head, which had, as they said, slipped through 
               <br />

               _ their ﬁngers last year, should be paid to them, and I told them that I had been 
               <br />
               authorized to do so, which gave them much satisfaction. In anticipation of 
               <br />
               a settlement I had prepared a draft agreement, which was being copied for 
               <br />
               me by Mr. Graham. I informed them of this, and stated that I would sign 
               <br />
               it, and that the Chiefs and Councillors must do so likewise, so that there 
               <br />
               could be no misunderstanding. When the agreement was completed, I 
               <br />
               asked Mr. Cummings, the Interpreter, to read it to them, which he did. 
               <br />
               Three Indians, who understood English, and who had at an early period 
               <br />
               been selected by the Indians to check the interpretation of what was said, 
               <br />
               standing by, and Mr. Cummings being assisted by Mr. Cook, of St. James, 
               <br />
               who, at Mr. Cummings’ request, I had associated with him, on the Indians 
               <br />
               choosing their interpreters. I then signed the agreement, and called upon 
               <br />
               Yellow Quill to do so. He came forward cheerfully and said he would 
               <br />
               sign it, because he now understood what he never did before, viz., what was 
               <br />
               agreed to at the Stone Fort. I then called on his Councillors to sign, but 
               <br />
               they refused, saying they had agreed by the mouth. I then told the Indians 
               <br />
               that unless the Councillors signed nothing could be done, and that the Coun- 
               <br />
               .cillors who refused would be responsible for the failure of the negotiations.
