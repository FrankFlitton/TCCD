               The Indians intimated their pleasure by a general shout of

               The Lieutenant-Governor then met the few Chippewas who 
               <br />
               came forward, and told them that they must be paid at the

               well pleased. I am told you are of a bad mind ; you proposed

               to prevent me from crossing the river ;* if you did it was very

               itself. Then I am told you tried to prevent the other Indians 
               <br />
               from making the treaty. I tell you this to your faces so if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘it</span>

               no difference in my duty. The Queen has made treaties with 
               <br />
