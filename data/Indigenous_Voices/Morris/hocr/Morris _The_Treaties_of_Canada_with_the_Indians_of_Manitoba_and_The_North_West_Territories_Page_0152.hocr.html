               on the north bank. Altogether, the appearance of the place, on my arrival, 
               <br />
               was most prepossessing. The banks were covered with Indians with their 
               <br />
               canoes. and immediately the boat rounded the point below the Mission and 
               <br />
               came in view a salute was fired, the like of which, I was subsequently told, 
               <br />
               had never been heard in the “ Ratty Country."

               Having landed at the Mission, Mr. Cochrane informed me that he had, as 
               <br />
               I requested, summoned the Indians to meet in the school~house at three 
               <br />
               o’clock that afternoon, and when the hour arrived I proceeded there and 
               <br />
               found upwards of ﬁve hundred Indians gathered. I stated the object of my 
               <br />
               mission to them, and was at once assured of their desire to accept of, and 
               <br />
               their gratitude for, the Queen’s bounty and benevolence. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I found that the I’as and Cumberland bands of Indians had acknowledged 
               <br />
               Chiefs, but that the Moose Lake band had none, owing to a division amongst 
               <br />
               them. It appeared that the Indians from the Che-ma-wa-win desired to be 
               <br />
               a distinct band and have their reserves where I had seen them. at the 
               <br />
               entrance of the river from Cedar Lake; but noticing, on my way up, the 
               <br />
               unﬁtness of the locality for a reserve, and having learned that at Moose Lake, 
               <br />
               where part of the band desired to live, a most suitable locality could be had, 
               <br />
               I had decided before meeting them upon the course I should take, which 
               <br />
               was, not to encourage the division in the band, and allow only one Chief ; 
               <br />
               and this I did, and succeeded, without much trouble, in getting the band to 
               <br />
               unite. I then requested all the Indians to meet in council and select their 
               <br />
               Chief and head men, and be prepared the following morning to present them 
               <br />
               to me, when I would be ready to speak to them. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The next morning at eleven o’clock I met them and found they had done 
               <br />
               as I requested, and having been presented to the Chiefs and Councillors I 
               <br />
               proceeded to explain the terms of the treaty that I desired to receive their 
               <br />
               adhesion to. The Chiefs immediately stated that they wanted to make a 
               <br />
               treaty of their own, and it was only after great difﬁculty that I could make 
               <br />
               them understand that in reality it was not a new treaty they were about to 
               <br />
               make. 
               <br />

               They had heard of the terms granted the Indians at Carlton, and this 
               <br />
               acted most prejudicially at one time against the successful carrying out of 
               <br />
               my mission; but I at last made them understand the difference between 
               <br />
               their position and the Plain Indians, by pointing out that the land they 
               <br />
               would surrender would be useless to the Queen, while what the Plain Indians 
               <br />
               gave up would be of value to her for homes for her white children. They 
               <br />
               then agreed to accept the terms offered if I would agree to give them reserves 
               <br />
               where they desired; and to their demands I patiently listened, and having 
               <br />
               at last come to a satisfactory understanding I adjourned the meeting to the 
               <br />
               following day.

               Before proceeding further, I would draw your attention to the localities 
               <br />
               I granted for reserves, subject to the. approval of the Government, and beg

               to inform you that I made every inquiry as to the extent of farming land
