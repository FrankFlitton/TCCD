               Chief Kou-croche to see the Lieutenant-Governor at Fort Garry,

               to acquaint him of their desire to make peace with the Sioux-

               <br />
               he had promised to live at peace with all men, and he now 
               <br />
               wished to make friends with the Sioux. The distrust between 
               <br />
               the two tribes had been great, owing to past events. At the

               <br />
               were coming to attack them. Permission was given to the 
               <br />
               Chief to pay his visit to the Sioux, and messengers were sent 
               <br />
               to them, in advance, to explain the object of his visit.

               The result of the interview was satisfactory, and the ancient 
               <br />
