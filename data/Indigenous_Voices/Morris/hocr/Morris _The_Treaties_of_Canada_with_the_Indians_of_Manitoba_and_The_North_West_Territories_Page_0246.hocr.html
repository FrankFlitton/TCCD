               We resumed our journey on Monday and arrived at Fort McLeod on the 
               <br />
               Old Man’s River, on Tuesday the 4th September. The distance between 
               <br />
               the Blackfoot crossing of the Bow River and the Fort is about seventy-nine 
               <br />

               A few miles from Fort McLeod I was met by the Commissioners of the 
               <br />
               Mounted Police and a large party of the Force, who escorted me into the 
               <br />
               Fort, while a salute was ﬁred by the artillery company from one of the hills 
               <br />
               overlooking the line of march. The men, whose horses were in excellent 
               <br />
               condition, looked exceedingly well, and the ofﬁcers performed their duties 
               <br />
               iziamost efﬁcient manner. The villagers presented me with an address 
               <br />
               of welcome, and altogether my reception at Fort McLeod was such as to 
               <br />
               satisfy the most fastidious lover of display, and more than enough to satisfy 
               <br />
               the writer.

               At Fort McLeod, on my arrival, I received your despatch of ﬁrst August, 
               <br />
               covering the Commission relating to the Treaty and a copy of the Order in 
               <br />
               Council of 12th July, in terms of which the commission was issued. Also 
               <br />
               your letter of 27th July, informing me that it had been thought desirable to 
               <br />
               place the services of the Rev. Father Lacombe at the disposal of the Com- 
               <br />
               missioners while negotiating the treaty. A few days afterwards I was sorry 
               <br />
               to learn by telegraph that the reverend gentleman had been taken by ill- 
               <br />
               ness on the journey and would be unable to be present at the meeting with 
               <br />
               the Indians. Here. however, I was happy to meet Rev. Father Scollen, a 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic missionary, who has labored for some years among the 
               <br />
               Crees and Blackfeet in the western portion of the territories. He kindly 
               <br />
               furnished me such information as he possessed, and afterwards went to the 
               <br />
               treaty, where his assistance was of some value, particularly in dealing with 
               <br />
               the Crees present.

               While at the fort I had interviews with several of the Blood Chiefs, who 
               <br />
               called upon me to inquire if they could not be treated with there instead of 
               <br />
               at Bow Rivcz. I explained that hereafter the Government would endeavor 
               <br />
               to pay them their annuities at places most convenient for them, but that 
               <br />
               on the occasion of making a treaty it was desirable that the several Chiefs 
               <br />
               and their principal head men should meet together to talk over the matter, 
               <br />
               so that all might feel that they had been consulted as to the terms of the 
               <br />
               agreement. They went away satisﬁed, said they would do as the Great 
               <br />
               Father advised, and go to Bow River.

               I cannot speak too highly of the kind manner in which the ofﬁcers and

               men of the Mounted Police at Fort McLeod treat their Indian visitors. 
               <br />
