               Sm,——I have the honor to inform you that on the 4th August I received

               at Swan River your telegram dated on the first of that month.

               It notiﬁed me that a Commission appointing Lieut.-Col. James F. 
               <br />
               McLeod, C.M.G., and myself, Commissioners to negotiate a treaty with the 
               <br />
               Blackfeet and other Indians of the unsnrrendered parts of the North-West 
               <br />
               Territories adjoining the United States boundary, had been forwarded to 
               <br />
               Fort McLeod. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I immediately made preparations for the journey. These occupied me a 
               <br />
               week, as arrangements had to be made for the removal of furniture and 
               <br />
               other property to Battle River, where the Government House for the ter- 
               <br />
               ritories, in course of construction, would probably be ready for occupation 
               <br />
               on my return from the treaty negotiations. On the 11th August I left Swan 
               <br />
               River for Fort McLeod, m'a Battleford, proposing to go from the latter place 
               <br />
               by Cypress Hills to my destination. I took the Quill Lake trail and came 
               <br />
               to the telegraph line, about four miles from Big Stone Lake. Thence 
               <br />
               I followed that line until I came to the trail at the elbow of the North 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan leading to Battle River. Where the telegraph crosses the 
               <br />
               South Saskatchewan I found an excellent ferry scow, and a ferryman 
               <br />
               placed there by the Public Works Department. I arrived at the ferry about 
               <br />
               noon on the 20th, and though a high wind rendered it difﬁcult to manage 
               <br />
               the scow, the horses, with the vehicles and their contents, were safely fer- 
               <br />
               ried before sunset. On the following evening I reached the Elbow, and the 
               <br />
               morning thereafter before leaving camp, Inspector Walker, of Battleford, 
               <br />
               drove up, on his way to Carlton, to arrange for the distribution of certain 
               <br />
               of the articles intended for the Indians of Treaty Number Six, which had 
               <br />
               not arrived when he paid the annuities at that post in the early part of the 
               <br />
               month. Some of the Indians had not dispersed since they received their 
               <br />
               payments, and interested parties were causing dissatisfaction among them 
               <br />
               by reporting that the provisions intended for them, while assembled to 
               <br />
               receive their annuities, having now arrived, should be distributed to them, 
               <br />
               as well as the agricultural implements and other articles promised. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I advised Inspector Walker to distribute to those Indians still around 
               <br />
               Carlton their share of the presents, and to give them a small quantity of 
               <br />
               provisions from the Government supplies, to enable them to proceed with- 
               <br />
               out delay to their hunting grounds. I then continued my journey to Battle-' 
               <br />
               ford, which I reached on Monday, the 24th, at noon. Here I was happy to 
               <br />
               meet Major Irvine, who had come straight from Fort McLeod, across the 
               <br />
               Great Plains, to conduct me on my journey, and to inform me that for 
               <br />
               satisfactory reasons adduced by Crowfoot, the leading chief of the Blackfeet, 
               <br />
