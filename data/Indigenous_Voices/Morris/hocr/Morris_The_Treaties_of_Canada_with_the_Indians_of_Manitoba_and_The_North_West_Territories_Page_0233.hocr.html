               others. The N orth-VV est Council is considering the framing 
               <br />
               of a law to protect the buffaloes, and when they make it, they 
               <br />
               will expect the Indians to obey it. The Government will not 
               <br />
               interfere with the Indian’s daily life, they will not bind him.

               giving him the means of growing from the soil, his food. The
