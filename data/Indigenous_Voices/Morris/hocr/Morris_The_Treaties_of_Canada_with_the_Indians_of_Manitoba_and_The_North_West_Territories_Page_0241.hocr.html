               it for any length of time ; the only reason that they never drove the Amer-

               icans off, apart from their love for whiskey, was their dread of the Henri

               taken from them without any ceremony. This I can certify, for although

               they may not say so to others yet they do not hide it from me.

               their value. Of course you would ﬁnd the same prejudices amongst the

               Blackfeet that you have found amongst the Crees, but you would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span>

               no greater difﬁculty in dispelling them. You would have four clans
