               <br />
               recognized as a Chief, was decorated in my presence with the 
               <br />
               old King George <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">silver</span> medal, by one of the band, to whom it 
               <br />
               had been entrusted for safe keeping by the young man’s father, 
               <br />
               who was a Chief, with the charge that on the boy’s coming of 
               <br />
               age, it would be delivered over to him. The Chieftainships 
               <br />
               were at ﬁrst partly hereditary, partly won by deeds of dar- 
               <br />
               ing and of leadership against the foe. They are now gen- 
               <br />
               erally elective, though the tendency to hereditary succession 
               <br />
               still largely exists. The power of the Chiefs has been much 
               <br />
               broken of late, and 1. am of opinion that itis of importance to 
               <br />
               strengthen the hands of the Chiefs and Councillors by a due 
               <br />
               recognition of their ofﬁces and respect being shewn them. 
               <br />
               They should be strongly impressed with the belief that they 
               <br />
               are ofﬁcers of the Crown, and that it is their duty to see that 
               <br />
               the Indians of their tribes obey the provisions of the treaties. 
               <br />
               The importance of upholding the Chiefs, may be illustrated by 
               <br />
               an incident which occurred near Fort Ellice, after the making 
               <br />
               of the treaty. A party composed of three men and the wife
