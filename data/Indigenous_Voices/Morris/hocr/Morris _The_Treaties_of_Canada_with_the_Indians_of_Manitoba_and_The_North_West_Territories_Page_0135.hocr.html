               mouth of the Great Saskatchewan River, and met the Indians _ 
               <br />
               who live there. Their houses were built at the foot of the 
               <br />
               Grand Rapids, and in the immediate vicinity of the Hudson’s 
               <br />
               Bay, Tramway, some seven miles from the mouth of the river. 
               <br />
               The river is here deep to the very shore, so that the steamer 
               <br />
               ran long aside the bank, and was moored by ropes attached to 
               <br />
               the Chief’s house. The Commissioners met the Indians and 
               <br />
               informed them of the desire of the Government to control the 
               <br />
               land where they had settled, and to give them a reserve, in- 
               <br />
               stead, on the opposite side of the river. They said, they would 
               <br />
               surrender the locality in question, and go to the south side of the 
               <br />
               river, if a small sum was given them, to aid them in removing 
               <br />
               their houses or building others. To this the Commissioners 
               <br />
               willingly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acceded,</span> and promised that the next year a sum of 
               <br />
               ﬁve hu <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘d</span> dollars would be paid them for that purpose. 
               <br />
               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treat,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> then signed, the Commissioners having extended 
               <br />
               the boundaries of the treaty limits, so as to include the Swampy 
               <br />
               Cree Indians at the Pas or Wahpahpuha, a settlement on the 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan River, and recommended that Commissioners 
               <br />
               should be sent in the ensuing summer to complete the work. 
               <br />
               The Commissioners then returned to Winnipeg, after a voy- 
               <br />
               age, on and around the lake, of about one thousand miles. 
               <br />
               The terms of the treaty were identical with those of Treaties 
               <br />
               Numbers Three and Four, except that a smaller quantity of 
               <br />
               land was granted to each family, being one hundred and sixty, 
               <br />
               or in some cases one hundred acres to each family of ﬁve, while 
               <br />
               under Treaties Numbers Three and Four the quantity of land 
               <br />
               allowed was six hundred and forty acres to each such family. 
               <br />
               The gratuity paid each Indian in recognition of the treaty was 
               <br />
               also ﬁve dollars per head, instead of twelve dollars the cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances under which the treaty was made being different. 
               <br />
               The area covered by these treaties was approximately about 
               <br />
               100,000 square miles and has been described as lying north of 
               <br />
