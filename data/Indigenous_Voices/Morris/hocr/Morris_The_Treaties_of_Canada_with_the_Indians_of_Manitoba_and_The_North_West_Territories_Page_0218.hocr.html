               here to make you understand the Queen’s will. I received 
               <br />
               your letter last night and was glad to learn that you wanted to 
               <br />
               accept the terms I had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered,</span> and which had been accepted by 
               <br />
               the other Indians. Before I received your letter I had 
               <br />
               sent you one asking you to meet me here where we are now, 
               <br />
               and I am glad you have come, as I could not otherwise have

               met you.

               <br />
               Chief, he should have a blue coat. I do not yet know who the 
               <br />
               Chiefs are. To be a Chief he must have followers. One man 
               <br />
               came forward as a Chief and I had to tell him unless you 
               <br />
               have twenty tents you cannot continue as a Chief.

               “The color of your Chief’s coat is perhaps a little thing; 
               <br />
               red is the color all the Queen’s Chiefs wear. I wear this 
               <br />
               coat, but it is only worn by those who stand as the Queen’s 
               <br />
               Councillors; her soldiers and her oﬂicers wear red, and all the 
               <br />
               other Chiefs of the Queen wear the coats we have brought, and 
               <br />
               the good of this is that when the Chief is seen with his uniform 
               <br />
               and medal every one knows he is an ofﬁcer of hers. I should 
               <br />
               be sorry to see you dill'erent from the others, and now that 
               <br />
               you understand you would not wish it.”

               <br />
               this day, and I hope we will be blessed. I am glad that I see 
               <br />
               something that will be of use; I wish that we all as a people 
               <br />
               may be beneﬁtted by this. I want that all these things should 
               <br />
               be preserved in a manner that they might be useful to us all ; 
               <br />
               it is in the power of men to help each other. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Ve</span> should not 
               <br />
               act foolishly with the things that are given us to live by. I 
               <br />
               think some things are too little, they will not be sufﬁcient for 
               <br />
               our wants. I do not want very much more than what has 
               <br />
               been promised, only a little thing. I will be glad if you will 
               <br />
               help me by writing my request down ; on account of the 
               <br />
               buffalo I am getting anxious. I wish that each one should 
               <br />
               have an equal share, if that could be managed; in this I think 
               <br />
               we would be doing good. Perhaps this is not the only time
