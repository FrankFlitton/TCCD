               <br />
               meet them, and that in accordance with the promises made, the Commis- 
               <br />
               sioners were now here to discuss the terms of a treaty. Yet as we had 
               <br />
               learned that very few of the Bloods, Sareees or I’iegans had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrived,</span> we 
               <br />
               would not unduly press forward the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">negotiations,</span> but wait until Wednesday 
               <br />
               to give the others time to arrive.

               The Indians listened attentively to what was said, and several of the 
               <br />
               Chiefs expressed their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfaction.</span> at not being asked to meet us on the 
               <br />
               morrow. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commissioners</span> then told them there were rations provided 
               <br />
               for them by the Government, and that those who were in need of pro- 
               <br />
               visions might apply to certain of the Police officers detailed to see to their 
               <br />
               proper distribution.

               The Stonies and one Blood Chief applied for ﬂour, tea, sugar and tobacco, 
               <br />
               but said they were not then in need of beef. Crowfoot and some other 
               <br />
               Chiefs under his influence would not accept any rations until they would 
               <br />
               hear what terms the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commissioners</span> were prepared to offer them. He ap- 
               <br />
               peared to be under the impression that if the Indians were fed by the 
               <br />
               bounty of the Government they would be committed to the proposals of the 
               <br />
               Commissioners, whatever might be their nature. Though I feared this 
               <br />
               refusal did not angur well for the final success of the negotiations, yet I 
               <br />
               could not help wishing that other Indians whom I have seen, had a little 
               <br />
               of the spirit in regard to dependence upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lovernment</span> exhibited on this

               occasion by the great Chief of the Blackfeet.

               Among the visitors at the treaty I was pleased to meet the Rev. John 
               <br />
               McDongall, \Vesleyan missionary at Morley Ville, and son of the late 
               <br />
               lamented Rev. George McDougall, so well and favourably known in con- 
               <br />
               nection with Indian affairs in the North-VVest. Mr. McDongall was 
               <br />
               present at the first interview the Commissioners held with the Indians, 
               <br />
               and acted as interpreter for the Stonies, who do not understand the Black- 
               <br />
               foot language. He, as well as the Rev. C. Scollen, rendered the Commis- 
               <br />
               sioners all the assistance in their power. Traders, with large supplies of 
               <br />
               goods, were arriving on the ground. They desired to erect buildings of logs 
               <br />
               to protect their property, but as some of the Indian Chiefs objected to the 
               <br />
               trees along the river being cut down for such a purpose until after the 
               <br />
               treaty, the Commissioners deemed it prudent, to prevent complications, to 
               <br />
               ask the traders to erect only temporary stanchions sufficient to support 
               <br />
               canvas coverings. They complied with our wishes, and the Indians gave us 
               <br />
               no further trouble on the subject.

               0n the evening of Monday I also received a message from Bobtail, a Cree 
               <br />
               Chief, who, with the larger portion of the band, had come to the treaty 
               <br />
               grounds. He represented that he had not been received into any treaty. 
               <br />
               He, hmvever, had not attended the meeting that day, because he was un- 
               <br />
               certain whether the Commissioners would be willing to receive him along 
               <br />
               with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Blackfeet. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asked</span> him and his band to meet the Commissioners 
               <br />
               separate from the other Indians on the following day.
