               the Governor; this they did in a large semi-circle; in their

               able of which was the “ dance of the stem.” This was commenced 
               <br />

               pipe stem, walked slowly along the semi-circle, and advancing 
               <br />
               to the front, raised the stem to the heavens, then slowly turned 
               <br />
               to the north, south, east and west, presenting the stem at each 
               <br />
               point; returning to the seated group he handed the stem to 
               <br />
               one of the young men, who commenced a low chant, at the

               same time performing a ceremonial dance accompanied by the
