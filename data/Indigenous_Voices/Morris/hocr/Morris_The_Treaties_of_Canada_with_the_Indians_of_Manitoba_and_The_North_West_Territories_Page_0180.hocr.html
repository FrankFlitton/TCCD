               The Beardy again addressed me, and said,—-“ You have told me what

               I replied to them, explaining, with regard to assistance, that we could 
               <br />
               not support or feed the Indians, and all that we would do would be to help 
               <br />
               them to cultivate the soil.

               <br />
               to preserve the buffalo, and assured them that it would be considered by the 
               <br />
               Governor-General and Council of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“'est</span> Territories, to see if a

               The three Chiefs and their head men then signed the treaty, and the 
               <br />
               medals and ﬂags were distributed, when Mr. Christie intimated that he was 
               <br />
               ready to make the payments.

               <br />
               informed them that, as we had to leave for Fort Pitt, this was impossible;

               The persistency with which these Indians clung to their endeavor to com-

               <br />
               it was made known to him that the treaty would be made there.
