               Sm,—I have the honor to inform you that after my return from St. 
               <br />
               Peters, ﬁnding that in view of my contemplated mission to Lake Winnipeg 
               <br />
               it would be impossible for me to visit all the bands of Indians included in 
               <br />
               Treaties Numbers One and Two, I requested the Indian Commissioner, 
               <br />
               Mr. Provencher, to proceed to meet them at Fort Alexander and the 
               <br />
               Broken Head and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Roseau</span> rivers, while I should proceed to Lake Manitoba 
               <br />
               and meet at Manitoba House the various bands of Indians included in 
               <br />
               Treaty Number Two. In pursuance of this arrangement, I left here on the 
               <br />
               17th of August for Oak Point, on Lake Manitoba, where I was to take a 
               <br />
               boat for Manitoba Post. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I was accompanied by the Hon. James McKay, whose presence enabled 
               <br />
               me to dispense with an interpreter, and was of importance otherwise, as he 
               <br />
               had assisted my predecessor in the making of the treaty originally at Mani- 
               <br />
               toba Post. Mr. Graham, of the Indian Department, also accompanied me 
               <br />
               to make the payments and distribute the pensions. I reached Oak Point 
               <br />
               on the afternoon of the 18th, and left there on the afternoon of the 20th, 
               <br />
               arriving at Manitoba House on the evening of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">21st.</span> The next day being 
               <br />
               Sunday. nothing of course was done relating to my mission, but on Monday 
               <br />
               morning I met the Indians at ten o’clock on the lake shore. The six bands 
               <br />
               included in the treaty were all represented by their Chiefs and head men 
               <br />
               and a large number of their people. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I explained to them the object of our mission, my remarks being fully 
               <br />
               interpreted by Mr. McKay, and obtained their assent in writing to the 
               <br />
               Order in Council of the 30th April last, the terms of which were accepted 
               <br />
               with cordiality and good feeling by the Indians. 
               <br />

               The new medals and uniforms were distributed to the Chiefs and head 
               <br />
               men, and the payments under the revised treaty were then commenced by 
               <br />
               Mr. McKay and Mr. Graham. and continued until 12.30 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pm.</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               On the 24th, the payments were resumed and concluded, but owing to 
               <br />
               heavy rain and high winds, we were unable to leave Manitoba Post until 
               <br />
               the 25th. The Indians on our departure again <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁring</span> their guns in token 
               <br />
               of their respect and good will. Owing to stormy weather, which obliged us 
               <br />
               to encamp on Bird Island, we did not return to Oak Point until the after- 
               <br />
               noon of the 27th.

               0n the 28th, the Indians residing in that vicinity, and belonging to 
               <br />
               Sousanye's band, were paid by Messrs. McKay and Graham. I returned 
               <br />
               to Fort Garry on the 1st September, in the afternoon, my journey having 
               <br />
               been protracted by unfavorable weather, and by the fact that owing to the 
               <br />
               prevalence of shoals. the navigation of Lake Manitoba is difﬁcult in stormy
