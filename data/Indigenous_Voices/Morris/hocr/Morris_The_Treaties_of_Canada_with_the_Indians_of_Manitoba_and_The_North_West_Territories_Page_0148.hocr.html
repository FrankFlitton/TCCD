               Rapids ; upon which we told him that before we could speak further, we must 
               <br />
               be assured by the band that he was their head man, and this the band at once 
               <br />
               did. \Ve then thought it advisable to recommend that they should make the 
               <br />
               Chief of the Berens River band their Chief, and make their head man a Coun- 
               <br />
               cillor to him, and although our proposition was not at once received satis- 
               <br />
               factorily, we ultimately prevailed upon them to accept it, and the Chief was 
               <br />
               at once elected. By this means we saved the expenses necessarily incurred 
               <br />
               in maintaining one Chief and two Councillors. We then stated that we 
               <br />
               were prepared to grant them their reserve where they asked for it ; and 
               <br />
               having explained the treaty to them, clause by clause, and mentioned in the 
               <br />
               adhesion where the reserve should be, the adhesion was duly signed by the 
               <br />
               Chief and Councillors. The payment of the annuity was then gone on with 
               <br />
               and ﬁnished that afternoon at four o’clock.

               We then distributed the implements, ammunition, twine and provisions. 
               <br />
               When we had ﬁnished, the Chief and Councillors came forward, and thanked 
               <br />
               us for all that had been done for them; they said they were well pleased 
               <br />
               with what they had received, and desired us to inform you of the fact, which 
               <br />
               we accordingly promised. They then returned in the same boats they had 
               <br />
               come over in : before leaving the bank, giving three cheers for the Queen 
               <br />
               and three for the Governor.

               We are very much pleased to inform you that the best possible feeling 
               <br />
               appears to exist between the Indians in this region. They all appeared 
               <br />
               anxious to farm and settle down, and we heard that a number of houses 
               <br />
               had been built at Poplar River, and considerable clearing done there since 
               <br />
               the treaty was made with them last year ; the implements and tools we 
               <br />
               brought them were therefore most acceptable. As these bands live at a con- 
               <br />
               siderable distance from each other, we would recommend that an extra 
               <br />
               supply of tools he allowed them. We also feel satisﬁed that the animals 
               <br />
               promised by the treaty might be furnished, as we certainly consider them 
               <br />
               in a position to take care of the same.

               As you directed, we informed them that their application for hay lands 
               <br />
               had been forwarded to the Government, and this gave them great satis- 
               <br />
               faction. The following morning, Saturday, August 5th, Mr. Reid left for 
               <br />
