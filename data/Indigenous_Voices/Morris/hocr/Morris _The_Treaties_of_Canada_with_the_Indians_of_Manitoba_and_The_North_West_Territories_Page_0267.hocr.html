               know what I said to them three years ago, when the Police 
               <br />
               ﬁrst came to the country ——that nothing would be taken away 
               <br />
               from them without their own consent. You all see <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> that 
               <br />
               what I told you then was true. I also told you that the 
               <br />
               Mounted Police were your friends, and would not wrong you or 
               <br />
               see you wronged in any way. This also you see is true. The 
               <br />
               Police will continue to be your friends, and be always glad to 
               <br />
               see you. On your part you must keep the Queen’s laws, and 
               <br />
               give every information to them in order that they may see the 
               <br />
               laws obeyed and offenders punished. You may still look to 
               <br />
               me as your friend, and at any time when I can do anything for 
               <br />
               your welfare, I shall only be too happy to do so. You say that 
               <br />
               I have always kept my promises. As surely as my past prom- 
               <br />
               ises have been kept, so surely shall those made by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com-l</span> 
               <br />
               missioners be carried out in the future. If they were broken 
               <br />
               I would be ashamed to meet you or look you in the face ; but 
               <br />
               every promise will be solemnly fulﬁlled as certainly as the sun 
               <br />
               now shines down upon us from the heavens. I shall always 
               <br />
               remember the kind manner in which you have today spoken of 
               <br />

               On Thursday afternoon the Lieutenant-Governor departed
