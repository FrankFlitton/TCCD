               <br />
               of opinion “ that'it was desirable to secure the extinction of the 
               <br />
               Indian title not only to the lands within Manitoba, but also to 
               <br />
               so much of the timber grounds east and north of the Province 
               <br />
               as were required for immediate entry and use, and also of a 
               <br />
               large tract of cultivable ground west of the Portage, where 
               <br />
               there were very few Indian inhabitants.” It was therefore 
               <br />
               resolved to open negotiations at the Lower Fort Garry, or 
               <br />
               Stone Fort, with the Indians of the Province, and certain adjacent 
               <br />

               <br />
               Manitoba Post, a Hudson’s Bay fort, at the north end of Lake 
               <br />

               Mr. Simpson accordingly issued proclamations, inviting the
