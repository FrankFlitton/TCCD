               already been treated with.

               I declined to hear them further, and they retired, some stating that they

               would go to Fort Pitt, which I warned them not to do.

               Besides these Saulteaux, there were others present who disapproved of

               Amongst those paid were the few resident Saulteaux, who were accepted by
