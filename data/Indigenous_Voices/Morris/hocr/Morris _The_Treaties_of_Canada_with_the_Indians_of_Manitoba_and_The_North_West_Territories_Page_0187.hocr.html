               ﬁed that a few simple regulations would preserve the herds for many years. 
               <br />
               The subject was constantly pressed on my attention by the Indians, and I 
               <br />
               promised that the matter would be considered by the N orth-West Council. 
               <br />
               The council that has governed the territories for the last four years was 
               <br />
               engaged in maturing a law for this purpose, and had our regime continued 
               <br />
               we would have passed a statute for their preservation. I commend the

               5th. There is another class of the population in the North-West whose 
               <br />
               position I desire to bring under the notice of the Privy Council. I refer to 
               <br />
               the wandering Half-breeds of the plains, who are chieﬂy of French descent 
               <br />
               and live the life of the Indians. There are a few who are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">identiﬁed</span> with 
               <br />
               the Indians, but there is a large class of Metis who live by the hunt of the 
               <br />
               buffalo, and have no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settled</span> homes. I think that a census of the numbers 
               <br />
               of these should be procured, and while I would not be disposed to recom- 
               <br />
               mend their being brought under the treaties, I would suggest that land 
               <br />
               should be assigned to them, and that on their settling down, if after an 
               <br />
               examination into their circumstances, it should be found <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">new</span> 'ary and 
               <br />
               expedient, some assistance should be given them to enable them to enter
