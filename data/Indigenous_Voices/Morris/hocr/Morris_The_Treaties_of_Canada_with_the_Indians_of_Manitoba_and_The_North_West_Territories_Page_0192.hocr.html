               <br />
               that I scarcely know where to begin. I have been nearly

               four years Governor of Manitoba and these territories, and 
               <br />
               from the day I was sworn, I took the Indian by the hand, and

               those who took it have never let it go.

               “Three years ago I went to the north-west angle of Lake 
               <br />
               of the Woods, and there I met the Chippewa nation, I gave 
               <br />
               them a message and they talked with me and when they 
               <br />
               understood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theyl</span> took my hand. Some were away, next year 
               <br />
               I sent messengers to them and I made a treaty between the 
               <br />
               Queen and them ; there are numbered of those altogether four 
               <br />
               thousand. I then went to Lake Qu’Appelle the year after, and 
               <br />
               met the Crees and Chippewas there, gave them my message, 
               <br />
               and they took my hand. Last summer I went to Lake Win~ 
               <br />
               nipeg and gave the Queen’s message to the Swampy Crees and 
               <br />
               they and I, acting for the Queen, came together heart to heart; 
               <br />
               and now that the Indians of the east understand the Queen 
               <br />
               and her Councillors, I come to you. And why is all this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done?</span> 
               <br />
               I will tell you ; it is because you are the subjects of the Queen 
               <br />
               as I am. She cares as much for one of you as she does for 
               <br />
               one of her white subjects. The other day a party of Iroquois 
               <br />
               Indians were taken to England across the ocean ; the Queen 
               <br />
               heard of it and sent to them, saying, ‘I want to see my red chil- 
               <br />
               dren,’ took their hands and gave each of them her picture, and 
               <br />
               sent them away happy with her goodness.
