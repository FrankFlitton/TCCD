               been absent for over two months and a half. Mr. McKay, having taken

               1st. The Indians inhabiting the ceded territory are chiefly Crees, but 
               <br />
               there are a few Assiniboines on the plains and also at the slope of .the 
               <br />
               mountains. There are also a small number of Saulteaux and one band of

               <br />
               of the Crees to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comlnence</span> to cultivate the soil, and so great a desire to have 
               <br />
               their children instructed. I requested Mr. Christie to confer with the Chief 
               <br />
               while the payments were going on, as to the localities where they would 
               <br />

               <br />
               indicated the places, in fact most of them have already commenced to settle.

               It is, therefore, important that the cattle and agricultural implements 
               <br />
               should be given them without delay.

               ing these as soon as the spring opens. I think it probable that cattle and. 
               <br />
               some implements could be purchased at Prince Albert and thus avoid trans-

               <br />
               I thought the desire of the Indians, to be instructed in farming and building, 
               <br />
               most reasonable, and I would therefore recommend that measures be 
               <br />
               adopted to provide such instruction for them. Their present mode of living 
               <br />
               is passing away; the Indians are tractable, docile and willing to learn. I 
               <br />
               think that advantage should be taken of this disposition to teach them to 
               <br />
               become self-supporting, which can best be accomplished with the aid of a few 
               <br />
               practical farmers and carpenters to instruct them in farming and house

               The universal demand for teachers, and by some of the Indians for mis-

               and extend their operations amongst them. The ﬁeld is wide enough for 
               <br />
               all, and the cry of the Indian for help is a clamant one.
