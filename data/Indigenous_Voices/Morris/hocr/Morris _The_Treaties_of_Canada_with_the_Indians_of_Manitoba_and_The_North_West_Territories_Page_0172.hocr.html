               Leaving the Indian encampment I arrived at Fort Carlton, where Mr. 
               <br />
               Christie, Dr. Jackes and myself were assigned most comfortable rooms,

               In the evening, Mist-ow-as-is and Ah-tuk-uk-koop, the two head Chiefs

               of the Carlton Crees, called to pay their respects to me, and welcomed me

               On the 16th the Crees sent me word that they wished the day to confer

               I acceded to their request, learning that they desired to bring the Duck

               I sent a messenger, Mr. Peter Ballenden, to Duck Lake to inform the 
               <br />
               Indians that I would meet them at the encampment of the Carlton Crees, 
               <br />
               about two miles from the fort.

               On the 17th, on his return, he informed me that the Chief said “ He had

               not given me leave to meet the Indians anywhere except at Duck Lake, 
               <br />
               and that they would only meet me there.” The Carlton Indians, however, 
               <br />
               sent me word, that they would be ready next morning at ten o’clock.

               On the 18th, as I was leaving for the Indian encampment, a messenger 
               <br />
               came to me from the Duck Lake Indians, asking for provisions. I replied, 
               <br />
               that Mr. Christie was in charge of the distribution of provisions, but that I 
               <br />
               would not give any to the Duck Lake Indians, in consequence of the un- 
               <br />
               reasonableness of their conduct, and that provisions would only be given to 
               <br />
               the large encampment.

               I then proceeded to the Indian camp, together with my fellow Commis-

               On my arrival I found that the ground had been most judiciously chOsen,

               spot which the Indians had left for my council tent overlooked the whole.
