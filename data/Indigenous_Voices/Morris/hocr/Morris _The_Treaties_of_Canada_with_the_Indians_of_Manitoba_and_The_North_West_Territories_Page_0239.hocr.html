               I requested the Rev. C. Scollen, who had for many years 
               <br />
               been a missionary among the Plain Crees, and latterly, for sev- 
               <br />
               eral years, among the Blackfeet, to make a report to me of the 
               <br />
               character, habits and condition of this nation, with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which‘re-</span>

               quest he willingly complied. I now give place to this report, 
               <br />
               which gives a vivid view of the character of this bold and war-

               like race, and shews the beneﬁts they had, so far back as 1876, 
               <br />
               derived from the presence of the Mounted Police, the prohibi- 
               <br />
               tion of liquor, and the establishment of law and order in the 
               <br />
               North-West Territories, under Canadian rule. I may here 
               <br />
               remark, that another great beneﬁt has resulted from the judi- 
               <br />
               cious steps taken by the Canadian Government, and that is the' 
               <br />
               cessation of warfare between the various tribes, which was 
               <br />
               before of constant occurrence. An intelligent Ojibbeway Indian 
               <br />
               trader told me, that the change was wonderful. “Before,” he 
               <br />
               said, “the Queen’s Government came, we were never safe, and 
               <br />
               now,” he said, “I can sleep in my tent anywhere, and have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no</span>

               <br />
               treat me as a friend.” The report of Mr. Scollen is as follows:

               EXCELLENT GOVERNOR,—Having had some years of experience as a mis- 
               <br />
               sionary amongst the Cree and Blackfeet Indians of the North-West Terri- 
               <br />
               tory, I humbly undertake to submit to your consideration a few details regard- 
               <br />
               ing the latter tribe of Her Majesty’s Indian subjects. I do this with all the

               more conﬁdence as the successful way in which you conducted the treaty 
               <br />
               with the Carlton Indians (a treaty including no small difﬁculties). has con-

               vinced me of your thorough knowledge of the character of this people. 
               <br />
               But, although the general character of all the tribes may be nearly the same, 
               <br />
               yet in their social dispositions they sometimes materially differ, and this, I 
               <br />
               think, will be found to be the case with the Crees and Blackfeet when com- 
               <br />
               pared on that point. The Crees have always looked upon the white man as a 
               <br />
               friend, or, to use their own language, as a brother. They have never been 
               <br />
               afraid of him. nor have they given him any cause to be afraid of them. The 
               <br />
               Blackfeet have acted somewhat differently; they have regarded the White man 
               <br />
               as a demi-god, far superior to themselves in intelligence, capable of doing th em
