               On Tuesday, at two o’clock, the Cree Chief and his band assembled ac- 
               <br />
               cording to appointment. The Commissioners ascertained from him that he 
               <br />
               had frequented for some time the Upper Bow River country, and might 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fairly</span> be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> into the present treaty, but he expressed a wish to have his 
               <br />
               reserve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nearll’igeou</span> Lake, within the limits of Treaty Number Six, and 
               <br />
               from what We could learn of the feelings of the Blackfeet toward the Crees, 
               <br />
               we considered it advisable to keep them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> as much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> possible. We 
               <br />
               therefore <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">informed</span> the Chief that it would be most expedient for him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> 
               <br />
               give in his adhesion to the treaty of last year, and be paid annually, on the 
               <br />
               north of Red Deer River, with the other Cree Chiefs. He consented. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“’6</span> 
               <br />
               then told him that we could not pay him until after the Blackfeet had been 
               <br />
               dealt with, as it might create jealousy among them, but that in the mean- 
               <br />
               time his band could receive rations. He said it was right that he should 
               <br />
               wait until we had settled with the Blackfeet, and agreed to come and sign 
               <br />
               his adhesion to Treaty Number Six at any time I was prepared to receive 
               <br />

               During Tuesday, several parties of Indians came in, but the principal 
               <br />
               Blood Chiefs had not yet arrived. According to appointment, however, the 
               <br />
               Commissioners met the Indians at two o’clock on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\V-ednesday.</span> An outline 
               <br />
               was given of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms</span> proposed for their acceptance. We also informed 
               <br />
               them we did not expect an answer that day, but we hoped to hear from them 
               <br />
               to-morrow. ,. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That day we again intimated to the Indians that rations Would be delivered 
               <br />
               to such as applied for them. We told them the provisions were a present, 
               <br />
               and their acceptance would not be regarded as committing the Chiefs to the 
               <br />
               terms proposed by the Commissioners. Most of the Chiefs at once applied 
               <br />
               for flour, tea, sugar and tobacco, and in a day or two they also asked for 
               <br />
               meat. Even Crowfoot, at last thankfully accepted his share of the rations, 
               <br />
               and the beef cattle began to decrease rapidly. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               On Tuesday we met the Indians at the usual hour. We further explained 
               <br />
               the terms outlined to them yesterday, dwelling especially upon the fact that 
               <br />
               by the Canadian Law their reserves could not be taken from them, occupied 
               <br />
               or sold, without their consent. They were also assured that their liberty of 
               <br />
               hunting over the open prairie Would not be interfered with, so long as they 
               <br />
               did not molest settlers and others in the country. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We then invited the Chiefs to express their opinions. ()ne of the minor 
               <br />
               Blood Chiefs made a long speech. lie told us the Mounted Police had been 
               <br />
               in the country for four years, and had been destroying a quantity of wood. 
               <br />
               For this wood he asked the Commissioners should make the Indians a present 
               <br />
               payment of ﬁfty dollars a head to each Chief, and thirty dollars a head to 
               <br />
               all others. He said the Blackfeet, Bloods, Sarcees and l’icgans were all one; 
               <br />
               but he asked that the Crees and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I‘Ialf-breeds</span> should be sent back to their 
               <br />
               own country. The Queen, he remarked, had sent the police to protect them; 
               <br />
               they had made it safe for Indians to sleep at night, and he hoped she would 
               <br />
               not soon take these men away. 
               <br />
