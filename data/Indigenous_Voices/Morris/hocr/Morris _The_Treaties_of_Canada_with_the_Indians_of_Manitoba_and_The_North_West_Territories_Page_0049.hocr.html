               mised you was just, kind and fair between the Qeeen and you. 
               <br />
               It is now three years we have been trying to settle this matter. 
               <br />
               If we do not succeed to-day I shall go away feeling sorry for 
               <br />
               you and for your children that you could not see what was 
               <br />
               good for you and for them. I am ready to do what I promised 
               <br />
               you yesterday. My hand is open and you ought to take me 
               <br />
               by the hand and say, “yes, we accept of your offer.” I have 
               <br />
               not the power to do what you ask of me. I ask you once more 
               <br />
               to think what you are doing, and of those you have left at. 
               <br />
               home, and also of those that may be born yet, and I ask you 
               <br />
               not to turn your backs on what is offered to you, and you ought 
               <br />
               to see by what the Queen is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offering</span> you that she loves her red 
               <br />
               subjects as much as her white. I think you are forgetting one 
               <br />
               thing, that what I offer you is to be While the water ﬂows and 
               <br />
               the sun rises. You know that in the United States they only 
               <br />
               pay the Indian for twenty years, and you come here to-day and 
               <br />
               ask for ever more than they get for twenty years. Is that 
               <br />
               just’l I think you ought to accept my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer,</span> and make a treaty 
               <br />
               with me as I ask you to do. I only ask you to think for 
               <br />
               yourselves, and for your families, and for your children and 
               <br />
               children’s children, and I know that if you do that you will 
               <br />
               shake hands with me to-day.”
