               “ Many years ago our Great Mother made a treaty with the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Indians</span> far away by the great waters in the east. A few years 
               <br />
               ago she made a treaty with those beyond the Touchwood Hills 
               <br />
               and the \Voody Mountains. Last year a treaty was made with 
               <br />
               the Crees along the Saskatchewan, and now the Queen has sent 
               <br />
               Col. McLeod and myself to ask you to make a treaty. But in 
               <br />
               a very few years the buffalo will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">probably</span> be all destroyed, and 
               <br />
               for this reason the Queen wishes to help you to live in the future 
               <br />
               in some other way. She wishes you to allow her white children 
               <br />
               to come and live on your land and raise cattle, and should you 
               <br />
               agree to this she will assist you to raise cattle and grain, and 
               <br />
               thus give you the means of living when the buffalo are no more. 
               <br />
               She will also pay you and your children money every year, which 
               <br />
               you can spend as you please. By being paid in money you 
               <br />
               cannot be cheated, as with. it you can buy what you may think 
               <br />
               proper.

               “The Queen wishes us to offer you the same as was accepted 
               <br />
               by the Crees. I do not mean exactly the same terms, but 
               <br />
               equivalent terms, that will cost the Queen the same amount of 
               <br />
               money. Some of the other Indians wanted farming implements, 
               <br />
               but these you do not require, as your lands are more adapted 
               <br />
               to raising cattle, and cattle, perhaps, would be better for you. 
               <br />
               The Commissioners will give you your choice, whether cattle or 
               <br />
               farming implements. I have already said we will give you 
               <br />
               money, I will now tell you how much. If you sign the treaty 
               <br />
               every man, woman and child will get twelve dollars each; the 
               <br />
               money will be paid to the head of each family for himself, 
               <br />
               women and children; every year, for ever, you, your women 
               <br />
               and your children will got ﬁve dollars each. This year Chiefs 
               <br />
               and Councillors will be paid a larger sum than this; Chiefs will 
               <br />
               get a suit of clothes, a silver medal, and ﬂag, and every third 
               <br />
               year will get another suit. A reserve of land will be set apart 
               <br />
               for yourselves and your cattle, upon which none others will be 
               <br />
