               SIR,—I have the honor to enclose you copy of a proclamation I have

               caused to be issued, with a view to prevent the danger arising from intoxi-

               cating drinks being given to the Indians, on the occasion of the meeting to

               I look upon the proceedings, we are now initiating, as important in their 
               <br />
               bearing upon our relations to the Indians of the whole continent. In fact, 
               <br />
               the terms we now agree <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span> will probably shape the arrangements we shall 
               <br />
               have to make with all the Indians between the Red River and the Rocky 
               <br />
               Mountains. It will therefore be well to neglect nothing that is within our 
               <br />
               power to enable us to start fairly with the negotiations. .

               With that view, I have, amongst other things, asked Major Irvine to 
               <br />
               detail a few of his troops to be present at the opening of the treaty. Mili- 
               <br />
               tary display has always a great effect on savages, and the presence, even of 
               <br />
               a few troops, will have a good tendency.

               I fear we shall have to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">incur</span> a considerable expenditure for presents of

               I doubt if it will be found practicable to make arrangements upon so
