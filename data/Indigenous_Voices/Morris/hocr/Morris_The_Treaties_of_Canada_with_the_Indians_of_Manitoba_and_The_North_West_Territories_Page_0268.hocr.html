               Prior, however, to this irruption, a portion of the Sioux tribe 
               <br />
               of American Indians, took refuge in the Red River settlement, 
               <br />
               after the massacre of the whites by the Indians in Minnesota, 
               <br />

               <br />
               the settlement. The main body took up a position at Sturgeon

               was composed of representative men. Their deliberations 
               <br />
               were grave and anxious. In December, 1863, the Governor-

               in-Chief, Mr. Dallas, reported to the Council, that he had

               visited the principal camp of the Sioux at Sturgeon Creek, and 
               <br />
