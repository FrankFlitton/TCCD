               <br />

               <br />
               asked and granted before meeting. Eventually the conference 
               <br />
               was opened. The ceremonies which attended it were imposing.

               The national stem or pipe dance was performed, of which a 
               <br />

               <br />
               with the utmost good feeling, and thus the Indian title was ex- 
               <br />

               <br />

               strong desire for instruction in farming, and appealed for the
