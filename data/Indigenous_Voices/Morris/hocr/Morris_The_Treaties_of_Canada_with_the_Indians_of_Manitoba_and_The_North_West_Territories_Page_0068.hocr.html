               Mr. Laird and I left Fort Garry on the 26th of August, and arrived at

               Lake Qu’Appelle on the 8th of September, Mr. Christie having gone in 
               <br />

               We were accompanied on arriving by the escort of militia under the

               The escort took up their encampment at a very desirable situation on the 
               <br />
               edge of the lake, the Indians being encamped at some distance. 
               <br />

               The Commissioners were kindly provided with apartments by W. J.

               After our arrival, the Commissioners caused the Indians to be summoned,

               to meet them, in a marquee tent adjoining the encampment of the militia.

               The Crees came headed by their principal Chief “Loud Voice,” and a 
               <br />
               number of Saulteaux followed, without their Chief, Coté. The Commis- 
               <br />
               sioners, having decided that it was desirable that there should be only one 
               <br />
               speaker on behalf of the Commissioners, requested me owing to my previous 
               <br />
               experience with the Indian tribes and my ofﬁcial position as Lieutenant- 
               <br />
               Governor of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> Territories, to undertake the duty, which I 
               <br />
               agreed to do. Accordingly, I told the Indians the object of our coming and 
               <br />
               invited them to present to us their Chiefs and headmen. “ Loud Voice ” 
               <br />
               stated that they were not yet ready and asked for a delay till next day, to 
               <br />
               which we assented. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               0n the 9th, four Indian soldiers were sent to the Commissioners to ask 
               <br />
               for two days delay, but we replied that when they met us in conference 
               <br />
               they could prefer any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasonable</span> request, but that we expected them to 
               <br />
               meet us as agreed on the previous day, and further that the Saulteaux had 
               <br />
               not conducted themselves with proper respect to the Commissioners, as 
               <br />
               representatives of the Crown, as their principal Chief Cote had not met us. 
               <br />
               Eventually, both the Crees and the Saulteaux met us, with their Chiefs, 
               <br />
               when I addressed them. They asked time to deliberate and we appointed 
               <br />
               the 11th at ten o’clock for the next conference.
