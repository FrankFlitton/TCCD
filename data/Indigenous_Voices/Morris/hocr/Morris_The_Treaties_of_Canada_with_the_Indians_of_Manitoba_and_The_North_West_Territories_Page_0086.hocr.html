               as children would to a father, as children ought to do to a 
               <br />
               father, and as you ought to the servants of the great mother <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of‘</span> 
               <br />
               us all. I told my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“friends</span> yesterday that things changed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here;</span> 
               <br />
               that we are here to-day and that in a few years it may be we 
               <br />
               will not be here, but after us will come our children. The 
               <br />
               Queen thinks of the children yet unborn. I knOw that there 
               <br />
               are some red men as well as white men who think only of to- 
               <br />
               day and never think of to-morrow. The Queen has to think of 
               <br />
               what will come long after to-day. Therefore, the promises we 
               <br />
               have to make to you are not for to-day only but for to-morrow, 
               <br />
               not only for you but for your children born and unborn, and 
               <br />
               the promises we make will be carried out as long as the sun 
               <br />
               shines above and the water ﬂows in the ocean. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vhen</span> you are 
               <br />
               ready to plant seed the Queen’s men will lay off Reserves so as 
               <br />
               to give a square mile to every family of ﬁve persons, and on 
               <br />
               commencing to farm the Queen will give to every family culti- 
               <br />
               vating the soil two hoes, one spade, one scythe for cutting the 
               <br />
               grain, one axe and plough, enough of seed wheat, barley, oats 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">potatoes</span> to plant the land they get ready. The Queen 
               <br />
               wishes her red children to learn the cunning of the white man 
               <br />
               and when they are ready for it she will send schoolmasters on 
               <br />
               every Reserve and pay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> We have come through the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> for many days and we have seen hills and but little 
               <br />
               wood and in many places little water, and it may be a long 
               <br />
               time before there are many white men settled upon this land, 
               <br />
               and y0u will have the right of hunting and ﬁshing just as you 
               <br />
               have now until the land is actually taken up. (His Honor 
               <br />
               repeated the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offers</span> which had been given to the Saulteaux on the 
               <br />
               previous day.) I think I have told you all that the Queen is 
               <br />
               willing to do for you. It ought to show you that she has 
               <br />
               thought more about you than you have about her. I will be 
               <br />
               glad now to have those whom you have selected speak for you 
               <br />
               and I again ask you to keep nothing back. This is the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               time you have had white chiefs, ofﬁcers of the Queen, so high 
               <br />
               in her Councils, so trusted by her among you. We have no
