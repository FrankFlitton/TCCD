               them, and if the whole body present were to ask as a matter of grace and 
               <br />
               favor, under the circumstances, that their brethren should be released, Her 
               <br />
               Majesty would be willing to consent to their discharge; she would grant as 
               <br />
               a favor what she must refuse if asked for on any other ground. They replied 
               <br />
               by saying that they begged it as a matter of favor only. Thereupon I acceded 
               <br />
               to their request, and directed the discharge of the four Indians. This was 
               <br />
               received with great satisfaction. I explained again, that there might be no 
               <br />
               misunderstanding about it, that henceforth every offender against the law 
               <br />
               must be punished. They all expressed their acquiescence in what I said. 
               <br />
               The discharge of the prisoners had an excellent effect.

               Next morning the Indians, through one of their spokesmen, declared in 
               <br />
               presence of the whole body assembled, that from this time they would never 
               <br />
               raise their voice against the law being enforced. After the order of the 
               <br />
               release, the Chiefs and spokesmen addressed us, questions were asked and 
               <br />
               answered, and some progress made in the negotiations. Eventually the 
               <br />
               meeting adjourned till this morning at ten o’clock. 
               <br />

               A general acquiescence in the views laid down by Mr. Simpson and myself 
               <br />
               was expressed; but it was quite clear, by the proceedings of to-day, that our 
               <br />
               views were imperfectly apprehended. When we met this morning, the 
               <br />
               Indians were invited to state their wishes as to the reserves, they were to 
               <br />
               say how much they thought would be sufﬁcient, and whether they wished 
               <br />
               them all in one or in several places, 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In deﬁning the limits of their reserves, so far as we could see, they wished 
               <br />
               to have about two-thirds of the Province. We heard them out, and then 
               <br />
               told them it was quite clear that they had entirely misunderstood the mean- 
               <br />
               ing and intention of reserves. We explained the object of these in something 
               <br />
               like the language of the memorandum enclosed, and then told them it was of 
               <br />
               no use for them to entertain any such ideas, which were entirely out of the 
               <br />
               question. We told them that whether they wished it or not, immigrants 
               <br />
               would come in and ﬁll up the country; that every year from this one twice 
               <br />
               as many in number as their whole people there assembled would pour into 
               <br />
               the Province, and in a little while would spread all over it, and that now 
               <br />
               was the time for them to come to an arrangement that would secure homes 
               <br />
               and annuities for themselves and their children.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We told them that what we proposed to allow them was an extent of one 
               <br />
               hundred and sixty acres for each family of ﬁve, or in that proportion ; that 
               <br />
               they might have their land where they chose, not interfering with existing 
               <br />
               occupants; that we should allow an annuity of twelve dollars for every 
               <br />
               family of ﬁve, or in that proportion per head. We requested them to think 
               <br />
               over these propositions till Monday_morning.
