               Lieut.-Col. Provencher, Indian agent, and S. J. Dawson, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Esq”</span> Com-

               Inissioner, acting on behalf of Her Majesty, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the one part, and the Sal- 
               <br />
               teaux tribe of Ojibbeway Indians on the other, at the North-VVest Angle 
               <br />
               of the Lake of the Woods, on the 3rd of October, for the relinquishment of 
               <br />
               the Indian title to the .tract of land therein described, and embracing 
               <br />
               55,000 square miles. In the ﬁrst place, the holding of the negotiation of the 
               <br />
               treaty had been appointed by you to take place at the North-\Vest Angle 
               <br />
               before you requested me to take part therein, and Mr. Dawson had obtained 
               <br />
               the consent of the Indians to meet there on the 10th of September, but they 
               <br />
               afterwards changed their minds, and refused to meet me unless I came to 
               <br />
               Fort Francis. I refused to do this. as I felt that the yielding to the demand 
               <br />
               of the Indians in this respect, would operate injuriously to the success of the 
               <br />
               treaty, and the results proved the correctness of the opinion I had formed. 
               <br />
               I therefore sent a special agent (Mr. Pierre Levaillier) to warn them that I 
               <br />
               would meet them as arranged at the North~West Angle on the 25th, or not 
               <br />
               at all this year, to which they eventually agreed. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I left here for the Angle on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">23rd</span> September, and arrived there on the 
               <br />
               25th, when I was joined by Messrs. Provencher and Dawson, the last named 
               <br />
               of whom I was glad to ﬁnd had been associated with the Commissioners in 
               <br />
               consequence of the resignation of Mr. Lindsey Russell, thereby giving us 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt as well of his knowledge of the country to be dealt with, as of the 
               <br />
               several bands of Indians therein. Mr. Pether, of Fort Francis, was also in 
               <br />
               attendance, and Mr. Provencher was accompanied by Mr. St. John, of his 
               <br />
               department. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               On arriving, the Indians, who were already there, came up to the house I 
               <br />
               occupied, in procession, headed by braves bearing a banner and a Union Jack, 
               <br />
               and accompanied by others beating drums. They asked leave to perform a 
               <br />
               dance in my honor, after which they presented to me the pipe of peace. 
               <br />
               They were then supplied with provisions and returned to their camp. As 
               <br />
               the Indians had not all arrived, and for other reasons, the 26th, 27th and 
               <br />
               28th were passed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">without</span> any progress, but on the 29th I sent them word 
               <br />
               that they must meet the Commissioners next morning. Accordingly, on the 
               <br />
               the 30th, they met us in a tent, the use of which I had obtained from the 
               <br />
               military authorities. I explained to them the object of the meeting, but as 
               <br />
               they informed me that they were not ready to confer with us, I adjourned 
               <br />
               the meeting until next day. On the lst <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">October"</span> they again assembled. 
               <br />
               The principal cause of the delay was divisions and jealousies among 
               <br />
               themselves. The nation had not met for many years, and some of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Qhem</span> had 
               <br />
               never before been assembled together. They were very jealous of each other, 
               <br />
               and dreaded any of the Chiefs having individual communications with me, 
               <br />
