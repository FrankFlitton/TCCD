               <br />
               for their soldierly bearing and excellent conduct while at the Angle. Their 
               <br />
               presence was of great value, and had the effect of deterring traders <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> 
               <br />
               bringing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">articles'of</span> illicit trade for sale to the Indians; and moreover 
               <br />
               exercised a moral inﬂuence which contributed most materially to the success 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">negotiations.</span> I have further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> add, that it was found impossible, 
               <br />
               owing to the extent of the country treated for, and the want of knowledge of 
               <br />
               the circumstances of each band, to deﬁne the reserves to be granted to the 
               <br />
               Indians. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> therefore agreed that the reserves should be hereafter 
               <br />
               selected by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcers</span> of the Government, who should confer with the several 
               <br />
               bands, and pay due respect‘to lauds actually cultivated by them. A pre- 
               <br />
               vision was also introduced to the effect that any of the reserves, or any 
               <br />
               interest in them, might hereafter be sold for the beneﬁt of the Indians by 
               <br />
               the Government with their consent. I would suggest that instructions 
               <br />
               should be given to Mr. Dawson to select the reserves with all convenient 
               <br />
               speed; and, to prevent complication, I would further suggest that no patents 
               <br />
               should be issued, or licenses granted, for mineral or timber lands, or other 
               <br />
               lands, until the quescion of the reserves has been ﬁrst adjusted.
