               that I should meet the Indians of Treaties Numbers One and Two, with a

               view to a revision of the terms thereof, and an adjustment of the disputed 
               <br />
               questions connected therewith, I proceeded to the St. Peter Reserve on the 
               <br />
               5th of August and encamped near the Indian tents.

               On the 6th I met Chief Prince and his band, being accompanied by the 
               <br />
               Hon. James McKay, who at my request gave me the beneﬁt of his valuable 
               <br />
               services, and by Mr. Provencher. I explained to the Indians the terms 
               <br />
               offered to them by the Government, and obtained their written assent 
               <br />
               thereto, endorsed on a parchment copy of the Order in Council of date the 
               <br />
               30th April, 1875. As however there are in the bands of Treaties Numbers 
               <br />
               One and Two, four councillors, i.e., head men, and two braves, we were 
               <br />
               under the necessity of agreeing that they should continue at that number, 
               <br />
               instead of two, as speciﬁed in the report of the Privy Council. We then 
               <br />
               brought before them your request that the portion of the reserve embraced 
               <br />
               in the proposed new town near the Paciﬁc Railway crossing should be sold 
               <br />
               for their beneﬁt, to which they agreed, and the formal instrument of sur- 
               <br />
               render will be enclosed to you by the Indian Commissioner.

               The Indians living at Nettley Creek asked to have a reserve assigned 
               <br />
               them there, and I promised to bring their request under your notice.

               I did not bring up the question of the division of the band into two, as my 
               <br />
               experience with the Portage band, arising from a similar difﬁculty, led me to 
               <br />
               fear that complications might arise from the proposal which might prevent 
               <br />
               the settlement of the more important matter of the disposal of the open 
               <br />
               questions relating to the treaty. I was therefore of opinion that the 
               <br />
               division of the band should be postponed to next year, and acted upon that 
               <br />
               opinion. A party of Norway House Indians were present and asked for a 
               <br />
               reserve at the Grassy Narrows. I informed them that one could not be 
               <br />
               granted at that place, and learning from them that the Chief at Norway 
               <br />
               House was about leaving there with a party of Indians to confer with me, 
               <br />
               I engaged three of the Indians present to proceed at once to Norway House 
               <br />
               and inform the Indians that I would meet them there about the middle of 
               <br />
               September.

               I have since learned that they met the Chief after he had left Norway 
               <br />
               House or Fort Garry, and caused him to return.
