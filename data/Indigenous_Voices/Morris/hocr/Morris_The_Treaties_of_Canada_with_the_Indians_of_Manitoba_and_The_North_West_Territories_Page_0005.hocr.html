               <br />
               the Indians, may be considered satisfactory. They were such as I thought

               it advisable to offer, in order that the matter might be ﬁnally settled, with- 
               <br />

               The Indians had been advised by certain interested parties to insist on 
               <br />
               such extravagant terms as I felt it quite impossible to grant; and from the

               <br />

               I explained to the chiefs in council the difference between the lands ceded 
               <br />
               heretofore in this Province, and those then under consideration, they were 
               <br />
               of good quality and sold readily at prices which enabled the Government to 
               <br />
               be more liberal, they were also occupied by the whites in such a manner as 
               <br />
               to preclude the possibility of the Indian hunting over or having access to 
               <br />
               them: whereas the lands now ceded are notoriously barren and sterile, and 
               <br />
               will in all probability never be settled except in a few localities by mining 
               <br />
               companies, whose establishments among the Indians, instead of being pre- 
               <br />
               judicial, would prove of great beneﬁt as they would afford a market for any 
               <br />
               things they may have to sell, and bring provisions and stores of all kinds 
               <br />

               Neither did the British Government contemplate the removal of the 
               <br />
               Indians from their present haunts to some (to them) unknown region in the 
               <br />
               far West, as had been the case with their brethren on the American side.

               I told them that the two chiefs who were In Toronto last winter (Shingua- 
               <br />
               couse and Nebennigoebing) only asked the amount which the Government 
               <br />
               had received for mining locations, after deducting the expenses attending 
               <br />
               their sale. That amount was about eight thousand pounds which the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment would pay them without any annuity or certainty of further beneﬁt; 
               <br />
               or one-half of it down, and an annuity of about one thousand pounds.
