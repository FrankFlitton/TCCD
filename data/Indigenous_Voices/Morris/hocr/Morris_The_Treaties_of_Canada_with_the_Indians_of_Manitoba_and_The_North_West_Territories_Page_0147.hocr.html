               <br />
               to say that they had arrived and were then holding a council. The same

               afternoon the Chief and Councillors called upon us and desired to know 
               <br />
               when we would be prepared to meet them, and though the 5th was the day 
               <br />
               appointed, we thought it advisable. as all the Indians were then gathered 
               <br />
               there, and were anxious to return to their homes, to appoint the following 
               <br />
               day, the 4th August.

               Were all in the school-house We proceeded there, and met, in addition to the 
               <br />
               Berens River band, about thirty Indians from the Grand Rapids of Berens 
               <br />
               River. We explained the object of our mission, and found the Indians from 
               <br />
               the Rapids most anxious to accept the Queen’s bounty and benevolence, some 
               <br />
               of them had already accepted the anmmity with the Lao Seule Indians we 
               <br />
               found, so we immediately told them that it was only to those that had not
