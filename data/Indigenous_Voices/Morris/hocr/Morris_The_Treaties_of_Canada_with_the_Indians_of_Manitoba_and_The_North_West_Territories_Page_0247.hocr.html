               Having rested a week after my tedious journey of over seven hundred 
               <br />
               miles, I then occupied myself for a few days in viewing the surrounding 
               <br />
               country. In the village I found some excellent stores, supplied with almost 
               <br />
               every article of dry goods, hardware and groceries, that any inland com- 
               <br />
               munity requires. Notably among these were the stores of J. G. Baker &amp; 
               <br />
               Co. and Messrs. T. C. Power &amp;, Bro. There is also a good blacksmith’s 
               <br />
               shop in the village, in which coal is used from the Pelly River, at a place 
               <br />
               some twenty miles distant from Fort McLeod. I was told by the propri- 
               <br />
               etor of the shop that the coal answers tolerably well for blacksmithing pur- 
               <br />
               poses, and in the fort it is extensively used for fuel. It burns nearly as 
               <br />
               well in a stove as some varieties of Pictou coal.

               <br />
