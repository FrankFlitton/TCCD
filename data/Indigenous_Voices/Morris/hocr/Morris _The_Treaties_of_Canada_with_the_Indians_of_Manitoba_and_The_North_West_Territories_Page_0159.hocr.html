               On the 13th instant (April) I had a visit from the Cree Chiefs, representing 
               <br />
               the Plain Crees from this to Carlton, accompanied by a few followers. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The object of their visit was to ascertain whether their lands had been 
               <br />
               sold or not, and what was the intention of the Canadian Government in 
               <br />
               relation to them. They referred to the epidemic that had raged throughout 
               <br />
               the past summer, and the subsequent starvation, the poverty of their 
               <br />
               country, the visible diminution of the buffalo, their sole support, ending by 
               <br />
               requesting certain presents at once, and that I should lay their case before 
               <br />
               Her Majesty’s representative at Fort Garry. Many stories have reached 
               <br />
               these Indians through various channels, ever since the transfer of the North- 
               <br />
               West Territories to the Dominion of Canada, and they were most anxious 
               <br />
               to hear from myself what had taken place. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I told them that the Canadian Government had as yet made no application 
               <br />
               for their lands or hunting grounds, and when anything was required of them, 
               <br />
               most likely Commissioners would be sent beforehand to treat with them, and 
               <br />
               that until then they should remain quiet and live at peace with all men. 1' 
               <br />
               further stated that Canada, in her treaties with Indians, heretofore, had 
               <br />
               dealt most liberally with them, and that they were now in settled houses 
               <br />
               and well off, and that I had no doubt in settling with them the same liberal 
               <br />
               policy would be followed. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               As I was aware that they had heard many exaggerated stories about the 
               <br />
               troops in Red River, I took the opportunity of telling them why troops had 
               <br />
               been sent; and if Her Majesty sent troops to the Saskatchewan, it was as 
               <br />
               much for the protection of the red as the white man, and that they would be 
               <br />
               for the maintenance of law and order. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               They were highly satisﬁed with the explanations offered, and said they 
               <br />
               would welcome civilization. As their demands were complied with, and 
               <br />
               presents given to them, their immediate followers, and for the young men 
               <br />
               left in camp, they departed well pleased for the present time, with fair 
               <br />
               promises for the future. At a subsequent interview with the Chiefs alone, 
               <br />
               they requested that I should write down their words, or messages to their 
               <br />
               Great Master in Red River. I accordingly did so, and have transmitted 
               <br />
               the messages as delivered. Copies of the proclamation issued, prohibiting 
               <br />
               the trafﬁc in spirituous liquors to Indians or others, and the use of strychnine 
               <br />
               in the destruction of animal life, have been received, and due publicity
