               When the peculiar circumstances surrounding the position of the Indians 
               <br />
               of the Province were pointed out, the future of the country predicted, and 
               <br />
               the views and intentions of the Government explained by the Lieutenant- 
               <br />
               Governor and myself, the Indians professed a desire for time to think over 
               <br />
               what had been said before making any reply; and when their answer came 
               <br />
               it proved to contain demands of such an exorbitant nature, that much time 
               <br />
               was spent in reducing their terms to a basis upon which an arrangement 
               <br />
               could be made.

               Every band had its spokesman, in addition to its Chief, and each seemed 
               <br />
               to vie with another in the dimensions of their requirements. I may mention, 
               <br />
               as an illustration, that in the matter of reserves, the quantity of land de- 
               <br />
               manded for each band amounted to about three townships per Indian, and 
               <br />
               included the greater part of the settled portions of the Province. It was 
               <br />
               not until the 3rd of August, or nine days after the first meeting, that the 
               <br />
               basis of arrangement was arrived at, upon which is founded the treaty of 
               <br />
               that date. Then, and by means of mutual concessions, the following terms 
               <br />
               were agreed upon. For the cession of the country described in the treaty 
               <br />
               referred to, and comprising the Province of Manitoba, and certain country 
               <br />
               in the north-east thereof, every Indian was to receive a sum of three dollars 
               <br />
               a year in perpetuity, and a reserve was to be set apart for each band, of 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient size to allow one hundred and sixty acres to each family of ﬁve 
               <br />
               persons, or in like proportion as the family might be greater or less than ﬁve. 
               <br />
               As each Indian settled down upon his share of the reserve, and commenced 
               <br />
               the cultivation of his land, he was to receive a plough and harrow. Each 
               <br />
               Chief was to receive a cow and a male and female of the smaller kinds of 
               <br />
               animals bred upon a farm. There was to be a bull for the general use of 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               each reserve. In addition to this, each Chief was to receive a dress, a ﬂag 
               <br />
               and a medal, as marks of distinction; and each Chief, with the exception of 
               <br />
               Bozawequare, the Chief of the Portage band, was to receive a buggy, or 
               <br />
               light spring waggon. Two councillors and two braves of each band were to 
               <br />
               receive a dress, somewhat inferior to that provided for the Chiefs, and the 
               <br />
               braves and councillors of the Portage band excepted, were to receive a buggy. 
               <br />
               Every Indian was to receive a gratuity of three dollars, which, though given 
               <br />
               as a payment for good behaviour, was to be understood to cover all dimen- 
               <br />
               sions for the past.

               On this basis the treaty was signed by myself and the several Chiefs, on

               <br />
               and on the following day the payment commenced.
