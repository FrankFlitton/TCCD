               <br />
               not made up their minds yet about the land—he tells us they

               have not decided to refuse our hands. I am glad to hear him

               say that, and if it will please my Indian brethren here we will 
               <br />
               be glad to wait another day and meet them here to-morrow 
               <br />
               morning, if they will promise me with the words of men that 
               <br />
               they will look this matter straight in the face ; that they will 
               <br />
               lay aside every feeling except the good of their people, and try 
               <br />
               to see what is right, and that they will come back and say,

               <br />

               <br />

               The Chief said I was not very well, yet I am here. Why? 
               <br />
               Because the duty was laid upon me. I was afraid of the 
               <br />
               journey; but when a Chief has a duty to do he tries to do it, 
               <br />
               and I felt that if I could do you any good, as I believed I 
               <br />
               could, I ought to be here. I tell you this, trust my words,
