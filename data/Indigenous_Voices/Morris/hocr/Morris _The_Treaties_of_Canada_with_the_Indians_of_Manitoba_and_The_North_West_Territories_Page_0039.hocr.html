               <br />
               dopenais, came forward and drew off his gloves, and spoke as follows: 
               <br />
               “ Now you see me stand before you all. What has been done here to-day, 
               <br />
               has been done openly before the Great Spirit, and before the nation, and 
               <br />
               I hope that I may never hear any one say that this treaty has been done 
               <br />
               secretly. And now, in closing this council, I take off my glove, and in 
               <br />
               giving you my hand, I deliVer over my birthright, and lands, and in 
               <br />
               taking your hand I hold fast all the promises you have made, and I hope 
               <br />
               they will last as long as the sun goes round, and the water flows, as you 
               <br />
               have said.” To which I replied as follows: “I accept your hand, and 
               <br />
               with it the lands, and will keep all my promises, in the firm belief that 
               <br />
               the treaty now to be signed will bind the red man and the white man 
               <br />
               together as friends forever.” The conference then adjourned for an hour 
               <br />
               to enable the text of the treaty to be Completed, in accordance with the 
               <br />
               understanding arrived at. At the expiration of that period the conference 
               <br />
               was resumed, and after the reading of the treaty, and an explanation of it 
               <br />
               in Indian by the Hon. James McKay, it was signed by the Commissioners 
               <br />
               and by the several Chiefs, the first signature being that of a very aged 
               <br />
               hereditary Chief ‘he next day the Indians Were paid by Messrs. Pether 
               <br />
               and Graham, 0. Department of Public \Vorks; the latter of whom 
               <br />
               kindly offered his services, as Mr. l’rovencher had to leave to keep another 
               <br />
               appointment. The negotiation was a very difficult and trying one, and 
               <br />
               requiret. on the part of the Commissioners, great patience and firmness. On 
               <br />
               the whole I am of opinion that the issue is a happy one. With the exception 
               <br />
               of two bands in the Shebaudowan District, whose adhesion was secured in 
               <br />
               advance, and the signatures of whose Chiefs Mr. Dawson left to secure, the 
               <br />
               Indian title has been extinguished over the vast tract of country comprising 
               <br />
               55,000 square miles lying between the upper boundary of the Lake Superior 
               <br />
               treaty, and that of the treaty made by Mr. Commissioner Simpson at 
               <br />
               Manitoba Post, and embracing within its bounds the Dawson route, the 
               <br />
               route of the Canada Paciﬁc Railway, and an extensive 'lumber and mineral 
               <br />
               region.* .[t is fortunate, too, that the arrangement has been effected, as the 
               <br />
               Indians along the lakes and rivers were dissatisfied at the use of the waters, 
               <br />
               which they considered theirs, having been taken without compensation, 
               <br />
               so much so indeed that I believe if the treaty had not been made, the 
               <br />
               Government would have been compelled to place a force on the line next year.
