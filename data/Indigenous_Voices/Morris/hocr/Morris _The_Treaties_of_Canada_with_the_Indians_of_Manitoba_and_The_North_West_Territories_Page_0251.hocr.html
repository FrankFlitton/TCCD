               the Sarcees, said, we are all going to take your advice. Eagle Head, the 
               <br />
               Piegan head Chief, remarked, “ Igive you my ha ml. We all agree to what 
               <br />
               Crowfoot says.” Rainy Chief, head of the North Bloods, said he never went 
               <br />
               against the white man‘s advice. Some of the minor Chiefs spoke to the 
               <br />
               same effect.

               The Commissioners expressed their satisfaction at the unanimity among 
               <br />
               the Indians, and said they would prepare the treaty and bring it to-morrow 
               <br />
               for signature. The only difﬁcult matter then to be arranged was the reserves. 
               <br />
               The Commissioners thought it would take unnecessary time to discuss this 
               <br />
               question in open meeting, and resolved that one of them should visit the 
               <br />
               head Chiefs at their camps, and consult them separately as to the localities 
               <br />
               they might desire to select. Lieut.-Col. McLeod undertook this duty, while 
               <br />
               I attended to the preparation of the draft treaty. He succeeded so well in 
               <br />
               his mission that we were able to name the places chosen in the treaty.

               On Saturday, 22nd September, we met the Indians to conclude the treaty. 
               <br />
               Mekasto, or Red Crow, the great Chief of the South Bloods, had arrived the 
               <br />
               previous evening, or morning, on the ground, and being present, came for- 
               <br />
               ward to be introduced to the Commissioners.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The assemblage of Indians was large. All the head Chiefs of the several 
               <br />
               tribes were now present; only two Blackfeet and two Blood minor Chiefs 
               <br />
               were absent. The representation was all that could be expected. 
               <br />

               The Commissioners had previously informed the Indians that they would 
               <br />
               accept the Chiefs whom they acknowledged, and now close in front of the 
               <br />
               tent sat those who had been presented to the Commissioners as the recog-

               The conditions of the treaty having been interpreted to the Indians, some 
               <br />
               of the Blood Chiefs, who had said very little on the previous day, owing to 
               <br />
               Red Crow’s absence, now spoke, he himself in a few kind words agreeing to 
               <br />
               accept the treaty. Crowfoot then came forward and requested his name to 
               <br />
               be written to the treaty. The Commissioners having ﬁrst signed it, Mr. 
               <br />
               L’Heureux, being familiar with the Blackfoot language, attached the Chiefs’ 
               <br />
               names to the document at their request and witnessed to their marks.

               I may mention in this connection that on Saturday also I was waited 
               <br />
               upon by a deputation of Half-breeds, who presented me with a petition, 
               <br />
               expressing the hope that the buffalo law might not be stringently enforced 
               <br />
               during the approaching winter, and praying that they might receive some 
               <br />
               assistance to commence farming. With respect to the buffalo ordinance,‘ I 
               <br />
               told them that the notice having been short, the law would not be very 
               <br />
               strictly enforced for the ﬁrst winter, and in regard to their prayer for assis- 
               <br />
               tance to farm, I said I would make it known at Ottawa.

               On Monday, the 24th, the Commissioners met the Indians at ten a.m.

               <br />
               on Saturday signed the treaty this morning. The Chiefs were then asked
