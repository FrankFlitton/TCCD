               Sm, —In accordance with my instructions, I proceeded with as little 
               <br />
               delay as possible to Carlton, in the neighborhood of which place I met with 
               <br />
               forty tents of Crees : From these I ascertained that the work I had under- 
               <br />
               taken would be much more arduous than I had expected, and that the prin- 
               <br />
               cipal camps would be found on the south branch of the Saskatchewan and 
               <br />
               Red Deer Rivers. I was also informed by these Indians that the Crees and 
               <br />
               Plain Assiniboines were united on two points: 1st. That they would not

               receive any presents from Government until a deﬁnite time for treaty was 
               <br />
               stated. 2nd. Though they deplored the necessity of resorting to extreme 
               <br />
               measures, yet they were unanimous in their determination to Oppose the 
               <br />
               running of lines, or the making of roads through their country, until a set- 
               <br />
               tlement between the Government and them had been effected. I was further 
               <br />
               informed that the danger of a collision with the whites was likely to arise 
               <br />
               from the ofﬁcious conduct of minor Chiefs who were anxious to make them-
