               James F. McLeod, met the Blackfeet, at the Blackfoot crossing, 
               <br />
               on the Bow River, on the 17th day of September, 1877, which 
               <br />
               day had been selected for the time of meeting. Gov. Laird 
               <br />
               proceeded from the temporary seat of the Government of the 
               <br />
               North-West Territories at Swan River, and Col. McLeod from 
               <br />
               Fort McLeod, the head-quarters of the Mounted Police, to the 
               <br />
               appointed rendezvous.

               The Commissioners met the Indians on that day, and after 
               <br />
               ﬁve days of tedious negotiations, the treaty was satisfactorily 
               <br />
               concluded, and signed by the Chiefs and head men present.

               The total number of the Indians, represented at the making 
               <br />
               of the treaty, and who were paid the gratuity under it, was 
               <br />
               four <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thousalfd</span> three hundred and ninety-two. The terms of the 
               <br />
               treaty, were substantially the same as those contained in 
               <br />
               the N orth-VVcst Angle and Qu’Appelle treaties, except that 
               <br />
               as some of the bands were disposed to engage in pastoral pur- 
               <br />
               suits, it was arranged to give them cattle instead of agricultural 
               <br />
               implements. The Minister of the Interior well observes in his 
               <br />
               report “that the conclusion of this treaty with these warlike 
               <br />
               and intractable tribes, at a time when the Indian tribes, imme- 
               <br />
               diately across the border, were engaged in open hostilities with 
               <br />
               the United States troops, is certainly a conclusive proof of the 
               <br />
               just policy of the Government of Canada toward the aboriginal 
               <br />
               population,” and, I add, of the conﬁdence of the Indians in the 
               <br />
               promises and just dealing of the servants of the British Crown, 
               <br />
               in Canada ; a conﬁdence that can only be kept up by the strict- 
               <br />
               est observance of the stipulations of the treaties.

               I now append the interesting despatch of Lieut.-Gov. Laird, 
               <br />
               giving a detailed account of the negotiation of the treaty, and

               <br />
               4th, 187 7, which, though not authentic, I believe, gives a

               general view of what passed during the negotiations.
