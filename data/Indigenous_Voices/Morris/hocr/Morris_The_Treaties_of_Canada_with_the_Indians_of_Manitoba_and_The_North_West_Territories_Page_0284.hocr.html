               <br />
               two years since is eleven head. This may appear large, but

               Lieut.-Gov. Laird reported in 1877, “That some of the bands 
               <br />
               within the limits of Treaties Numbers Four and Six sowed 
               <br />
               grain and potatoes with good results that year, one band having 
               <br />
               about one hundred acres under cultivation.” He also states 
               <br />
               that the Indians are very desirous of farming, and that he has 
               <br />
               hopes that a much larger quantity of seed will be sown next 
               <br />
               year (1879). He also states that the band at White Fish 
               <br />
               Lake, raised enough that year to maintain themselves without 
               <br />

               <br />
               the progress of the Indians is quite marked. They have

               established two villages in order to have the beneﬁt of schools.
