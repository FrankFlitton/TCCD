               SIR, —I have the honor to enclose an agreement made with two Cree head 
               <br />
               men, who expressed to me a desire to join the treaty made at Fort <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Carlton</span> 
               <br />
               and Fort Pitt, on the 9th September, 1876. Little Pine is a Cree Chief who 
               <br />
               has for some time expressed his willingness to take the treaty. Lucky Man 
               <br />
               is a head man lately made by the Indians who have been followers of Big 
               <br />
               Bear, but who have now left him. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Big Bear himself was present when both Little Pine and Lucky Man 
               <br />
               signed, and, I think, would have taken the treaty himself, had he not felt 
               <br />
               ashamed at so many of his lodges leaving him. He is now almost alone, 
               <br />
               only three or four followers having remained with him. He states that he 
               <br />
               will take the treaty at Sounding Lake at the time of the payments. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Both Little Pine and Lucky Man have requested that they may be paid 
               <br />
               at Fort Walsh, as it is impossible for them to reach the more northern 
               <br />
               agencies, and I have agreed to it. It will therefore be necessary that 
               <br />
               enough money be forwarded to pay these Indians here. Little Pine states 
               <br />
               he will have thirty-four lodges, and Lucky Man twenty-ﬁve. Taking 
               <br />
               the average of a lodge at eight, which I understand is a fair estimate, it will 
               <br />
               make four hundred and seventy-two extra Indians to be paid.
