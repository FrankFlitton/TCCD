               of the Plain Country, viz., the buffalo, was rapidly diminish- 
               <br />
               ing, and the advent of so large a body of foreign Indians 
               <br />
               has precipitated its diminution, so that the ﬁnal extinction of 
               <br />
               the buffalo is fast drawing near. Already the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada, in the discharge of a national obligation, which has ever 
               <br />
               been recognized by all civilized authorities, has been obliged 
               <br />
               to come to the aid of the Blackfeet and other Indians to avert 
               <br />
               the danger and suffering from famine. The Sioux are already 
               <br />
               feeling the hardships of their position, and it will tax the skill 
               <br />
               and energies of the Government of Canada to provide a remedy. 
               <br />
               Already, at the instance of the Hon. David Mills, then Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior (who visited Washington for the purpose), an 
               <br />
               effort was made by the American Government to induce the 
               <br />
               Sioux to return to their homes. Envoys were sent to them 
               <br />
               from the United States, but they declined to accept the over- 
               <br />
               tures made to them. On the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">previous</span> occasion of the ﬂight 
               <br />
               into our territories of the Sioux, the American Government, as 
               <br />
               has been before recited, after an interval of nearly four years, 
               <br />
               offered them protection on their return journey from British 
               <br />
               territory to their homes in the United States and “ entire abso- 
               <br />
               lution for all past offences.” This forms a precedent which 
               <br />
               should be invoked and would doubtless be accepted by the 
               <br />
               Sioux if they can be induced to believe in the good faith 
               <br />
               of the American Government towards them. Every effort 
               <br />
               should be made to bring about so desirable a result, and 
               <br />
               the subject will doubtless engage in the future, as it has done 
               <br />
               in the past, the anxious consideration and wise action of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Government, who have a right to appeal to the 
               <br />
               President of the United States and his advisers, to relieve them 
               <br />
               from the incubus of the presence in our territories of so 
               <br />
               many of the wards of that Government, and who are without 
               <br />
