               the south side of Bow River is to keep hunters from building winter 
               <br />
               shanties on the river bottom. This practice has a tendency to alarm the 
               <br />
               buffalo, and keep them from their feeding grounds on the lower part of the 
               <br />
               river. After ten years it is feared the buffalo will have become nearly ex- 
               <br />
               tinct, and that further protection will be needless. At any rate by that 
               <br />
               time the Indians hope to have herds of domestic cattle. The country on 
               <br />
               the upper part of the Bow River is better adapted for settlement than most 
               <br />
               of that included in the Blackfeet reserve, consequently the Commissioners 
               <br />
               deemed it advisable to agree that a belt on the south side of the river should 
               <br />
               be exempt from general occupation for ten years, particularly as the Indians 
               <br />
               set great value on the concession.

               2. The articles promised in addition to the money payments may to some 
               <br />
               appear excessive. The Stonies are the only Indians adhering to this treaty 
               <br />
               who desired agricultural implements and seed. The promises, therefore, 
               <br />
               respecting these things may be understood as merely applicable to that 
               <br />
               tribe. The Blackfeet and Bloods asked for nothing of this kind ; they 
               <br />
               preferred cattle, a d the Commissioners being fully of opinion that such 
               <br />
               were likely to be much more serviceable to them than seed and implements, 
               <br />
               encouraged them in their request. The number of cattle promised may 
               <br />
               appear large ; but when it is considered that cows can be readily purchased 
               <br />
               at Fort McLeod for twenty or twenty-ﬁve dollars per head, and their de- 
               <br />
               livery to the Indians will cost an inconsiderable sum, the total expense of 
               <br />
               supplying the articles promised by this treaty will, I am convinced, cost less 
               <br />
               than those under either Treaty Number Four or Number Six.

               3. I would urge that the ofﬁcers of the Mounted Police be entrusted to 
               <br />
               make the annual payments to the Indians under this treaty. The Chiefs 
               <br />
               themselves requested this, and I said I believed the Government Would 
               <br />
               gladly consent to the arrangement. The Indians have conﬁdence in the 
               <br />
               Police, and it might be some time before they would acquire the same respect 
               <br />
               for strangers.

               4. The organization of the Blackfeet bands is somewhat different from 
               <br />
               that of the Saulteaux and Crees. They have large bands with head and 
               <br />
               minor Chiefs, and as they preferred that this arrangement should remain 
               <br />
               unchanged, the Commissioners gladly acceded to their desire, as expense 
               <br />
