               missioners again met them, but the Cree Chief “Loud Voice” asked for 
               <br />

               equal right of trading. The Commissioners then agreed to grant a ﬁnal

               The Saulteaux, one day went the length of placing six “soldiers,” armed 
               <br />
               with riﬂes and revolvers, in the conference tent to intimidate the other 
               <br />
               Indians, a step which was promptly counteracted by Lieut.-Col. Smith, 
               <br />

               the wisdom of the course taken by the Commissioners in obtaining the escort 
               <br />
               of the militia, as their presence exerted great moral inﬂuence, and I am 
               <br />
               persuaded, prevented the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jealousies</span> and ancient feud between the Crees and

               Saulteaux culminating in acts of violence.

               The conduct of the whole force was excellent and, whether on the march or

               in the encampment ground, they conducted themselves in a most creditable

               The Crees had, in the interval, decided to treat with us independently, 
               <br />
               and the Saulteaux, ﬁnding this, came to a similar conclusion. After a 
               <br />
               protracted interview, the Indians asked to be granted the same terms as 
               <br />
               were given at the North-VVest Angle. The Commissioners took time to 
               <br />
