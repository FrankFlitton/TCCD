               Ere passing from the subject, I cannot refrain from alluding 
               <br />
               to the Half-breed population of the North-West Territories. 
               <br />
               Those people are mainly of French Canadian descent, though 
               <br />
               there are a few of Scotch blood in the territories. Their inﬂu- 
               <br />
               ence with the Indian population is extensive. In Manitoba 
               <br />
               there is a large population of French Metis and Scotch Half- 
               <br />
               breeds, and they are proud of their mixed blood. This race is 
               <br />
               an important factor with regard to all N orth—West questions.
