               wanted suits of clothing every year for all the hands, and ﬁfty dollars for

               Railway, which I refused. They then asked that no “ fire-water ” should be 
               <br />
               sold on their reserves, and I promised that a regulation to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> effect should

               to war, and I told them the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Queen</span> was not in the hahit of employing the 
               <br />
               Indians in warfare. They asked that they should have power to put turhn-

               lent men oii' their reserves, ami I told them the law would he enforced against

               such men. They asked what reserves would he given them, and were 
               <br />
               informed by Mr. I‘rovencher that reserves of farming and other lands Would

               be given them as previously stated, and that any land actually in cultivation

               said if they were found on their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reserves</span> it would he to their beneﬁt, but not 
               <br />
               otherwise. They asked if an Indian found a. mine would he be paid for it, 
               <br />
               I told them he could sell his information if he could ﬁnd a purchaser like 
               <br />
               any other person. They explained that some of their children had married 
               <br />
               in the States, and they wished them to return and live among them, and 
               <br />
               wanted them included in the treaty. I told them the treaty was not for 
               <br />
               American Indians, but any bonu <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁdc</span> British I actions of the class they

               They said there \vere some ten to twenty families of half-breeds who were 
               <br />
               recognized as Indians, and lived with them, and they wished them included. 
               <br />
               I said the treaty was not for whites, but I would recommend that those 
               <br />
               families should he permitted the. option of taking either status as Indians or 
               <br />
               whites, but that they could not take both. They asked that Mr. Charles 
               <br />
               Nolin should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">employed</span> as an Indian Agent, and I stated that I would

               snlunit his name to the Government with favorahle mention of his services 
               <br />
               on that occasion. They asked that the Chiefs and head men, as in other 
               <br />
               treaties, should get an ofﬁcial suit of clothing, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> ﬂag, and a medal, which I 
               <br />
               promised. Mawedopenais produced one of the medals given to the Red 
               <br />
               River Chiefs, said it was not silver, and they were ashamed to wear it, as it 
               <br />
               turned black, and then, with an air of great contempt, struck it with his 
               <br />
               knife. I stated that I would mention what he had said, and the manner in 
               <br />
               which he had spoken. They also stated the Hudson Bay Company had 
               <br />
               staked out ground at Fort Francis, on part of the land they claimed to have 
               <br />
               used, and to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entitled</span> to, and I promised that enquiry would be made into 
               <br />
               the matter. They apologized for the number of questions put me, which
