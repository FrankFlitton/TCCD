               put into their hands the means of providing for themselves 
               <br />
               and their families at home; and now I will give you my last 
               <br />
               words. When I held out my hands to you at ﬁrst, I intended 
               <br />
               to do what was just and right, and what I had the power to do 
               <br />
               at once,-—not to go backwards and forwards, but at once to do 
               <br />
               what I believe is just and right to you. I was very much 
               <br />
               pleased yesterday with the words of the Chief of Lac Seul. I 
               <br />
               was glad to hear that he had commenced to farm and to raise 
               <br />
               things for himself and family, and I was glad to hear him ask 
               <br />
               me to hold out my hand. T. think we should do everything to 
               <br />
               help you by giving you the means .to grow some food, so that 
               <br />
               if it is a bad year for ﬁshing and hunting you may have some- 
               <br />
               thing for your children at home. If you had not asked it the 
               <br />
               Goverment would have done it all the same, although I had not 
               <br />
               said so before. I can say this, that when a band settles down 
               <br />
               and actually commences to farm on their lands, the Goverment
