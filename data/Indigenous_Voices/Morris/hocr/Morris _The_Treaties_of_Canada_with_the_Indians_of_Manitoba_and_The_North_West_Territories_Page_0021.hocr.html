               SIR,-—I have the honor to inform you that on Monday last I came to this 
               <br />
               Fort with the Commissioner to meet the Indians called here, with a view to 
               <br />
               negotiate a treaty, intending to open the business on Tuesday morning. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It appeared, however, on inquiry, that some bands of Indians had not 
               <br />
               arrived on Tuesday morning, and we were therefore obliged to postpone the 
               <br />
               opening of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meeting</span> till Thursday. On that day the Indians from all the 
               <br />
               sections of the country to which the invitation extended were found present 
               <br />
               to the number of about one thousand. A considerable body of half-breeds 
               <br />
               and other inhabitants of the country were also present, awaiting with some 
               <br />
               anxiety to learn what should be announced as the policy of the Government. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I enclose you a memorandum of the observations with which I opened the 
               <br />
               meeting. On reading them you will observe one or two points which may 
               <br />
               require some explanation. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               At the time of the treaty with the Earl of Selkirk, certain Indians signed 
               <br />
               as Chiefs and representatives of their people. Some of the Indians now deny 
               <br />
               that these men ever were Chiefs or had authority to sign the treaty. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               \Vith a view therefore to avoid a recurrence of any such question, we asked 
               <br />
               the Indians, as a ﬁrst step, to agree among themselves in selecting their 
               <br />
               Chiefs, and then to present them to us and have their names and authority 
               <br />
               recorded. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Furthermore, the Indians seem to have false ideas of the meaning of a 
               <br />
               reserve. They have been led to suppose that large tracts of ground were to 
               <br />
               be set aside for them as hunting grounds, including timber lands, of which 
               <br />
               they might sell the wood as if they were proprietors of the soil. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I wished to correct this idea at the outset. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Simpson followed me with some observations in the same strain, after 
               <br />
               which the Indians retired to select their Chiefs and spokesmen. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               On Friday morning the Chiefs and spokesmen were duly presented, and 
               <br />
               after their names were recorded, the Indians Were invited to express their 
               <br />
               views. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               After some delay they stated that there was a cloud before them which 
               <br />
               made things dark, and they did not wish to commence the proceedings till 
               <br />
               the cloud was dispersed. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               On inquiring into their meaning, I found that they were referring to some 
               <br />
               four of their number who were prisoners in gaol. It seems that some Swampy 
               <br />
               Indians had entered into a contract with the Hudson’s Bay Company as 
               <br />
               boatmen, and had deserted, and had been brought up before magistrates 
               <br />
               under a local law of last session, and ﬁned, and in default of payment sent 
               <br />
               to prison for forty days. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Of this term some considerable part had expired. A few of the offenders 
               <br />
               had paid their ﬁnes, but there were still four Indians remaining in prison. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               0n learning the facts I told the Indians that I could not listen to them if 
               <br />
               they made a demand for the release of the Indians as a matter of right; that
