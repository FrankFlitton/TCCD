     TREATY NUMBER THREE, OR THE NORTH-WEST ANGLE TREATY. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     IN the year 1871 the Privy Council of Canada issued a joint 
     <lb/>
     commission to Messrs. W. M. Simpson, S. J. Dawson and 
     <lb/>
     W. J. Pether, authorizing them to treat with the Ojibbeway 
     <lb/>
     Indians for the surrender to the Crown of the lands they in<lb break="no"/>habited—covering the area from the watershed of Lake Superior 
     <lb/>
     to the north-west angle of the Lake of the Woods, and from the 
     <lb/>
     American border to the height of land from which the streams 
     <lb/>
     flow towards the Hudson's Bay. This step had become neces<lb break="no"/>sary in order to make the route known as "the Dawson route," 
     <lb/>
     extending from Prince Arthur's Landing on Lake Superior to 
     <lb/>
     the north-west angle of the Lake of the Woods, which was then 
     <lb/>
     being opened up, "secure for the passage of emigrants and of 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Dominion generally," and also to enable the 
     <lb/>
     Government to throw open for settlement any portion of the 
     <lb/>
     land which might be susceptible of improvement and profitable 
     <lb/>
     occupation. The Commissioners accepted the appointment, and 
     <lb/>
     in July, 1871, met the Indians at Fort Francis. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The tribes preferred claims for right of way through their 
     <lb/>
     country. The Commissioners reported "that they had admitted 
     <lb/>
     these to a limited extent and had made them presents in pro<lb break="no"/>visions and clothing and were also to pay them a small amount 
     <lb/>
     in money, it being fully and distinctly understood by the 
     <lb/>
     Indians that these presents and clothing were accepted by them 
     <lb/>
     as an equivalent for all past claims whatever." The Commis<lb break="no"/>sioners having explained to them fully the intentions of the 
     <lb/>
     Government as to obtaining a surrender of their territorial 
     <lb/>
     rights, and giving in return therefor reserves of land and 
     <lb/>

     annual payments, asked them to consider the proposals calmly 
     <lb/>
     and meet the Commissioners the succeeding summer to 
     <lb/>
     come to an arrangement. In 1872, the Indians were found 
     <lb/>
     not to be ready for the making of a treaty and the subject 
     <lb/>
     was postponed. In the year 1873 a commission was issued 
     <lb/>
     to the Hon. Alexander Morris, then Lieutenant-Governor 
     <lb/>
    of Manitoba and the North-West Territories, Lieut.-Col. 
     <lb/>Provencher, who had in the interval been appointed Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Indian Affairs in the place of Mr. Simpson, who 
     <lb/>had resigned, and Lindsay Russell, Esq., but the latter being 
     <lb/>unable to act, Mr. Dawson, now M.P. for Algoma, was ap<lb break="no"/>pointed Commissioner in his stead. These Commissioners hav<lb break="no"/>ing accepted the duty confided to them, met the Indians at the 
     <lb/>north-west angle of the Lake of the Woods in the end of Sep<lb break="no"/>tember, 1873, and, after protracted and difficult negotiations, 
     <lb/>succeeded in effecting a treaty with them. A copy of the 
     <lb/>treaty will be found in the Appendix, and a brief record 
     <lb/> of the utterances of the Indians and of the Commissioners, 
     <lb/>which was taken down in short hand by one of the soldiers 
     <lb/>of the militia force, is hereto subjoined. This treaty was one of 
     <lb/> great importance, as it not only tranquilized the large Indian 
     <lb/> population affected by it, but eventually shaped the terms of 
     <lb/>all the treaties, four, five, six and seven, which have since been 
     <lb/> made with the Indians of the North-West Territories—who 
     <lb/>speedily became apprised of the concessions which had been 
     <lb/> granted to the Ojibbeway nation. The closing scenes were 
     <lb/>striking and impressive. The chief speaker, Mawe-do-pe-nais, 
     <lb/> thus winding up the conference on the part of the Indians, in his 
     <lb/> final address to the Lieutenant-Governor and his fellow Com<lb break="no"/>missioners :</p>

 
     <p>"Now you see me stand before you all : what has been done 
     <lb/>
     here to-day has been done openly before the Great Spirit and 
     <lb/>
     before the nation, and I hope I may never hear any one say that 
     <lb/>
     this treaty has been done secretly: and now in closing this 
     <lb/>
     council, I take off my glove, and in giving you my hand I 
     <lb/>

     deliver over my birthright and lands : and in taking your hand 
     <lb/>
     I hold fast all the promises you have made, and I hope they 
     <lb/>
    will last as long as the sun rises and the water flows, as you 
     <lb/>have said." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The conference then adjourned, and on re-assembling, after 
     <lb/>
     the treaty had been read and explained, the Commissioners signed 
     <lb/>
     it and the Lieutenant-Governor called on an aged hereditary 
     <lb/>
     Chief, Kee-ta-kay-pi-nais,to sign next. The Chief came forward, 
     <lb/>
     but declined to touch the pen, saying, "I must first have the 
     <lb/>
     money in my hand." The Lieutenant-Governor immediately held 
     <lb/>
     out his hand, and directed the interpreter to say to the chief, 
     <lb/>
     "Take my hand and feel the money in it. If you cannot trust 
     <lb/>
     me for half an hour, do not trust me forever." When this was 
     <lb/>
     repeated by the interpreter, the Chief smiled, took the out<lb break="no"/>stretched hand, and at once touched the pen, while his max t ' 
     <lb/>was being made, his last lingering distrust having been effect<lb break="no"/>ively dispelled by this prompt action and reply. The other 
     <lb/>Chiefs followed, and then the interpreter was directed to tell 
     <lb/>Kee-ta-kay-pi-nais, the Chief, that he would be paid forthwith, 
     <lb/>but the Chief at once replied, "Oh no, it is evening now, and 
     <lb/>I will wait till to-morrow." The payments were duly made 
     <lb/>next day, and so was closed, a treaty, whereby a territory 
     <lb/>was enabled to be opened up, of great importance to Canada, 
     <lb/>embracing as it does the Pacific Railway route to the North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>West Territories—a wide extent of fertile lands, and, as is 
     <lb/>believed, great mineral resources. I now quote the official 
     <lb/>despatch of the Lieutenant-Governor, dated the 14th October, 
     <lb/>1873, in which will be found, a full narrative of the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings, connected with the treaty, and a statement of the  
     <lb/>results thereby effected. I also submit a short-hand report 
     <lb/>of the negotiations connected with the treaty.

            <p>
     SIR,—I have the honor to enclose copy of a treaty made by myself, 
     <lb/>
     Lieut.-Col. Provencher, Indian agent, and S. J. Dawson, Esq., Com<lb break="no"/>missioner, acting on behalf of Her Majesty, of the one part, and the Sal<lb break="no"/>teaux tribe of Ojibbeway Indians on the other, at the North-West Angle 
     <lb/>
     of the Lake of the Woods, on the 3rd of October, for the relinquishment of 
     <lb/>
     the Indian title to the tract of land therein described, and embracing 
     <lb/>
     55,000 square miles. In the first place, the holding of the negotiation of the 
     <lb/>
     treaty had been appointed by you to take place at the North-West Angle 
     <lb/>
     before you requested me to take part therein, and Mr. Dawson had obtained 
     <lb/>
     the consent of the Indians to meet there on the 10th of September, but they 
     <lb/>
     afterwards changed their minds, and refused to meet me unless I came to 
     <lb/>
     Fort Francis. I refused to do this, as I felt that the yielding to the demand 
     <lb/>
     of the Indians in this respect, would operate injuriously to the success of the 
     <lb/>
     treaty, and the results proved the correctness of the opinion I had formed. 
     <lb/>
     I therefore sent a special agent (Mr. Pierre Levaillier) to warn them that I 
     <lb/>
     would meet them as arranged at the North-West Angle on the 25th, or not 
     <lb/>
     at all this year, to which they eventually agreed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I left here for the Angle on the 23rd September, and arrived there on the 
     <lb/>
     25th, when I was joined by Messrs. Provencher and Dawson, the last named 
     <lb/>
     of whom I was glad to find had been associated with the Commissioners in 
     <lb/>
     consequence of the resignation of Mr. Lindsey Russell, thereby giving us 
     <lb/>
     the benefit as well of his knowledge of the country to be dealt with, as of the 
     <lb/>
     several bands of Indians therein. Mr. Pether, of Fort Francis, was also in 
     <lb/>
     attendance, and Mr. Provencher was accompanied by Mr. St. John, of his 
     <lb/>
     department. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On arriving, the Indians, who were already there, came up to the house I 
     <lb/>
     occupied, in procession, headed by braves bearing a banner and a Union Jack, 
     <lb/>
     and accompanied by others beating drums. They asked leave to perform a 
     <lb/>
     dance in my honor, after which they presented to me the pipe of peace. 
     <lb/>
     They were then supplied with provisions and returned to their camp. As 
     <lb/>
     the Indians had not all arrived, and for other reasons, the 26th, 27th and 
     <lb/>
     28th were passed without any progress, but on the 29th I sent them word 
     <lb/>
     that they must meet the Commissioners next morning. Accordingly, on the 
     <lb/>
     the 30th, they met us in a tent, the use of which I had obtained from the 
     <lb/>
     military authorities. I explained to them the object of the meeting, but as 
     <lb/>
     they informed me that they were not ready to confer with us, I adjourned 
     <lb/>
     the meeting until next day. On the lst October they again assembled. 
     <lb/>
     The principal cause of the delay was divisions and jealousies among 
     <lb/>
     themselves. The nation had not met for many years, and some of them had 
     <lb/>
     never before been assembled together. They were very jealous of each other, 
     <lb/>
     and dreaded any of the Chiefs having individual communications with me, 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">48</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw>
   
        

     to prevent which they had guards on the approaches to my house and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Dawson's tent. On the 2nd October they again assembled, when I again 
     <lb/>
    explained the object of the meeting, through Mr. McPherson, an intelligent 
     <lb/>half-breed trader, whose services I secured. M. Chatelan, the Government 
     <lb/>interpreter, was also present. They had selected three spokesmen, and had 
     <lb/>also an Indian reporter, whose duty was to commit to memory all that was 
     <lb/>said. They had also secured the services of M. Joseph Nolin, of Point du 
     <lb/>Chene, to take notes in French of the negotiations, a copy of which notes I 
     <lb/>obtained from him and herewith enclose. The spokesmen informed me they 
     <lb/>would not treat as to the land until we settled with them as to the Dawson 
     <lb/>route, with regard to which they alleged Mr. Dawson had made promises 
     <lb/>which had not been kept, and that they had not been paid for the wood used 
     <lb/>in building the steamers, nor for the use of the route itself. Mr. Dawson 
     <lb/>explained that he had paid them for cutting wood, but had always asserted 
     <lb/>a common right to the use of wood and the water way. He asked them 
     <lb/>what promise had not been kept, and pointed out that the Government had 
     <lb/>twice before endeavored to treat with them for a settlement of all matters. 
     <lb/>He referred them to me as to the general question of the use of the route. 
     <lb/>They were unable to name any promises which had not been kept. Thereupon 
     <lb/>I told them I came on behalf of the Queen and the Government of the 
     <lb/>Dominion of Canada to treat with them with regard to the lands and all 
     <lb/>other matters, but that they refused to hear what I had to say ; they had 
     <lb/>closed my mouth ; and as we would not treat except for the settlement of all 
     <lb/>matters past and future I could not speak unless they asked me to do so. 
     <lb/>They conferred among themselves, and seeing that we were quite firm, the 
     <lb/>spokesman came forward and said that they would not close my mouth, after 
     <lb/>which they would make their demands. The Commissioners had had a 
     <lb/>conference and agreed, as they found there was no hope of a treaty for a less 
     <lb/>sum, to offer five dollars per head, a present of ten dollars, and reserves of 
     <lb/>farming and other lands not exceeding one square mile per family of five, or 
     <lb/>in that proportion, sums within the limits of our instructions, though I had 
     <lb/>private advices if possible not to give the maximum sum named, as the 
     <lb/>Government had been under a misapprehension as to amounts given to the 
     <lb/>bands in the United States. The Chiefs heard my proposal, and the meeting 
     <lb/>adjourned until next day. On the 3rd October the Chiefs again assembled 
     <lb/>and made a counter proposition, of which I enclose a copy, being the demand 
     <lb/>they have urged since 1869. I also enclose an estimate I had made of the 
     <lb/>money value of the demand, amounting to $125,000 per annum. On behalf 
     <lb/>of the Commissioners I at once peremptorily refused the demand. The 
     <lb/>spokesmen returned to the Chiefs, who were arranged on benches, the people 
     <lb/>sitting on the ground behind them, and on their return they informed me 
     <lb/>that the Chiefs, warriors and braves were of one mind, that they would 
     <lb/>make a treaty only if we acceded to their demand. I told them if so the 
     <lb/>conference was over, that I would return and report that they had refused 
     <lb/>to make a reasonable treaty, that hereafter I would treat with those bands 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="49" facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_05_Page_049.jpg"/>
            <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The North-West Angle Treaty</hi>.</fw> <fw type="num">49</fw>
   
         
     who were willing to treat, but that I would advise them to return to the 
     <lb/>
     council and reconsider their determination before next morning, when, if 
     <lb/>
     not, I should certainly leave. This brought matters to a crisis. The Chief 
     <lb/>
     of the Lac Seul band came forward to speak. The others tried to prevent 
     <lb/>
     him, but he was secured a hearing. He stated that he represented four 
     <lb/>
     hundred people in the north ; that they wished a treaty ; that they wished a 
     <lb/>
     school-master to be sent them to teach their children the knowledge of the 
     <lb/>
     white man ; that they had begun to cultivate the soil and were growing 
     <lb/>
     potatoes and Indian corn, but wished other grain for seed and some 
     <lb/>
     agricultural implements and cattle. This Chief spoke under evident 
     <lb/>
     apprehension as to the course he was taking in resisting the other Indians, 
     <lb/>
     and displayed much good sense and moral courage. He was followed by the 
     <lb/>
     Chief "Blackstone," who urged the other Chiefs to return to the council and 
     <lb/>
     consider my proposals, stating that he was ready to treat, though he did not 
     <lb/>
     agree to my proposals nor to those made to me. I then told them that I had 
     <lb/>
     known all along they were not united as they had said ; that they ought not 
     <lb/>
     to allow a few Chiefs to prevent a treaty, and that I wished to treat with 
     <lb/>
     them as a nation and not with separate bands, as they would otherwise 
     <lb/>
     compel me to do ; and therefore urged them to return to their council, 
     <lb/>
     promising to remain another day to give them time for consideration. They 
     <lb/>
     spent the night in council, and next morning having received a message 
     <lb/>
     from M. Charles Nolin, a French half-breed, that they were becoming more 
     <lb/>
     amenable to reason, I requested the Hon. James McKay (who went to the 
     <lb/>
     Angle three times to promote this treaty), Charles Nolin and Pierre Levaillier 
     <lb/>
     to go down to the Indian Council, and as men of their own blood, give them 
     <lb/>
     friendly advice. They accordingly did so, and were received by the Indians, 
     <lb/>
     and in about half an hour afterwards were followed by Messrs. Provencher 
     <lb/>
     and St. John, who also took part in the interview with the Council of Chiefs. 
     <lb/>
     The Chiefs were summoned to the conference by the sound of a bugle and 
     <lb/>
     again met us, when they told me that the determination to adhere to their 
     <lb/>
     demand had been so strong a bond that they did not think it could be 
     <lb/>
     broken, but they had now determined to see if I would give them anything 
     <lb/>
     more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commissioners had had a conference, and agreed previously to offer 
     <lb/>
     a small sum for ammunition and twine for nets, yearly—a few agricultural 
     <lb/>
     implements and seeds, for any band actually farming or commencing to 
     <lb/>
     farm, and to increase the money payment by two dollars per head if it should 
     <lb/>
     be found necessary in order to secure a treaty, maintaining a permanent 
     <lb/>
     annuities at the sum fixed. The Indians on the other hand had determined 
     <lb/>
     on asking fifteen dollars, with some other demands. In fixing the ten 
     <lb/>
     dollars the Commissioners had done so as a sum likely to be accepted in view 
     <lb/>
     of three dollars per head having been paid the Indians the first year the 
     <lb/>
     Dawson route was used, and that they had received nothing since. In reply 
     <lb/>
     to the Indians, I told them I was glad that they had reconsidered their 
     <lb/>
     decision, and that as they had done so, being desirous of inducing them to 
     <lb/>

     practice agriculture and to have the means of getting food if their fishing and 
     <lb/>
     hunting failed, we would give them certain implements, cattle and grain, 
     <lb/>
     once for all, and the extra two dollars per head of a money payment. This 
     <lb/>
     proposal was received favorably, but the spokesmen again came forward and 
     <lb/>
     said they had some questions to ask before accepting my proposal. They 
     <lb/>
     wanted suits of clothing every year for all the bands, and fifty dollars for 
     <lb/>
     every Chief annually. This I declined, but told them that there were some 
     <lb/>
     presents of clothing and food which would be given them this year at the 
     <lb/>
     close of treaty. They then asked free passes forever over the Canada Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway, which I refused. They then asked that no " fire-water " should be 
     <lb/>
     sold on their reserves, and I promised that a regulation to this effect should 
     <lb/>
     he introduced into the treaty. They then asked that they should not be sent 
     <lb/>
     to war, and I told them the Queen was not in the hahit of employing the 
     <lb/>
     Indians in warfare. They asked that they should have power to put turbu<lb break="no"/>lent men off their reserves, and I told them the law would be enforced against 
     <lb/>
     such men. They asked what reserves would be given them, and were 
     <lb/>
     informed by Mr. Provencher that reserves of farming and other lands would 
     <lb/>
     be given them as previously stated, and that any land actually in cultivation 
     <lb/>
     by them would be respected. They asked if the mines would be theirs ; I 
     <lb/>
     said if they were found on their reserves it would he to their benefit, but not 
     <lb/>
     otherwise. They asked if an Indian found a mine would he be paid for it, 
     <lb/>
     I told them he could sell his information if he could find a purchaser like 
     <lb/>
     any other person. They explained that some of their children had married 
     <lb/>
     in the States, and they wished them to return and live among them, and 
     <lb/>
     wanted them included in the treaty. I told them the treaty was not for 
     <lb/>
     American Indians, but any <hi rendition="simple:italic">bona fide</hi> British <hi rendition="simple:italic">Indians</hi> of the class they 
     <lb/>
     mentioned who should <hi rendition="simple:italic">within two</hi> years be found <hi rendition="simple:italic">resident</hi> on British soil would 
     <lb/>
     be recognized. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They said there were some ten to twenty families of half-breeds who were 
     <lb/>
     recognized as Indians, and lived with them, and they wished them included. 
     <lb/>
     I said the treaty was not for whites, but I would recommend that those 
     <lb/>
     families should be permitted the. option of taking either status as Indians or 
     <lb/>
     whites, but that they could not take both. They asked that Mr. Charles 
     <lb/>
     Nolin should be employed as an Indian Agent, and I stated that I would 
     <lb/>
     submit his name to the Government with favorable mention of his services 
     <lb/>
     on that occasion. They asked that the Chiefs and head men, as in other 
     <lb/>
     treaties, should get an official suit of clothing, a flag, and a medal, which I 
     <lb/>
     promised. Mawedopenais produced one of the medals given to the Red 
     <lb/>
     River Chiefs, said it was not silver, and they were ashamed to wear it, as it 
     <lb/>
     turned black, and then, with an air of great contempt, struck it with his 
     <lb/>
     knife. I stated that I would mention what he had said, and the manner in 
     <lb/>
     which he had spoken. They also stated the Hudson Bay Company had 
     <lb/>
     staked out ground at Fort Francis, on part of the land they claimed to have 
     <lb/>
     used, and to be entitled to, and I promised that enquiry would be made into 
     <lb/>
     the matter. They apologized for the number of questions put me, which 
     <lb/>

     occupied a space of some hours, and then the principal spokesman, Mawe<lb break="no"/>dopenais, came forward and drew off his gloves, and spoke as follows : 
     <lb/>
     " Now you see me stand before you all. What has been done here to-day, 
     <lb/>
     has been done openly before the Great Spirit, and before the nation, and 
     <lb/>
     I hope that I may never hear any one say that this treaty has been done 
     <lb/>
     secretly. And now, in closing this council, I take off my glove, and in 
     <lb/>
     giving you my hand, I deliver over my birthright, and lands, and in 
     <lb/>
     taking your hand I hold fast all the promises you have made, and I hope 
     <lb/>
     they will last as long as the sun goes round, and the water flows, as you 
     <lb/>
     have said." To which I replied as follows: " I accept your hand, and 
     <lb/>
     with it the lands, and will keep all my promises, in the firm belief that 
     <lb/>
     the treaty now to be signed will bind the red man and the white man 
     <lb/>
     together as friends forever." The conference then adjourned for an hour 
     <lb/>
     to enable the text of the treaty to be completed, in accordance with the 
     <lb/>
     understanding arrived at. At the expiration of that period the conference 
     <lb/>
     was resumed, and after the reading of the treaty, and an explanation of it 
     <lb/>
     in Indian by the Hon. James McKay, it was signed by the Commissioners 
     <lb/>
     and by the several Chiefs, the first signature being that of a very aged 
     <lb/>
     hereditary Chief he next day the Indians were paid by Messrs. Pether 
     <lb/>
     and Graham, of the Department of Public Works ; the latter of whom 
     <lb/>
     kindly offered his services, as Mr. Provencher had to leave to keep another 
     <lb/>
     appointment. The negotiation was a very difficult and trying one, and 
     <lb/>
     required on the part of the Commissioners, great patience and firmness. On 
     <lb/>
     the whole I am of opinion that the issue is a happy one. With the exception 
     <lb/>
     of two bands in the Shebandowan District, whose adhesion was secured in 
     <lb/>
     advance, and the signatures of whose Chiefs Mr. Dawson left to secure, the 
     <lb/>
     Indian title has been extinguished over the vast tract of country comprising 
     <lb/>
     55,000 square miles lying between the upper boundary of the Lake Superior 
     <lb/>
     treaty, and that of the treaty made by Mr. Commissioner Simpson at 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba Post, and embracing within its bounds the Dawson route, the 
     <lb/>
     route of the Canada Pacific Railway, and an extensive lumber and mineral 
     <lb/>
     region.<ref target="#fn_01">*</ref> It is fortunate, too, that the arrangement has been effected, as the 
     <lb/>
     Indians along the lakes and rivers were dissatisfied at the use of the waters, 
     <lb/>
     which they considered theirs, having been taken without compensation, 
     <lb/>
     so much so indeed that I believe if the treaty had not been made, the 
     <lb/>
     Government would have been compelled to place a force on the line next year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before closing this despatch, I have much pleasure in bearing testimony 
     <lb/>
     to the hearty co-operation and efficient aid the Commissioners received from 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Metis</hi> who were present at the Angle, and who, with one accord, whether 
     <lb/>
     of French or English origin, used the influence which their relationships to 
     <lb/>
     the Indians gave them, to impress them with the necessity of their entering 
     <lb/>
     into the treaty. I must also express my obligations to the detachment of 
     <lb/>

     troops under the command of Captain Macdonald, assigned me as an escort, 
     <lb/>
     for their soldierly bearing and excellent conduct while at the Angle. Their 
     <lb/>
     presence was of great value, and had the effect of deterring traders from 
     <lb/>
     bringing articles of illicit trade for sale to the Indians ; and moreover 
     <lb/>
     exercised a moral influence which contributed most materially to the success 
     <lb/>
     of the negotiations. I have further to add, that it was found impossible, 
     <lb/>
     owing to the extent of the country treated for, and the want of knowledge of 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances of each band, to define the reserves to be granted to the 
     <lb/>
     Indians. It was therefore agreed that the reserves should be hereafter 
     <lb/>
     selected by officers of the Government, who should confer with the several 
     <lb/>
     bands, and pay due respect to lands actually cultivated by them. A pro<lb break="no"/>vision was also introduced to the effect that any of the reserves, or any 
     <lb/>
     interest in them, might hereafter be sold for the benefit of the Indians by 
     <lb/>
     the Government with their consent. I would suggest that instructions 
     <lb/>
     should be given to Mr. Dawson to select the reserves with all convenient 
     <lb/>
     speed ; and, to prevent complication, I would further suggest that no patents 
     <lb/>
     should be issued, or licenses granted, for mineral or timber lands, or other 
     <lb/>
     lands, until the quescion of the reserves has been first adjusted.

     <lb/>
     arrived here on Thursday, 24th inst., having enjoyed delight<lb break="no"/>ful weather during the entire trip from Fort Garry. The 
     <lb/>
     Governor occupies the house of the officer in charge of the H.

     B. Post. The grounds around it have been nicely graded and

     closely, so as to completely screen the house from wind, and at 
     <lb/>
     the same time contribute much to relieve the monotony of the 
     <lb/>
     scenery. Immediately west of this, and likewise enclosed by 
     <lb/>
     walls of evergreens, is the large marquee used as a Council 
     <lb/>
     House, by the contracting parties ; and immediately sur<lb break="no"/>rounding it to the north and west are the tents of the other 
     <lb/>
     officers of the Commission and the officers and men of the 
     <lb/>
     Volunteers on detachment duty.

            <p>
     Situated to the eastward, and extending all along the river 
     <lb/>
     bank, are the tents of the Indians to the number of a hundred, 
     <lb/>
     with here and there the tent of the trader, attracted thither by 
     <lb/>
     the prospect of turning an honest penny by exchanging the 
     <lb/>
     necessaries of Indian life for such amounts of the price of their 
     <lb/>
     heritage as they can be induced to spend. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The natives now assembled here number about 800 all told, 
     <lb/>
     and hail from the places given below. Among them are many 
     <lb/>
     fine physically developed men, who would be considered good 
     <lb/>
     looking were it not for the extravagance with which they be<lb break="no"/>smear their faces with pigments of all colors. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was at first thought probable that the serious business of 
     <lb/>
     the meeting would be begun on Friday, but owing to the non<lb break="no"/>arrival of a large body of Rainy River and Lac Seul repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives, it was decided to defer it until next day. Saturday 
     <lb/>
     came, and owing to the arrival of a messenger from the Lac 
     <lb/>
     Seul band asking the Governor to wait for their arrival, pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings have further stayed until Monday. But "hope de<lb break="no"/>ferred maketh the heart sick ;" so the advent of Monday 
     <lb/>
     brought nothing but disappointment, and this, coupled with 
     <lb/>
     the disagreeable wet and cold weather that prevailed, made 
     <lb/>
     every one ill at ease if not miserable. The Chiefs were not 
     <lb/>
     ready to treat—they had business of their own to transact, 
     <lb/>
     which must be disposed of before they could see the Governor ; 
     <lb/>
     and so another delay was granted. But Monday did not find 
     <lb/>
     them ready, and they refused to begin negotiations. An inti<lb break="no"/>mation from the Governor that unless they were ready on the 
     <lb/>

     following day he would leave for home on Wednesday, hurried 
     <lb/>
     them up a little—they did wait on him today, Tuesday, but 
     <lb/>
     only to say they had not yet finished their own business, but 
     <lb/>
     that they would try and be ready to treat on Wednesday. 
     <lb/>
     And so the matter stands at present—if the Indians agree 
     <lb/>
     amongst themselves, the treaty will be opened to-morrow; 
     <lb/>
     otherwise the Governor will strike camp and return to Fort 
     <lb/>
     Garry.

            <p>
     Divisions and local jealousies have taken possession of the 
     <lb/>
     Indian mind. The difficulties are the inability of the Indians 
     <lb/>
     to select a high or principal chief from amongst themselves, 
     <lb/>
     and as to the matter and extent of the demands to be made. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     It is many years since these people had a general council, and 
     <lb/>
     in the interval many head men have died, while others have 
     <lb/>
     grown to man's estate, and feel ambitious to take part in the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings. But the fiat has gone forth, that unless a con<lb break="no"/>clusion is arrived at to-morrow negotiations will be broken off 
     <lb/>
     for this year.

     The assembled Chiefs met the Governor this morning, as per 
     <lb/>
     agreement, and opened the proceedings of the day by express<lb break="no"/>ing the pleasure they experienced at meeting the Commissioners 
     <lb/>
     on the present occasion. Promises had many times been made 
     <lb/>
     to them, and, said the speaker, unless they were now fulfilled 
     <lb/>
     they would not consider the broader question of the treaty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. S. J. Dawson, one of the Commissioners, reciprocated 
     <lb/>
     the expression of pleasure used by the Chiefs through their 
     <lb/>
     spokesman. He had long looked forward to this meeting, when 
     <lb/>
     all matters relating to the past, the present, and the future, 
     <lb/>
     could be disposed of so as to fix permanently the friendly rela<lb break="no"/>tions between the Indians and the white men. It was now, he 
     <lb/>
     continued, some years since the white men first came to this 
     <lb/>
     country—they came in the first place at the head of a great 
     <lb/>
     military expedition ; and when that expedition was passing 
     <lb/>
     through the country all the chiefs showed themselves to be true 
     <lb/>
     and loyal subjects—they showed themselves able and willing 
     <lb/>
     to support their Great Mother the Queen. Subsequently, when 
     <lb/>

     <fw type="num">56</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw> 
    

     we began to open up the road, we had to call upon the Indians 
     <lb/>
    to assist us in doing so, and they always proved themselves  
     <lb/>very happy to help in carrying out our great schemes. He 
     <lb/>was, he continued, one of the Commission employed by the 
     <lb/>Government to treat with them and devise a scheme whereby 
     <lb/>both white men and Indians would be benefitted. We made 
     <lb/>to the Indians the proposals we were authorized to make, and 
     <lb/>we have carried out these proposals in good faith. This was 
     <lb/>three years ago. What we were directed to offer we did offer, 
     <lb/>but the Indians thought it was too little, and negotiations were 
     <lb/>broken off. Since this I have done what was in my power to 
     <lb/>bring about this meeting with new terms, and consider it a very 
     <lb/>happy day that you should be assembled to meet the Governor 
     <lb/>of the Territory as representative of Her Majesty. He would 
     <lb/>explain to them the proposals he had to make. He had lived 
     <lb/>long amongst them and would advise them as a friend to take 
     <lb/>the opportunity of making arrangements with the Governor. 
     <lb/>When we arrange the general matters in question, should you 
     <lb/>choose to ask anything, I shall be most happy to explain it, as 
     <lb/>I am here all the time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The Chief in reply said his head men and young men were 
     <lb/>
     of one mind, and determined not to enter upon the treaty until 
     <lb/>
     the promises made in the past were fulfilled, they were tired 
     <lb/>
     of waiting. What the Commissioners called "small matters" 
     <lb/>
     were great to them, and were what they wished to have settled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The route that had been built through the country proved 
     <lb/>
     this, and the Commissioners promised something which they 
     <lb/>
     now wanted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This was taking the Commissioners on a new tack, but Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Dawson promptly undertook to answer the objections. He 
     <lb/>
     said all these questions had been discussed before; but if he 
     <lb/>
     had made any promises that remained unfulfilled, he would be 
     <lb/>
     happy to learn their nature. The Chief replied that all the 
     <lb/>
     houses on the line, and all the big boats on the waters, were 
     <lb/>
     theirs, and they wanted to be recompensed for them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Dawson continued, saying he was glad they had now 
     <lb/>
     come to a point on which they could deal. The Indians ques<lb break="no"/>tioned the right of the Government to take wood for the 
     <lb/>
     steamers. This was a right which the speaker had all along 
     <lb/>
     told them was common to all Her Majesty's subjects. He then 
     <lb/>
     referred them to the Governor if they had anything more to 
     <lb/>
     say on that subject. Wood on which Indians had bestowed 
     <lb/>
     labor was always paid for ; but wood on which we had spent 
     <lb/>
     our own labor was ours. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     His Excellency then addressed them at some length. He 
     <lb/>
    understood that they wanted to have the questions in which 
     <lb/>they were' interested treated separately. This was not what 
     <lb/>he came there for. Wood and water were the gift of the Great 
     <lb/>Spirit, and were made alike for the good of both the white man 
     <lb/>and red man. Many of his listeners had come a long way, and 
     <lb/>he, too, had come a long way, and he wanted all the questions 
     <lb/>settled at once, by one treaty. He had a message from the 
     <lb/>Queen, but if his mouth was kept shut, the responsibility would 
     <lb/>rest on the Indians, and not with him if he were prevented from 
     <lb/>delivering it. He had authority to tell them what sum of 
     <lb/>money he could give them in hand now, and what he could give 
     <lb/>them every year ; but it was for them to open his mouth. He 
     <lb/>concluded his remarks, which were forcibly delivered, with an 
     <lb/>emphatic "I have said." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The Chief reiterated that he and his young men were deter<lb break="no"/>mined not to go on with the treaty until the first question was 
     <lb/>
     disposed of. What was said about the trees and rivers was 
     <lb/>
     quite true, but it was the Indian's country, not the white 
     <lb/>
     man's. Following this the Governor told the Council that 
     <lb/>
     unless they would settle all the matters, the big and little, at 
     <lb/>
    once, he would not talk. He was bound by his Government, 
     <lb/>and was of the same mind to treat with them on all questions, 
     <lb/>and not on any one separately. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On seeing His Excellency so firm, and feeling that it would 
     <lb/>not do to allow any more time to pass without coming to busi<lb break="no"/><pb n="58" facs="final/images/Morris_MB_NWT_Treaties_Chapt_05_Page_058.jpg"/><fw type="num">58</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The Treaties of Canada with the Indians</hi>.</fw>ness the Chief asked the Governor to open his mouth and tell 
     <lb/>
     what propositions he was prepared to make. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     His Excellency then said—"I told you I was to make the 
     <lb/>
    treaty on the part of our Great Mother the Queen, and I feel 
     <lb/>it will be for your good and your children's. I should have 
     <lb/>been very sorry if you had shut my mouth, if I had had to go 
     <lb/>home without opening my mouth. I should not have been a 
     <lb/>true friend of yours if I had not asked you to open my mouth. 
     <lb/>We are all children of the same Great Spirit, and are subject 
     <lb/>to the same Queen. I want to settle all matters both of the 
     <lb/>past and the present, so that the white and red man will 
     <lb/>always be friends. I will give you lands for farms, and also 
     <lb/>reserves for your own use. I have authority to make reserves 
     <lb/>such as I have described, not exceeding in all a square mile for 
     <lb/>every family of five or thereabouts. It may be a long time 
     <lb/>before the other lands are wanted, and in the meantime you 
     <lb/>will be permitted to fish and hunt over them. I will also 
     <lb/>establish schools whenever any band asks for them, so that 
     <lb/>your children may have the learning of the white man. I will 
     <lb/>also give you a sum of money for yourselves and every one of 
     <lb/>your wives and children for this year. I will give you ten 
     <lb/>dollars per head of the population, and for every other year 
     <lb/>five dollars a-head. But to the chief men, not exceeding two 
     <lb/>to each band, we will give twenty dollars a-year for ever. I 
     <lb/>will give to each of you this year a present of goods and pro<lb break="no"/>visions to take you home, and I am sure you will be satisfied. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     After consultation amongst themselves, the Councillors went 
     <lb/>
     to have a talk about the matter and will meet the Governor to<lb break="no"/>morrow morning, when it is expected the bargain will be con<lb break="no"/>cluded. Of course. the Indians will make some other demands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Immediately after the adjournment as above, the Governor 
     <lb/>
     presented an ox to the people in camp; and the way it dis<lb break="no"/>appeared would have astonished the natives of any other land. 
     <lb/>
     Half-an-hour after it was led into encampment, it was cut up 
     <lb/>
    and boiling in fifty pots.

     of those you have seen before. We think it a great thing to 
     <lb/>
     meet you here. What we have heard yesterday, and as you 
     <lb/>
     represented yourself, you said the Queen sent you here, the 
     <lb/>
     way we understood you as a representative of the Queen. All 
     <lb/>
     this is our property where you have come. We have under<lb break="no"/>stood you yesterday that Her Majesty has given you the same

     power and authority as <hi rendition="simple:italic">she</hi> has, to act in this business ; you 
     <lb/>
     said the Queen gave you her goodness, her charitableness in 
     <lb/>
     your hands. This is what we think, that the Great Spirit has 
     <lb/>
     planted us on this ground where we are, as you were where 
     <lb/>
     you came from. We think where we are is our property. I 
     <lb/>
     will tell you what he said to us when he he planted us here ; 
     <lb/>
     the rules that we should follow—us Indians—He has given us 
     <lb/>
     rules that we should follow to govern us rightly. We have 
     <lb/>
     understood you that you have opened your charitable heart to

     us like a person taking off his garments and throwing them to 
     <lb/>
     all of us here. Now, first of all, I have a few words to address 
     <lb/>
     to this gentleman (Mr. Dawson). When he understood rightly

     what was my meaning yesterday, he threw himself on your

     when I spoke to him on the subject yesterday. We will follow

     what we heard from you yesterday, in regard to the money 
     <lb/>
     that you have promised us yesterday to each individual. I

     by the hand and say, "yes, we accept of your offer." I have 
     <lb/>
     not the power to do what you ask of me. I ask you once more 
     <lb/>
     to think what you are doing, and of those you have left at. 
     <lb/>
     home, and also of those that may be born yet, and I ask you 
     <lb/>
     not to turn your backs on what is offered to you, and you ought 
     <lb/>
     to see by what the Queen is offering you that she loves her red

     subjects as much as her white. I think you are forgetting one 
     <lb/>
     thing, that what I offer you is to be while the water flows and 
     <lb/>
     the sun rises. You know that in the United States they only 
     <lb/>
     pay the Indian for twenty years, and you come here to-day and 
     <lb/>
     ask for ever more than they get for twenty years. Is that 
     <lb/>
     just? I think you ought to accept my offer, and make a treaty 
     <lb/>
     with me as I ask you to do. I only ask you to think for 
     <lb/>
     yourselves, and for your families, and for your children and

     would have in goods, so that you would not have to pay the 
     <lb/>
     traders' prices for them. I wish you were all of the same mind 
     <lb/>
     as the Chief who has just spoken. He wants his children to be 
     <lb/>
     taught. He is right. He wants to get cattle to help him to 
     <lb/>
     raise grain for his children. It would be a good thing for you 
     <lb/>
     all to be of his mind, and then you would not go away without 
     <lb/>
     making this treaty with me."

     <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">BLACKSTONE</persName> (Shebandowan)—" I am going to lay down be<lb break="no"/>fore you the minds of those who are here. I do not wish to 
     <lb/>
     interfere with the decisions of those who are before you, or 
     <lb/>
     yet with your decisions. The people at the height of land where 
     <lb/>
     the waters came down from Shebandowan to Fort Frances, are

     <lb/>
     and I am perfectly willing to think that he authorized him. 
     <lb/>
     What I have to say is that the Indians may not be deceived by 
     <lb/>
     representations made to them, and that the two bands met me 
     <lb/>
     at Shebandowan and said they were perfectly willing to enter 
     <lb/>
     into a treaty."

            <p>
     Blackstone here handed in a paper which he alleged gave 
     <lb/>
     him authority as Chief, but which proved to be an official 
     <lb/>
     acknowledgement of the receipt of a letter by the Indian De<lb break="no"/>partment at Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Governor here agreed with the Council that it would be 
     <lb/>
     well for the Chiefs to have another meeting amongst them<lb break="no"/>selves. It was a most important day for them and for their 
     <lb/>
     children, and His Excellency would be glad to meet them again. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     The Council broke up at this point, and it was extremely 
     <lb/>
     doubtful whether an agreement could be come to or not. The 
     <lb/>
     Rainy River Indians were careless about the treaty, because 
     <lb/>
     they could get plenty of money for cutting wood for the boats, 
     <lb/>
     but the northern and eastern bands were anxious for one. The 
     <lb/>
     Governor decided that he would make a treaty with those bands 
     <lb/>
     that were willing to accept his terms, leaving out the few dis<lb break="no"/>affected ones. A Council was held by the Indians in the even<lb break="no"/>ing, at which Hon. James McKay, Pierre Léveillée, Charles 
     <lb/>
     Nolin, and Mr. Genton were present by invitation of the 
     <lb/>
     Chiefs. After a very lengthy and exhaustive discussion, it was 
     <lb/>
     decided to accept the Governor's terms, and the final meeting 
     <lb/>
     was announced for Friday morning. Punctually at the appointed 
     <lb/>
     time proceedings were opened by the Fort Francis Chiefs 
     <lb/>
     announcing to His Excellency that they were all of one mind, 
     <lb/>
     and would accept his terms, with a few modifications. The 
     <lb/>
     discussion of these terms occupied five hours, and met every 
     <lb/>
     possible contingency so fully that it would be impossible to do 
     <lb/>
     justice to the negotiators otherwise than by giving a full report 
     <lb/>
     of the speeches on both sides ; but want of space compels us to 
     <lb/>
     lay it over until next week. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The treaty was finally closed on Friday afternoon, and signed 
     <lb/>
     on Saturday ; after which a large quantity of provisions, ammu<lb break="no"/>nition and other goods were distributed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When the council broke up last (Thursday) night, 3rd Octo<lb break="no"/>ber, it looked very improbable that an understanding could be 
     <lb/>
     arrived at, but the firmness of the Governor, and the prospect 
     <lb/>
     that he would make a treaty with such of the bands as were 
     <lb/>
     willing to accept his terms, to the exclusion of the others, led 
     <lb/>
     them to reconsider their demands. The Hon. James McKay, 
     <lb/>
     and Messrs. Nolin, Genton, and Léveillée were invited in to their 
     <lb/>
     council, and after a most exhaustive discussion of the circum<lb break="no"/>stance in which they were placed, it was resolved to accept the 
     <lb/>
     Governor's terms, with some modifications. Word was sent to 
     <lb/>

     put into their hands the means of providing for themselves 
     <lb/>
     and their families at home; and now I will give you my last 
     <lb/>
     words. When I held out my hands to you at first, I intended 
     <lb/>
     to do what was just and right, and what I had the power to do 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">at once</hi>,—not to go backwards and forwards, but at once to do 
     <lb/>
     what I believe is just and right to you. I was very much 
     <lb/>
     pleased yesterday with the words of the Chief of Lac Seul. I 
     <lb/>
     was glad to hear that he had commenced to farm and to raise 
     <lb/>
     things for himself and family, and I was glad to hear him ask 
     <lb/>
     me to hold out my hand. I think we should do everything to 
     <lb/>
     help you by giving you the means to grow some food, so that 
     <lb/>
     if it is a bad year for fishing and hunting you may have some<lb break="no"/>thing for your children at home. If you had not asked it the 
     <lb/>
     Goverment would have done it all the same, although I had not 
     <lb/>
     said so before. I can say this, that when a band settles down 
     <lb/>
     and actually commences to farm on their lands, the <choice><sic>Goverment</sic><corr>Government</corr></choice>

     will agree to give two hoes, one spade, one scythe, and one axe 
     <lb/>
     for every family actually settled ; one plough for every ten famil<lb break="no"/>ies ; five harrows for every twenty families ; and a yoke of 
     <lb/>
     oxen, a bull and four cows for every band ; and enough barley, 
     <lb/>
     wheat and oats to plant the land they have actually broken 
     <lb/>
     up. This is to enable them to cultivate their land, and it is 
     <lb/>
     to be given them on their commencing to do so, once for all. 
     <lb/>
     There is one thing that I have thought over, and I think it is 
     <lb/>
     a wise thing to do. That is to give you ammunition, and twine 
     <lb/>
     for making, nets, to the extent of $1,500 per year, for the whole 
     <lb/>
     nation, so that you can have the means of procuring food.- </p>

<p>Now, I will mention the last thing that I can do. I think 
     <lb/>
     that the sum I have offered you to be paid after this year for 
     <lb/>
     every man, woman and child now, and for years to come, is 
     <lb/>
     right and is the proper sum. I will not make any change in 
     <lb/>
     that, but we are anxious to show you that we have a great 
     <lb/>
     desire to understand you—that we wish to do the utmost in our 
     <lb/>
     power to make you contented, so that the white and the red 
     <lb/>
     man will always be friends. This year, instead of ten dollars we 
     <lb/>
     will give you twelve dollars, to be paid you at once as soon as we 
     <lb/>
     sign the treaty. This is the best I can do for you. I wish you to 
     <lb/>
     understand we do not come here as traders, but as representing 
     <lb/>
     the Crown, and to do what we believe is just and right. We 
     <lb/>
     have asked in that spirit, and I hope you will meet me in that 
     <lb/>
     spirit and shake hands with me-day and make a treaty for 
     <lb/>

     On Saturday, Mr. Pether, Local Superintendent of Indian

     Works, began to pay the treaty money—an employment that

     all did a great trade—the H. B. Co. alone taking in $4,000 in 
     <lb/>
     thirty hours—it was a noticeable fact that many took home 
     <lb/>
     with them nearly all their money. When urged to buy goods

     there, a frequent reply was : " If we spend all our money here 
     <lb/>
     and go home and want debt, we will be told to get our debt 
     <lb/>
     where we spent our money. "Debt" is used by them instead 
     <lb/>
     of the word "credit." Many others deposited money with

     One very wonderful thing that forced itself on the attention 
     <lb/>
     of every one was the perfect order that prevailed throughout 
     <lb/>
     the camp, and which more particularly marked proceedings in 
     <lb/>
     the council. Whether the demands put forward were granted 
     <lb/>
     by the Governor or not, there was no petulance, no ill-feeling, 
     <lb/>
     evinced ; but everything was done with a calm dignity that was

     their winter quarters.

     The Governor and party left on Monday morning, the troops, 
     <lb/>
     under command of Captain McDonald, who had conducted 
     <lb/>
     themselves with the greatest propriety, and had contributed, by 
     <lb/>
     the moral effect of their presence, much to the success of the 
     <lb/>
     negotiation, having marched to Fort Garry on Saturday morn<lb break="no"/>ing.
