               I also bought five sacks of flour from the government stores 
               <br />
               from stock they had on hand to meet requirements of the 
               <br />
               Indians in the treaty negotiations, a half keg of tea, and a half 
               <br />
               keg of sugar from a ten gallon barrel. I took all the tobacco I 
               <br />
               could get, as there had been a heavy run on this luxury item.

               Taking advantage of the lower prices of the traders anxious to 
               <br />
               clear their stocks for the return journey, I was able to practically 
               <br />
               name my own price for the things I wanted.

               The cart that I had purchased from Alexander Kennedy was 
               <br />
               iron bound, the first to make an appearance in the trade, so I 
               <br />
               was not afraid to load heavy. I was very well pleased with myself 
               <br />
               as I made the rounds of the traders preparing to leave, picking 
               <br />
               up bargains wherever I could. Money, my friend, had a great

               William Bull was usually the best of companions but for the 
               <br />
               first few days I thought he was very quiet and somewhat 
               <br />
               despondent. Actually he seemed to be occupied in some deep 
               <br />
               thought, so I finally asked him what was troubling him.

               he now speaks as if it had already been promised to him. I 
               <br />
               listened carefully to your interpretations of the Governor’s 
               <br />
               answer to his request. The Governor stated that he had no 
               <br />
               authority to grant any such request and merely stated that as 
               <br />
               James Seenum was a chief and had asked, he would pass the 
               <br />
               request on to his superiors. Is that right, Peter?”

               <br />
               for one chief would have broken the terms of the treaty to all 
               <br />
               those others who had already signed. Surely Chief Seenum does 
               <br />
               not think that he has been promised the land from the Dog

               <br />
               before the camp broke up. I tried to explain to him that this was 
               <br />
               not true but he would have none of my explanation, and we had 
               <br />
               some words between us. That is why I asked to go along with 
               <br />
               you. It would be a good thing if you would speak to him about 
               <br />

               is not satisfied with the terms of the treaty why did he sign? It
