               one of our girls, you did not marry trouble. Your wife has had

               This remark of the old gentleman had its desired effect in 
               <br />
               cooling my nervousness. Under his cheerful conversation 
               <br />
               which avoided the matter uppermost in my mind, we began 
               <br />
               eating. I forgot my lack of hunger and my usual good appetite 
               <br />
               asserted itself, much to the amusement of my optimistic friend. 
               <br />
               The gleam in his eye reminded me of my former protests 
               <br />
               against eating any breakfast.

               It was now broad daylight and everybody was up and about 
               <br />
               their duties. I watched the old gentleman’s clumsy efforts at 
               <br />
               washing the dishes. Then he turned to me in a grumbling voice 
               <br />
               and said, “You have my wife working for you and I have to do 
               <br />
               her work, so you had better go after my horses as I need them 
               <br />
               this morning.”

               I had a long walk after his horses. It took quite a search to 
               <br />
               find them but I brought them in for him at the Hunter teepee. 
               <br />
               Mrs. Hunter waved to me to come to my own tent.

               Charlotte gave me a weary smile and said, “Peter, I am glad 
               <br />
               for you. It is another boy and I want him named David.”

               I was so relieved and glad that she was all right that I would

               Hunter I noticed just tied his horses up till noon, then 
               <br />
               turned them out again. He had merely sent me after the horses 
               <br />
               to keep me occupied. I was grateful for his clever management 
               <br />
               that had kept me busy and free from needless worry.

               Two days later a couple of strangers arrived and made 
               <br />
               inquiries as to my whereabouts. They were guided to Hunter’s 
               <br />
               teepee by one of the camp guards. Hunter immediately offered 
               <br />
               them the hospitality of his teepee, placing robes for them to rest 
               <br />
               in a reclining position. A good meal was prepared at once as 
               <br />
               was the custom when strangers were guests. The guard had 
               <br />
               shown them to Hunter’s tepee knowing how matters were in 
               <br />
               my tent, this with far more consideration and tact than I 
               <br />
               experienced among white settlers in later years.
