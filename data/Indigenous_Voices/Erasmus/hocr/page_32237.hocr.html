               care lavished on us for our stay. Certainly it was the best 
               <br />
               hospitality that could be provided. The camp crier rode among 
               <br />
               the teepees and announced our arrival. He was riding on a gaily 
               <br />
               decorated pinto pony. He was telling the people that their 
               <br />
               interpreter had arrived and that the chiefs and councillors 
               <br />

               I decided to take a walk around camp and saw Governor 
               <br />
               Morris walking in front of the Hudson’s Bay post. There were 
               <br />
               over 250 teepees on the Indian section of the grounds. It was an 
               <br />
               impressive sight. I had never seen so many teepees in one 
               <br />
               locality before. There were hundreds of horses feeding on the 
               <br />
               flats, some picketed close by their owner’s teepee with the usual 
               <br />
               assortment of dogs which appeared to have barked themselves 
               <br />
               to exhaustion as they lay before each teepee.

               Peter Ballenden and his brother Sam came to the chiefs and 
               <br />
               informed them that the Governor desired them to meet him at 
               <br />
               the fort that evening. I had just returned from my walk when 
               <br />
               Mista-wa-sis came to my tent and asked me to accompany them. 
               <br />

               “I have been told,” said the chief, “that the Governor has 
               <br />
               hired two other interpreters. However, we have decided to pay 
               <br />
               you ourselves, even if the Governor does not.”

               The chiefs were dressed in all their finery, feathers, plumes, 
               <br />
               and ermine-decorated coats. I felt a little out of place among the 
               <br />
               tribal costumes; and when we came before the assembled 
               <br />
               officials, they also had quite as great an array of finery as our 
               <br />
               Indian chiefs. My work clothes, though neat and clean, when 
               <br />
               compared against all the other finery were indeed inadequate. I 
               <br />
               wished that I had come better prepared for this situation.

               <br />
               interpreters the chief had mentioned. I was not too greatly 
               <br />
               concerned, as I knew both men; their ability as interpreters to a

               large gathering such as we would be faced with on the morrow 
               <br />
