               It was pretty much of an after-dinner speech. Some of the 
               <br />
               Governor’s guests applauded but I noticed that Clarke and 
               <br />
               Ballenden were not among them. Mr. Morris advised me that,

               The next day the Police band preceded the Governor as 
               <br />
               before, but there was not so much pomp and display from the 
               <br />
               Government party. Even the Governor walked unescorted from 
               <br />
               his carriage the short distance to the stand. The Indians were 
               <br />
               already in place in their usual postures of comfortable listening 
               <br />

               that today he wanted to hear what they had to say, adding, “I

               Poundmaker, who was not a chief at that time but just a 
               <br />
               brave, spoke up and said, “The governor mentions how much 
               <br />
               land is to be given to us. He says 640 acres, one mile square for 
               <br />
               each family, he will give us.” And in a loud voice he shouted, 
               <br />
               “This is our land! It isn’t a piece of pemmican to be cut off and 
               <br />
               given in little pieces back to us. It is ours and we will take what

               A strong wave of approval came back from the seated

               Indians at his statement. Some braves in the last row rose to 
               <br />

               The Commissioner was visibly shaken by this demonstra-
