               Big Child answered, “We have our own interpreter, Peter 
               <br />
               Erasmus, and there he is. Mr. Clarke (he pointed directly at 
               <br />
               Clarke) advised me that Peter Erasmus was a good man to 
               <br />
               interpret the Cree language. Further than that, he recommend- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               advice, though I have no acquaintance with the man, I went to 
               <br />
               a great deal of trouble to fetch him here and though I know 
               <br />
               nothing of his efficiency, I am prepared to use his services. All 
               <br />

               “Is that correct?” asked Governor Morris of Clarke.

               did not know that the chiefs had sent for him; therefore I hired

               “It was quite unnecessary to send for the man,” said the 
               <br />
               Governor. “We have two interpreters hired by the government 
               <br />
               and it is up to the government to provide the means of 
               <br />

               I had quietly interpreted these side conversations to the 
               <br />
               chief and he was prepared for an answer.

               “Very good,” said Mista-wa-sis, ”you keep your interpreters 
               <br />
               and we will keep ours. We will pay our own man and I already 
               <br />
               see that it will be well for us to do so.”

               This latter statement by the chief, I interpreted to Morris 
               <br />
               directly, not waiting for Ballenden to misinterpret the chief’s 
               <br />
               meaning. 
               <br />

               “There is no need for you to assume this extra expense for 
               <br />
               an interpreter when the government is willing to pay for the 
               <br />
               interpretations,” reiterated the Commissioner. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The chief replied rather heatedly, “Our man will interpret 
               <br />
               as well as yours. I can speak Blackfoot and I know what it takes 
               <br />
               to interpret. If you do not want the arrangement, there will be 
               <br />
               no talks. We did not send for you, you sent for us.”

               I was quick to translate the conversations before waiting for 
               <br />
               Ballenden’s hesitant and slow interpretations. The Governor’s 
               <br />
               party were huddled at the table in low conversation, none of 
               <br />
               which I could hear. In the meantime the chiefs gathered 
               <br />
               together and were about to leave the room when the Governor 
               <br />
               looked up and saw they were going to leave. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “All right,” he said. “You can have your interpreter. My 
               <br />
               tent will be pitched on the prairie where we will meet. There 
               <br />
               will be a band playing to notify you of our presence.”
