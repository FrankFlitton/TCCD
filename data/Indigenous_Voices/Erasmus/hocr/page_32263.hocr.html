               from his way, once he makes up his mind. I am afraid he will

               <br />
               about it. All the Governor promised, as I said before, was that 
               <br />
               he would bring his request to his superiors, and he also said 
               <br />

               We were heavily loaded but by travelling early and late, we 
               <br />
               made good time. The weather remained clear and our stock 
               <br />
               stood up to the work. Our equipment did not give us any 
               <br />
               trouble or cause of delay. My iron bound cart proved an

               Whitefish, so we unloaded our carts and arranged to have my 
               <br />
               new horses taken care of. I caught up a fresh saddle horse and 
               <br />
               started out to meet the buffalo hunters.

               I shot a black bear near where the village of Spedden is now 
               <br />
               situated. He was standing on his hind legs eating saskatoons on 
               <br />
               a side hill. He was bending the branches with his paws much as 
               <br />
               man would do. I shot him just behind the front legs in the body. 
               <br />
               He dropped and rolled almost to my horse’s feet from about 
               <br />
               twenty-five steps away. The thick growth of grass had deadened 
               <br />
               the sound of my approach. It was a tempting shot but a foolish 
               <br />
               one. If our party were not on this side of the Saskatchewan, the 
               <br />
               meat would spoil before it could be used. I felt guilty of a crime 
               <br />
               against all the laws of prairie life — unwritten laws, but 
               <br />
