               l HE GOVERNOR’S TENT was pitched on a slight rise some 
               <br />
               distance from the fort. Most of the other officials were already 
               <br />
               waiting for him in the tent. Then the Governor’s carriage 
               <br />
               appeared, accompanied by the Mounted Police and led by the 
               <br />
               promised band. The Police, dressed in their smart scarlet 
               <br />
               uniforms and riding well trained horses, made a big impression 
               <br />
               with the Indians. In fact the great prestige of the Governor was 
               <br />
               somewhat overshadowed by the smart appearance of his escort.

               Many Indians of that camp were seeing the Mounted Police 
               <br />
               for the first time. Though small in number, the Police were to 
               <br />
               be an important factor in establishing in the minds of the tribes 
               <br />
               the fairness and justice of government for all the people 
               <br />
               regardless of colour or creed — something they had no concept 
               <br />
               of in its broader sense.

               The Indian’s own rules were handed down from the dim 
               <br />
               past, their oldest traditions accepted without question. The 
               <br />
               chiefs and councillors were chosen for outstanding qualities of 
               <br />
               character. Bravery and ability were the sole measures by which 
               <br />
               their leaders were qualified to take positions of trust. A son of a 
               <br />
               chief assumed office following the death of the chief only if he 
               <br />
               had proved himself qualified under these standards of office.
