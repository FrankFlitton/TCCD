               Eight years afterward, in June of 1884, James Seenum 
               <br />
               engaged me to accompany him and interpret in regard to his 
               <br />
               request for a large area as requested in this treaty at Fort Pitt. 
               <br />
               We went to Regina where he was successful in getting the 
               <br />
               Saddle Lake Reserve lines extended to take in a block of land to 
               <br />
               the east. He had amended his claims considerably but won his 
               <br />
               demands for better farm land, because the Whitefish and 
               <br />
               Goodfish Reserves were not large enough to accommodate the 
               <br />
               young people according to the average per-person allowance 
               <br />

               On September 9th, the treaty terms were read and explained 
               <br />
               to the people. The chiefs agreed to sign, and so the treaty was 
               <br />
               quickly completed with none of the dissension that had 
               <br />
               occurred at Carlton. The paying of treaty money and issuing of 
               <br />
               uniforms took the greater part of two more days.

               Governor Morris advised me that I would now be in the 
               <br />
               government service and that he would recommend me at a 
               <br />
               salary of fifty dollars per month. I would act for the government 
               <br />
               in the distribution of rations and goods in fulfillment of the 
               <br />
               government’s part of the treaty terms. I would also be called 
               <br />
               upon from time to time to interpret the treaties to those chiefs 
               <br />
               who had not yet signed. I was to remain at my present abode at 
               <br />
               Whitefish Lake for the purpose of handling matters concerned 
               <br />
               with Indians of that area and its precincts.

               This information was most agreeable and an entirely 
               <br />
               different prospect than that I was faced with on my first 
               <br />
               appearance at Carlton. Governor Morris further advised me 
               <br />
               that I would be on call for any assignment for which my 
               <br />
               services might be required. To all this I agreed, suitably 
               <br />
               expressing my appreciation of his confidence and assuring him 
               <br />
               of my fidelity in the accomplishment of my duties.

               The departure of Governor Morris and his entourage was 
               <br />
               attended by all the chiefs and their head men, with considerable 
               <br />
               show of appreciation and good wishes from the Indians at Fort 
               <br />
               Pitt. For myself, I felt that all the chiefs there would carry out 
               <br />
               their obligations with sincerity and would make every effort to 
               <br />
               assist their people to become established on the reserves that 
               <br />
               they would choose the following summer. This was verified in 
               <br />
               later years when I had an opportunity of visiting some of their 
               <br />
               reserves.

               The camp now broke up. William Bull came to me and said 
               <br />
               he wanted to travel home with me. I was glad and arranged 
               <br />
               with him to drive one of the carts. I bought another cart and 
               <br />
               horse from a trader at a very low price as he had sold out his
