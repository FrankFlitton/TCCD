               the Police had the same laws for white men and the Indians was

               true of our country, whereas only the previous year some 
               <br />
               Americans had committed murder on our side of the line. They 
               <br />
               had been followed to Montana and arrested but when they were 
               <br />
               brought before the Montana court, in spite of all the clear 
               <br />
               evidence of their guilt, the case was dismissed. The men had 
               <br />
               only killed Indians and that was not considered a crime on that

               On Tuesday the Indians were slow in gathering at the 
               <br />
               Governor’s tent. Poundmaker and The Badger were trying to 
               <br />
               gather support for their demands in the matter of treaty terms. 
               <br />
               Majority opinion had forced them to a grudging consent at the 
               <br />
               meeting. The Chipewyan was again active wherever he could 
               <br />
               find an audience, and backed by the other two men had 
               <br />
               regained his former boldness. But I noticed he was having 
               <br />
               difficulty in getting anyone to listen.

               The Governor did not waste any time on preliminary talk 
               <br />
               but said he was ready to listen to the people and was prepared to 
               <br />
               clear up any question about which there was any doubt. 
               <br />
               Poundmaker immediately spoke, asking help when the 
               <br />
               Indians started to settle on the reserves. The Badger took up the 
               <br />
               theme with more elaboration.

               <br />
               we want aid and when we can’t help ourselves in case of

               Sakamoos5 and others spoke, referring to portions of the 
               <br />
               treaty in regard to settlement on reserves, the need for medical 
               <br />
               help, and guidance in regard to the new project of agriculture. 
               <br />
               A summary of their remarks meant that they wanted assistance 
               <br />
               to get established in their new occupation of agriculture, not 
               <br />
               only financially but also in instruction and management.

               Then the Hon. James McKay, in a somewhat arrogant tone, 
               <br />
               admonished them in Cree for their demands. “In my experience 
               <br />
               you always want more than you were promised in the first place 
               <br />
               and you are never satisfied with what is given you.” He made 
               <br />
               other biting remarks detrimental to the character of the

               In view of my knowledge of what had transpired at their 
               <br />
               council I thought his speech most unfortunate and very 
               <br />
               harmful. His very attitude insulted the intelligence of his 
               <br />
               listeners. There was distinct murmur of disapproval all over 
               <br />
               the crowd. McKay had hardly taken his seat when The Badger
