               When the people were finally seated in their usual posture, 
               <br />
               sitting cross-legged, the Governor opened his address. There 
               <br />
               were no interruptions, but quiet attentive listening. At the 
               <br />
               conclusion of his talks, he asked the people for their opinions, 
               <br />

               <br />
               waited for their reaction to his words. Morris looked puzzled, or 
               <br />
               rather ”disappointed" might be the better description of his 
               <br />
               attitude. At other places he had received many objections and a

               Finally Chief Eagle got to his feet, faced the people, and told 
               <br />
               them not to be afraid to speak their minds. If there was 
               <br />
               anything they did not understand or wished to know, this was 
               <br />

               Sweet Grass made a speech of some length, expressing his

               willingness on behalf of his people to accept the treaty terms 
               <br />

               James Seenum spoke with some feeling, referring to the 
               <br />
               plough he had received as a gift from Mr. Christie some years 
               <br />
               previously. He stated that they had pulled the plough by 
               <br />
               manpower when their ponies had refused to work, had used the 
               <br />
               roots of trees for hoes, and had now learned the value <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»of</span> 
               <br />
               growing grain and vegetables. He was greatly pleased to know 
               <br />
               that now they would be furnished with better tools and the

               Chief Seenum asked for a large tract of land. “For my part, I 
               <br />
               wish to say that I want a large area to settle all the Cree — the 
               <br />
               Woods Crees and Plain Crees —— who may not now be taken in

               Apparently he wanted a general reserve that would 
               <br />
               accommodate all Indians who might not at this time be willing 
               <br />
               to choose land and which would be set apart for this purpose. 
               <br />
               The chief went on to say, “I want an area from the Whitemud 
               <br />
               River to Dog Rump Creek, extending back as far as the Beaver 
               <br />

               The Governor replied that he could not promise such a 
               <br />
               large tract of land without consultation with his superiors. The 
               <br />
               area selected was beyond his instructions. “It is not in my
