               hardships endured by our people. Some have bewailed the 
               <br />
               poverty and suffering that has come to Indians because of the 
               <br />
               destruction of the buffalo as the chief source of our living, the 
               <br />
               loss of the ancient glory of our forefathers; and with all that I 
               <br />
               agree, in the silence of my teepee and on the broad prairies 
               <br />
               where once our fathers could not pass for the great number of 
               <br />

               <br />
               trampled in our teepees. With all these things, I think and feel

               anything that will bring these things back for tomorrow and all

               lodges. I have seen with my eyes and listened with my ears to the 
               <br />
               sorrows of that once-proud nation; people whom we have 
               <br />
               known as our enemies, the Peigan and the Bloods who are their 
               <br />
               brothers. Pay attention, listen hard to what I am about to say. 
               <br />
               The Big Knives of the south came into Blackfoot territory as 
               <br />
               traders; though few in number they have conquered these 
               <br />
               nations, and that, all the Crees in the days of our fathers and 
               <br />
               their fathers before them failed to do. How did they do it? Listen 
               <br />
               closely, my brothers, and you will understand. What was done 
               <br />
               to them can be done to us if we throw away the hand that is 
               <br />
               extended to us by this treaty.

               <br />
               and cheap goods persuaded the southern tribes it would be a 
               <br />
               good thing to have a place to trade products of the hunt, the 
               <br />
               hides and tanned goods. The traders came and built strong 
               <br />
               forts, and with their long rifles that can kill at twice the distance 
               <br />
               of our own and the short guns that can spout death six times 
               <br />
               quicker than you can tell about it, they had the people at their 
               <br />
               mercy. The Blackfoot soon found out the traders had nothing 
               <br />
               but whisky to exchange for their skins. Oh, yes! They were 
               <br />
               generous at first with their rotten whisky, but not for long. The 
               <br />
               traders demanded pay and got Blackfoot horses, buffalo robes, 
               <br />
               and all other things they had to offer.
