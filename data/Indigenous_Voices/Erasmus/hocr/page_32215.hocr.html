               It was with horror and impotent rage that I had listened to a

               recital of the growing power that these degenerate adventurers

               I was in those days indifferent to the need of government, 
               <br />

               My old friend Spence had kept me informed of the 
               <br />
               controversy raging in the settlement of the Red River and Fort

               with any side in the disputed matters concerned with this

               living in the western Territories. It would be some time before

               The matter of annexation to the States was a different
