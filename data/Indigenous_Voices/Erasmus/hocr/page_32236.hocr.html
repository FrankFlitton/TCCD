               I went back to the men and told them that I would be ready 
               <br />
               as soon as they wanted to go. “We are ready now,” said one man 
               <br />
               as he rose to his feet from where he was resting. “My father has 
               <br />

               Packing a few things in a bag for extras, I went with the

               clothes I was dressed in, hurriedly packed food and cooking 
               <br />

               <br />
               I was ready to start. Peter had fetched the horses while I was 
               <br />
               packing my duffle for the trip. I bid the family goodbye and 
               <br />
               gave some last minute instructions to Peter in regard to the care 
               <br />
               of the family and equipment. These latter orders were hardly 
               <br />
               necessary as I had long since been dependent on the young man 
               <br />
               for the care of everything while I was away. Of course a man 
               <br />
               likes to assert his authority, especially with strangers present.

               Hunter decided to come along with us as he wanted to listen 
               <br />
               to the treaty negotiations. I was just a bit worried that the fast 
               <br />
               trip would be too much for him but he was well mounted as we 
               <br />
               all were and if he grew too tired I could leave the pack outfit and 
               <br />
               he could follow up at an easier gait. I need not have given the 
               <br />
               matter any thought for he stood up to the trip as well as any of us

               <br />
               condition to start with and stood up well to the trip. A large

               encampment appeared, and separated by a lane were the 
               <br />
               various tents and canvas shelters that housed the traders. 
               <br />
               Apparently they had anticipated an agreement on treaty terms 
               <br />
               and had come prepared to do business with the Indians.3 Later I 
               <br />
               learned that my youngest sister was there also. She had married 
               <br />
               a trader, a big strapping Swede by the name of Pederson. 
               <br />
               Though I was kept pretty busy, we managed to get together for
