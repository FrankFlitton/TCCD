               Big Child and Star Blanket on each side of me nodded their 
               <br />
               agreement. The former rose to his feet. There was considerable 
               <br />
               stir among the Indians at the delay. Voices were noticeable 
               <br />
               from those seated furthest away from the stand. As soon as Big 
               <br />
               Child stood up there was immediate silence. He was a 
               <br />
               commanding figure of a man, not tall, but he stood straight and 
               <br />
               his wide shoulders spoke of strength. He didn‘t say a word until 
               <br />
               there was complete silence. Showing his closed fist with index 
               <br />
               finger protruding, he spoke, “This is number one,” indicating 
               <br />
               “one” with the raising of his hand for all to see. “Already you 
               <br />
               have broken your word on what you have agreed.”

               I stood beside him and interpreted word for word as he

               All the Indians rose to their feet and crowded forward 
               <br />
               behind their chiefs. The Police were kept busy keeping them 
               <br />
               away from the table. They were like a forest as a gathering 
               <br />
               storm of words rolled forward. I was thoroughly angered at the 
               <br />
               manner in which the Governor had been inveigled into this 
               <br />
               situation.

               I had expected neither the strong reaction from the Indians 
               <br />
               nor McKay's determination to have his own way. I knew that 
               <br />
               Peter Ballenden had not the education or practice to interpret, 
               <br />
               and his voice had no carrying quality to make himself heard 
               <br />
               before all this large assembly. The Rev. McKay had learned his 
               <br />
               Cree among the Swampy and Saulteaux. While there was a 
               <br />
               similarity in some words, and I had learned both languages, the 
               <br />
               Prairie Crees would not understand his Cree. Further, the 
               <br />
               Prairie Crees looked down on the Swampy and Saulteaux as an 
               <br />
               inferior race. They would be intolerant at being addressed in 
               <br />
               Swampy or Saulteaux words. I knew that McKay was not 
               <br />
               sufficiently versed in the Prairie Cree to confine his interpreta- 
               <br />
               tions to their own language.

               The Rev. Mr. McDougall was busy trying to calm Bear

               leading chiefs stood without saying a word while all the fuss
