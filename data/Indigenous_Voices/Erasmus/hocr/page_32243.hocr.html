               moment was sweet but I could read consternation on the faces 
               <br />
               of my impolite friends at the table. 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               The Governor, who I could see was growing exasperated at 
               <br />
               these frequent interruptions to his talk, said, “All right, 
               <br />
               Erasmus. Let this be your chance to justify your chiefs’ 
               <br />
               confidence in your work.” 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I immediately rose to my feet, stepped beside the Governor’s 
               <br />
               table, faced the Crees, and spoke in Cree, reviewing the text of 
               <br />
               the Governor’s speech to them. Then I motioned to the 
               <br />
               Commissioner to continue his address. I knew my voice had 
               <br />
               suffered nothing from my heated veins or the exultation that I 
               <br />
               felt at the complete disposal of the slight so desperately 
               <br />
               manoeuvered by these men sitting around the table. The 
               <br />
               Governor spoke for an hour or so explaining the purpose of the 
               <br />
               treaty and its objectives, and describing in some detail the 
               <br />
               terms. He especially emphasized the money each person would 
               <br />
               get. There were no further interruptions. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Once during a pause in the Governor’s speech, the 
               <br />
               Honourable James differed with me over an interpretation of 
               <br />
               one word. However, his brother supported my interpretation in 
               <br />
               the matter and no further objections were expressed during the 
               <br />
               whole of the remaining treaty negotiations. Though that first 
               <br />
               day I felt high strung and angry over the treatment I had 
               <br />
               received, I was determined that nothing would prevent me from 
               <br />
               doing my work with credit to my employers and justice to the 
               <br />
               Governor’s talks. 
               <br />

               The Indians had retired to their teepees or were sitting in 
               <br />
               groups discussing the treaty terms. Hunter was around 
               <br />
               somewhere with the other Indians. I was reclining in our tent 
               <br />
               trying to calm my ruffled feelings and assess the value of my 
               <br />
               contribution to the talks when the Governor’s cook stuck his 
               <br />
               head in the tent flaps and said that the Governor wanted to see 
               <br />
               me. I was about to give the men a curt refusal, thinking that 
               <br />
               sending the lowest man on their staff to summon me to the 
               <br />
               great man’s presence was another effort to emphasize my status. 
               <br />
               Then I heard the Hon. James McKay, Christie, and Dr. Jackes 
               <br />
               questioning the cook, asking if he had found my tent. He 
               <br />
               answered in the affirmative; then they all came to the tent and 
               <br />
               said they were there to escort me back to the Governor’s 
               <br />
               quarters. Entering, I stood without making any comment, 
               <br />
               awaiting the gentleman’s pleasure. “Well, Mr. Erasmus. I 
               <br />
               suppose you are slightly exhausted over your labours this 
               <br />
               forenoon?” I thought I detected a slight hint of sarcasm in his 
               <br />
               tone and immediately answered, “No, Mr. Morris. Not by the 
               <br />
               work but by the preliminaries that led up to the work.” 
               <br />

               He smiled and I heard laughs in the background. Then he
