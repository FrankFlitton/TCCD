               impartial justice without regard to colour or creed, and the

               tenacity of its members in carrying out their duties, soon 
               <br />
               became a topic of Indian campfire conversation. The small 
               <br />
               number of this Police Force would have been utterly incapable 
               <br />
               of handling the thousands of Indians if they had attempted to 
               <br />

               Our approach to the Governor’s tent was delayed by certain 
               <br />
               ceremonial proceedings that have been far better described than 
               <br />
               I feel capable of doing. However, let me say that these 
               <br />
               ceremonial practices had a deep significance to the tribes and 
               <br />
               can only be explained as a solemn approach to a vital and 
               <br />
               serious issue for discussion.

               Few people realize that those so—called savages were far 
               <br />
               more deeply affected and influenced by their religious beliefs 
               <br />
               and convictions than any comparable group of white people, 
               <br />
               whose lip service to their religion goes no deeper than that. The 
               <br />
               forms of ceremonial behaviour with which the Indians 
               <br />
               approached the Governor‘s tent were based on practices whose 
               <br />
               actual meaning has long since been lost. The ceremony in the 
               <br />
               crowning of the kings and queens of England would have little 
               <br />
               meaning were it not for the benefit of a written language.

               We were finally seated on the grass in a large semicircle in 
               <br />
               front of the Governor’s tent crossed-legged, a position that 
               <br />
               seems to be the most restful and relaxed manner of listening to a 
               <br />
               speech. I have seen quite old men rise to their feet to speak from 
               <br />
               this position without the use of their hands or arms to assist 
               <br />
               them, all with apparently effortless ease. My own attempts in 
               <br />
               this regard were never graceful or even easy. I always had to use 
               <br />
               my hands and arms to assist me. It was a physical feat that I 
               <br />
               never successfully conquered.

               Peter Erasmus to come forward to interpret the Governor’s

               speech. I rose to my feet and said, “I object, Sir. It is my

               impression that I am not employed by the government but am

               acting only on behalf of the chiefs assembled here. Therefore, I
