               We arrived at Fort Pitt ahead of the government party. A 
               <br />
               detachment of Police was already camped on the north side of 
               <br />
               the river and I counted a hundred Indian teepees camped on the

               We crossed the river with a boat that some traders were 
               <br />
               using to carry their goods across. Although the river was 
               <br />
               unusually low that fall, crossing goods over safely always gave 
               <br />
               some concern. By assisting the traders, we got the use of their 
               <br />
               boat that made the crossing a simple matter.

               On the morning of September the fifth, the Governor and 
               <br />
               his party arrived with a Police escort that had gone out to meet 
               <br />
               him. All the tribes that were to meet there had not yet arrived 
               <br />
               but they had sent riders ahead to tell the others of their coming. 
               <br />
               Finally on the sixth, the last of the tribes pitched their teepees 
               <br />
               with the others.

               Seenum band came to where I was resting. “The chiefs have

               <br />
               cunning beasts and I always said that I thought they would

               “Go ahead,” said Hunter. “I can keep your shady couch

               I was questioned at some length about the attitude of the 
               <br />
               tribes who signed the treaty at Carlton, about details in 
               <br />
               reference to treaty concessions, and the terms agreed upon, 
               <br />
               which by that time I had memorized by heart. I gave them a 
               <br />
               review of the discussions of the council meeting of the chiefs at 
               <br />
               Carlton, reporting the objections raised by those who opposed 
               <br />
               the signing, and spoke of the petition that had been drawn up 
               <br />
               for the Commissioner, with the points agreed to and those 
               <br />
               refused. I mentioned Poundmaker’s and The Badger’s efforts at 
               <br />
               trying to block or misinterpret the terms of the treaty, at which 
               <br />
               there were some expressions of disgust about their attitude.”

               Then I wound up my talk by a report of the two speeches made 
               <br />
