               Chief Seenum then took his place and spoke. “You have all 
               <br />
               questioned Peter Erasmus on the things that have taken place 
               <br />
               at Carlton. He is a stranger to many of you but I am well 
               <br />
               acquainted with him. I have respect for his words and have 
               <br />
               confidence in his truthfulness. Mista-wa-sis and Ah-tuk-a-kup 
               <br />
               both sent their sons all the way from Carlton to where he lives, 
               <br />
               and he is married to one of our favourite daughters. He was not 
               <br />
               at home but they followed him to the prairie where he was 
               <br />
               hunting buffalo with our people. Little Hunter is a chief and 
               <br />
               brings back a good report of his work during treaty talks. He 
               <br />
               would not tell us something that was not for our good. 
               <br />
               Therefore, as those other chiefs who are in greater number than 
               <br />
               we are have found this treaty good, I and my head man will sign 
               <br />
               for our people. I have spoken.”

               Each of the other chiefs with their councillors expressed 
               <br />
               agreement, each man expressing in his own words ideas that 
               <br />
               conformed to the general acceptance of treaty terms. They were

               There was some delay on the morning of the seventh, which 
               <br />
               was the day set for the meeting with the Governor, as it was

               manoeuvres that always preceded a gathering of this kind as at 
               <br />
               the meeting at Carlton. Finally two young men volunteered 
               <br />
               their help. They were in training but as yet were not considered 
               <br />
               fully qualified.

               The riders were performing in front of the people who were 
               <br />
               advancing to the Commissioner’s tent when suddenly the two 
               <br />
               young men got confused in their movements and crashed their 
               <br />
               horses into each other. Both men were thrown to the ground, 
               <br />
               receiving injuries, and the horses were hurt. Fortunately there 
               <br />
               was a Police doctor on hand who took charge of the injured 
               <br />
               men. One had a dislocated hip while the other had only minor

               <br />
