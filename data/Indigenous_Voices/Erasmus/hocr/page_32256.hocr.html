               afternoon, and with the sixtyI had received from the paymaster

               Mr. Christie, I felt well paid for my trip. I thanked them for the

               money and told them I was well satisfied with the amount they

               traders’ stores and offered to buy Whitey, my buffalo runner

               <br />
               as he had been instructed in the use of money. The animal was

               good value for the price but I mention this incident to show 
               <br />
               how easily at that time the Indians could have been cheated out

               I bought a good stout cart horse harnessed to a cart for fifty 
               <br />
               dollars to carry our duffle and the goods we bought. The traders 
               <br />
               were getting ready to move to the next trading spot at Fort Pitt 
               <br />
               and were offering some good deals to lighten their loads. I 
               <br />
               bought a shotgun practically new for about half the asking 
               <br />

               <br />
               staple articles of food and a stove. This would be the first

               At our evening stop I took the gun and presented it to John 
               <br />
               Hunter; his pleasure was something to see, as he alternately 
               <br />
               polished the blued steel of the barrel and took aim as if to get 
               <br />
               used to the feel of the gun. Then I showed him a handsome 
               <br />
               piece of good print for dresses for his wife and some household 
               <br />
               utensils as well, but when I showed him all those things his 
               <br />
               former pleasure evaporated and he looked very grim.

               things that you have bought for us. I never could match such a 
               <br />
               gift with a return. It is too much. My wife shall have all the
