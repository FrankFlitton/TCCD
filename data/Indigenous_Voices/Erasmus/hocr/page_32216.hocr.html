               government would be established. I found myself adopting a 
               <br />
               completely different attitude. It had now become a personal 
               <br />
               matter by the loss of two winters’ labour in trapping and 
               <br />
               trading.

               The continued decrease of buffalo on the prairies was 
               <br />
               creating considerable resentment among the Indians whose 
               <br />
               livelihood depended completely on the buffalo. Though 
               <br />
               poison bait was unheard of among the northern tribes, a supply 
               <br />
               was being used and made available by these southern traders. 
               <br />
               Indian dogs had been killed by the baits set out for wolves and 
               <br />
               coyotes, and it was a common belief that horses had been 
               <br />
               poisoned by eating grass where an unrecovered carcass had 
               <br />
               decomposed. If horses could die, they argued, then buffalo 
               <br />
               would also be killed.

               Isolated among the northern tribes, I had not given these 
               <br />
               matters much thought. My personal loss by one of these rogues 
               <br />
               filled me with a resentment almost beyond my control. At the 
               <br />
               moment I did not credit my brother’s weakness for drink a 
               <br />
               factor of any importance. 1 had fervently expressed my hearty 
               <br />
               approval at Carlton and Fort Pitt and definitely stated that it 
               <br />
               would be easy to recruit help to route those whisky traders and 
               <br />

               When we got back home, Charlotte received my bad news 
               <br />
               with her usual fortitude. ”Well, Peter! Using your own words, 
               <br />
               it is tough luck. We are both healthy and we can still hunt and 
               <br />
               fish. We will leave our two boys with my mother and make that 
               <br />

               The weather was very mild for that time of year in the latter 
               <br />
               part of October 1870, after a sharp period that froze the small 
               <br />
               lakes. I made a last effort to change my wife’s idea of braving the 
               <br />
               trip but it was useless. “We can be at that creek in four days. We 
               <br />
               have a good tent and the weather is mild. Look at this fur-lined

               bag that I have made for our girl. Hundreds of Indian children 
               <br />
               have been carried for centuries in this kind of thing. My mother 
               <br />
               helped me make it. Besides, she is only too eager to have our 
               <br />
               boys in her care while we are away.”
