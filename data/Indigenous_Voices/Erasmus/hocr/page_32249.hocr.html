               There was a deep silence after Mista-wa-sis had taken his 
               <br />
               seat. No one appeared to have anything to say. Then, finally, 
               <br />
               Star Blanket rose to his feet and for along minute stood with his 
               <br />
               head bowed as if in deep thought or as if he had been 
               <br />
               profoundly impressed with the former speaker’s words.

               “Yes,” he said finally, ”I have carried the dripping scalps of 
               <br />
               the Blackfoot on my belt and thought it was a great deed of 
               <br />
               bravery. I thought it was part of the glory of war but I now agree 
               <br />
               with Mista-wa-sis.” Then he raised his voice so that it rang 
               <br />
               with the power of great conviction, “It is no longer a good 
               <br />
               thing. If we had been friends we might now be a host of people 
               <br />
               of all nations and together have power to demand the things 
               <br />

               “No, that is not the road we took, but killed each other in

               continuous wars and in horse stealing, all for the glory we all 
               <br />
               speak of so freely. The great sickness took half our lodges and 
               <br />
               the dreaded disease fell as heavily on our enemies. We are weak 
               <br />
               and my brother Mista-wa—sis I think is right that the buffalo 
               <br />
               will be gone forever before many snows. What then will be left 
               <br />
               us with which to bargain? With the buffalo gone we will have
