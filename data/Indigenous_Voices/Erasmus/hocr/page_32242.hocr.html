               The Governor was quick to take advantage of the lull after 
               <br />
               Mista-wa-sis had waved his people to silence. You could almost 
               <br />
               feel the strong tension that still remained. Governor Morris 
               <br />
               started his address with the Rev. McKay interpreting.

               “You nations of the Crees,” he began, “I am here on a most 
               <br />
               important mission as representing Her Majesty the Queen 
               <br />
               Mother to form a treaty with you in her name, that you

               surrender your rights in these northern territories to the

               He went on to explain that treaties already had been signed 
               <br />
               by other tribes, naming those that had been treated with. He 
               <br />
               mentioned the Touchwood Hills Crees and some of the others, 
               <br />

               McKay’s interpretations were mixed with Swampy and 
               <br />
               Saulteaux words. I mentioned this in English to the table, and 
               <br />
               the Honourable James angrily shouted, “Stop that, or you will 
               <br />

               Mista-wa-sis, after listening for a time, jumped to his feet 
               <br />
               and said, “We are not Swampy Crees or Saulteaux Indians. We 
               <br />
               are Plains Crees and demand to be spoken to in our own

               McKay understood, was confused, and sat down. The 
               <br />
               Governor turned to me and asked what the chief had said. I 
               <br />
               explained the chief’s words. The Rev. McKay again tried to 
               <br />
               continue, got mixed up with Saulteaux words and took his seat.

               Ballenden was now called up. I was delighted, for I knew 
               <br />
               the man quite well. He was a good man to interpret personal 
               <br />
               talks but I knew he would be completely out of his element as 
               <br />
               an interpreter for such a large meeting, where a man’s voice had 
               <br />
               to carry to reach the men furthest from the stand.

               His attitude of the previous evening in not showing me any 
               <br />
               recognition; and Clarke’s conspicuous neglect of a formal 
               <br />
               introduction, even though he was personally acquainted with 
               <br />
               me, had fairly made my blood boil. I had no pity for the men 
               <br />
               who had contributed their share to having me discredited with 
               <br />
               the Commissioner. Ballenden did exactly as I thought. He 
               <br />
               made an excellent interpretation of the Governor’s words but 
               <br />
               in a voice so low that it could not be heard beyond the first ten 
               <br />
               rows of men seated on the ground. The men in the back rows 
               <br />
               got to their feet and demanded that he speak in a louder voice; 
               <br />
               again there was some confusion and the two chiefs beside me 
               <br />
               got to their feet and ordered the men to be quiet. Ballenden tried 
               <br />
               to raise his voice, choked, and then sat down. My revenge at that
