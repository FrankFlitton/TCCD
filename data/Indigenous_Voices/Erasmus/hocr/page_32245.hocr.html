               The Governor went on to explain that unless certain lands 
               <br />
               were set aside for the sole use of the Indians, the country would 
               <br />
               be flooded with white settlers who would not give the Indians 
               <br />
               any consideration whatever. He made references to other areas 
               <br />
               where settlement was growing very fast. Morris’s speech and 
               <br />
               explanation were couched in simple terms for the understand- 
               <br />
               ing of the Indian people. His manner held a sincerity that was 
               <br />
               most effective in impressing his audience. Knowing the 
               <br />
               Indians as I did, I could see that they were receiving the message 
               <br />
               with a growing understanding of its purpose.

               Standing at the Governor’s table I was able to observe the 
               <br />
               reactions of some of the listeners. I felt that Big Child and Star 
               <br />
               Blanket were both convinced of the fairness and justice of the 
               <br />
               terms explained to them by the speaker. I had an increased 
               <br />
               confidence in my interpretations, my sympathies transferred to 
               <br />
               the Governor’s side, and my early animosity to the party was 
               <br />
               completely gone. The translations came to my tongue without 
               <br />
               effort and I seemed inspired to a tension that made my voice 
               <br />
               heard in the back rows where I had placed Hunter to give me a 
               <br />
               sign if my voice was not being heard distinctly.

               Mista-wa-sis rose to his feet at the conclusion of Morris’s

               detailed explanations of the treaty terms and answers to 
               <br />
               questions that arose during the proceedings, saying, “We heard 
               <br />
               all you have told us and I want to tell the Governor how it is 
               <br />
               with us as well. When a thing is thoughtoutquietly, that is the 
               <br />
               best way. I ask this of him today, that we go and think over his 
               <br />
               words.”

               Governor Morris agreed with the chief and the meeting was 
               <br />

               The Indians did not hold a council on Sunday. The main 
               <br />
               chiefs said it was better to let the people have time to talk things 
               <br />
               over among themselves before calling a meeting. So word was 
               <br />
               sent to the Governor that they wanted to postpone the meeting 
               <br />
               till Tuesday. Permission was granted and a council called for 
               <br />
               Monday.

               I was asked to attend the council with them and was 
               <br />
               personally escorted to the meeting by Mista-wa-sis and his ally 
               <br />
               Star Blanket. They said that I might be called upon to explain 
               <br />
               the talks, in case of any misunderstanding of my interpreta- 
               <br />
               tions of the treaty terms. “There are many among us who are 
               <br />
               trying to confuse and mislead the people; that is why I thought 
               <br />
               it best to give them lots of time for their bad work. Today they 
               <br />
               will have to come out in the open and will be forced to show 
               <br />
               their intentions,” said Big Child.
