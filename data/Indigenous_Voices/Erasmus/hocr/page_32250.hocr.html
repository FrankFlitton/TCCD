               <br />
               has told you. The mother earth has always given us plenty with 
               <br />
               the grass that fed the buffalo. Surely we Indians can learn the 
               <br />
               ways of living that made the white man strong and able to 
               <br />

               men never had the buffalo but I am told they have cattle in the

               thousands that are covering the prairie for miles and will 
               <br />

               <br />
               spread over our lands. The white men number their lodges by 
               <br />
               the thousands, not like us who can only count our teepees by 
               <br />
               tens. I will accept the Queen’s hand for my people. I have

               With the last of his words, the councillors of both main 
               <br />
               speakers rose to their feet, together held up their hands as a 
               <br />
               gesture of acceptance, and again took their places. Other chiefs 
               <br />
               among the assembly spoke a few words in agreement. The

               Mista—wa-sis adjourned the meeting by saying, “It is good

               <br />

               <br />
               to ask questions on things you want cleared up. We will have

               To this the Indians agreed. Dismissed, many of the chiefs
