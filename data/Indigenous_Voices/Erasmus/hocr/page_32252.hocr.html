               your own meaning. What I did say was that when we settle on 
               <br />
               the ground to work the land, that is when we will need help and 
               <br />

               The speech that McKay had made was not interpreted into 
               <br />
               English but Morris could see that it had made a bad impression 
               <br />
               on the people by the angry stir that prevailed. I interpreted all 
               <br />
               Indian replies and said, ”Let McKay, the Honourable James, 
               <br />
               explain his own speech.” However, I noticed the Governor did 
               <br />
               not take the trouble to inquire into the contents of McKay’s 
               <br />
               speech that had so roused the Indians.8

               <br />
               he said instead. “You will get the seed and you need not concern 
               <br />
               yourselves about what your children will eat. They will be 
               <br />

               Big Child spoke, “It is well known that if we have plenty in 
               <br />
               our gardens and crops we would not insist on getting more 
               <br />
               provisions, but it is only in the case of extremity and from the 
               <br />
               ignorance of Indians in commencing to work the land that we 
               <br />
               speak. We are in the dark. This is no trivial matter with us.”9

               “The things we have talked over in our Council, we think 
               <br />
               are for our good,” said Star Blanket. “I believe that the good 
               <br />
               councillors of the Queen Mother and her commissioners know 
               <br />
               what is best for them. I was told that the Governor was a good 
               <br />
               man and now that I have seen him and listened to him talk, I 
               <br />
               know I heard right. He has removed some of the obstacles to our 
               <br />
               understanding and I hope he will remove them all.”10

               Star Blanket paused in his discourse as Big Child rose to his 
               <br />
               feet and demanded silence from the back where the Chipewyan 
               <br />
               was again causing a disturbance. 
               <br />

               Star Blanket continued, “We want food in the spring, when 
               <br />
               we begin to farm; according as the Indian settles on the land 
               <br />
               and as he advances, his needs will increase. I would now ask the 
               <br />
               Governor to give us time to consider all the things that he has 
               <br />
               told us today.”

               This was granted, with a warning from the Commissioner 
               <br />
               that he could not spend too much time with them as he had 
               <br />
               other tribes to treat with that would be waiting for him. He 
               <br />
               further stated that he had heard that the buffalo were near and 
               <br />
               they would want to be on their way to get their winter 
               <br />
               provisions. ”Food, my friends, is getting scarce in camp.” 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The Governor now turned to the Chipewyan who had been 
               <br />
               making a disturbance in the crowd. “You are only one of those 
               <br />
               people you claim to represent. You are no wiser than your tribe 
               <br />
               who have already accepted treaty terms with the Government. 
               <br />
               If you have anything to say, I will speak to your people after I 
               <br />
               have finished with the Crees.”
