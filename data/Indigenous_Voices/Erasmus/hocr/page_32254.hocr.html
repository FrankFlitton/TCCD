               followed the same wording as that signed at Carlton. The

               reading of the treaty took a great deal of time and required the

               watch on the wording to see that it included everything that 
               <br />
               had been promised. However, the other chiefs appeared 
               <br />
               satisfied that the Governor would carry out his promises to the 
               <br />
               letter. I was able to assure Mista-wa-sis that everything 
               <br />
               promised had been included in the writing. He was satisfied 
               <br />

               o’clock while the chiefs’ uniforms were issued, complete with 
               <br />
               medals and a flag. The councilmen were to receive theirs at the 
               <br />
               Hudson’s Bay store. The Governor gave them a short discourse 
               <br />
               on the meaning of the uniforms, which in substance meant that 
               <br />
               they were now representatives of the Queen Mother and to see 
               <br />

               <br />
               fulfill the obligations contained in their positions. There 
               <br />
               would be an issue of uniforms to the men that they chose from 
               <br />

               There was a great deal of hand-shaking and some fine

               compliments exchanged on both sides before the Governor 
               <br />
               took his departure. Mista-wa-sis and Star Blanket, I knew, 
               <br />
               meant every word they said, as did the Governor. Poundmaker 
               <br />
               was equally well versed in complimentary words but I felt 
               <br />
               certain that he didn’t mean a word he said; in this I was right,

               Treaty payments were started immediately after the 
               <br />
               signing. Christie was in charge and retained me for the balance 
               <br />
               of that day to assist in the interpretations. “Peter, the Governor 
               <br />
               wishes to see you at the fort this evening for a private talk and I 
               <br />

               <br />
