               number you could count on your fingers and toes, yet the 
               <br />
               cutthroats and criminals who recognized no authority but their

               <br />
               murdered Indians without fear of reprisal, immediately 
               <br />

               own side of the line. I ask you why those few men could put to

               flight those bad men who for years have defied the whole of the

               <br />
               Blackfoot. Why of course, they are of flesh and blood. They 
               <br />
               could be killed as easily as any Blackfoot, but ask yourselves 
               <br />
               why the traders fled in fear from so few men. The southern 
               <br />
               tribes outnumbered this small Police Force one hundred to one, 
               <br />
