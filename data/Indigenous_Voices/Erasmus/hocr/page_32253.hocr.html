               <br />
               meeting to say, “Listen, my friends, all of you sitting around 
               <br />
               here, be patient and listen to what our interpreter has been 
               <br />
               instructed to tell you. What he will tell you are the things our 
               <br />
               main chiefs and councillors have decided to ask for and have 
               <br />
               agreed are for our best interests. There will be no more talk or 
               <br />
               questions asked of the Governor.”11

               I first explained to the Commissioner that the document I 
               <br />
               was about to read had been prepared by the main chiefs and 
               <br />
               their councillors and actually contained little more than what 
               <br />
               already had been promised, but I had been asked to read the 
               <br />
               petition to all the people for their agreement. Thus I 
               <br />
               interpreted the contents to the Indians before handing it to the 
               <br />
               Governor.

               The Governor then spoke at some length as he dealt with 
               <br />
               each section of the petition and gave reasons for the few of the 
               <br />
               things that could not be granted. However, he consented to a 
               <br />
               grant of one thousand dollars to assist those actually engaged 
               <br />
               in farming land on the reserves, but this would operate for three 
               <br />
               years only. This would apply to each band. They would receive 
               <br />
               a plough and harrow for three families under the same 
               <br />
               conditions. They would be at liberty to hunt and trap on 
               <br />
               government lands the same as before. The things they would be 
               <br />
               getting would be a present on top of what they had before nor 
               <br />
               would they be compelled to go to war except on their own free 
               <br />
               will. A medicine chest would be placed in the house of every 
               <br />
               agent for the free use of the band.12 Each band would get four 
               <br />
               oxen, one bull and six cows, one boar and two pigs. After a 
               <br />
               band had settled on its reserve and started to raise grain, they 
               <br />
               would get one hand mill. Each chief would get one horse,

               Most of the chiefs expressed agreement, but Poundmaker 
               <br />
               was still not satisfied. Joseph Toma asked for guns and said he

               was speaking for Red Pheasant.

               Morris replied, “When the list of things the interpreter read

               <br />
               he was satisfied as the others were. Then the principal chiefs

               expressed approval. I cannot grant your request.”

               Red Pheasant got up and repudiated the statement of
