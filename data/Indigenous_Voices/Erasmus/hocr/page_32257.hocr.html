               “Yes,” said Hunter, “but I was doing those things for my 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               said, “Throw the gun away if you wish. It is yours to do what 
               <br />
               you like with it. I do not need another gun as I have one at home

               He was profuse in his apologies. Luckily I had hit on the 
               <br />
               only theme that could dissolve his ethical beliefs that a gift 
               <br />
               must always have compensation.

               <br />
               way. Such delicate management hadn’t occurred to me. To pay 
               <br />
               his wife for what they considered a friendly service would be 
               <br />
               putting a price on friendship that would take away the pleasure

               We were both happy on the first leg of our journey towards 
               <br />
               home. We were well satisfied with our trip. John Hunter was a 
               <br />
               chief in his own tribe. His name interpreted in English was 
               <br />
               Little Hunter. He was not a small man as his name would 
               <br />
               indicate but I found that the name may have been received as a 
               <br />
               child. He was not a big man but he certainly wasn’t little either 
               <br />
               in physical stature or in character.

               “Poundrnaker,” he said while discussing the meeting, “is 
               <br />
               not satisfied, nor will he ever be satisfied. He does not think but 
               <br />
               just talks and keeps on talking. He and some of the others will 
               <br />
               make trouble. Times will be hard for the prairie Indians once 
               <br />
               the buffalo are gone. They will have nothing and will not settle 
               <br />
               on the land until they are nearing starvation. Steinhauer has 
               <br />
               often told us that we must learn to farm and raise animals to 
               <br />
               support ourselves for the day when the buffalo will be no more. 
               <br />
               Now I have to believe him. We are lucky that we already know 
               <br />
               something about raising grain and vegetables, and besides we 
               <br />
               still have bush game and fish.
