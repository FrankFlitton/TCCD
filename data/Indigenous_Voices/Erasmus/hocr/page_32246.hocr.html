               <br />
               was learned in the language the Governor speaks. You all heard 
               <br />
               and saw the other men fail to interpret what he tried to say. He, 
               <br />
               Peter Erasmus, is the people’s hired man. He is here to open our

               was offered in the treaty terms.”

               Ah-tuk-a-kup’s words had the immediate effect of silencing

               the council men spoke in addition to the chiefs. There was a
