               Mr. Speaker, I quite agree with the hon.

               gentleman, the retiring minister (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton) that this is not the time to under- 
               <br />
               take the discussion of the principles in- 
               <br />
               volved in the Bill. But, with the two state- 
               <br />
               ments which have been read and with the 
               <br />
               reading of the statements and the causes 
               <br />
               which make the reading of the statements 
               <br />
               necessary this afternoon, we alone have to 
               <br />
               deal and with these I shall deal for a mo-

               ment with your kindly permission. It did 
               <br />
               not come as a matter of surprise to this 
               <br />
               side of the House that the Minister of the

               Interior should at some early period read 
               <br />
               his letter of resignation, or give his rea-

               sons for resigning to this House, nor do I

               framed and to have been rushed before the<br />House.  It did seem an odd and almost un-<br />explainable thing that a Bill of such impor-<br />tance should be framed in the absence of<br />two of the most responsible ministers in<br />the House as regards the country and the<br />scope of territory in which that Bill was to<br />be operative, and having respect to the de-<br />claration of policy which I think a year or <br />two ago was made in this House when, <br />with some new idea of a division of<br />ministerial responsibility, it was announced<br />that certain ministers were to be held more<br />or less accountable for the particular pro-<br />vinces or sections from which they came.<br />This was exemplied in the case of the hon.<br />Minister of agriculture (Mr. Fisher) in his<br />intermeddling with the militia matters of<br />this country.  During the last few weeks<br />this important Bill has been framed and<br />has been laid before the House in the ab-<br />sence of the hon. Minister of the Interior,<br />who was especially charged with the super-<br />vision of and the responsibility for the<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Northwest Territories and the west gen-

               erally. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> We</span> were led to think that possibly 
               <br />
               the second chapter of what took place on 
               <br />
               an almost similar line a year or two ago 
               <br />
               was being prepared for the House and the 
               <br />
               country. It is well known that at that 
               <br />
               time a most important railway Bill was 
               <br />
               conceived and formed and was almost, if not<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> 
               <br />
               quite, presented to this House behind the 
               <br />
               back of the responsible Minister of Rail- 
               <br />
               ways and Canals, whose ofﬁce it should 
               <br />
               have been to have aided in the consider- 
               <br />
               ation and preparation of that Bill. We 
               <br />
               were of late led still more to suppose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> 
               <br />
               from a remark which fell casually, but 
               <br />
               rather acridly, from the lips of the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) him- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self,</span> who, when, not long ago, asked about 
               <br />
               the time when we might expect the intro- 
               <br />
               duction of the Bill, gave as his answer that 
               <br />
               it would probably be introduced at a cer- 
               <br />
               tain time, and when some inquiring mind of 
               <br />
               the many inquiring minds on this side of the 
               <br />
               House put the question to the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister as to whether the hon. the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior would be back by 
               <br />
               that time, the right hon. Prime Minister, as 
               <br />
               I say, rather sharply retorted that he did 
               <br />
               not know whether he would or not, but that 
               <br />
               he, the Prime Minister, would be here. Tak- 
               <br />
               ing all this with the history of this Bill into 
               <br />
               consideration it did not come as a surprise 
               <br />
               to this part of the House, and I doubt very 
               <br />
               much if it fell as much of a surprise upon 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen on the other side of the 
               <br />

               important member of the cabinet at any
