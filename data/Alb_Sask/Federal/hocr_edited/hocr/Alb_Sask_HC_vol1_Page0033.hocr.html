               hon. gentleman has questioned me with re- 
               <br />
               gard to a pamphlet which has been issued 
               <br />
               purporting to be certain collations from the 
               <br />
               debates of this House on a former occasion 
               <br />
               on the question of separate schools. I was 
               <br />
               not aware until this moment that this pam- 
               <br />
               phlet had been distributed, and I shall make 
               <br />
               inquiry and ascertain who is responsible 
               <br />
               for it. I do not mean any discourtesy to 
               <br />
               the House, on the contrary ; the House is 
               <br />
               entitled to the amplest information, and 
               <br />
               that it shall have at all times, and I hope 
               <br />
               before this matter is settled. But many of 
               <br />
               the matters which have been introduced to- 
               <br />
               day are absolutely foreign to the question 
               <br />
               which I was forced to bring before the 
               <br />
               House, that is to say the resignation of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Brandon. The other ques- 
               <br />
               tions will come up at a later date. Some 
               <br />
               remarks have been made, for instance, by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for South Wellington (Mr. 
               <br />
               Guthrie) when he said that this Bill had 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> before the House for two sessions. 
               <br />
               That was evidently a slip of the tongue, 
               <br />
               and was easily answered. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               meant only to say that the question of au- 
               <br />
               tonomy had been discussed for two sessions. 
               <br />
               Everybody knows, especially the members 
               <br />
               who were in the old parliament, that for 
               <br />
               the last two sessions the question of auton- 
               <br />
               omy for the Territories has been under dis- 
               <br />
               cussion ; I presume that is what my hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend</span> had in his mind when he spoke on 
               <br />
               this Bill. But the only object I had in ris- 
               <br />
               ing was to refer to a statement—not a state- 
               <br />
               ment but an insinuation, made, I think, by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for South York. The hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> insinuated that in bringing for- 
               <br />
               ward this measure there was an intention 
               <br />
               on my part in some way to get rid of the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior. I simply notice 
               <br />
               the statement to give it the most emphatic 
               <br />
               denial that I can. Whatever may be the 
               <br />
               differences of opinion between myself and 
               <br />
               my late colleague, I am sure he will acquit 
               <br />
               me of having had any idea of acting deceit- 
               <br />
               fully towards him. I am sure that no one 
               <br />
               knows better than himself that it is with 
               <br />
               extreme regret that I have to lose his valu- 
               <br />
               able services, and if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> could have retained 
               <br />
               them 1 would have done so with great 
               <br />
               pleasure. When the hon. member for South<br />York insinuates that I was conspiring<br />in some way to get rid of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Brandon he makes an insinuation 
               <br />
               which is absolutely eithout the shadow of 
               <br />
               foundation.
