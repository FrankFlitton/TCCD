               Mr. MILLER. Since the Toronto ‘ Globe’ 
               <br />
               has been quoting a good deal, I would like 
               <br />
               to ask the hon. gentlemen if he has noticed 
               <br />
               in to-day’s ‘Globe’ the statement that a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> deal of whisky and money were being

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LALOR.</span> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I have 
               <br />
               seen some such statement as that. It was 
               <br />
               generally reported, too, that this government 
               <br />
               had sent up piles of money to carry that con- 
               <br />
               stituency, I think they were most anxious 
               <br />
               to do so. Now the hon. member for Centre 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~York</span> is a very prominent man of the Liberal 
               <br />
               party, a very prominent supporter of this 
               <br />
               government, he has great inﬂuence in the 
               <br />
               party. In fact it is said that the member 
               <br />
               for Centre York is rather ambitious. that he 
               <br />
               is looking forward to advancement. It is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.said</span> that the right hon. the premier holds one 
               <br />
               of those plums in his hand which the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Centre York is anxious to get, 
               <br />
               and that may be partly the reason why he 
               <br />
               is so enthusiastic :in support of this Bill. 
               <br />
               I suspect, however, that he is not very en- 
               <br />
               thusiastic, because he has a pretty good 
               <br />
               idea that when he goes back to his cou- 
               <br />
               zstituents for re-election his majority will be 
               <br />
               much smaller than it was at the last election, 
               <br />
               and it was small enough then. I notice by 
               <br />
               the Toronto ‘ Star,’ the faithful party organ 
               <br />
               of the Postmaster General, that a relative ot" 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has just been appointed 
               <br />
               to a prominent position as grain inspector 
               <br />
               in the city of Toronto at a salary of $3,000 
               <br />
               a year. So I think we can at least say that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has considerable in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence with this government. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now we are told that there is no feeling 
               <br />
               throughout the country at all, we are told 
               <br />
               “that no hostile sentiment exists to any ex- 
               <br />
               .tent, and that the feeling in Toronto does 
               <br />
               not amount to anything. In fact the Min— 
               <br />
               ister of: Justice told us the other night that 
               <br />
               nobody left the Liberal party on this ques— 
               <br />
               tion that they had the slightest respect for. 
               <br />
               And the senior member for Ottawa (Mr. 
               <br />
               Belcourt) the other night called these gen-

               tlemen who were opposing the government 
               <br />
               upon this Bill. renegade Liberals. When 
               <br />
               some one asked him if he styled the Toronto 
               <br />
               ‘ Globe’ as one of the renegades, he said he 
               <br />
               did. Therefore the Toronto ‘Globe’ is in the 
               <br />
               ranks of the renegades. I wonder who it 
               <br />
               was that gave the hon. member for Ottawa 
               <br />
               authority to read the Toronto ‘Globe’ out 
               <br />
               of the party? Is he especially set aside to 
               <br />
               read Liberal malcontents out of the party '! 
               <br />
               He seems to assume that position, whether 
               <br />
               he is entitled to it or not. Mr. Speaker, let

               when the election came on the government

               this country. The time is not far distant 
               <br />
               when the great west, including Manitoba 
               <br />
               and British Columbia, will hold the con- 
               <br />
               trolling power in this parliament. Therefore, 
               <br />
               in giving them a constitution, it behooves us 
               <br />
               to consider it with the greatest care; we 
               <br />
               should try and give them a constitution that 
               <br />
               will be acceptable to the people of that coun- 
               <br />
               try, not only for the present, but for all 
               <br />
               time to come. We should give them a con- 
               <br />
               stitution that will be not only acceptable to 
               <br />
               Canada but to the British empire as well. 
               <br />
               For, Sir, wherever you ﬁnd a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian,</span> 
               <br />
               whether at home or in a foreign country, you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd a man who is proud of the fact that 
               <br />
               he is a Canadian, more than that you will 
               <br />
