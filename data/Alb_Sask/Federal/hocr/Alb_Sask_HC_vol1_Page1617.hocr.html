               province, I wish to give my views to the

               <br />
               of Athabaska was added to the old district 
               <br />
               of Alberta, forming the proposed new pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Alberta, we all became very much 
               <br />
               interested, or at least I did, ln learning as 
               <br />
               much as could be learned about the southern 
               <br />
               portion of the whole of that portion of Atha- 
               <br />
               baska. By reference to the map you will 
               <br />
               see that the portion of Athabaska added to 
               <br />
               this province is about 350 miles from east to 
               <br />
               west and somewhat more than that from 
               <br />
               north to south. The southeast portion of it 
               <br />
               you will notice is drained by the Athabaska 
               <br />
               river and the southwestern portion by the 
               <br />
               Peace River. As a resident of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories for a number of years I know 
               <br />
               that those two portions of that territory have 
               <br />
               been attracting a good deal of attention. I 
               <br />
               know that large numbers of people are going 
               <br />
               up to the valley of the Athabaska river and 
               <br />
               that still greater numbers are going to the 
               <br />

               <br />

               province in which so much money and

               energy are expended is certainly entitled to 
               <br />
               a representative. The Peace River district 
               <br />
               I found in even a more ﬂourishing condition. 
               <br />
               I found there eighteen stores, ten churches. 
               <br />
               six schools, four sawmills, ﬁve shingle mills. 
               <br />
               three plaining mills, ﬁve ﬂour mills (one of 
               <br />
               which is a ﬁfty barrel roller mill and four of

               what is called the Grande Prairie. a portion 
               <br />
               of the Peace River valley is one of the most

               productive and fertile districts in the west.

               <br />
               to one representative in the new legislature. 
               <br />
               In addition to that I found there was a con-
