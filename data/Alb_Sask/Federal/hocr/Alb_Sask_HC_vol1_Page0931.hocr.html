               gentleman who poses as a great peace-

               <br />
               he went through the debate of 1896 and 
               <br />
               knows the whole question thoroughly. My

               hon. friend who has just spoken said that 
               <br />
               when the Prime Minister set himself on the 
               <br />
               rock of the constitution, he thought it was a 
               <br />
               Sif-tonian rock. I think when my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition shelters 
               <br />

               <br />
               Fosterite rock, because I do not believe the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman of his own impulse would 
               <br />
               take the stand he has taken. Nevertheless,

               he has stated that he takes the stand of his

               Mr. BUREAU. I think if you were to 
               <br />
               give the administration of the lands to the 
               <br />
               provinces and to place restrictions on them 
               <br />
               in that administration, it would be an en- 
               <br />
               croachment on provincial rights. You would 
               <br />
               be establishing a condition of things Which 
               <br />
               they themselves would not enforce, that 
               <br />
               is, you would be encroaching on provincial

               rights, and consequently I come to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that in the opinion of hon. gentle-

               men opposite the principle of provincial

               behind when it suits you, but when it does 
               <br />
               not suit you, to the winds with provincial 
               <br />
               rights. I read with great interest a speech 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for North Toron-

               reading and comparing the speeches of the 
               <br />

               the hauling around and changing of front 
               <br />

               <br />
               North Toronto (Mr. Foster). In those days 
               <br />
               when he discussed the question of remedial 
               <br />
               legislation, he dismissed with a snap of his 
               <br />
               ﬁngers the question of provincial rights. He 
               <br />
               said that :
