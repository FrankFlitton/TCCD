               <br />
               let us discuss it in a quiet way. He is 1n 
               <br />
               . favour of clause 16, !No. 2 because, forsooth, 
               <br />
               he cannot go any further than the ordin- 
               <br />
               ances of 1892. Why? Because the Conser- 
               <br />
               vative government in 1892 did not disallow 
               <br />
               those ordinances. Surely he is not serious? 
               <br />
               Sir John Thompson. as was stated yester- 
               <br />
               day by my right hon. friend—and it is on 
               <br />
               record—always treated those ordinances as 
               <br />
               if they were only of a temporary character 
               <br />
               and were only to last until the Territories 
               <br />
               were created into provinces. The creating 
               <br />
               of new provinces out of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'Territories</span> had 
               <br />
               been talked of for years; and when this took 
               <br />
               place an educational law would be framed 
               <br />
               which would do justice to all. If we are 
               <br />
               to accept the dictum of the Hon. Mr. Brown, 
               <br />
               which my right hon. friend quoted in his ﬁrst 
               <br />
               speech on the 21st of February, and that of 
               <br />
               Sir Alex. Campbell made in the Senate, the 
               <br />
               law of 1875 passed by Mr. Mackenzie was 
               <br />
               to be the law for ever. That was the reason 
               <br />
               why Mr. Brown was so much opposed to 
               <br />
               it. He said: If you pass that law now, it 
               <br />
               will be the law for ever. Yet we are told 
               <br />
               that because the late Conservative govern- 
               <br />
               ment did not disallow the ordinances of 
               <br />
               1892 my brave friend the Minister of Inland 
               <br />

               <br />

               hon. Minister of Inland Revenue. Mine is 
               <br />

               <br />

               my hon. friend knows that we are not that 
               <br />
               he has got into such a hot temper. He

               tenable before the people of the province

               I have been in every province in this Dom- 
               <br />
               inion, and wherever I have been my policy 
               <br />
               has been the same. My Chieftain can defend 
               <br />
               himself. If the hon. gentleman (Mr. Scott) 
               <br />
               has been accustomed to be dragged after 
               <br />
               his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leader,</span> I can tell him that on this side 
               <br />
               we are not worked by strings in our lead- 
               <br />
               er’s hands. We have opinions of our own 
               <br />
               particularly on questions of this kind. I 
               <br />
               speak for myself. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Scott) has put a question to me and I 
               <br />
               desire to answer it. I say that clause 16, 
               <br />
               No. 2, the clause he is going to vote for, 
               <br />
               does not give anything to the Catholic min- 
               <br />
               ority of the Northwest Territories.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> Mr. A. JOHNSTON. I would like to put 
               <br />
               to the hon. gentleman (Mr. Bergeron) one 
               <br />
               question. I do not rise to prolong this dis- 
               <br />
               cussion, but, as my hon. friend from Beau- 
               <br />
               harnois (Mr. Bergeron) has expressed a 
               <br />
               desire that I should follow him. I propose, 
               <br />
               in a few words to test his sincerity on this 
               <br />
               very important question. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               (Mr. Bergeron) ﬁnds fault with the attitude 
               <br />
               ol" this side of the House on this particular 
               <br />
               question. He says he is prepared to go be- 
               <br />
               fore the people of his province and denounce 
               <br />
               the attitude of the government on this ques- 
               <br />
               tion. Will he, in his place in this House to— 
               <br />
               night, say that when the time comes he will 
               <br />
               go before the people of his province and 
               <br />
               denounce the attitude of his own leader (Mr. 
               <br />
               R. L. Borden) and those who surround him ?
