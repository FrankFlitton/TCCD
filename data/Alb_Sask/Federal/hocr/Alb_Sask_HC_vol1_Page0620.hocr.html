               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inuhis</span> remarks. He made a ﬁne speech.

               <br />
               Tory machines he made anawful mistake. 
               <br />
               Let me say again. because we cannot say 
               <br />
               it too often. that although there may have 
               <br />
               been abuses in some places. for instance, in 
               <br />
               the county of Charlevoix, which has been 
               <br />
               referred to. there are the most damnable 
               <br />
               things in this book which have been sent to 
               <br />
               Rome and which are not true. But, on the 
               <br />
               whole. our bishops in Quebec are men of a 
               <br />
               great deal of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prudence.</span> They are learned 
               <br />
               men. They are chosen with a great deal 
               <br />
               of care. They are wise, and they are men 
               <br />
               of delicate sensibilities. There is a bishop 
               <br />
               in the county I have the honour to represent, 
               <br />
               and he has never dropped me a letter or ex- 
               <br />
               pressed a desire to see me as to the vote I 
               <br />
               may give or as to the position which I in- 
               <br />
               tend to take upon this question. Some 
               <br />
               'people may think that I am getting hot 
               <br />
               upon this question of the Manitoba schools. 
               <br />
               I have been the victim of it. In 1900 the 
               <br />
               gentleman who presented himself against 
               <br />
               me in the county of Beauharnois was an 
               <br />
               English Protestant. You know this gentle— 
               <br />
               man: you have seen him here. He was a 
               <br />
               thorough Conservative until 1896; but he 
               <br />
               went against the Conservative party in 
               <br />
               1896, because the Conservative party want- 
               <br />
               ed to render justice to the Catholic minority 
               <br />
               of Manitoba. There are many English 
               <br />
               votes in that county. and they were cast for 
               <br />
               that gentleman when he was a candidate 
               <br />
               in 1900. I believe that these people voted 
               <br />
               for him sincerely and honestly, and natural- 
               <br />
               ly they elected him, because our people do 
               <br />
               not separate upon national lines. There 
               <br />
               are many priests in my county, and I say 
               <br />
               here, upon my honour as a member of par- 
               <br />
               liament. that never has a bishop or priest 
               <br />
               in the county of Beauharnois gone to a 
               <br />
               man and told him that he should vote for 
               <br />
               me because I was a French Canadian and 
               <br />
               a Roman Catholic. The result was that
