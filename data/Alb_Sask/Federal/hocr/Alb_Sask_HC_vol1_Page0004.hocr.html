               there are in the American Union states of 
               <br />
               unequal sizes. It is not a fatal fault as has 
               <br />
               been proved by the history of the American 
               <br />
               Union, but I believe that when provinces 
               <br />
               are not the result of historic tradition, when 
               <br />
               they have not come to us formed and when 
               <br />
               we have the control of events, it is prefer- 
               <br />
               able that the provinces should be as near 
               <br />
               as possible about the same size. Therefore, 
               <br />
               it is impossible to suppose that this im- 
               <br />
               mense territory of 1,112,527 miles should 
               <br />
               be formed into one single province. There 
               <br />
               is another objection. The territories are 
               <br />
               naturally divided into two portions from 
               <br />
               the point of view of agriculture, climate, 
               <br />
               and productions generally, the northern 
               <br />
               portion and the southern portion, and I 
               <br />
               would place the boundary of these two 
               <br />
               sections a little south of the boundary 
               <br />
               which now divides the provisional district 
               <br />
               of Mackenzie from the provisional district 
               <br />
               of Athabaska. This northern portion of 
               <br />
               the continent has not yet been fully ex- 
               <br />
               plored, but still we know enough of it, 
               <br />
               there has been enough exploration of it 
               <br />
               and it has been travelled over suﬂicientiy, 
               <br />
               to make us sure that it is absolutely unﬁt 
               <br />
               for agriculture. The climate is too cold 
               <br />
               and the soil is too poor. There are, how- 
               <br />
               ever, very excellent and very promising in- 
               <br />
               dications of mineral wealth in that dis- 
               <br />
               trict. There are indications to-day of pe— 
               <br />
               troleum, coal, gold, copper and other min- 
               <br />
               erals, and perhaps some day we may have 
               <br />
               in what is to-day a barren section, an- 
               <br />
               other Yukon. But we know by the expe- 
               <br />
               rience of the past that mineral wealth, 
               <br />
               when not coupled with agriculture, is but 
               <br />
               a precarious ground on which to found the 
               <br />
               hope of thick and permanent settlement. 
               <br />
               Therefore. we put aside <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> northern sec-

               When we were ﬁrst approached on this 
               <br />
               subject, it was proposed to us that we should 
               <br />
               make a province extending from the Ameri- 
               <br />
               can boundary up to the 57th parallel, that 
               <br />
               is to say, somewhat to the south of the 
               <br />
               provisional boundary between the provis- 
               <br />
               ional districts of Mackenzie and Athabaska, 
               <br />
               but we thought it preferable to take in the 
               <br />
               whole district of Athabaska. The reason 
               <br />
               for this is, that although Athabaska is not 
               <br />
               considered to be a fertile country, and the 
               <br />
               eastern portion of it is barren, the western 
               <br />
               portion, the valley of the Peace river, is 
               <br />
               equal to the valley of the Saskatchewan and 
               <br />
               settlement there is already proceeding rapid- 
               <br />
               ly. There are to~day on the Peace river two 
               <br />
               grist mills, provided absolutely from Wheat 
               <br />
               grown in the Peace river valley, and there- 
               <br />
               fore we have decided to include within the 
               <br />
               new provinces the provisional district of 
               <br />
               Athabaska. The area of these two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pros</span> 
               <br />
               vinces together will be about 550,345 square 
               <br />
               miles. This is, in our estimation, altogether 
               <br />
               too large an area to be made into one single 
               <br />
               province according to the size of the other 
               <br />
               provinces, the largest of which is British 
               <br />
               Columbia, and the next largest Quebec,

               square miles and Quebec with an area 0! 
               <br />
               351,000 square miles. By dividing it into 
               <br />
               two you have two provinces of 275,000 
               <br />
               square miles in round numbers, each about 
               <br />
               the size of the province of Ontario. If any 
               <br />
               01' the members of the House will care to 
               <br />
               look at the map, they will see that we have 
               <br />
               put the provisional boundary on the fourth 
               <br />
               meridian and according to our present in- 
               <br />
               formation, this will give about the same 
               <br />
               area and also the same population to the two 
               <br />
               provinces. It is estimated that the popula- 
               <br />
               tion to-day in these two provinces is about 
               <br />
               500,000 souls. We have no accurate data, 
               <br />
               but we can proceed pretty conﬁdently upon 
               <br />
               this information. The census in 1901 gave 
               <br />
               to these Northwest Territories a population 
               <br />
               of a little over 160,000 souls. Since that 
               <br />
               time, during the seasons of 1901, 1902, 1903 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1904,</span> the population, by immigration 
               <br />
               alone, has increased by over 100,000 a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year,</span> 
               <br />
               so that to-day we feel we are on pretty safe 
               <br />
               ground when we say that there is in those 
               <br />
               two provinces a total population of 500,000 
               <br />
               souls, and we calculate that this population 
               <br />
               is about equally divided between the two 
               <br />
