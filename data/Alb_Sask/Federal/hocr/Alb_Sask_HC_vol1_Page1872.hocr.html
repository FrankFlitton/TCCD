               <br />
               distorted view of this amendment. The 
               <br />
               hon. the leader of the opposition this after- 
               <br />
               noon gave us a ten minute dissertation on

               rect drafting, and what he said was very 
               <br />
               true. We have an illustration of it here.

               After about four or ﬁve months discussion,

               <br />
               we asked for in the ﬁrst instance. There

               <br />
               siderable discussion in the House and in 
               <br />
               North Oxford and London regarding tne 
               <br />
               origin of the educational clause in this an- 
               <br />
               tonomy Bill. The very point brought up by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Hastings (Mr. Porter) 
               <br />
               this evening is the very best proof of the 
               <br />
               fact that the issue in North Oxford and 
               <br />
               London was not the actual effect of 
               <br />
               the educational clause, it was not the 
               <br />
               separate or the public school <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system.</span> 
               <br />
               but it was whether it was the re- 
               <br />
               presentative of the Pope or not who drafted 
               <br />
               that clause and put it .in the hands of the

               Bill was introduced on February 21, the 
               <br />
               people expressed no dissatisfaction. When 
               <br />
               the amendment was announced a month 
               <br />
               later, they again believed that the- object 
               <br />
               of section 1(3, No. 2, was to perpetuate 
               <br />

               tlemen opposite have lamentably failed to 
               <br />
               secure these expressions. But we ﬁnd—and 
               <br />
               the point is made abundantly clear by the
