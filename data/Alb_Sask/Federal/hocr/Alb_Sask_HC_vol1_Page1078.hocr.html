               now, the principle of taking the question

               <br />
               that the Northwest Territories became en-

               <br />
               British North America Act with regard to 
               <br />
               education. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">PI</span> am not sure that I could ac-

               cede to that legal proposition. but if there 
               <br />
               be any doubt that the minority acquired 
               <br />
               certain rights in 1870, there can be no 
               <br />
               doubt that section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act was applied to the minority 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories by the Act 
               <br />
               which we passed in 1880. Well, since 1880 
               <br />
               .the minority have acquired some rights and 
               <br />
               privileges. They got some ordinances pas- 
               <br />
               sed in connection with education; and I 
               <br />
               am glad to say that the legislation which 
               <br />
               was passed in 1883, and which gave to the 
               <br />
               minority in the Territories the full meas- 
               <br />
               ure of their rights and privileges, was pre- 
               <br />
               pared by two of my colleagues, one of 
               <br />
               whom is the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver). My hon. friend, the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, was then a member of the 
               <br />
               territorial assembly and one of those who 
               <br />
               passed this legislation giving the minority 
               <br />
               the full measure of justice and the full 
               <br />
               measure of their rights. Whether the min- 
               <br />
               ority acquired those rights in 1870 or whe- 
               <br />
               ther they acquired them by the legislation of 
               <br />
               1880, there is no doubt that in 1880 separate 
               <br />
               schools were established, and there is no 
               <br />
