               important commercial questions before Can- 
               <br />
               ada to-day. The market of Japan, I believe, 
               <br />
               is the best market we can hope to gain—- 
               <br />
               and a growing market too, We have the

               shipping facilities unexcelled by any coun-

               <br />
               some gentlemen from Japan visiting Canada 
               <br />
               ——I do not know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Whether</span> for the purpose or 
               <br />
               not—purchased some high grade Jersey

               ﬁed that they are the best cattle to take, 
               <br />
               and expressed surprise that they had not 
               <br />
               earlier known that Canada was raising for 
               <br />
               sale that class of cattle. This would in- 
               <br />
               dicate a want of enterprise on the part of 
               <br />
               Canada. If this is the case in regard to 
               <br />
               our cattle, surely the advertising that Can-

               Mr. FISHER. I heartily agree with what

               red is not quite correct. Two gentlemen

               came from Japan to this continent to pur— 
               <br />

               Canadian exhibit at Osaka two years ago, 
               <br />
               they thought they would not return to Japan

               until they had visited Canada and found 
               <br />
               what could be done here. They came here, 
               <br />
               and put themselves in communication with

               my department, with the result that they 
               <br />
               purchased over twenty head. These gentle-

               Hon. GEO. E. FOSTER. The 'hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for W'innipeg (Mr. Bole) is not present 
               <br />
               and I was not here yesterday when he 
               <br />
               drew .the attention of the House to a state- 
               <br />
               ment said to have been made by myself. It is 
               <br />
               not a very important matter, but might just 
               <br />
               as well be made clear. In the unrevised ‘Han- 
               <br />
               sard,’ I am reported as having made the 
               <br />
               statement that the hon. member (Mr. Bole) 
               <br />
               has brought down with him from Winnipeg 
               <br />
               certain statements and correspondence and 
               <br />
               an assignment of. Mr. Chaffee’s claims. I 
               <br />
               did not say that, although the unrevised 
               <br />
               ‘ Hansard’ would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁcient</span> warrant for 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Winnipeg (Mr. Bole) to 
               <br />
               think I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had.</span> The full stop was left out and 
               <br />
               also some words. What I meant to say was 
               <br />
               that Mr. Bole was in Winnipeg that time. I 
               <br />
               then preceeded to say that shortly after- 
               <br />
               wards the papers brought down show an as- 
               <br />
               signment from Mr. ChafEee <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> McDonald a 
               <br />
               Go. That makes all the difference in the 
               <br />
               world in the statement, but the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Winnipeg (Mr. Bole) was fully justi- 
               <br />
               ﬁed in calling attention to it from what ap- 
               <br />
               peared in the unrevised ‘Hansard.’
