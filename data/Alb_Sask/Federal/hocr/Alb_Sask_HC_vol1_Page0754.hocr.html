               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">less</span> a person than Sir A. T. Gait, the cham-

               pion of Protestant interests in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec at the time that Canada became 
               <br />
               a part of confederation. Surely it does not

               lie in the mouths of papers like the Toronto

               statement that provincial rights are being 
               <br />

               Gait had that provision inserted in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnd that subsection 2 of section 93 was 
               <br />
               added at the request of. Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">A.</span> T. Gait. That 
               <br />
               does not apply to any other province; yet 
               <br />
               the Protestants in that case have the right

               <br />

               <br />

               the constitution of Canada and therefore

               why should .not the educational clauses

               in the past to live under a system 
               <br />
               of separate schools. It has been stated 
               <br />
               in certain quarters and by certain parties 
               <br />
               that the province of Ontario was rather in— 
               <br />
               clined to be an intolerant province. I have 
               <br />
               lived in that province all my life and have 
               <br />
               been extensively acquainted throughout that

               province, and I must say that it is a toler- 
               <br />
               ant province. We know that in the provin— 
               <br />
               cial election of 1886, and in subsequent elec- 
               <br />
               tions, the leaders of the Conservative party 
               <br />
               sought by all means at their command to 
               <br />
               deprive the Roman Catholic section of the 
               <br />
               population of Ontario of their separate 
               <br />
               schools, to impair and practically destroy 
               <br />
               their system of separate schools and we 
               <br />
               know with what result. We know that in 
               <br />
               each case Sir Oliver Mowat appealed to the 
               <br />
               broad, tolerant views of the people in re-

               and every one of these cases without ex-

               <br />
               returned at the head of the polls. There- 
               <br />
               fore, I say the people of Ontario are a broad- 
               <br />
               minded people, that they are not an intol- 
               <br />
               erant people. I regret, however, to say that 
               <br />
               we have in Ontario some rags like the To- 
               <br />
               ronto ‘News ’ and will mention another 
               <br />
               paper like the Toronto ‘World,’ which , for 
               <br />
               the time being, contain so much inﬂammable 
               <br />
               material that they make a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great,</span> blaze, 
               <br />
               but it is only a temporary blaze, which, like 
               <br />
               all ‘violent ﬁres soon burn out themselves.’ 
               <br />
               Therefore, I would say to our Catholic breth- 
               <br />
               ren who do not know the people of Ontario 
               <br />
               that they may rest assured that the people of 
               <br />
               Ontario are a broad-minded people, and I 
               <br />
               will go further and say that when the right 
               <br />
               hon. Prime Minister comes to appeal to the 
               <br />
               people of Ontarioon account of the narrow 
               <br />
               views which have been expressed in opposi- 
               <br />
               tion to him and when the broad—minded, tol- 
               <br />
               erant people of Ontario come to size up' the 
               <br />
               situation and know the facts they will cast 
               <br />
               into the ﬁre of rags all such journals as those 
               <br />
               which I have mentioned and which are try- 
               <br />
               ing now to stir up religious strife and ani— 
               <br />
               mosity. I also wish, Mr. Speaker, to point 
               <br />
               out the advantage that will result from hav- 
               <br />
               ing peace and harmony assured in the North- 
               <br />

               <br />
               placed beyond the control of any particular 
               <br />
               ﬁrebrand who may afterwards arise in these 
               <br />
               new provinces and who may desire to make 
               <br />
               cheap political capital out of it the same as 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster), the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule), and the hon. member for South 
               <br />
               York (Mr. Maclean). I think it is of the 
               <br />
               utmost importance that we should have the 
               <br />
               school system clearly deﬁned as it is in 
               <br />
               these Bills, so that there will be no bickering, 
               <br />
               no lawsuits extending over a number of 
               <br />
               years and no cause for strife in these new 
               <br />
               provinces. I ask what will be the result? 
               <br />
               The minority in the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               will know that they will be entitled to sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools, that they Will be guaranteed 
               <br />
               to them. We know that there are thousands 
               <br />
               of people who are coming from foreign 
               <br />
               lands, from the United States and other 
               <br />
               countries, to settle in these new provinces. 
               <br />
               It is of the utmost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«importance</span> that we 
               <br />
               should give every possible encouragement 
               <br />
               to our friends, Protestant and Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lic, throughout all parts of Canada to locate 
               <br />
               in these provinces so as to leaven this for- 
               <br />
               eign element with the Canadian spirit. 
               <br />
               Therefore, I say it is of the utmost impor- 
               <br />
               tance that we should have that law in force 
               <br />
               and that we should give every encourage- 
               <br />
