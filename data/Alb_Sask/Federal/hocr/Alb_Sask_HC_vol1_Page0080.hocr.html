               Mr. BENNETT. W'e all know that cer- 
               <br />
               tain inﬂuences were at work in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec in the last election; there was 
               <br />
               the pledge that there should be separate 
               <br />
               schools in the Northwest, and I have no 
               <br />
               doubt that was worked to the bitter end; 
               <br />
               quietly no doubt; much quieter than in the 
               <br />
               case of the Remedial Bill in 1896. Be that 
               <br />
               as it may, here is a cabinet disjointed and 
               <br />
               disrupted, paralyzed before the people of 
               <br />
               Canada for the last three weeks, ﬁghting 
               <br />
               within and fears without, and its supporters 
               <br />
               all muzzled except the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe (Mr. Leighton McCarthy), 
               <br />
               whom I congratulate on his bravery in 
               <br />
               standing up in deﬁance of the government, 
               <br />
               and the hon. member for South Wellington 
               <br />
               (Mr. Guthrie), who has not been seen since. 
               <br />
               My fear is that if any other gentleman on 
               <br />
               that side were to make a similar statement, 
               <br />
               the same fate might attend him. And what 
               <br />
               is the position of the hon. member (Mr. 
               <br />
               Guthrie) to-day ? Here is the Bill which 
               <br />
               he was to support going to be emasculated, 
               <br />
               nothing to be left of it, and if the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman comes back to the House he will have 
               <br />
               to denounce the government for taking the 
               <br />
               very Vitals out of his pet measure. And 
               <br />
               where is the hon. member for West Assini— 
               <br />
               bola (Mr. Scott) ? He published in the 
               <br />
               newspapers that he was favourable to this 
               <br />
               legislation, but to-night he is as silent as 
               <br />
               the tomb. What a humiliating spectacle! 
               <br />
               Only the Prime Minister to speak, and 
               <br />
               after him the Minister of Justice ; and when 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice has had his say, it 
               <br />
               is the same parade of the stock in trade that 
               <br />
               brought the Prime Minister to the front in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec, and on which he 
               <br />
               has been depending ever since, and on which 
               <br />
               he must always depend in order to have a 
               <br />
               political existence in this country.

               the discussions of this measure inﬂamma-

               tory addresses have been unknown in the

               past, we have now to regret that such a 
               <br />
               happy condition of affairs has come to an 
               <br />
               end. It has remained for another member 
               <br />
               of the silent ministry to drag in that passion, 
               <br />
               that prejudice and that extreme asperity 
               <br />

               mands from this side of the House that 
               <br />
               some one should speak for the government, 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice ﬂew to his feet and 
               <br />
               indulged in the most extreme degree of 
               <br />
               heat and passion. I would remind the hon. 
               <br />
               minister that there is a time to be bitter, as 
               <br />
               there is a time to be tranquil. If, in the

               where passion and prejudice did not exist,

               that is wanting, and that verdict we have 
               <br />
