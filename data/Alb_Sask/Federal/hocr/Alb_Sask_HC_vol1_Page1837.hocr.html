               power are of three <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> natures: 
               <br />
               First, are the clauses relating to the 
               <br />
               active power of the province and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">determine</span> 
               <br />
               ing the matters it shall bear upon; 2nd, are 
               <br />
               the clauses expressly restrictive or by re- 
               <br />
               ference to the B.N.A. Act; and 3rd, are the 
               <br />
               constitutional clauses proper. Matters per— 
               <br />
               taining to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> two ﬁrst clauses are subject 
               <br />
               to the will and even to the mere impulse of 
               <br />
               the legislatures and the parliament. But 
               <br />
               the constitutional clauses which are based 
               <br />
               upon formal compacts, cannot be tampered 
               <br />
               with by any one, neither by parliament nor 
               <br />
               by legislatures; and anything enacted to the 
               <br />
               contrary is void and null ; anything that in— 
               <br />
               fringes upon the spirit and even upon the 
               <br />
               form of those clauses is equally void and 
               <br />
               null. And this parliament cannot re~enact 
               <br />
               laws or ordinances contrary to the spirit 
               <br />

               ritories, I was very much pleased indeed to 
               <br />
               hear the beautiful argument made last night 
               <br />
               by my hon. friends the member for Labelle 
               <br />

               <br />
               magny (Mr. Lavergue). I would have liked 
               <br />
               very much to have added a few words of 
               <br />
               endorsation of what they have said upon 
               <br />
               this Question, but I hesitated to do so for

               fear lest I should be exposed to repeat again 
               <br />
               what this House is already very much aware 
               <br />
               of. I will conﬁne my remarks to the mere 
               <br />
               statement that I approve unhesitatingly of 
               <br />
               their views on this matter, and that I am

               (Mr. Fitzpatrick) Wished to be sincere he 
               <br />
               could this very evening amend this Bill in
