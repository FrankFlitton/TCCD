               resolution came before the legislative as- 
               <br />
               sembly at Regina, one of the members

               that the people of the west desire provincial

               It has already been pointed out, Mr.

               Speaker, that to establish but one province 
               <br />
               out of the western Territories would be to 
               <br />
               establish a province which, in its area and 
               <br />
               in its capacity to sustain population, would 
               <br />
               so far exceed that possessed by any other 
               <br />
               province that it would very soon have a pre-

               <br />
               shown that to establish a province in each

               tice of this House as likely to result from a

               division of the ranching country would have 
               <br />
               been avoided. Of course, Mr. Speaker, there 
               <br />
               are two main objections to the establishment 
               <br />
               of a northern and a southern province. In 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place, that division would not give 
               <br />
               nearly as equitable a division of the natural 
               <br />
               resources of the Territories between the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces as the present one, and the other 
               <br />
               objection is that it would not have made 
               <br />
               provision for the administration of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Atha'</span> 
               <br />
               baska, the western portion of which will 
               <br />
               very shortly be settled. As to the question 
               <br />
               of the boundary line, if we are to have an 
               <br />
               eastern and a western province, I do not 
               <br />
               think any fault can be found with the 
               <br />
               placing of the boundary line at the fourth 
               <br />
               meridian. That division leaves the area 
               <br />
               of the two provinces almost the same and 
               <br />
               besides it leaves the agricultural lands al- 
               <br />
               most equal in each. It has been estimated 
               <br />
               by the surveyor general that according to 
               <br />
               the present division, the agricultural lands 
               <br />
               in the new province of Saskatchewan will 
               <br />
               amount to 86,000 square miles, while in the 
               <br />
               new province of Alberta they will amount 
               <br />
               to 80,000 square miles, so that there will 
               <br />
               be in each <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province</span> practically the same 
               <br />
               quantity of agricultural land.

               but which has been brought to the attention 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ot"</span> the House on several occasions, and has 
               <br />
               been exhaustively dealt with by the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen who preceded me. I refer 
               <br />
               to the extension of the boundaries of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba. With regard to the extension west- 
               <br />
               ward, I agree entirely With my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from eastern Assiniboia (Mr. Turiif) 
               <br />
               when he said the other night that 
               <br />
               the boundary of Manitoba could not be ex— 
               <br />
               tended westward, so as to include a por- 
               <br />
               tion of the Saskatchewan and Assinlboia, 
               <br />
               without exciting a public agitation and pro- 
               <br />
               test the like of which the country has 
               <br />
               never experienced. I was somewhat sur- 
               <br />
               prised at the argument of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Macdonald (Mr. Staples) who contended 
               <br />
               that the western boundary of Manitoba 
               <br />
               should be extended. Knowing well the 
               <br />
               feeling in Assiniboia and Saskatchewan, as 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman must, I should think 
               <br />
               that the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentieman</span> and those who take 
               <br />
               the same view, would have the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ob&lt;</span>
