               who is in possession for the time being of 
               <br />
               the seed. It may be a railway company, a 
               <br />
               common carrier, it may be any person on 
               <br />
               Whose premises the goods are temporarily

               <br />
               market. If an ofﬁcer comes up and insists 
               <br />
               upon making an examination and if this 
               <br />
               person refuses or obstructs in any degree he 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               to some extent, an experimental matter. 
               <br />
               This isa matter of educating the people up 
               <br />
               to a certain standard and it is not advisable 
               <br />
               that we should have drastic legislation at 
               <br />
               the beginning. Would it not be manifestly 
               <br />
               unfair if a railway company which was car- 
               <br />
               rying this grain from place to place, refused 
               <br />
               in such case to stop its train in order to per- 
               <br />
               mit of the examination here spoken of being 
               <br />
               made? Yet the result would be that if a rail- 
               <br />
               way company refused to delay its trains in 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               sonable in these matters. A gentleman who 
               <br />
               has a number of people in his employment 
               <br />

               <br />
               section 10 might be reduced to $100.

               Mr. FISHER. I would say in reply to 
               <br />
               the arguments of the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Lennox) in the ﬁrst place, that this ques- 
               <br />
               tion was discussed in the committee and 
               <br />
               the committee decided to retain the penalty 
               <br />
               as it is. I would say again that this penalty 
               <br />
               is not a penalty under ordinary circumstan- 
               <br />
               ces for the contravention of the law, but it 
               <br />
               is the penalty for a person who obstructs 
               <br />
               an ofﬁcer in the discharge of his duty, a 
               <br />
               serious offence, an offence which must be 
               <br />
               deliberate as the ofﬁcer will have to declare 
               <br />
               what his duties are and what he is there 
               <br />
               for. The penalty of $500 is the limit. 
               <br />
               I can imagine circumstances under which 
               <br />
               a person would obstruct an ofﬁcer in the 
               <br />
               execution of his duty in carrying out the 
               <br />
               law where $500 would not be at all too 
               <br />
               much as a penalty for the offence. But, the 
               <br />
               penalty of $500 is not necessary. The pen- 
               <br />
               alty is to be $25, and it may be increased 
               <br />
               up to as high as $500. Under these cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances I do not think the penalties as 
               <br />
               herein described are too great, and I must 
               <br />
               ask the House to reject the amendment.
