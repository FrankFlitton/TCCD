               but it soon became a matter of compromise. 
               <br />
               There was a desire on the part of the people

               Now, Mr. Speaker, I will refer in a few 
               <br />
               words to my position. and also to my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posi-Ï,</span>

               tion on the Remedial Bill when it was before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> 
               <br />
               the House. I happened to be a member at i 
               <br />
               that time, and I voted in favour of the Bill. 
               <br />
               I voted in support of the government. I was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               nine years younger in age then, and I had 
               <br />
               nine years less experience than I have now. " 
               <br />
               I voted largely from party exigencies. I am : 
               <br />
               frank in saying so, and I think I will have 
               <br />
               many-sympathizers amongst my friends who 
               <br />
               are supporting this measure on this occasion. 
               <br />
               I acknowledge that I made a mistake. I 
               <br />
               now, before this House and the country. 
               <br />
               disavow my action at that time. And why ? 
               <br />
               I found that when I went to my people, 
               <br />
               when I went to my Roman Catholic citizens 
               <br />
               and supporters, after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">voting</span> in favour of the 
               <br />
               Remedial Bill, in the interest of that church 
               <br />
               and in the interest of the minority of Manl- 
               <br />
               toba, they would have none of it. I found 
               <br />
               that they were frank, honest, open and 
               <br />
               above-board. When I went to them I told 
               <br />
               them, and they knew as well as I could tell 
               <br />
               them, the position that I occupied. They 
               <br />
               were frank, open and square, and they told 
               <br />
               me they would not vote for me, that they 
               <br />
               were supporters of the Liberal party, and 
               <br />
               although they did not tell me so, I inferred 
               <br />
               that, inasmuch as the Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier was the leader of that party. it 
               <br />
               was particularly attractive to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.»</span> They 
               <br />
               received me in the most hospitable manner 
               <br />
               and spoke to me in pleasant terms, but vote 
               <br />
               for me they would not. Of course, this is 
               <br />
               a personal matter, but it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has-</span> some bearing 
               <br />
               on .my action on the Remedial Bill. At the 
               <br />
               close of the poll in the election of 1896, in 
               <br />

               <br />
               adopted for party reasons and party reasons 
               <br />
               alone. Because of the manner in which my 
               <br />
               Catholic constituents, my fellow-citizens, 
               <br />
               treated me, and because of the manner in 
               <br />
               which the people of the Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               treated Sir Charles Tupper, I felt absolved

               from any obligation to continue my support 
               <br />

               now before you, Mr. Speaker. and this 
               <br />
               House. that I took the course I did, and that- 
               <br />
               I regret the vote I gave on that occasion. 
               <br />
               Had I voted against the government at that 
               <br />
               time it was a moral certainty that I would 
               <br />
               have been successful in my appeal to my 
               <br />
               constituents. I was defeated only by a com- 
               <br />
               paratively small majority. My Protestant 
               <br />
               friends I found were very much dissatisﬁed 
               <br />
               with the course I had taken. However. 
               <br />
               that is all past and gone. But my position 
               <br />
               I feel in duty bound to clearly deﬁne. I 
               <br />
               know that my fellow-members will bear 
               <br />
               with me, for I do not pretend to be a speak- 
               <br />
               er. I wish a few minutes more. and then 
               <br />
               I remember, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, it was stated at the time of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Manitoba</span> agitation that certain agreements 
               <br />
               had been arrived at and put in shape. At 
               <br />
               that time, as you all know, there was a 
               <br />
               territorial government established to rule 
               <br />
               that country. Certain agreements had been 
               <br />
               entered into regarding schools by a few 
               <br />
               scattered people in that vast country in 
               <br />
               conjunction with the good Christian mission- 
               <br />
               aries of the Catholic Church, and all praise 
               <br />
               and credit should be given to these pioneers

               Certain agreements were entered into 
               <br />
               with these people at that time, and the ques- 
               <br />
               tion arises whether it is reasonable to sup- 
               <br />
               pose that such agreements should be car- 
               <br />
               ried out for all time. These good people, 
               <br />
               on one part poor ignorant halt-breeds, honest 
               <br />
               and good as they were, in conjunction with 
               <br />
               these worthy pioneers of the Catholic Church 
               <br />
               were then the only people living in that 
               <br />
               country, and I ask in all fairness and sin- 
               <br />
               cerity whether it can be considered reason- 
               <br />
               able that the future generations in that 
               <br />
               country which will be populated by mil- 
               <br />
               lions. should be restricted in their social and 
               <br />
               political and educational life by such an 
               <br />
               agreement. Personally I do not think so; 
               <br />
               I cannot make myself believe any such pro- 
               <br />
               position as that would be reasonable. It 
               <br />
               has been said that this is not a question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               sectarian against national schools, but that 
               <br />
               it is a constitutional question. Well. the 
               <br />
               good God in Heaven if he heard this dis-
