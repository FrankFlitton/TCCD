               <br />
               applicable to the new province the provisions 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act which are 
               <br />
               applicable to the original united provinces, 
               <br />
               so that it might possibly follow from that 
               <br />
               that section 109 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act would apply to the provinces; 
               <br />
               that is to say that all lands, mines and 
               <br />
               minerals and royalties, except as we are now 
               <br />
               making provision for them, might pass to the 
               <br />
               province. My intention is to keep the lands, 
               <br />
               mines. minerals and royalties vested in the
