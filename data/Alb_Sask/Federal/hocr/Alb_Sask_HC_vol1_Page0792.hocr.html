               As I said a few moments ago, I have been

               tion that, during the ten years of my ser- 
               <br />
               vice, we have never had to consider a single 
               <br />
               case where there was a grievance caused 
               <br />

               without heat and without friction. A short 
               <br />
               time ago a question was raised in the city 
               <br />
               of Montreal with reference to the care of 
               <br />
               those suffering from contagious diseases. 
               <br />
               It was found impossible to agree to have a 
               <br />
               common hospital, so it was decided that 
               <br />
               there should be two hospitals, the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic children <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬂfering</span> from measles, 
               <br />
               scariatina and other diseases of that kind, 
               <br />
               to ”be sent to one, and the Protestant child- 
               <br />
               ren similiarly afﬂicted to be sent to another. 
               <br />
               Well What was the result ? Although three- 
               <br />
               quarters of the population of Montreal is 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment, the representatives of the Protestant 
               <br />
               hospitals were given a twenty-ﬁve year con- 
               <br />
               tract at $15,000 a year for taking care of the

               non-Roman Catholic children and others 
               <br />
               who might be aﬂiicted with contagious

               diseases, While the Roman Catholics were 
               <br />
               given $15,000 for a similar term to take care 
               <br />
               of the Roman Catholics Who were taken

               that our privileges will be curtailed—not

               that. The liberties we enjoy in the pro-

               subsection 2 of section 93 provides that

               It has been stated at times in this House 
               <br />
               that there exists much hardship in certain 
               <br />
               regions in the province of Quebec. If I had 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«time</span> I might go into that. But I wish to 
               <br />
               point out brieﬂy that this is not due prim- 
               <br />
               arily to the school system but to a series 
               <br />
               of circumstances of which the school sys- 
               <br />
               tem is but one. Fifty years ago in the eastern 
               <br />
               townships, of every 1,000 of the population, 
               <br />
               658 were English and only 342 were French. 
               <br />
               To-day, of every 1,000, 314 are English and 
               <br />
               686 French. In other words the propor- 
               <br />
               tions of the population in the twelve so- 
               <br />
               called eastern townships is completely re— 
               <br />
               versed. The Protestants were two~thirds of 
               <br />
               the population ﬁfty years ago, to-day they 
               <br />
               are but one-third. It will be readily seen 
               <br />
               that where a population is coming in or go- 
               <br />
               ing out there will be a period when there 
               <br />
               are but few representatives of one class, 
               <br />
               and, at that time, there will be a certain 
               <br />
               degree of hardship. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\So</span> we ﬁnd, from time 
               <br />
               to time, that a school municipality ceases to 
               <br />
               exist. And if you take up the Quebec ‘ Ofﬂ- 
               <br />
               cial Gazette,’ you will ﬁnd obituary notices 
               <br />
               stating that in this or that munici- 
               <br />
               pality the Protestant school has ceased to 
               <br />
               exist. It is sad we all admit it; we hate 
               <br />
               to see the schools die. Yet, as a matter 
               <br />
               of fact, there has been no falling off in the 
               <br />
               number of Protestant elementary schools, 
               <br />
               in fact, they have shown a satisfactory in- 
               <br />
               crease in the last twenty years. There 
               <br />
               were 797 in 1883, 878 in 1893, and 898 in 
               <br />
               1903. But the dying out of schools here and 
               <br />
               there arises from conditions not chargeable 
               <br />
               to the school law, for that law makes every 
               <br />
               effort to keep a dying school alive as long 
               <br />
               as possible. A school can unite with 
               <br />
               its neighbour, or several sections can 
               <br />
               join forces. Or they can consolidate 
               <br />
               the schools and bring the children to- 
               <br />
               gether by means of carriages. It is 
               <br />
               only when it becomes impossible to get 
               <br />
               together enough children to make even 
               <br />
               a small school by uniting the districts that 
               <br />
               a school municipality ceases to exist. And 
               <br />
               before it ceases to exist it must be a year 
               <br />
               without school ; and, at the end of the year 
               <br />
               it must be shown that there is no attempt
