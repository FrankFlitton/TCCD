               field in my county, there is an English 
               <br />
               Protestant college called the Gault Insti- 
               <br />
               tute. In some remarks which I made in 
               <br />
               this House on a previous occasion I ex- 
               <br />
               pressed the idea that there was not much 
               <br />
               religion taught in Protestant schools. I 
               <br />
               had in my mind more than anything else 
               <br />
               nou—sectarian schools. i received imme-

               <br />
               in it and the religious features were marked 
               <br />
               so that I would not overlook them. In

               I do not believe the majority in this 
               <br />
               House are in favour of having no religious 
               <br />
               instruction in schools. I know very well 
               <br />
               the majority of the members from Quebec 
               <br />
               cannot be in favour of that. If you must 
               <br />
               have religion in the school, What kind of 
               <br />
               religion will you have ? What is taught in 
               <br />
               the Gait institute is very good religion, but 
               <br />
               is that the way that French Canadians would 
               <br />
               like their children to be taught in religion ? 
               <br />
               My right hon. friend knows very well they 
               <br />
               would not. More than that, my impression 
               <br />
               is that it-is forbidden by the bishops to let 
               <br />
               the children go to schools where another 
               <br />
               religion is taught. Whether they are right 
               <br />
               or wrong that is the position. and for that 
               <br />
               reason I say that in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories by your amendment you are giving 
               <br />
               what? Schools where no religion at all is 
               <br />
               taught, except that half—hour after school. 
               <br />
               That will be taught in the way I have read 
               <br />
               in the Protestant schools and in another way 
               <br />
               in the Roman Catholic schools, after the 
               <br />
               classes are over. My right hon. friend (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) knows very well that is 
               <br />
               not the spirit of Roman Catholic schools, 
               <br />
               but he will do as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> for Gloucester

               <br />
               to give more, but we cannot do it. Is 
               <br />
               that the way that those who built up this 
               <br />
               country spoke? Is that the way Cartier 
               <br />
               spoke when he wanted to get the Militia 
               <br />
               Bill passed and was threatened with defeat 
               <br />
               in consequence ? He introduced the Bill, he 
               <br />
               was defeated, he brought it on again and 
               <br />
               was returned and carried the Bill, and my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend could have done the same; 
               <br />
               he could have done better than Cartier. he 
               <br />
               could have carried his measure and he 
               <br />
               knows in his heart it is the only measure 
               <br />
               that could be carried that could do justice 
               <br />
               to that minority and not only that but to the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic element in Canada. If my 
               <br />
               hon. friend has done that because he ex-

               pects to have more peace in the future, if he 
               <br />

               <br />
               I wish to refer to an article from a paper 
               <br />
               which I read the other day. There are in 
               <br />
               Quebec some papers which reproduce ex- 
               <br />
               tracts from papers in Ontario m order to in- 
               <br />
               ﬂame the population of our province. This 
               <br />
               practice was deprecated by some hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen opposite last night and I join them in 
               <br />
               that. We have a press which does a great 
               <br />
               deal of harm by reproducing articles from 
               <br />
               papers in Ontario, articles which I do not 
               <br />
               defend but which I think very bad. A 
               <br />
               great many of these papers are not party 
               <br />
               papers, and of course no party can be held 
               <br />
               responsible for their actions. The papers 
               <br />
               I want to speak of are in the same line. I 
               <br />
               have seen it stated that Catholic teaching 
               <br />
               and separate schools had a tendency to dim- 
               <br />
               inish the loyalty of the people. Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, you know better than that. Anybody 
               <br />
               who has read the history of this country 
               <br />
               knows better than that. I will take the 
               <br />
               contrary proposition. I say give to Roman 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholics</span> their schools, treat them as Eng- 
               <br />
               land has treated them after the cession and 
               <br />
               you will have the same results that we have 
               <br />
               seen in the past. In 1875 when the rebels 
               <br />

               <br />
               when they came here and wanted to take 
               <br />
               from England these immense possessions of 
               <br />
               which we are now so proud, who was the 
               <br />
               man of authority who stood by the British 
               <br />

               <br />
               his suasion and inﬂuence? It was Mon-
