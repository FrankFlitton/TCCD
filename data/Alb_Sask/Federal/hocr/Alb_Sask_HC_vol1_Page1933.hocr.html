               quer Court. That is my humble opinion 
               <br />
               and I do not think there is anything in the 
               <br />
               language ot‘ Sir John Thompson which in 
               <br />
               any way is inconsistent with that. It I 
               <br />
               am right in that opinion, which I venture

               <br />
               think we created courts in the Territories

               <br />

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I think there is a 
               <br />
               very distinct line of cleavage between the 
               <br />
               educational privilege in the British North 
               <br />
               America Act and the question of language; 
               <br />
               in fact, with all due deference to my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, I cannot ﬁnd any comparison be- 
               <br />
               tween the two. The British North America 
               <br />
               Act provides in special sections for the 
               <br />
               distribution of legislative power. Section 93 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act makes 
               <br />
               special provision for a code in respect to edu- 
               <br />
               cation applicable to all the provinces of the 
               <br />
               Dominion without any exception whatever. 
               <br />
               The effect of our legislation is to apply that 
               <br />
               code to the new provinces. There is also 
               <br />
               a provision in respect to language. Section 
               <br />
               91 provides for the question of language. 
               <br />
               Section 91 provides that the provinces shall 
               <br />
               deal exclusively with property and civil 
               <br />
               rights which never include language and for 
               <br />
               the organization of the courts. So much is 
               <br />
               that the case, that it was found neces- 
               <br />
               sary to have a special provision to create 
               <br />
               an exception as far as the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec is concerned. That exception is 
               <br />
               created for one province, and that is the 
               <br />
               only province which enjoys this privilege 
               <br />
               with respect to language. That is the situ- 
               <br />
               ation under the Britis North America Act. 
               <br />
               I state it brieﬂy and imperfectly, simply 
               <br />
               because I intend, on the third reading, of this 
               <br />
               I now give notice, to discuss this question at 
               <br />
               that time, which I think is the proper time 
               <br />
               to discuss a matter of this importance.

               <br />
               may understand what my position is. If

               the attitude of the government is based ab-

               solutely on section 93, without any changes 
               <br />
               on account of the supposed compact of 1875, 
               <br />
               I am with them. I have said that before; 
               <br />
               but that does not seem to be the attitude of 
               <br />
               the government. We may perhaps be at 
               <br />
               cross purposes about that; I do not know ; 
               <br />
               but that does not seem to be the position of 
               <br />
               the government, because they have intro- 
               <br />
               duced changes in section 93 depending, as‘ I 
               <br />
               understand it. upon the supposed legislative 
               <br />
               compact contained in the Act of 1875. If 
               <br />
               there is a legislative compact in the Act of 
               <br />
               1875, it does seem to me that there is also 
               <br />
               a legislative compact in the Act of 1877. 
               <br />

               as lands are concerned my position is simple. 
               <br />
               Section 109 simply provides that all lands, 
               <br />
               mines, minerals and royalties belonging to 
               <br />
               the several provinces shall continue to be- 
               <br />
               long to them.

               <br />
               does not deal with legislative jurisdiction, 
               <br />
               but with proprietary rights. Section 92 
               <br />
               gives to the provinces power to deal with 
               <br />
               their lands, but whether they own the lands
