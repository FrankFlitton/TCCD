               That is the answer I give to the state- 
               <br />
               ment of the First Minister, and that is why 
               <br />
               I say we ought not to do the same thing in 
               <br />
               a country which is, new and being rapidly 
               <br />
               settled. In such a country we shoud avoid 
               <br />
               the mistakes committed in the past. For 
               <br />
               that reason 1 am supporting what I believe 
               <br />
               to be a national school system. Forty years 
               <br />
               ago we had church schools and pay schools 
               <br />
               and we had no public or free schools. Our 
               <br />
               educational system then was very poor. 
               <br />
               and We adopted the national school system 
               <br />
               because we believed it to be better than the 
               <br />
               other. and upon trial we found it a great 
               <br />
               improvement and extended it by degrees 
               <br />
               until we have it practically enforced 
               <br />
               throughout the province to-day. Shall we 
               <br />
               ever go back to these church and parochial 
               <br />
               schools ? Protestants never will because 
               <br />
               they prefer the national system and because 
               <br />
               they think it is the duty of the state to see 
               <br />
               that every child is educated. They have no 
               <br />
               desire to have religion taught in the schools 
               <br />
               but are content to leave that to the churches. 
               <br />
               The sentiment of the 19th and 20th century 
               <br />
               is in favour of that system. The enlighten— 
               <br />
               ed, intelligent civilization of to-day recog- 
               <br />
               nizes that fact, and that policy is being car- 
               <br />
               ried out the world over. Are we going back 
               <br />
               to what has been discarded in the past? 
               <br />
               We are. told <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> that public sentiment is

               We are told that separate schools work 
               <br />
               satisfactorily. I need hardly refer to that 
               <br />
               question. The trend of the age is in favour 
               <br />
               of national schools. The educational system 
               <br />
               of Canada to-day is entirely different from 
               <br />
               what it was when the schools were sectar- 
               <br />
               ian and pay schools. They are new national 
               <br />
               and non—sectarian and we want to keep 
               <br />
               them so. But a comparison is made with 
               <br />
               regard to the prevalence of crime in coun- 
               <br />
               tries where there are separate schools com- 
               <br />
               pared with those where the‘natioual public 
               <br />
               school ﬂourishes. It seemed to me that was 
               <br />
               a most unfortunate comparison. Can the 
               <br />
               comparison be said to be a fair one between 
               <br />
               Canada and the United States? No. But 
               <br />
               take the provinces that have no separate 
               <br />
               schools and compare them with those that 
               <br />
               have. Did the right hon. gentleman do that? 
               <br />
               Not at all. I however have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> the troube 
               <br />
               to look up the statistics and I ﬁnd that there 
               <br />
               is practically no difference. Take Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Is- 
               <br />
               land, British Columbia and Manitoba. and 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd practically there is no difference as 
               <br />
               regards the prevalence of crime between 
               <br />
               these provinces and the provinces of Ontario 
               <br />
               and Quebec. But the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               pointed to the United States and asked how 
               <br />
               we were to account for the prevalence in 
               <br />
               that country of divorces. Surely that is not 
               <br />
               due to the absence of separate schools. Why 
               <br />
               did he not show that the application for 
               <br />
               divorces from these provinces which have 
               <br />
               not separate schools are larger than those 
               <br />
               which have. The reason is evident. I 
               <br />
               looked into that question and I found no 
               <br />
               evidence ’of any difference so that the com- 
               <br />
               parison between Canada and the United 
               <br />
               States is not a fair one. I have said that 
               <br />
               the trend of the age is in favour of national 
               <br />
               schools. They are to be found in Mexico, 
               <br />
               Bolivia, in most of the South American 
               <br />
               republics, Venezuela, Equador, France, Italy,
