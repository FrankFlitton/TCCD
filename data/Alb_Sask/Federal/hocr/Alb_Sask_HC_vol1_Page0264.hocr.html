               I see that the hour is getting late and 
               <br />
               I do not desire to trespass too much upon 
               <br />
               the time of this House, but there are cer—

               only have to appeal to the indulgence of 
               <br />
               the House and point to the fact that there

               There are certain other important features 
               <br />
               in this Bill to which I wish to refer. There 
               <br />
               is ﬁrst the placing of the boundary line 
               <br />
               at the fourth meridian. A few days ago 
               <br />
               I called attention to a resolution passed at 
               <br />
               a public meeting in the town of Medicine 
               <br />
               Hat which pointed out the objections to this

               that the dividing line should be sixty miles 
               <br />

               To—day we are in this position that there

               gentleman is only half in. And the result 
               <br />
               of having no man in the cabinet charged 
               <br />
               with the supervision of the task of dividing

               that country has been that local interests 
               <br />
               have been allowed to prevail. The boun-

               mains to-day in the eastern province, and 
               <br />
               the danger will be that the ranching indus-

               in the cast, but it is very important to the

               west. The other day it was pointed out.

               <br />

               of drawing this line and so splitting up 
               <br />
               the ranching country will be a conﬂict 
               <br />
               of brands. One province may or may 
               <br />
               not enact a branding law. One province 
               <br />
               may declare that cattle and horses not 
               <br />
               branded may be sold irrespective of the 
               <br />
               owner, and you will have a conﬂict in that 
               <br />
               way, whereas if the line Went a little bit 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iteiüor</span> says it should go, that difﬁculty 
               <br />
               would not arise and you would include

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically</span> all the ranching country in the
