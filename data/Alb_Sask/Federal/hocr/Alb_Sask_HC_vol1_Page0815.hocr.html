               <br />

               <br />
               Manitoba entered the confederation , in 
               <br />

               once been rejected, in 1894, by the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice, Sir John Thompson ? How could 
               <br />
               we banish all apprehensions for the future, 
               <br />
               when we have these facts fresh in our 
               <br />
               minds, facts which are recorded in history 
               <br />
               and which are part of that series of griev- 
               <br />
               ances to which our race has been subjected. 
               <br />
               For we are not making any mistake about 
               <br />
               it. The reason for giving to the legislatures 
               <br />
               of the new provinces absolute control over 
               <br />
               the school system is not, in my opinion, a 
               <br />
               desire to comply with the constitution. It is 
               <br />
               because certain bigoted persons fear lest 
               <br />
               the Catholic religion should be taught in 
               <br />
               the schools, and lest our tongue and in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence should spread.
