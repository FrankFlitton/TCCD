               So far as the subject I introduced to the

               attention of the House this afternoon is 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               myself in that regard have been very good. 
               <br />
               and I think he will do me the justice of 
               <br />
               saying that I have taken pains, sometimes 
               <br />
               even when I thought they were unnecessary, 
               <br />

               <br />
               I might have supposed that. if he in-

               tended to make the extended remarks he

               So far as the question at issue is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, the debate has wandered consider- 
               <br />
               ably from the point at which it started. 
               <br />
               I do not know that I could usefully add 
               <br />
               anything to what I said this afternoon. 1 
               <br />
               endeavoured to express the views that I 
               <br />
               hold in a temperate and moderate man- 
               <br />
               ner ; and, without any idea of fomenting re— 
               <br />
               ligious discord or race prejudice, I brought 
               <br />
               the subject to the attention of the House and 
               <br />
               drew certain inferences which, in my judg- 
               <br />
               ment were well founded, but which, are 
               <br />
               matters of judgment and opinion. These 
               <br />
               were very strongly controverted by my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend in the remarks he addressed to 
               <br />
               the House. I have no fault to ﬁnd With the 
               <br />
               tone of his remarks or with the challenge 
               <br />
               he threw out. It may be that the right

               hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman’s</span> prophesy will prove 4201'-

               rect: If this question ever does come as 
               <br />
               a direct issue before the people, the course 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman has taken may be 
               <br />
               found, in the judgment of the people, to have 
               <br />
               been a wise, prudent, and constitutional 
               <br />
               course. I greatly doubt it. So far as I am 
               <br />
               concerned, if that verdict is given, I shall 
               <br />
               be perfectly willing to accept it. For the 
               <br />
               present, the only thing that remains for me 
               <br />
               to say is that whether the verdict of the 
               <br />
               people shall be as the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               prophesies or not, I shall have no word 
               <br />
               to withdraw from those which I have spoken 
               <br />
               on this subject to—day.
