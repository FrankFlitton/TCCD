               law upon this subject and makes it to appear

               that in the whole of the states of the Union 
               <br />
               there is no instance of general exemption from 
               <br />
               taxation. There may be one or two isolated 
               <br />
               cases in particular states of partial and tem-

               <br />
               general rule of almost universal application is 
               <br />
               that there is no exemption in one form or 
               <br />
               another from taxation. The instances which

               places in Minnesota and Wisconsin, are in- 
               <br />
               stances of exemption from taxation by one

               <br />
               is imposed in lieu of other taxes, and it may 
               <br />
               be that this is the fairest mode of taxation. 
               <br />
               Some hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> have said that it is of 
               <br />
               very little consequence, that the road-bed is 
               <br />
               taxed very lightly in Ontario, that some of our 
               <br />
               legislatures have declined to tax <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hallway</span> com— 
               <br />
               panies at all. But what kind of railway com- 
               <br />
               panies were these? They were railways built 
               <br />
               by private capital, and were not paying interest 
               <br />
               on their investments. I do not say that a rule. 
               <br />
               of this kind does not apply to a railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> is 
               <br />
               built at public charge and that is given a mon-

               <br />

               <br />
               it lasts for ever; no matter how bloated this 
               <br />
               cooperation may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">become;</span> no matter how magni-

               <br />
               tion. In considering that, you have to look at 
               <br />
               the general result of taxation. Some of the 
               <br />
               United States railways you ﬁnd paying a tax of 
               <br />
               $300 or $400 per annum, and $600 or $800 per 
               <br />
               annum is paid as taxes by the English railways. 
               <br />
               You ﬁnd, therefore, that the possibilities of 
               <br />
               railway taxation are very great. You ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               Illinois Central Railway paying almost the 
               <br />
               whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">empenses</span> of the government of that state,

               <br />
               its property, its stock, or its capital. I'say 
               <br />
               that I can well conceive a time when a. tax on 
               <br />
               the gross receipts of railways might be a very 
               <br />
               satisfactory tax and a very satisfactory source 
               <br />
               A tax for trans- 
               <br />
               portation would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apparently</span> be a very equal 
               <br />
               taxation, and if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> necessity arose of adding 
               <br />
               to the revenue, it is quite possible that we 
               <br />
               mlight wish to avail ourselves of such a tax. 
               <br />
               There is another point in which this exemption 
               <br />
               is objectionable. it places this company in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position</span> of a monopoly by itself, because it 
               <br />
               places at a disadvantage all competitors who

               are to raise the funds themselves to build‘their 
               <br />
               railways. The contract requires perpetual ex- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">emption,</span> the other offer does not demand any ex- 
               <br />
               emption at all. Choose! The choice is yours! 
               <br />
               Take the penpotuad exemption in the contract 
               <br />
               or take the liability to taxation in the offer. 
               <br />
               Yours is the choice ; for it you will be held re- 
               <br />
               sponsible. Then the contract provides that the 
               <br />
               land grant shall be exempt from taxation for 
               <br />
               twenty years, unless sold or occupied from the 
               <br />
               date of the grant. The money galin to the com-

               <br />
               that. There can be no doubt but that the 
               <br />
               burdens which this company are freed from 
               <br />
               are most serious. Hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               have said so. Theyhave said they could not 
               <br />
               use this land grant otherwise, that nobody 
               <br />
               would buy if they supposed the syndicate was 
               <br />
               to be subjected to the same taxes as the rest 
               <br />
               of the world. They get the choice of land and 
               <br />
               they are not to pay the same taxes as the rest 
               <br />
               of the community. Why should they not ? Is 
               <br />
               it because .they get a large proﬁt ? Because 
               <br />
               they are getting altogether four prices for 
               <br />
               building the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«prairie</span> section, that, therefore, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> are to be untaxed and free ? Then the in- 
               <br />
               direct aoss is still greater by this mode of set- 
               <br />
               tlement, by the burdens it imposes on the ad-
