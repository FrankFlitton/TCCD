               tion to get a leader. If those gentlemen who 
               <br />
               sing the song of Ontario so smoothly think 
               <br />
               their province is the premier one, how is it

               <br />
               All this excitement, all this religious 
               <br />
               ﬂame that my hon. friend speaks about, 
               <br />
               comes from the allegation that the claim 
               <br />
               of the province of Manitoba to have its 
               <br />
               boundaries enlarged was not conceded by 
               <br />
               the Dominion government the moment it 
               <br />
               was asserted, because there was inter- 
               <br />
               ference from the Papal ablegate in this 
               <br />
               country. That is the charge in a nutshell, 
               <br />
               and I want to examine it for a moment. 
               <br />
               The attitude assumed by our friends from 
               <br />
               Manitoba is a most dictatorial one. With- 
               <br />
               out saying a word with regard to the fines- 
               <br />
               tion of having an enlargement_of their 
               <br />
               boundaries for a long period of years, they 
               <br />
               suddenly woke up on the 16th of January 
               <br />
               last and said they wanted to have their 
               <br />
               boundaries extended west, north and east, 
               <br />
               cutting into one province, asuming a large 
               <br />
               portion of territory in another, and taking 
               <br />
               out of the new provinces to be constructed 
               <br />
               a third portion of territory. They want to 
               <br />
               have it done right away, not a moment of 
               <br />
               hesitation. No interests are to be _con- 
               <br />
               sidered, even the interests of the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario are to be disregarded, and I 
               <br />
               assume that the hon. member for South 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) is one of those 
               <br />
               who agree with the proposition that although 
               <br />
               Premier Whitney may think they have some 
               <br />
               claims, yet they are not to be considered 
               <br />
               at all by this coterie of politicians that 
               <br />
               happen to be in charge and who are just 
               <br />
               now demanding it. Let me say, as coming 
               <br />
               from one of the smaller provinces of the 
               <br />
               Dominion, that they also have a right to 
               <br />
               be considered in regard to this subject. The 
               <br />
               legislature of the province of New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick, minor in size, though important as a 
               <br />
               factor in the confederation, no later than 
               <br />
               a month ago passed a strong resolution in 
               <br />
               which they represented to the federal gov- 
               <br />
               ernment that on this question of the accre- 
               <br />
               tion of the provinces the rights of the smal- 
               <br />
               ler provinces should be considered. We 
               <br />
               hear about Manitoba being a postage stamp 
               <br />
               on the map. Well, we who come from 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, although it may be a postage 
               <br />
               stamp on the map, we come as one of the 
               <br />
               partners in this confederation, and we say 
               <br />
               that we have the same interest as New 
               <br />

               <br />
               that the province of ;New Brunswick, through 
               <br />

               the province of Manitoba the_premier has 
               <br />
               been negotiating for some time with Arch—

               bishop Langevin in regard to the postion of 
               <br />
               separate schools in that province. It is evi-

               <br />
               the Papal ablegate. These negotiations 
               <br />
               were initiated by the Manitoba government 
               <br />
               some time ago and Mr. Campbell, the At- 
               <br />
               torney General of Manitoba, had an inter-

               view with the Papal ablegate with regard 
               <br />
               to this question. Were they initiated by 
               <br />
               this government, or even at the suggestion 
               <br />

               member of the Manitoba government do not

               contain the faintest suggestion that these

               negotiations were initiated by any member 
               <br />
               of this government. On the contrary, we 
               <br />
               have the fact stated that the Attorney 
               <br />
               General of Manitoba consulted with the 
               <br />

               <br />
               serted and not denied that negotiations 
               <br />
               have been going on for a long time between
