               <br />
               limitation contained in that section, I have

               stitutional capacity to do it under the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish North America Act of 1871. If my hon. 
               <br />
               friend takes the trouble to look up the 
               <br />
               opinion of so eminent a predecessor of his 
               <br />
               own as Sir John Thompson, he will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that Sir John Thompson expresses the same 
               <br />
               opinion. I think there can hardly be any 
               <br />
               doubt Whatever that we can and should 
               <br />
               exercise that power. But, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               if there were any doubt about it; if we 
               <br />
               passed this Act in acordance with our own 
               <br />
               judgment and our own discretion, giving 
               <br />
               these provinces such a constitution as we in 
               <br />
               our judgment think they ought to have by 
               <br />
               making a change in section 93, and there 
               <br />
               were any remote doubt about the constitu- 
               <br />
               tionality of that; is it not perfectly clear 
               <br />
               that all the Prime Minister would have to 
               <br />
               do would be as was done in the case of the 
               <br />
               Manitoba Act get a conﬁrming Act from the 
               <br />
               imperial parliament. There would not be 
               <br />
               any diﬂiculty about it, and if there were the 
               <br />
               least doubt that is the course that should be 
               <br />
               adopted.

               Now, Mr. Speaker, if there is any doubt 
               <br />
               about our power, I say that in fact nobody 
               <br />
               else but us can deal with it. We are here as 
               <br />
               the only possible constitutional body to deal 
               <br />
               with this question upon its merits. Does 
               <br />
               any one imagine that the imperial parlia- 
               <br />
               ment is going to discuss this question and 
               <br />
               undertake to settle it upon its merits ? 
               <br />
               Then, who is going to settle it upon its 
               <br />
               merits? The imperial parliament would 
               <br />
               never do that, they would deal with it as 
               <br />
               we recommended; they would say : you are 
               <br />
               the governing body; possibly technically 
               <br />
               you may not have enough power given you 
               <br />
               by the Act of 1871, but if you have not we 
               <br />
               will give it to you; it is your business, 
               <br />
               settle it as you see fit. And Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               that is the only way it can be settled. We 
               <br />
               are unquestionably in the position of being 
               <br />
               the only body that can ever dealwith the 
               <br />
               merits of this case. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">

               <br />
               be: it would be that the province ought 
               <br />
               to be left entirely free to deal with its own 
               <br />

               amount of doubt about it I would strike out

               two propositions. We have the principle 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act to apply. 
               <br />
               The leader of the government and myself 
               <br />
               can agree that we ought to apply the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, but as to the particular way 
               <br />
               in which we are to apply that principle we 
               <br />
               do not agree. But we ought to apply the 
               <br />
               principle, and when we come to the ques-

               tion : h0w are we to apply it, we come up

               against two separate and distinct and irre— 
               <br />
               concilable propositions. From my stand- 
               <br />
               point <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I~</span> say: inasmuch as the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories are not a constitutionally free

               community; inasmuch as the ordinances 
               <br />
               passed are ordinances passed under a special 
               <br />
               and limited power; therefore when they
