               struck me that the words ‘so appointed’ 
               <br />

               <br />
               other expression as, ‘appointed to such ofﬁce’ 
               <br />
               because ‘so appointed’ should refer to some 
               <br />
               previous words concerning appointment, but 
               <br />
               there is no previous expression of that kind.

               <br />

               provinces, at least, prothonotaries have no

               Mr. FIELDING. The drafting of the Bill

               in trust funds is that 50 per cent is the

               Mr. FIELDING. The practice in previ-

               Mr. BR‘ODEUR. It is very important
