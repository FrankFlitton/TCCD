               <br />
               also been the practice, and is it so considered

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tention</span> was not to carry it out ? No. The 
               <br />
               only reason why it has not been carried out 
               <br />
               is, that the minister being absent one of his 
               <br />
               clerks formally asked the Department of 
               <br />
               Justice to prepare a contract. 
               <br />
               had been decided on because the McGregor 
               <br />
               Company had been informed that their ten- 
               <br />
               der would be accepted, and then all that 
               <br />
               was necessary was a form of contract which 
               <br />
               the oﬁicial of the Interior Department ap- 
               <br />
               plied to the Department of Justice to make 
               <br />
               out. And it was only when the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice in looking at the contract came to 
               <br />
               the conclusion that the work did not belong 
               <br />
               to the Interior Department at all but to the 
               <br />
               Department of Public Works, that he drew

               <br />
               matter. We want, and we ought to have, all 
               <br />

               <br />
               I have no doubt the Prime Minister will 
               <br />
               bring down at once all the papers inconnec-

               the ministers of the different departments 
               <br />
               have power or have taken to themselves the 
               <br />
               power of entering into contracts for public

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. There is one 
               <br />
               thing in which I can agree with my hon. 
               <br />

               this subject. I think all the papers should 
               <br />
               be brought down, and they will be brought 
               <br />

               Mr. W. F. MACLE-AN. Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               there is another aspect of this question that 
               <br />
               has not been brought out. This is an in- 
               <br />
               ternational question: we are dealing with 
               <br />
               an international issue, and I do not think 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman can give a single 
               <br />
               precedent for any action being taken con- 
               <br />
               cerning an international boundary without 
               <br />
               consulting parliament. _ With regard to the 
               <br />
               boundary posts between the United Sates 
               <br />
               and Canada, a commission was appointed, 
               <br />
               parliament was consulted, congress was con- 
               <br />
               sulted, and a joint arrangement was reach- 
               <br />
               ed; and if an international boundary fence 
               <br />
               was to be erected, it would certainly be good 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial policy to consult with the adjoin- 
               <br />
               ing party as “to the style of the fence and 
               <br />
               as to a division of the cost. That is the 
               <br />
               way farmers deal with each other when 
               <br />
               they want to build a boundary fence be— 
               <br />
               tween their farms. I would like to ask 
               <br />
               the Postmaster General, who represents a 
               <br />
               farmers’ riding, and the Minister of Agr'- 
               <br />
               culture, who is supposed to conserve the in-
