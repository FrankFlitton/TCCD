               is the party which is responsible for 
               <br />
               them. The Liberal party contested it 
               <br />
               then and has contested it ever since, 
               <br />
               continuously, honestly and thoroughly. If 
               <br />
               they are doing what hon. gentlemen think is 
               <br />
               a different thing now they are doing what in

               their opinion it is necessary to do in order 
               <br />
               to keep faith with the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. The hon. gentleman who 
               <br />
               has just taken his seat (Mr. Kemp) said that 
               <br />
               the Postmaster General expressed himself 
               <br />
               as against the principle of separate schools 
               <br />
               and I venture to say he did. It is a liberal 
               <br />
               doctrine, it always has been a Liberal doc- 
               <br />
               trine that it was not necessary to have a 
               <br />
               separate school system in this country. But 
               <br />
               separate schools were established and as 
               <br />
               long as we have sectarian teaching in the 
               <br />
               schools it will be necessary to have separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools. Whether or not it is a wise 
               <br />
               thing to have religious teaching in the 
               <br />
               schools other than the reading of the Bible 
               <br />
               is a moot question and need not enter into 
               <br />
               this discussion. We have the separate school 
               <br />
               system engrafted on our constitution, it is 
               <br />
               a part of our system and we must carry out 
               <br />
               that principle honestly and fairly as between 
               <br />
               ourselves and the people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               who are now interested in this matter. Why 
               <br />
               is it necessary that this legislation in re- 
               <br />
               lation to separate schools should be enacted 
               <br />

               <br />

               right to their denominational schools if such

               <br />
               For myself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\I</span> cannot see and I doubt if any 
               <br />
               other man can possibly intelligently argue 
               <br />
               that when these provinces are brought into 
               <br />
               the Dominion they do not come in under the 
               <br />
               provisions of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               and that under the provisions of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act they are not entitled to 
               <br />
               all the rights and privileges which at the 
               <br />
               time of their entrance to the union they 
               <br />
               enjoy in regard to denominational schools. 
               <br />
               It has been argued that the word ‘union’ 
               <br />
               in section 93 refers to the union of the origi- 
               <br />
               nal provinces. It did no doubt refer, so far 
               <br />
               as the expression in subsection 1 of section 
               <br />
               93 went, to the union of the original pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, but I say that under section 146 
               <br />
               outside and outlying territories are to 
               <br />
               come in subject to the provisions of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act and 
               <br />
               to the provisions of section 93 of that 
               <br />
               Act as well as all its subsections. Thus I 
               <br />
               think speaking for myself that it was not at 
               <br />
               all necessary in so far as the rights of the 
               <br />
               minority in the Northwest Territories are 
               <br />
               concerned to introduce into this Bill section 
               <br />
               16 at all. If these provinces had simply been 
               <br />

               Mr. GERMAN. The hon. gentleman says 
               <br />
               that is all he wants but he goes further 
               <br />
               than that. The amendment includes the 
               <br />
               power : to exclusively make laws in relation 
               <br />
               to education. The leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               is introducing into his amendment what I 
               <br />
               think is quite ultra vires of this parliament, 
               <br />
               an attempt to cut off from the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest the rights which they would enjOy 
               <br />
               under the British North America Act. He is 
               <br />
               saying that we will curtail the rights that 
               <br />
               you will have under the‘British North Am- 
               <br />
               erica Act by asserting in this Bill that you 
               <br />
               shall have full powers of provincial self— 
               <br />
               government including education, the right to 
               <br />
               exclusively make laws in relation to edu- 
               <br />
               cation. So it is by reason of the latter part 
               <br />
               of his amendment that I absolutely object 
               <br />
               to his amendment. I think the provinces 
               <br />
               have the right to all the privileges which 
               <br />
               they enjoy at the present and what is this 
               <br />
               parliament doing ? It is simply conﬁrming 
               <br />
               the law which exists in those Territories to- 
               <br />
