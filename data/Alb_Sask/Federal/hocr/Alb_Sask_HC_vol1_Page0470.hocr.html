               to do with this any more than any other

               can result. If the Prime Minister is

               coercion——l think that is the proper term to

               use in relation to this clause—coercion is not

               transgresses the principle of provincial 
               <br />
               rights at the very outset. This is not good 
               <br />
               legislation, as I shall prove from the Prime

               Minister’s own lips. It interferes with the

               tion of coercion there stands another issue. 
               <br />
               The Prime Minister has instructed the 
               <br />
               House on some of the principles of the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic religion ; he has told us that 
               <br />
               in addition to the pure question of religion 
               <br />
               there is the great question of dogma which 
               <br />
               enters into the notion of those that hold that 
               <br />
               faith. With the question of religion, with 
               <br />
               the relationship existing between a man’s 
               <br />
               conscience and his God I have nothing to 
               <br />
               do. I never allowed any other man to in- 
               <br />
               terfere in the relationship existing between 
               <br />
               my conscience and my God, and I never in- 
               <br />
               sulted any man by interfering with him in 
               <br />
               that respect. But in relation of the question 
               <br />
               of dogma, that is the business end of the 
               <br />
               proposition, and when any church corpor-

               <br />
               Presbyterian or any other—just the same 
               <br />
               as any railway corporation comes before the 
               <br />
               people of this country for legislation, it is 
               <br />
               the bounden duty of every man who com— 
               <br />

               <br />
               not 011 the sentimental issue, not to bow

               the basis of what is right and what is
