               The First Minister asked Mr. Haultain if he 
               <br />
               had any suggestion to make with regard

               <br />
               pose any plan to the First Minister. What 
               <br />
               then was the government to do? Mr. Haul-

               Mr. LAKE. After listening to all the

               details of this meeting which we have

               <br />
               this is what took place. A conference was 
               <br />
               certainly called by Mr. Haultain, but ap- 
               <br />
               parently, after a great deal of talk, no de- 
               <br />
               cision was come to. Then after all the 
               <br />
               Conservatives had withdrawn—at any rate 
               <br />

               Western Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) moved this 
               <br />
               formal motion ? By whom was that re-

               jected ? Evidently by the Liberal members 
               <br />
               from the Territories in that meeting. That 
               <br />
               conference was held in room 48, the room 
               <br />

               <br />

               hon. member for Western Assiniboia (Mr. 
               <br />
               Scott) moved a resolution in accordance 
               <br />
               with the wishes of his chief, that there 
               <br />
               should be a conference held by the members 
               <br />
               of the Territories. That formal motion was 
               <br />
               rejected and rejected by his own friends. 
               <br />
               He did not even get a seconder.

               touched the main part of it, and that is: 
               <br />
               Who did this carving up? Who chalked out 
               <br />
               these tidings? We have heard that a con- 
               <br />
               ference was held, but, to quote a great 
               <br />
               biblical authority, ‘the voice is the voice of 
               <br />
               Jacob, but the hand is the hand of Esau.’ 
               <br />
               This map has been carved out in a most 
               <br />
               wonderful way to suit the views of these 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen who support the hon. min- 
               <br />
               ister from Edmonton. That hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has failed to do justice to the population, 
               <br />
               because the list he has furnished shows 
               <br />
               that there are as many as three in one con- 
               <br />
               stituency to one in another. Surely it 
               <br />
               cities are to be considered great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">centres,’</span> 
               <br />
               such cities as Calgary and Edmonton, with 
               <br />
               5,000 of a population each, cannot be called 
               <br />
               great urban centres. It is nonsense to talk 
               <br />
               of a hive being created in a district which 
               <br />
               does not contain 5,000 people. To say that 
               <br />
               those people are not as well educated or 
               <br />
               intelligent and should not have as much to 
               <br />
               say in the conduct of public affairs as those 
               <br />
               in the surrounding county is absurd. Even 
               <br />
               admitting that Montreal and Toronto should 
               <br />
               not be represented according to their popu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lation—and</span> I am not saying that they are 
               <br />
               not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entitled,</span> to more liberal representation—- 
               <br />
               such small cities as Edmonton and Calgary 
               <br />
               cannot be considered great centres of popu- 
               <br />
               lation. The hon. member for Western 
               <br />
               Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) has said that these 
               <br />
               half-breeds are the best entitled to vote of 
               <br />
               any people in the district. They are, he 
               <br />
               says, natives. Let me tell him that they 
               <br />
               are only half-breeds and that the natives of 
               <br />
               the country are the Indians; and who de- 
               <br />
               prived the Indians of the franchise so far 
               <br />
               as they had it? It was not this side <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of“</span> 
               <br />
               the House. We gave the Indians the tran- 
               <br />
               chise the hon. gentleman says the natives 
               <br />
               should have. The native then is the Indian 
               <br />
               and the half-breed is only a half native, ac- 
               <br />
               cording to that reasoning, and therefore you 
               <br />
               are giving to the half what you refuse to 
               <br />
               the whole. And in that respect the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman is certainly putting himself in 
               <br />
               the hole. I see by this division that the 
               <br />
               district of Calgary had upwards of 2,000 
               <br />
               voters at the last election who voted. There 
               <br />
               are 2,682 on the list and 2,052 voted, Where- 
               <br />
               as in some of the districts named there 
               <br />
               are much less. In Stony Plain there are 
               <br />
               only 584, or a difference of nearly 375 per 
               <br />
               cent. You have four in Calgary to one in 
               <br />
               Stony Piain. Surely the hon. minister will 
               <br />
               not pretend that an inhabitant of Stony 
               <br />
               Plain is worth four times one in Calgary. 
               <br />
               I am not as conversant with the country as 
               <br />
