               or the policy laid down in the redrafted Bill. 
               <br />
               is the correct one for us to pursue. The 
               <br />

               <br />
               the time being is Postmaster General of 
               <br />
               Canada—we do not know how soon he will 
               <br />
               resign when he gets to understand this 
               <br />
               educational clause ; he does not understand 
               <br />
               it yet. The Postmaster General told us 
               <br />
               that none of the statutes admitting new 
               <br />
               provinces into the confederation were alike. 
               <br />
               He told us that Ontario and Quebec had 
               <br />
               separate schools. but that in the case of New 
               <br />

               Island and British Columbia separate schools 
               <br />
               were not established by law. I have here 
               <br />
               the statute under which Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island was admitted into the Dominion, and 
               <br />
               that statute is silent on the question of 
               <br />
               separate schools. But the Postmaster General 
               <br />
               did not tell us why it is silent. If there is 
               <br />
               anything in the argument of the government 
               <br />
               it must be: that the province of Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island - was not entitled to 
               <br />
               have separate schools unless the Act 
               <br />
               gave power to establish such schools in that 
               <br />
               province. The logical result of the argu- 
               <br />
               ment of the government is, that the Prince

               Edward Island Act being silent on the ques—
