               As a matter or fact one _ of the reasons

               <br />
               to recognize Canadian certiﬁcates is that 
               <br />
               in Canada there are various certiﬁcates, and

               <br />
               answer was: If you will recognize Cana-

               Mr. FISHER. The ﬁrst .point is with 
               <br />
               regard to the recognition of our certiﬁcates 
               <br />
               to entitle an animal to exhibition as a 
               <br />
               thoroughbred. I think that that would fol- 
               <br />
               low the recognition of our certiﬁcates by 
               <br />
               the customs authorities. I may say how- 
               <br />
               ever that the United States exhibition 
               <br />
               authorities have recognized our certiﬁcates. 
               <br />
               At the St. Louis exhibition last year, ani- 
               <br />
               mals that were registered in the herd books 
               <br />
               were accepted as thoroughbreds and allowed 
               <br />
               to compete. We could not however get free 
               <br />
               entry of those animals for sale. That is a 
               <br />
               question of customs over which the exhibi- 
               <br />
               tion authorities have no control. They re— 
               <br />
               ferred the matter to the customs authorities. 
               <br />
               and these authorities applied their ordinary 
               <br />
               rule which does not recognize Canadian 
               <br />
               certiﬁcates of registration. The conse-

               quence was that any animal exhibited at

               of the House while I take up its attention 
               <br />
               for a short time. I listened last night with 
               <br />
               pleasure to the speech from another young 
               <br />
               member of the House (Mr. Lalor), and while 
               <br />
               I congratulate him on the excellent address 
               <br />
               he made as his maiden effort. I was very 
               <br />
               much astonished at some "of his remarks. 
               <br />
               Indeed I thought that he skated around 
               <br />
               the question very carefully; and I noticed 
               <br />
               in the past few days an inclination among 
               <br />
               members opposite to sail all around the 
               <br />
               subject and not face it as it should be faced. 
               <br />
               I would refer, in the ﬁrst place, to the 
               <br />
               speech of the hon. member for Calgary 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy) in which he challenged the 
               <br />
               government to open up a constituency in 
               <br />
               the west and appeal to the people to elect 
               <br />
               its Minister of the Interior. You will notice 
               <br />
               in that speech that he almost tells us that 
               <br />
               if the government had courage enough to 
               <br />
               place this matter before the country he 
               <br />
               would have very little objection to the Bill 
               <br />
               afterwards; that is, if any member from 
               <br />
               the west was appointed Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior and was elected by his constituents. 
               <br />
               I am sorry he is not in his place to-day. and 
               <br />
               I am sorry to say that that good looking 
               <br />
               young man has not been in his place since 
               <br />

               Mr. T. MARTIN. I only said that I had

               not seen him and I have not seen him here 
               <br />
               in the House. The hon. member for South 
               <br />
               York (Mr. W. F. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vMacleau)</span> has made several 
               <br />
               speeches, one particularly, challenging the 
               <br />
               government to appoint a Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior and to go to the country, to open any 
               <br />
               constituency in the west and elect a minister 
               <br />

               month that courageous gentleman’s chair has 
               <br />
               also been vacant. I call attention to the 
               <br />
               fact that even the shepherd of the ﬂock, the 
               <br />
               member for Leeds (Mr. Taylor) has made 
               <br />
               some statements in this House that I think 
               <br />
               are worth calling the attention of the House 
               <br />
               to. He said :
