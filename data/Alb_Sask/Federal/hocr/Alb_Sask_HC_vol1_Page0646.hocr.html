               Mr. EMMERSON. What I stated was 
               <br />
               that we proposed to acquire running rights 
               <br />
               over this railroad. I apprehend that my 
               <br />
               hon. friend would not deem that an impos— 
               <br />
               sibility ; because to-day, under running rights 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway runs over the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway between St. John and 
               <br />
               Halifax. In this instance arrangements 
               <br />
               could be made not inimical to the interests 
               <br />
               of the country and certainly not inimical to 
               <br />
               the interests of the maritime ports. our 
               <br />
               great object is not only to have cheap and 
               <br />
               expeditious transportation, but to have that 
               <br />
               transportation to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maritime</span> seaports in 
               <br />
               winter particularly, and through the St. 
               <br />
               Lawrence route in summer. The details of 
               <br />
               the Bill on the order paper will come up for 
               <br />
