               Well, Sir, is there any doubt that the law

               <br />

               (Page 2014). It is very much to be regretted 
               <br />
               that men who call thmselves liberal have 
               <br />
               thought ﬁt to abolish separate schools in Maui- 
               <br />
               toba, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">use,</span> of the French language. But 
               <br />
               there is one thing in that connection which 
               <br />
               affords me great pleasure, and that is that when 
               <br />
               the Manitoba government proclaimed that pol— 
               <br />
               icy, all the Catholic Liberals in Manitoba rose 
               <br />
               as one man to protest against it. And those 
               <br />
               who had portfolios in that government resigned 
               <br />
               their positions. Do we see the same thing to- 
               <br />
               day in the federal government ? Do we see the 
               <br />
               French Canadian members of the cabinet re- 
               <br />
               signing their seats When they ﬁnd the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of which they are members abolishing 
               <br />
               separate schools in the Northwest ? No ; there 
               <br />
               is no danger. It is true that Martin the Lib- 
               <br />
               eral, has abolished separate schools in Maui- 
               <br />
               toba; but the French members of the Maui- 
               <br />
               toba government resigned when that was done. 
               <br />
               Here we see the-federal government virtually 
               <br />
               abolishing the separate schools of the North- 
               <br />
               west, and, at the same time, we see the French 
               <br />
               Canadian members keeping their seats in the 
               <br />
               cabinet, and, consequently, approving what the 
               <br />
               government has done. .

               (Page 2015). Is it not to be deplored that in

               this country the French Canadians and Catho- 
               <br />
               lics should be treated as they have been ? In 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec, where we have a ma- 
               <br />
               jority, we have treated the Protestants with 
               <br />
               justice. They have no complaint to make 
               <br />
               against us. Why should they not give us in 
               <br />
               Manitoba and the Northwest the same right 
               <br />
               that we give to the Protestant minority in
