               <br />
               section 12, it was not contemplated that the 
               <br />
               schedules of this Bill should be settled at 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">table.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11</span> have no hesitation in saying to 
               <br />
               my hon. friend that in my own mind I thought

               that these schedules should not be settled at 
               <br />
               this table. My hon. friend from West Assini- 
               <br />
               boia (Mr. Scott), has stated my opinion in 
               <br />
               regard to that. I have taken that position all 
               <br />
               along in the debate. The discussions which 
               <br />
               took place between myself and my colleagues 
               <br />
               and the representatives of the Northwest 
               <br />
               legislature were conﬁdential, and I shall not 
               <br />
               disclose them. but at all events the statement 
               <br />
               has been made by my hon. friend from West 
               <br />
               Assiniboia that it was my intention to have 
               <br />
               these schedules conﬁrmed in the same man- 
               <br />
               ner as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dhenschedules</span> were conﬁrmed at the 
               <br />
               time of the last Dominion redistribution ; 
               <br />
               that is by a conference of members from 
               <br />
               both sides of the House. This view did not

               commend itself to the judgment of hon.

               Mr. FOSTER. That is now a new version. 
               <br />
               Now we come down to the point that the pro- 
               <br />
               position was not made to the members from 
               <br />
               the Northwest on this side of the House. but 
               <br />
               that the proposition was made in some way 
               <br />
               to Mr. Haultain, but it was not in the mind 
               <br />
               of the right hon. Prime Minister, as he told 
               <br />
               us here. that there should be a conference 
               <br />
               between Mr. Haultain and somebody else 
               <br />
               to ﬁx this up. There was to be no confer- 
               <br />
               ence consonant with his idea between the 
               <br />
               members in this House on both sides. What 
               <br />
               had Mr. Haultain to do in so far as a con- 
               <br />
               ference between members representing the 
               <br />
               government and opposition in this House 
               <br />
               was concerned ? Nothing at all. The state— 
               <br />
               ment made the other day by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               who has just spoken (Mr. Scott) and the 
               <br />
               statement he made to—day are not consistent 
               <br />
               with each other, and both of them ﬂatly 
               <br />
               deny what the right hon. Prime Minister has 
               <br />
               said that he had in his mind, and what hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen sitting on this side of the House 
               <br />
               declare is an absolute fact. The right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister is the important man on that 
               <br />
               side of the House. If he had an idea of 
               <br />
               actually holding it, he placed himself in the 
               <br />
               position of taking no certain step to apprise 
               <br />
               the opposition of the fact that he had that 
               <br />
               idea and that he thought it would be right 
               <br />
               that it should prevail. Then, having done 
               <br />
               nothing and having brought the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter</span> to 
               <br />
               this pass, he now gives as an excuse for the 
               <br />
               present basis and the present proceeding that
