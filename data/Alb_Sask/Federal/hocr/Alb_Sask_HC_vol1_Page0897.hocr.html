               directly interested, surely it is going some- 
               <br />
               what beyond the proprieties to undertake 
               <br />
               to engineer an agitation of this kind in the 
               <br />
               east. A few newspapers in Toronto, with 
               <br />
               their violent editorials and still more violent 
               <br />
               cartoons, and perhaps a few newspapers in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec, do not represent 
               <br />
               the sober thought of the people of Canada. 
               <br />
               They represent only the extreme sections 
               <br />
               of both parties, and it seems to me that 
               <br />
               the government, in taking a middle course— 
               <br />
               you may call it a compromise if you wish— 
               <br />
               is performing a service to Canada which all 
               <br />
               peace loving and progressive citizens will 
               <br />
               in a very short time‘ learn to appreciate 
               <br />
               and applaud.

               safe and conducive to the future peace and

               prosperity of the country. I shall for the

               moment assume the position of an extreme
