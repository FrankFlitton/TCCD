               Northwest Territories Act, the provisions 
               <br />
               to which I am now referring—that it

               <br />
               sight that this provision had been inserted

               should have been such a provision. That

               West assembly. To that amendment :1 sub-

               amendment was proposed by the late Mr.

               took a very different view, by his sub-

               this moment to say they are permanent is a

               that time, not to change our views, but to set

               <br />
               has demanded certain measures—not only on

               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> of language, but on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span> of schools

               <br />
               stitution, which has been devised for the safety

               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> and the protection of the mim-

               I quote my right hon. friend, in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place, as a justiﬁcation for my bringing up 
               <br />
               the question at present, because, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">according</span> 
               <br />
               to what he then said, this is the proper time 
               <br />
               to deal with that question. That is one 
               <br />
               point, but there is another which I invoke 
               <br />
               in favour of the contention I have the 
               <br />
               honour to submit, and that is what my hon. 
               <br />
               friend said, namely, that when the time 
               <br />
               came to deal with this question, we must 
               <br />
               deal with it in the broad spririt of the con- 
               <br />
               stitution, safeguarding the majority and at 
               <br />
               the same time protecting the minority.
