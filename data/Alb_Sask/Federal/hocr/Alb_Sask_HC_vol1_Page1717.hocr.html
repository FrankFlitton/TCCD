               <br />

               <br />
               as I know. The estimate of population up 
               <br />
               to the present time is 400.145 for the two 
               <br />

               <br />
               " tiou and have the election later. A redistri- 
               <br />
               bution for this House took place in 1893, 
               <br />
               but the election did not take place until 
               <br />
               1896. We had another redistribution in 
               <br />
               1902. and an election in 1904. In each case 
               <br />
               the redistribution took place on the popula- 
               <br />

               <br />
               strongly opposed to giving Indians the vote. 
               <br />
               He thinks now that the Indian is as good 
               <br />
               as a white man. He can hear redistribution

               discussed now with perfect good humour.
