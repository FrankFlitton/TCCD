               Now, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Speaker,</span> all I have to say is

               that it does seem a very strange thing that

               this contract should have been let in the 
               <br />
               manner in which it has been let, and I think

               the country is entitled to some explan- 
               <br />
               ation of the circumstances. As we all

               know it is a very large contract and in—
