               <br />
               of Canada were deceived as to that. While 
               <br />
               that assertion was being placarded all over 
               <br />
               the country, an emissary was sent to 
               <br />
               Rome, behind the backs of the people, to 
               <br />
               say that the settlement was only an in- 
               <br />
               stalment. Have not the people of Canada 
               <br />
               a right to be apprehensive as to their rights 
               <br />
               and their concern in the welfare of this 
               <br />
               country, when the party in power backed up 
               <br />
               by a strong majority saw ﬁt to deal in that 
               <br />
               way with matters that are sacred to every 
               <br />

               <br />
               separate schools on their own merits—I will 
               <br />
               leave that question in the hands of its own 
               <br />
               friends, and that’s bad enough. We have 
               <br />
               heard a great deal from our friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Fisher) about 
               <br />
               the condition of education in the province 
               <br />

               Some people will ask: What business is 
               <br />
               it of yours whether our schools are good or 
               <br />
               bad ? I reply that certainly it is our duty. 
               <br />
               If we appropriate public money for school 
               <br />
               purposes, we are certainly interested in 
               <br />
               seeing that the money is properly expended. 
               <br />
               If it were any particular church which was 
               <br />
               spending its own money on the schools, 
               <br />
               then of course it would be the business of 
               <br />
               nobody except those belonging to that church 
               <br />
               What these schools were like. Let me read 
               <br />
               here what the hon. Minister of Justice (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick) said in the Quebec provincial 
               <br />
               legislature about these very same schools in 
               <br />
               that province. You may talk about the in- 
               <br />
               tolerance of Ontario, but, I defy you to look 
               <br />
               through the speech of any public man in 
               <br />
               that province and ﬁnd in it a stronger in- 
               <br />

               Mr. Fitzpatrick, supporting Mr. Marchand, 
               <br />
               said that our common school system was the 
               <br />
               very worst that could be found in any country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i</span> 
               <br />
               its evil <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effects</span> were everywhere apparent. The

               read or write. He, himself, knew that thirty

               per cent of the jurymen in our law counts 
               <br />

               money were voted last year for the common

               were the popular classes better educated to-

               day than twenty years ago? He thought not. 
               <br />
               A large amount was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also</span> yearly expended on 
               <br />
               normal schools which appeared almost totally 
               <br />
               useless under the existing state <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> things. He

               <br />
               was wrong, that over ﬁfty per cent of the

               <br />
               was not to be wondered at when we reﬂected 
               <br />

               wanting, but because of the vicious educational

               But said by a Quebec man. that charge 
               <br />
               cannot lie. But Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fitzpatrick’s</span> comments 
               <br />
               are rather hard on the statements made by 
               <br />
               the hon. the Minister of Agriculture the other 
               <br />
               day. It ought to be the aim of every man 
               <br />
               in this country to have our schools eiﬁcient. 
               <br />
               These schools ought to be the schools of the 
               <br />
               people. If the right hon. the First Minister 
               <br />
               was sincere in what he said about public 
               <br />
               schools. he certainly cannot be sincere in 
               <br />
               giving to the minority in the Territories the 
               <br />
               small concessions he is giving them in the 
               <br />
               Bill before the House, if we are to judge by 
               <br />
               the criticism of his own friends. We have 
               <br />
               had man after man of them get up and say 
               <br />
               that the school clause does not mean any- 
               <br />
               thing that lt merely establishes public. 
               <br />
               schools with half an hour religious instruc— 
               <br />
               tion added. If that be the case, then the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman is not dealing honestly 
               <br />
               With the minority and is not consistent 
               <br />
               with his own professions. If he believes 
               <br />
               that public schools are not inthe interests 
               <br />
               of the country. then he should see that the 
               <br />
               people in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> be really given
