               <br />
               $10,000,000. But I think that is a mere 
               <br />
               guess because the population would have to 
               <br />
               increase very rapidly indeed to bring the 
               <br />
               revenue to $10,000,000. It would have to 
               <br />
               increase more than twice as rapidly as it 
               <br />
               does now; because if we take the revenue 
               <br />
               per capita of the whole Dominion, which is 
               <br />
               $8.87, and apply it to a population of 5,000,- 
               <br />
               000, for each of those two provinces, it 
               <br />
               would not produce quite $5,000,000, which is 
               <br />
               a long way from $10,000,000, which the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman said would be the revenue, pos- 
               <br />
               sibly, when they reached the 800,000. An 
               <br />
               increase of 300,000 over 500,000 would not 
               <br />
               make up the other $5,000,000. So I think we 
               <br />
               must not bank too much on this enormous 
               <br />
               increase of revenue to meet the very large 
               <br />
               expenditure. We Will have to make a more 
               <br />
               careful calculation than was made by the 
               <br />

               examine the details of the ﬁgures, we ﬁnd

               <br />
               will remain with us, because the Edmonton

               jail is to be treated as a penitentiary for the 
               <br />
               Territories. Therefore the ﬁnancial obli-

               gation-s connected with that penitentiary 
               <br />
               will be upon us, and that sum is deducted 
               <br />
               from the amount they claim, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> jail will

               police service. they charged $100,000. which

               they wanted us to give them in order that

               they may provide for their police service. 
               <br />

               necessary to make any. Then in addition, 
               <br />

               it was necessary to construct it, we should
