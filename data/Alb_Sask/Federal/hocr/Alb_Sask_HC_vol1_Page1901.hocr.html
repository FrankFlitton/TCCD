               lative assembly having decided that its pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings should be in English, the use of 
               <br />
               the French language is totally abolished in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories? Is that what

               my hon. friend contends?

               a few moments ago that theopinion given

               by Sir John Macdonald, was that even if the

               legislature of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               would abolish the dual system as regards

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. The reasons may

               be as the hon. gentleman stated, but I have 
               <br />
               looked into this somewhat carefully and I 
               <br />
               arrived at the conclusion that the Act of 
               <br />
               1877 was modiﬁed only in one respect by 
               <br />
               v. hat took place in 1890-92, namely, that the 
               <br />
               legislature of the Northwest Territories was 
               <br />
               given authority, .by resolution or otherwise, 
               <br />
               to regulate its proceedings and pursuant to 
               <br />
               that the legislature of the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories abolished the use of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> French 
               <br />
               language in its proceedings and in the re- 
               <br />
               cording ot its resolutions. Apart from that 
               <br />
               the Act of 1877 is as much in force in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories today as it ever has 
               <br />
               been.
