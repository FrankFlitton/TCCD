               the hon. gentleman suggests. I would like

               to point out further in this connection, as it 
               <br />
               was my duty to state in the House yester-

               day in regard to another matter, that it is 
               <br />
               very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficult</span> to deﬁne the line between the 
               <br />
               ranching country and the farming country, 
               <br />
               for the reason that a country which a few 
               <br />
               years ago was understood to be solely a 
               <br />
               ranching country is now being occupied by 
               <br />
               hundreds, if not thousands, of people for the 
               <br />
               purpose of grain raising. There are settle- 
               <br />
               ments being made for strictly agricultural 
               <br />
               purposes to-day in the Alberta district, im- 
               <br />
               mediately south of the district of Calgary

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represented</span> by my hon. friend, in localities 
               <br />
               which, seven years ago, were considered to 
               <br />
               be strictly ranching country ; and the people 
               <br />
               in those settlements have raised magniﬁcent 
               <br />
               crops of wheat on that very land, and are 
               <br />
               depending on wheat raising for their success. 
               <br />
               So along the main line of the Canadian Paci- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fic</span> Railway, in the very country he speaks of 
               <br />
               as exclusively ranching, several towns have

               started up recently which are dependent for

               their success on the success of farming in 
               <br />
               those localities. So that you cannot draw 
               <br />
               an exact line dividing farming country from

               posed, his argument is the same. He argued 
               <br />
               for one jurisdiction over the fur-bearing 
               <br />

               <br />
               parallel to the Arctic ocean ; but he did not 
               <br />
               show why, if there was to be a division, the 
               <br />
               60th parallel was'not as good a division as 
               <br />
               any other that could be made. It is general- 
               <br />
               ly agreed, I think, by this House that there 
               <br />
               is no intention or desire on the part of the 
               <br />
               people that the whole of that vast western

               between the international boundary and the

               Arctic ocean should be organized under one 
               <br />
               jurisdiction. If there is to be a division, 
               <br />
               there is no reason given why this division 
               <br />
               is not good. We claim that it is a good and 
               <br />
               fair division. "I do not dispute that the di-

               Saskatchewan valley pretty much the same 
               <br />
               conditions prevail. That is to say, there is

               no particular place where you can draw a 
               <br />
               line to make an absolute division between 
               <br />
               two kinds of country.

               The hon. gentleman spoke of the 
               <br />
               western boundary as being an irregular 
               <br />
               line, that is to say, the Rocky moun— 
               <br />
               tains. Well, we cannot change the Rocky 
               <br />
               mountains and we cannot change the 
               <br />
               boundary of British Columbia; we have to 
               <br />
               accept that as it is. There might possibly 
               <br />
               be a division between what is called the

               <br />

               <br />
               Moosejaw, known as the coteau of the

               Missouri, which crosses the boundary line 
               <br />

               ward until it terminates a little south of 
               <br />
               Battleford. If there is a natural division in

               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> it is that line; but it is not

               As to the district <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Athabaska, I think 
               <br />
               what my hon. friend from South York 
               <br />
               (Mr. W. F. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">M‘aelean)</span> has said might very

               much greater. He has seen ﬁt to designate 
               <br />
               it, and I think with some degree of justice. 
               <br />
               as being ﬁt to be the seat of a new province.

               My hon. friend from Calgary has declared 
               <br />
               that not only is it notﬂt to be the seat of a
