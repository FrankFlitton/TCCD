               If I understand the English language, you 
               <br />
               have in chapter 29, section 41, which is thus 
               <br />
               perpetuated as part of the constitution of 
               <br />
               the new provinces forever, exactly the same 
               <br />
               provisions as those which are to be found in 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875. Every important or effective 
               <br />
               word, so far as I understand it, that is to be 
               <br />
               found in the Act of 1875, is to be found 
               <br />
               here. Section 16, No. 1, perpetuates the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 in so far as that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> provides 
               <br />
               for separate schools in the Territories. That 
               <br />
               was the intention, that was the direct 
               <br />
               enactment, of section 16, No. 1. Section 
               <br />
               16,_ No. 2, does the same thing indirectly. 
               <br />
               It does not directly .re-enact the Act of 1875 
               <br />
               as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«a,</span> part of the constitution, but it re-enacts 
               <br />
               this part of the ordinances of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories as part of the constitution, it re- 
               <br />
               enacts the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chapter—and</span> section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofithe</span> ordin- 
               <br />
               ances to which I have just referred, and 
               <br />
               which are thus made part of the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of the new provinces for all time to 
               <br />
               come. The provisions of that section are 
               <br />
               to all intents and purposes, so far as my 
               <br />
               understanding goes, the same as the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875. Let us test the question in an- 
               <br />
               other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way.</span> Up to the present time I have 
               <br />
               been comparing the Act of 1875 with sec- 
               <br />
               tion 16, No. 2, and I have done that be- 
               <br />
               cause the Act of 1875 was re—enacted in 
               <br />
               section 16, No. 1. Let us now take section 
               <br />
               16, No. 1 directly, and compare it with sec- 
               <br />
               tion 16, No. 2, and with the ordinance 
               <br />
               which is brought into force by section 16. 
               <br />
               No. 2. In subsection 2 of section 16, No. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">omitting</span> the immaterial words, you have the 
               <br />
               words which constitute a protection to the

               minority in the Northwest. I will read them, 
               <br />
               omitting all immaterial words, as my hon.
