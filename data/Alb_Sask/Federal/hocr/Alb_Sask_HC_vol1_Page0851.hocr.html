               <br />
               lowed him. The Liberal members were ex-

               ceedingly enthusiastic the ﬁrst day, but 
               <br />
               when Mr. Sifton stepped out the western 
               <br />
               members stepped out with him. Mr. Sifton 
               <br />
               came back and he announced that a com- 
               <br />
               promise had been made, and that the Bill 
               <br />
               had been changed. He told us that he was 
               <br />
               opposed to separate schools, and in effect 
               <br />
               his statement was, that rather than turn 
               <br />
               his party out of power he would sacriﬁce 
               <br />
               his principles and stay with the game. Talk 
               <br />
               about a hero. I got letters and resolutions 
               <br />
               stating that they were proud of Mr. Sifton 
               <br />
               and that there never was a greater hero in 
               <br />
               the country, because every one has respect 
               <br />
               for a man who sticks to his principles no 
               <br />
               matter what these principles may be. The 
               <br />
               Orange lodges were extolling Mr. Sifton, and 
               <br />
               I got letters asking me to back up Mr. Sif- 
               <br />
               ton, and I was ready to back him up but I 
               <br />
               am sorry he deserted us in the ﬁght. I see 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) 
               <br />
               here, and I listened to his address with a 
               <br />
               great deal of interest. I may say here that 
               <br />
               whether we are Grit or Tory, or whether we 
               <br />
               are Catholic or Protestant we must all be 
               <br />
               glad that the keynote of every speech here 
               <br />
               is loyalty to the British Crown. We may 
               <br />
               differ for a little while on educational ques- 
               <br />
               tions, but so long as we are loyal there is 
               <br />
               no danger but that everything will come out 
               <br />
               right in the end. I would like my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Labelle to come up into my 
               <br />
               country and stay there for ten years, and I 
               <br />
               can tell him he will come back to Quebec 
               <br />
