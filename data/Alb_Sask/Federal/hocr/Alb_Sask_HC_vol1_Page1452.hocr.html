               <br />
               ning to end of this whole measure: history

               is knocked endways, dates are upset and 
               <br />
               everything is done to ﬁt in alleged facts to 
               <br />
               certain intentions of the government. I 
               <br />
               would like to call attention to what I 
               <br />
               think is really before us. In my opin- 
               <br />
               ion it was the intention of the British

               when any portion of the Territories be-

               came so far developed as to justify pro-

               ment to confer such status upon that portion 
               <br />
               of the territory. It was not only our duty 
               <br />
               to do that but we were not at liberty to add 
               <br />

               We ﬁnd south of the 55th parallel of lati- 
               <br />
               tude, three districts, Alberta, Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               and Assiniboia, all of a somewhat similar 
               <br />
               nature and developed very much in the 
               <br />
               same degree. They would constitute, so

               far as area is concerned, a compact pro-

               vince of reasonable dimensions; a little 
               <br />
               larger than Ontario and not quite so large 
               <br />
               as Quebec. The government. instead of

               granting the wishes of these districts and _ 
               <br />
               constituting out of them a new province, 
               <br />
