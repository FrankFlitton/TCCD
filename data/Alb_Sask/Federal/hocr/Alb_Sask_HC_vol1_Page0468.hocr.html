               Mr. A. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LAVE‘RGNE.</span> The hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Toronto said that when this law 
               <br />
               was passed war would begin in the North- 
               <br />
               west. These hon. gentlemen are always 
               <br />
               ready to accept the opinion of the majority 
               <br />
               when that opinion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">..is</span> against separate 
               <br />
               schools, but when that opinion is in favour of 
               <br />
               separate schools then they talk of war and 
               <br />
               rebellion against the sovereign authority of 
               <br />
               this parliament. I say that if separate 
               <br />
               schools were withheld from the people of 
               <br />
               the Northwest it would be an injustice done 
               <br />
               against the Catholics of the Dominion. an 
               <br />
               injustice which is not deserved by the 
               <br />
               Catholics and French Canadians of this 
               <br />
               Dominion.

               But, Sir, what can we do then ? We can 
               <br />
               make a constitutional ﬁght. You never 
               <br />
               heard the members from Quebec of the 
               <br />
               hierarchy, or the priests of Quebec talking 
               <br />
               of war and rebellion. You have never 
               <br />
               heard from the pulpits of our churches the 
               <br />
               speeches which have been made in other 
               <br />
               churches or in lodges. We submit to the 
               <br />
               law. We may oppose the law, we may 
               <br />
               conduct a constitutional agitation against 
               <br />
               it, but you never heard on our side talk of 
               <br />
               war or rebellion because the majority was 
               <br />
               against us. We respect the majority. but 
               <br />
               it is strange to observe the attitude of hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the other side of the House. 
               <br />
               When they have the majority with them they 
               <br />
               claim that the majority has every right, but 
               <br />
               when the majority is against them they 
               <br />
               say that they will make war against the 
               <br />
