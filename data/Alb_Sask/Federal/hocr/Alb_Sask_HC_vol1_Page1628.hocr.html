               gested that that 10 per cent should apply 
               <br />
               .to a whole group of constituencies. That 
               <br />
               is What is being done in this particular case. 
               <br />
               The constituencies grouped north are re- 
               <br />
               ceiving, taken as a whole. an exceptional 
               <br />
               amount of consideration. But if you take 
               <br />
               the number of votes on the list you will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the right hon. Prime Minister, accord— 
               <br />
               ing to his own ﬁgures, has favoured consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies in the north to the extent of :22 per 
               <br />
               cent; and I wish to say, Mr. Chairman, in 
               <br />
               regard to this, that I am not taking into 
               <br />
               consideration the two extra constituencies 
               <br />
               which are to be formed in Athabaska. I 
               <br />
               am taking purely and simply the constituen- 
               <br />
               cies in the old district of Alberta. if you 
               <br />
               take the voters‘ list you will see that the 
               <br />
               northern people have been favoured to the 
               <br />
               extent of 22 per cent. The ﬁgures furnished 
               <br />
               by the right hon. Prime Minister show that 
               <br />
               on the basis of the votes cast they have been 
               <br />
               favoured to the extent of 10 per cent. I 
               <br />
               would like to know how that compares with 
               <br />
               the way that the legislative assembly man- 
               <br />
               aged their own distribution, in which the 
               <br />
               variation amounted to about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4.}</span> per cent 
               <br />
               throughout the whole country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> We have 
               <br />
               heard a good deal about the argument that 
               <br />
               areas should be taken into consideration in 
               <br />
               discussing this question. So I consider they

               to the dilﬁculties of carrying on an election

               The only trouble was that the return of the

               <br />

               presentation in Athabaska, I would like to 
               <br />
               say that I fully agree that every man in that 
               <br />
               country should have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">franchise</span> and should 
               <br />
               be entitled to cast his vote for a member 
               <br />
               to represent him, but we must not forget 
               <br />
               the fact that there is a large portion of the 
               <br />
               country which is being cut <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">OE</span> and deprived 
               <br />
               of representation by the action of the pre- 
               <br />
               sent government. That portion of the dis- 
               <br />
               trict of Saskatchewan which lies north of 
               <br />
               Manitoba has a fair number of voters in it. 
               <br />
               I should not wonder if it has just as many 
               <br />
               voters as those who will cast their votes 
               <br />
               in either of these proposed districts in 
               <br />
               Athabaska. They have enjoyed the tran- 
               <br />
               chise for many years, they have been 
               <br />
               entitled to elect a member for the Nor-th- 
               <br />
               west legislative assembly, and now they 
               <br />
               are to be thrown into unorganized ter- 
               <br />
               ritory and to be deprived of their fran- 
               <br />
               chise. I think that is a point which is worth 
               <br />
               bearing in mind in connection with this dis— 
               <br />
               cussion. You have only to look at the map 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> see how very little consideration has been 
               <br />
               given to the question, because you will see 
               <br />
               that they bring in all these huge constituen- 
               <br />
               cies from the north and corner them in and 
               <br />
               around the city of Edmonton. We ﬁnd also 
               <br />
               that this principle of area has been departed 
               <br />
               from in the most astonishing way in the 
               <br />
               new province of Saskatchewan. There is 
               <br />
               one constituency in the south that has more 
               <br />
               than ﬁve times the area of two of the con— 
               <br />
               stituen-cies in the north. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[It</span> has ﬁve times the 
               <br />
               area and nearly double the voting strength 
               <br />
               of these constituencies in the north. That is 
               <br />
               one example to show that the area has not 
               <br />
               been the guiding principle in this redistri- 
               <br />
               bution. The smallest district in area is 
               <br />
               Rosthern, one of these northern constituen— 
               <br />

               <br />
               Moosejaw in the south, and has only about

               one—half of the voting population.
