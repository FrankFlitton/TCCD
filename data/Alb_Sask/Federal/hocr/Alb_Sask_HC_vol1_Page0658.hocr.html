               for the power of the clergymen of the

               wark of liberty and so on . What is the 
               <br />
               palladium of liberty, or the bulwark of 
               <br />
               liberty as regards the Bill? We have the 
               <br />
               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir</span> William Mulock, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Postmaster.</span> 
               <br />
               General, and we have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gourt</span> appointed 
               <br />
               to investigate into this matter. We have 
               <br />
               four judges to stand between the people 
               <br />
               and any attacks that may be made upon' 
               <br />
               their liberties. When I say an attack upon 
               <br />
               their liberties I do not mean a vicious 
               <br />
               attack, an absolutely unjustiﬁable attack; I 
               <br />
               mean that when the advance guard of a 
               <br />
               great body comes forward <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.to</span> assist what 
               <br />
               they believe to be right in the interests of 
               <br />
               their church, but which we do not believe to 
               <br />
               be in the best interests of Canada, we have 
               <br />
               as the palladium of Canadian liberty the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman who is sleeping in his seat 
               <br />
               tonight and we have three more. I, as a 
               <br />
               Protestant—and I do not think I am saying 
               <br />
               anything <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offensive</span> in saying that—rest my 
               <br />
               case mainly with him. The others may be 
               <br />
               prejudiced, they may be carried away with 
               <br />
