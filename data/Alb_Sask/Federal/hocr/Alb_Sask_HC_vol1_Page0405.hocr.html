               Mr. SCOTT. Does my hon. friend think 
               <br />
               the point is essential ? If he will study the 
               <br />

               Mr. SCOTT. I was about to make a sort 
               <br />
               of confession to my hon. friend. I would 
               <br />
               have had no objection at all to stating my 
               <br />
               views during the election regarding what 
               <br />
               would be the proper action for the Dominion 
               <br />
               parliament to take on the school question. 
               <br />
               I will give my hon. friend the proof of this. 
               <br />
               Two years ago his leader put on the order 
               <br />
               paper a motion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘with</span> regard to autonomy. 
               <br />
               concerning which I prepared some notes. 
               <br />
               The debate came on very late. I spoke on 
               <br />
               the question after midnight and did not use 
               <br />
               all of my notes. In the next <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">session'of</span> 1904, 
               <br />
               I expected the leader of the opposition to 
               <br />
               again raise that question and I‘amplitied my 
               <br />
               notes. The question never did come up; 
               <br />
               but if it had. I have here exactly what I in- 
               <br />
               tended to sav and I shall read a portion of
