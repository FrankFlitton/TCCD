               Justice. 1 say, Sir, that there is no power

               contained in the British North America Act 
               <br />
               to carve out new provinces, but, there was a 
               <br />
               power given in that Act to admit these new 
               <br />
               Territories which were not then part of 
               <br />
               the union. They were therefore, not cover- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ca Act at that time, because they were not 
               <br />
               in the Dominion of Canada at all, they be- 
               <br />
               ing under the Hudson Bay Company under 
               <br />
               the imperial parliament. It takes some fur- 
               <br />
               ther enactment to bring them under that 
               <br />
               section. Having got those Territories into 
               <br />
               the Dominion under the Act of. 1870, 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba, in advance 
               <br />
               of legislation by the imperial parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, was carved out of these Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories by the parliament of Canada, 
               <br />
               but, it does not at all follow that it this 
               <br />
               parliament assumed jurisdiction to carve 
               <br />
               out the provinces, therefore the legislation 
               <br />
               was intra vires. The parliament of Canada 
               <br />
               evidently thought they had not the right to 
               <br />
               do so, and shortly afterwards there was 
               <br />
               legislation in this regard, passed by the 
               <br />
               imperial parliament, and the same imperial 
               <br />
               legislation which validated the Manitoba 
               <br />
               Act, for the ﬁrst time gave the. parliament 
               <br />
               of Canada the power to carve provincesout 
               <br />
               of these new Territories. I call the attention 
               <br />
               of the House to section 2 of the Act of 1871. 
               <br />
               which gives this power, because if this 
               <br />
               power is not in the British North America 
               <br />
               Act, there is no inherent power in the parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada to create these provinces; 
               <br />
               and for this reason, that any power the par— 
               <br />
               liament of Canada has in respect to this 
               <br />
               legislation must of necessity come from the 
               <br />
               imperial parliament, and until the Act of 
               <br />
               1871 was passed. the imperial parliament 
               <br />
               alone had the power to carve out these new 
               <br />
               provinces. So, Sir, if my argument is cor— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rect,</span> the parliament of Canada as repre- 
               <br />
               senting the imperial parliament, has just 
               <br />
               that power to carve out provinces, which 
               <br />
               the imperial parliament gave her. Let us

               power which this parliament has in this

               <br />
               that I felt that it was most unfortunate, if 
               <br />

               <br />
               he should have thought proper to have in- 
               <br />

               <br />
               strongest feelings and prejudices of every 
               <br />
               Protestant in this country. If there was 
               <br />
               one method of proceeding with the consider— 
               <br />
               ation of this matter which could have caused 
               <br />
               anything but calmness and moderation, the 
               <br />
               Speech of the right hon. the Prime Minis-
