               <br />
               were, ‘ Hands off Manitoba,’ ‘ No coercion,’

               ‘We believe in provincial rights.’ “No <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">co-l,</span>

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vercion</span> under Laurier.’ While the leaders 
               <br />
               of the present government were avowing‘ 
               <br />
               these principles and telling the people of 
               <br />
               Canada that these principles were right, I 
               <br />
               was telling the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> of the county of 
               <br />
               Lambton that I also believed these principles 
               <br />
               were right; I was defending the cause ot“ 
               <br />
               provincial rights and educational freedom 
               <br />
               for Manitoba as conscientiously and as 
               <br />
               honestly then as I am now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saying</span> to the 
               <br />
               present government: You should stand to 
               <br />
               your principle of provincial rights, you 
               <br />
               should stand by your own doctrine of no 
               <br />
               coercion in matters of education for the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Territories : Be true to the prin- 
               <br />
               ciples you avowed in 1896 and the people 
               <br />
               will love, honour and respect you. But, if 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> do not harken to the people to-day, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">your</span> government will go down to deserved 
               <br />
               ignominy and defeat. If public men or 
               <br />
               governments can avow certain principles, 
               <br />
               agitate those principles to the extent of 
               <br />
               defeating a government so as to establish 
               <br />
               those principles, and, when they attain 
               <br />
               power laugh at the professions they made 
               <br />
               and cast the principles they advocated to the 
               <br />
               winds, they are aiming a blow at public 
               <br />
               morality, they are lowering the position of 
               <br />
               public men, and we need not wonder at 
               <br />
               people scoﬂing at the idea that public men 
               <br />
               can be honest. I believe that disgrace and 
               <br />
               defeat should await any public man or any 
               <br />
               government in Canada that will not fulﬁl 
               <br />
               promises made to the people. And, when 
               <br />
               you come to realize that the present govern- 
               <br />
               ment have not been carrying out their pro- 
               <br />
               mises ever since they came into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power,</span> 
               <br />
               when you come to realize that they are 
               <br />
               to-day practically a government of oppor- 
               <br />
               tunists, it seems an easy matter for them to 
               <br />
               break faith with the people. They seem to 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               believe and to act upon the old adage that 
               <br />
               the people like to be humbugged. But there 
               <br />
               is also an old saying that you can fool some 
               <br />
               of the people part of the time, and you can 
               <br />
               fool all the people some of the time, but you 
               <br />
               cannot fool all the people all the time. I 
               <br />
               feel conﬁdent that the people of Canada will 
               <br />
               soon come to realize that, the present gov- 
               <br />
               ernment have been humbugging them for 
               <br />
               the last nine or ten years, and they will put 
               <br />
               a stop to it at the earliest opportunity. They 
               <br />
               professed in 1896 that if they were given the 
               <br />
               reins of ofﬁce they would reduce the running 
               <br />
               expenses of this country. They have near- 
               <br />
               ly doubled them. They told the people 
               <br />
               that they would reduce the taxes. They 
               <br />
               have increased them. They talked about 
               <br />
               free trade as it is in England, commercial 
               <br />
               union, and annexation. And practically 
               <br />
               the only plank in their platform that was 
               <br />
               worth standing upon was provincial rights, 
               <br />
               and here they are to-day ready to abandon 
               <br />
               that also. The people of Ontario, last Janu- 
               <br />
               ary, declared that they did—not believe in 
               <br />
               double-dealing, that they had had enough 
               <br />
               of corrupt government in that province, and 
               <br />
               the old government went down and out. 
               <br />
               Honesty among public men is regarded as 
               <br />
               necessary by our people. and they will not 
               <br />
               condone wrong-doing. This government has 
               <br />
               had an opportunity to create a unity of 
               <br />
               feeling between the races in Canada as 
               <br />
               no government has ever had before. Had 
               <br />
               the principles avowed by hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               leading the government to—day been the 
               <br />
               same as the principles they avowed in 1896, 
               <br />
               they would have given to these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces absolute control of education and 
               <br />
               would thereby have cemented the bonds be- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               tween the races. Look back at the situation 
               <br />
               created in 1896, when race and religious 
               <br />
               feeling 'un rampant in this land, when 
               <br />
               neighbours mistrusted each other, when Ro— 
               <br />
               man Catholics regarded Protestants <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> their 
               <br />
               natural enemies and Canada was not a unit- 
               <br />
               ecl nation. Look at this country to-day, and 
               <br />
               cannot you see that feeling is more intensi— 
               <br />
               fied than it was in 1896? Have not the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">niembers</span> of this parliament presented more 
               <br />
               petitions to this House, have they not had 
               <br />
               more letters sent to them urging them to 
               <br />
               stand by one principle or the other '? Does 
               <br />
               not the government see that a ﬂame is 
               <br />
               being fanned to—day that a score of years 
               <br />
               will not quench? And, if this government 
               <br />
               forces separate schools upon the new pro- 
               <br />
               rinces, they throw into the political soil 
               <br />
               of Canada a seed that cannot be uprooted 
               <br />
               for all time to come. We can never make

               Canada a great nation, we can never make 
               <br />

               our people a united people until we blot out 
               <br />
