               Sir, the question whether separate schools 
               <br />
               should, or should not, be established is one 
               <br />
               which might well have been debated in 1863 
               <br />
               when that system was adopted for the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario; it is one which might well have 
               <br />
               been debated upon principle in 1867 and 1870 
               <br />
               when these schools were being perpetuated 
               <br />
               under the Confederation Acts. But it is not a

               <br />
               I have no right to take my preference on that

               with the question of a clause of the constitu-

               History, Sir, is making itself these eventful 
               <br />
               days. Shall the chapter be a record of noble-

               <br />

               petty and provincial, or shall we be recorded 
               <br />
