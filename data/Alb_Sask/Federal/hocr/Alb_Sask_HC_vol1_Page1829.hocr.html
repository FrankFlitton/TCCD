               place, what is the difference between clause 
               <br />
               16 in the original Bill and clause 16 as 
               <br />
               amended? And. in the second place, why 
               <br />
               did he (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fitzpatrick)</span> make the change—-

               Mr. FITZPATRI-CK. If I were to at- 
               <br />
               tempt any criticism of myself in these mat- 
               <br />
               ters, I would not criticise my drafting, but 
               <br />
               my good nature. I am tempted, through 
               <br />
               my good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nature,</span> to make changes, even 
               <br />

               <br />
               I may proﬁt in the future. The question is 
               <br />
               as to the merits of the amendment—not as 
               <br />
               to whether it is well drafted or not. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister said, when he introduced 
               <br />
               the Bill, that he was not only willing, but 
               <br />
               anxious, that any improvement possible 
               <br />
               should be suggested. And here is the 
               <br />
               answer, on the part of my hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bergeron), in the shape of an amendment 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing the suggestion of the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               that sugge'stions for improvement will be 
               <br />
               welcome, the hon. gentleman (Mr. Ber- 
               <br />
               geron) gives us this amendment, which, I

               clear. In what respect does it make it

               clear ? Does it make it clear by declaring

               any reference whatever to the Dominion

               land fund or securing any portion of that

               clearer so far as it omits all reference to 
               <br />

               <br />
               so far as it omits to make any provision for 
               <br />
