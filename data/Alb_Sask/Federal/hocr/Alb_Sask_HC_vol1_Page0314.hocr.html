               dently apply to the legislative power. If we

               were merely to admit these new provinces

               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec. they would be without 
               <br />
               a constitution. since they have not any as 
               <br />
               was the case with the province which came 
               <br />
               into confederation in 1867. New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia. British Columbia and Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island had their constitution just 
               <br />
               the same as Ontario and Quebec. But in 
               <br />
               this case it is necessary to decide on the 
               <br />
               terms of the constitution of these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. since they are without a constitu- 
               <br />
               tion at the time we are granting them pro- 
               <br />
               vincial autonomy.
