               Mr. SPROULE. I speak only of the gen- _ 
               <br />
               eral practise among politicians. As the Min- ‘ 
               <br />
               ister of Justice has denied it, I have nothing 
               <br />
               more to say. But was it not natural that 
               <br />
               the delegate from Manitoba should come to 
               <br />
               the conclusion that the government’s hand 
               <br />
               was behind it? Wasit the ﬁne Italian 
               <br />
               hand alone that accounted for it? How 
               <br />
               did he know our statutes so as to be able 
               <br />
               to draw clauses that would dove-tail into 
               <br />
               them and accomplish what was wanted in 
               <br />
               Manitoba ? Was there not some power be— 
               <br />
               hind him that prepared these subsections 
               <br />
               for him? There must have been. And 
               <br />
               certainly it would not have been any one in 
               <br />
               the Manitoba government, for they did not 
               <br />
               accept it. Now, it is admitted and not 
               <br />
               denied that the Papal ablegate took an im- 
               <br />
               portant part in preparing these Autonomy 
               <br />
               Bills to establish the two new provinces, in 
               <br />
               drawing up their educational clauses. It 
               <br />
               is admitted that conferences took place, 
               <br />
               that he was satisﬁed and accepted them. 
               <br />
               Now, if separate schools are fastened on 
               <br />
               half a continent there, who has done it? 
               <br />
               The government through the representative 
               <br />
               of the church. He helped them to do it. 
               <br />
               And if he was successful in establishing 
               <br />
               them over 500,000 square miles of territory. 
               <br />
               is it any wonder that he attempted to go 
               <br />
               farther and fasten them on Manitoba as

               will ﬁght it out along these lines to the end. 
               <br />
               I will tell him to keep on with that ﬁght 
               <br />
               and to congratulate himself on the result 
               <br />
               when he comes to the end of it. It is claim- 
               <br />
               ed and not denied that this proposal in the 
               <br />
               Bill was submitted and it was carried 
               <br />
               through. There is no doubt on that sub- 
               <br />
               ject. Now, we combine the statement of 
               <br />
               the Papal ablegate and the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment with regard to the statement of 
               <br />
               the Hon. Robert <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rogers.</span> Three of the ﬁve 
               <br />
               speciﬁc items mentioned by Rogers which 
               <br />
               are known to the government are ad- 
               <br />
               mitted to be correct. As to the fourth one 
               <br />
               a lapse of memory is pleaded; the First 
               <br />
               Minister says: I have no remembrance of 
               <br />
               it and I think i1 would remember it if it was 
               <br />
               so—but he does not say it was not so. On 
               <br />
               the ﬁfth one the government denies that 
               <br />
               they had any knowledge of what took 
               <br />
               place when the Manitoba delegates were 
               <br />
               with the Papal ablegate. Rogers never 
               <br />
               said they knew what took place but he 
               <br />
               assumed they did in consequence of the 
               <br />
               circumstances that surrounded it, and I say 
               <br />
               he was justiﬁed in that conclusion. Then 
               <br />
               we take the Papal ablegate’s admission that 
               <br />
               he invited them ; as Rogers said an invita- 
               <br />
               tion came. When did it come ? Mr. Rogers 
               <br />
               says March 20, the Papal ablegate says : I 
               <br />
               think I met them on the 23rd or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">24m</span> 
               <br />
               before they left for home. The invitation 
               <br />
               seems to have been on the 20th of March. 
               <br />
               When was the Bill to be introduced in the 
               <br />
               House to give separate schools to the two 
               <br />
               new provinces ? On the 2lst of the month. 
               <br />
               When was the ﬁrst disclosure to be given 
               <br />
               to the people whether or not their boundar— 
               <br />
               ies were to be extended ? On the 21st. Is it 
               <br />
               not natural to reach the conclusion that that 
               <br />
