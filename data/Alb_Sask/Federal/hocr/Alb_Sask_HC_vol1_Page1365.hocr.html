               <br />

               Mr. SAM. HUGHES. Mr. Speaker, I may 
               <br />
               say that my object has been accomplished 
               <br />
               if we have nothing more than the assurance 
               <br />
               of the Prime Minister that these contracts 
               <br />
               are going to be let by public tender and to 
               <br />
               the most favourable bidder for the country. 
               <br />
               That alone more than justiﬁes me in bring- 
               <br />
               ing the matter up. The Acting Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works endeavoured to make a point 
               <br />
               against the gentlemen who furnished me 
               <br />
               with the data on this matter, gentlemen of 
               <br />
               the very highest repute in the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada, by stating that they had put the 
               <br />
               price paid for this work at from $2.50 to $$ 
               <br />
               per square yard. I may say that I tried in 
               <br />
               the Auditor General’s Department, and in 
               <br />
               the Department of Public Works to ascer- 
               <br />
               tain what had been paid for the work, 
               <br />
               either the gross amount for the whole or 
               <br />
               the net amount paid per square yard, and 
               <br />
               I failed to get the slightest information. 
               <br />
               No papers were available in the Auditor 
               <br />
               General’s Department, they were somewhere 
               <br />
               else. In the Public Works Department they 
               <br />
               had been sent for by the chief engineer or 
               <br />
               the deputy minister, and I could not get 
               <br />
               them. How then are these gentlemen to be 
               <br />
               blamed for not knowing the actual cost? 
               <br />
               They went by the ﬁgures given them by gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen connected with the concern, and we 
               <br />
               have yet to measure in order to see how 
               <br />
               many square yards there are in the whole 
               <br />
               business. I was more than surprised to 
               <br />
               hear the Acting Minister of Public Works 
               <br />
               (Mr. Hyman) refer to the late Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works (Mr. Sutherland) as he did. 
               <br />
               I yield to no man in this House—not even to 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister—in the esteem in which 
               <br />
               I hold the late Minister of Public Works; 
               <br />
               and I venture the assertion that this contract 
               <br />
               was not let during his personal adminis- 
               <br />

               let as the Cornwall canal lighting contract 
               <br />
               was. The last time I saw the late <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister.</span> 
               <br />
               of Public Works—and I was as intimate 
               <br />
               with him as almost any member of this 
               <br />
               House except the Prime Minister and the 
               <br />
               Acting Minister of Public Works—he as- 
               <br />
               sured me that the Cornwall canal lighting 
               <br />
               contract was laid in front of him; and on 
               <br />
               the assurance that it had come from the 
               <br />
               Justice Department and was perfectly regu- 
               <br />
               lar he signed it without looking into it. 
               <br />
               Possibly this contract may have borne his 
               <br />
               signature, but I venture to say that his name 
               <br />
               was never put to it unless everything was 
               <br />
               fair and square and regular. I was glad 
               <br />
               however to see the acting minister change 
               <br />
               his assertion to one that he himself was not 
               <br />
               responsible. But if so who was responsible ? 
               <br />
               Possibly it was one of the oﬂicers of the 
               <br />
               department who are so busy letting con- 
               <br />
               tracts. I was roaming across the Northwest 
               <br />
               a few days ago and came across a notice on 
               <br />
               a board, regularly printed, forbidding home- 
               <br />
               steads in certain areas until sixty or a 
               <br />
               certain number of days after the plans and 
               <br />
               all this other business had been registered in 
               <br />
               the Surveyor General’s ofﬁce at Ottawa. The 
               <br />
               atmosphere was clear up there and I smelt, 
               <br />
               to use the expression somebody here used 
               <br />
               yesterday, a huge sized rat. I asked the late 
               <br />
               Deputy Minister of the Interior on my re- 
               <br />
               turn, and he stated that no such order had 
               <br />
               ever been issued. I then spoke to the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton), then Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior, and he denied having 
               <br />
               heard of it. He sent for one of his ofﬁcers. 
               <br />
               who has the honour to occupy a seat in this 
               <br />
               House, and was informed that that gentle- 
               <br />
               man, on his own responsibility, had issued 
               <br />
               that order. Possibly similar work has since 
               <br />
               been going on in the Public Works Depart- 
               <br />
               ment, and I would draw the attention of the 
               <br />
               First Minister to this. The argument is ad- 
               <br />
               vanced that the city of Ottawa is using this 
               <br />
               contract. Well, I venture to say that if the 
               <br />
               electors of this city understand the matter, 
               <br />
               they will get rid of their city engineer and 
               <br />
               their council. Any engineer of any corpor- 
               <br />
               ation, who will advise paying $2.25 for that 
               <br />
               pavement in front of the building when they 
               <br />
               can get the regular asphalt pavement for 
               <br />
               $2.50 per cubic yard, is not ﬁt for his busi- 
               <br />
               ness and should not be kept in his position. 
               <br />
               I wonder if the inﬂuence of.parliament hill 
               <br />
               were called in in order to impress upon the 
               <br />
               chief engineer of the city of Ottawa and the 
               <br />
               council possibly of that city that they should 
               <br />
               accept this new pavement. This question is 
               <br />
               worth looking into just as well as that won- 
               <br />
               derful petition of all the residents along the 
               <br />
               road. Who are these petitioners ? Bank 
               <br />
               clerks, gentlemen of the Rideau club. saloon 
               <br />
               keepers and the United States Consul’s 
               <br />
               ofﬁce. All these gentlemen, we are told. 
               <br />
               came and viewed the pavement and spon- 
               <br />
               taneously signed a petition, it looked so 
               <br />
               handsome. When did they see it? It is 
               <br />
