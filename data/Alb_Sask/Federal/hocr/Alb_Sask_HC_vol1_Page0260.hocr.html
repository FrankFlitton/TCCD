               Now, there is the position. The First Min- 
               <br />
               ister insists upon the inviolabi‘ity of that 
               <br />
               Act. The ex-Minister of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior</span> ﬁnds 
               <br />
               that under the Act the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minority</span> were en- 
               <br />
               titled to a complete dual <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system.</span> This was 
               <br />
               taken away by an ordinance. If they had 
               <br />
               the right to have them then they have the 
               <br />
               right now in spite of any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ordinances</span> to 
               <br />
               the contrary. I propose a little further on 
               <br />
               to deal with that section which specifically 
               <br />
               continues these rights of the minority in 
               <br />
               force in that country. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pisition</span> then 
               <br />
               is this, that the Prime Minister repudiates 
               <br />
               his speech and accepts a vio ation of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>

               Act of 1875 and accedes to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposition</span> to

               perpetuate a violation of the inviolable. 
               <br />
               There is the position between the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister and the hon member for Brandon 
               <br />

               But let us examine into these clauses for 
               <br />
               a moment, and we shall see just who has 
               <br />
               been making a compromise, who has been 
               <br />
               giving away his rights or his religious opin- 
               <br />
               ions. I ﬁnd that the objections of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) are, ﬁrst, 
               <br />
               that he objects to subsection 2 of section 
               <br />
               16, and it is on account of this clause he 
               <br />
               says that he resigned, because he says that 
               <br />
               in that all the evils which he has dilated

               toba. I Wish to make myself clear, but I 
               <br />
               am not going to be dragged into the discus- 
               <br />
               sion of the merits or demerits of a separate 
               <br />
               school system. That is a matter of which 
               <br />
               I know nothing, and I am simply taking the 
               <br />
               argument and citing the cases cited by the 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite who have had more

               than I have had. He says that he objects

               <br />
               a fallacious construction of that clause to 
               <br />
               which he raises his objection. Now, what 
               <br />
               are his other objections and why did he 
               <br />
               resign? Now, he objects to endowing a 
               <br />
               separate university, he objects to ear-mark- 
               <br />
               ing the public land fund. But what does 
               <br />
               the amendment do? Does it not create and 
               <br />
               endow schools from the same funds? Does 
               <br />
               the amendment make any distinction be- 
               <br />
               tween these two sections? Now, let us 
               <br />
               deal ’with the position as it is. How does 
               <br />
               the amendment change the Bill, if it changes 
               <br />
               it at all? I desire to point out that if the 
               <br />
               rights of the minority to separate schools 
               <br />
               were created under the Act of 1875, and if 
               <br />
               they were entitled under it to a complete 
               <br />
               dual system, then I say that under the 
               <br />
               amendment exactly the same state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> 
               <br />
               will prevail. Let me read subsection 1 of
