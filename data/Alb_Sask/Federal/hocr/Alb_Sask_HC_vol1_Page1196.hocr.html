               what we commonly call a quid pro quo. 
               <br />
               No man in this House at that time assumed 
               <br />
               that that $2,848,000 was a debt to be paid 
               <br />
               over to the province of Ontario in a bulk 
               <br />
               sum at any time, but the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario, in 1894. when their surplus practi- 
               <br />
               cally disappeared, and being desirous of 
               <br />
               placing a good ﬁnancial showing before the 
               <br />
               electors of the province, adopted the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of capitalizing this sum of $142,414 
               <br />
               and said: The Dominion of Canada owes 
               <br />
               us $2,848,000 in cash. Year after year the 
               <br />
               matter was discussed in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario, some holding one thing and some 
               <br />
               the other. I always thought that that $2,- 
               <br />
               848,000 was not a debt owing by this Do- 
               <br />
               minion to the province of Ontario. I was 
               <br />
               led to believe that from the fact that the 
               <br />
               Act that created that subsidy in 1884 de- 
               <br />
               clared that the $142,414 should be paid in 
               <br />
               half—yearly payments to the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario as an additional subsidy. It was 
               <br />
               so declared in the Act and as it was sub- 
               <br />
               sidy and not interest there was no authority 
               <br />
               for capitalizing it. With other questions 
               <br />
               in dispute between the old provinces and 
               <br />
               the Dominion of Canada this same matter 
               <br />
               was referred to arbitrators. and they de- 
               <br />
               clared that the settlement of 1884 should 
               <br />
               be held intact and that this subsidy should 
               <br />
               continue to be paid half-yearly to the pro— 
               <br />
               vinces of Ontario and Quebec. But, this 
               <br />
               is the point that I wish to draw attention 
               <br />
               to. At a later period the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario, still setting up the contention that 
               <br />
               this was capital owing to them, applied to 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) 
               <br />
               for an interpretation of the statute and I 
               <br />
               think we have it on record that the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance has given <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> 
               <br />
               opinion that the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               is entitled to call for that sum of $2,848.000. 
               <br />
               subject to certain conditions, but those 
               <br />
               conditions were conditions that could very 
               <br />
               readily be got over. If I recollect aright, 
               <br />
               the simple conditions were that they 
               <br />
               could be used in the construction of 
               <br />
               public works; so that the conditions 
               <br />
               were of such a minor character that they 
               <br />
               would not constitute a defence for the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada in resisting payment of 
               <br />
               that money. Now what I fear here is that 
               <br />
               probably these new provinces may make a 
               <br />
               demand in the same way, and that some

               <br />
               himself a little short of funds, when his 
               <br />
               surplus may not be quite so large, he will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd each of these provinces coming down 
               <br />

               in solid cash. I desire to call attention to 
               <br />
               this matter because I think we should be 
               <br />
               most explicit in the language and I have

               <br />

               <br />
               done in the case of the province of Ontario. 
               <br />
               I have no doubt that the draughtsman will 
               <br />
               be able to put that language in such deﬁnite 
               <br />
               and explicit form that there will be no dan- 
               <br />
               ger of uncertainty, but I always thought 
               <br />
               that the language of the Act of 1834 was 
               <br />
               extremely definite and very explicit indeed. 
               <br />
               It declared that the sum to be granted to 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario at this time, the 
               <br />
               $142,414 was to be paid as a subsidy and 
               <br />
               not as interest. Here we ﬁnd that the re- 
               <br />
               solution declares tha-t there is a sum of 
               <br />
               interest to be paid half—yearly to this pro- 
               <br />
               vince. I fancy we will ﬁnd as shrewd men 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories as we ﬁnd in 
               <br />
               Ottawa and those men will come down to 
               <br />
               us and say: You are paying us half-yearly 
               <br />
               interest at the rate of ﬁve per cent 
               <br />
               on $8,000,000; and if there is in- 
               <br />
               terest there must be principal, there can- 
               <br />
               not be interest without principal, and there- 
               <br />
               fore without accepting your little sum of 
               <br />
               $200,000 a year we believe we are able to 
               <br />
               manage our own affairs and we want you 
               <br />
               to pay over the $8,000,000 at once. Now 
               <br />
               let there be no uncertainty about this. I 
               <br />
               would ask the Finance Minister before I sit 
               <br />
               down what the real meaning of the clause 
               <br />
               is. Is it to be left open, is it to be left in 
               <br />
               uncertainty, or is the government of the 
               <br />
               same mind as the Minister of Finance was 
               <br />
               of some two or three years ago, and is he 
               <br />
               of that opinion still, that under the wording 
               <br />
               of this resolution, the province of Alberta, 
               <br />
               or the province of Saskatchewan could at 
               <br />
               any time call upon the Dominion for the 
               <br />
               capital sum of $8,000,000 instead of getting 
               <br />
               the allowance of $200,000 per half year in 
               <br />
               perpetuity ? I make no objection to the 
               <br />
               grant of money or to the allowance only I 
               <br />
               say, do not let us fall into the mistake of 
               <br />
               1884, if a mistake was made in 1884, and 
               <br />
               leave it in uncertainty. There is certainly 
               <br />
               more room for the contention in this case
