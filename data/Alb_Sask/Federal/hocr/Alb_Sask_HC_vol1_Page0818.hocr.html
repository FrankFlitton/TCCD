               the province had 40'98 persons in every group 
               <br />

               29'57 ;persons in each 100 group. In 1891 those 
               <br />
               under ﬁve years formed 14'71, and in 1901 14'41

               Much has been said, outside of this House, 
               <br />
               about the Quebec hierarchy, in order to set 
               <br />
               the Potestaut spirit at war with the system 
               <br />

               <br />

               me to thank them for having taken us as

               <br />
