               These last words are sufﬁcient evidence of 
               <br />
               the fact that the Catholic minority of New

               Brunswick might have appealed to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               were not true to their principles. I have

               Brunswick, I have to resent such an ac- 
               <br />
               cusation. My life has not been a life of 
               <br />
               eloquent deliverances, of famous speeches, 
               <br />
               . the echoes of which may have vibrated 
               <br />

               roborate my statement when I say that my 
               <br />
               life has been a life of hard work, of con- 
               <br />
               stant and energetic efforts for the promotion 
               <br />
               of the welfare of my French compatriots in 
               <br />
               the county of Gloucester and throughout the 
               <br />
               province of New Brunswick. None will 
               <br />
               accuse me of having at any time failed in

               my duty towards them as French people 01‘

               <br />
               parliamentary duty on this solemn occasion, 
               <br />
               I have to follow the voice of my conscience, 
               <br />
               refuse to be carried away <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> my incon-

               siderate feelings, and act not according to 
               <br />
               my personal wishes, but after an intelli- 
               <br />
               gent study of the question before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'us,</span> with 
               <br />
               the ambition of translating to our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">core-</span>

               ligionists of the west, all the privileges they

               are entitled to' by the constitution, refrain— 
               <br />
               ing from a desire of inserting cherished 
               <br />
               favours which an appeal to judicial authori- 
               <br />
               ties would at once eliminate after a useless 
               <br />
               excitement of feelings. As a member of 
               <br />
               the minority in New Brunswick, I must 
               <br />
               say that we have had to make a ﬁght 
               <br />
               to gain and hold the position that we 
               <br />
               now have. We made that ﬁght paciﬁ- 
               <br />
               caily. but we made it advantageously. 
               <br />
               feel deeply grieved that the French and 
               <br />
               Catholic minority in the Northwest, which 
               <br />
               is as dear to _me as to any one, will not be 
               <br />
               given by the constitution all the privileges 
               <br />
               that I would like to see them enjoy. But, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I do not despair for all that 
               <br />
               of the Catholic minority and the French 
               <br />

               <br />
               an inspiration for the minority in Manitoba

               to work our own case. We are working it 
               <br />
               out, slowly perhaps, but surely, and during 
               <br />
               the last twenty years the French Acadian

               As I have said, we have occasionally had 
               <br />
               statesmen in our province Who understood 
               <br />
               the rights of minorities, and who under- 
               <br />
               stood that it was the duty of the rulers of 
               <br />
               a country so to legislate that every child in 
               <br />
               the country should be educated, whether 
               <br />
               he was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French,</span> Scotch or Irish. I am

               sure that it is with great regret that the

               right hon. the leader of this government 
               <br />

               <br />
               triots in the west a greater measure of pri- 
               <br />
               vileges, which might place them on a better 
               <br />
               footing. But we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> compelled to 
               <br />
               take the position—I would not call it a hu- 
               <br />
               miliating position, but a constitutional p0- 
               <br />
               sition—that we cannot grant to our co-reli— 
               <br />
               gionists all the privileges that we would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">de—</span> 
               <br />
               sire to give them. In the province of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick we enjoy certain privileges which 
               <br />
               the judges of the Supreme Court of our 
               <br />
               province considered not to have been granted 
               <br />
               by the law of the province and said privi- 
               <br />
               leges were maintained by the court. The 
               <br />
               constitution today can only grant such rights 
               <br />
               and privileges as are possessed by minori- 
               <br />
               ties, Catholic or Protestant, by the law of 
               <br />
               the country. That was the consideration 
               <br />
               upon which the judges of the Supreme Court 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick based their judgment.
