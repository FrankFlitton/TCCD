               cussing the Indian question any more. I 
               <br />
               want to draw attention to the rather pecu- 
               <br />
               liar pos‘ition taken by the hon. leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition in his presentation of his 
               <br />
               case. He made the plea that because there 
               <br />
               was uncertainty in regard to the population 
               <br />
               of the district of Athabaska, therefore the 
               <br />
               delimitation of the constituencies should be 
               <br />
               left to a commission of judges ; but he does 
               <br />
               not propose to leave the representation of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Athabasna</span> to any commission of judges. 
               <br />
               He proposes that this House shall deﬁne 
               <br />
               the representation of Athabaska. He only 
               <br />
               calls in his commission of judges later on 
               <br />
               and for other purposes. Now, it seems to 
               <br />
               me that if he is not going to refer to this

               too much, I might point out that yesterday 
               <br />
               and the day before we were discussing the 
               <br />
               appointment of a commission. The ground 
               <br />
               we took was that it would be fair to appoint 
               <br />
               a commission of judges and have them de— 
               <br />
               limit the whole province. The House dis- 
               <br />
               cussed that proposal and last night the gov— 
               <br />
               ern-ment voted it down. A proposition was 
               <br />
               made to-day by the hon. gentleman from' 
               <br />
               St. Antoine division. Montreal. You voted 
               <br />
               down the commission, you refused to grant 
               <br />
               it. you are stiff necked and obstinate. and 
               <br />
               will not do the thing that is right. If you 
               <br />
               will not do the thing that is right and refer 
               <br />
               the question to a commission of judges, per- 
               <br />
               haps you would take our proposition as to a 
               <br />
               delimitation and see it‘ you cannot get some- 
               <br />
               where near what is a fair, reasonable and 
               <br />
               just distribution. That is the way we 
               <br />
               argue, and I do not see any inconsistency in 
               <br />
               that. I am thoroughly consistent. If I 
               <br />
               want a commission of judges and try to get 
               <br />
               you to accept it, and you will not, then I 
               <br />
               say: If you won’t do the whole thing that 
               <br />
               is right, will you do anything that is right ? 
               <br />
               Here is a plan which I think would be more 
               <br />
               fair and just than yours; will you adopt 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instead</span> of yours? There is no incon-

               trict of Athabas <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{a</span> of which neither he nor

               I are very well informed. he will surely 
               <br />
               take the judgment of this House in re- 
               <br />
               gard to the delimitation of the rest of the 
               <br />
               province in regard to which he and we are 
               <br />
               very well informed. At any rate, his ﬁrst

               <br />
               the population of Athabaska is, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after—</span>

               wards that we should not submit to the

               commission of judges the question of the 
               <br />
               representation of Athabaska, seem to me 
               <br />
               illogical and lacking consecutiveness.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. It is obvious that 
               <br />
               the two amendments were not the same. if 
               <br />
               they were, I could not move them. I

               moved the second. as the member for North
