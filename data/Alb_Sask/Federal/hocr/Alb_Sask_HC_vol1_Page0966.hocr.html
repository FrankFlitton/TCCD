               to lead to a great many complications. We 
               <br />
               have the Finance Minister saying that by 
               <br />
               this process separate schools in the North-

               and will have the effect of multiplying 
               <br />
               them. Now, Sir, with all these opinions 
               <br />
               before us, would it not be inﬁnitely better 
               <br />
               at the present time to drop out these clauses

               of Finance is correct in the view he takes 
               <br />
               that separate schools will disappear alto-

               ing this measure because he believes that 
               <br />
               will be the case. I cannot understand how

               <br />
               support that measure. Therefore, are we

               not drifting in another direction in this 
               <br />
