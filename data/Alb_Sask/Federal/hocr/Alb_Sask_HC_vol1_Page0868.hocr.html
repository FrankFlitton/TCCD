               be the duty of this parliament under those 
               <br />
               conditions? Here is one parliament com- 
               <br />
               pletely clothed with an authority to legislate 
               <br />
               in regard to this subject. On the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hand,</span> 
               <br />
               this parliament, which is attempting to deal 
               <br />
               with this matter, has at most only a doubt- 
               <br />
               ful right, and it has no obligation at all. 
               <br />
               _ It appears to me that the wise, just and fair 
               <br />
               course would be for this parliament not to 
               <br />
               interfere, but to leave it to that other legis- 
               <br />
               lature which has complete jurisdiction in 
               <br />
               the matter. Why is this parliament to as- 
               <br />
               sume a doubtful right and to impose unne- 
               <br />
               cessary obligations upon itself simply for 
               <br />
               the purpose of depriving the legislatures 
               <br />
               of their undoubted right and their obliga- 
               <br />
               tion? I must say that I have implicit 
               <br />
               conﬁdence in the people of these two new 
               <br />
               provinces, I have perfect conﬁdence that 
               <br />
               they will, when the time comes elect to 
               <br />
               their local legislatures men of integrity, 
               <br />
               men of wisdom, who, when the time ar- 
               <br />
               rives for legislation upon this subject, will 
               <br />
               be wanting neither in courage nor in tol- 
               <br />
               eration to pass such legislation and en- 
               <br />
               act such measures as will ensure to the 
               <br />
               Whole people of those two new provinces 
               <br />
               equal rights of civil and religious liberty. 
               <br />
               Another point to which I desire to call the 
               <br />
               attention of the House is the right of ap—

               America Act and which is retained by this 
               <br />
               parliament. A consideration of that right of 
               <br />
               appeal will lead to the conclusion that initi- 
               <br />
               ative legislation in regard to educational 
               <br />
               matters was intended to begin, and should 
               <br />
               begin with the local legislatures. The con- 
               <br />
               stitution provides that there should be a 
               <br />
               right of appeal for the minority. What 
               <br />
               does that right of appeal mean ? Is it limit- 
               <br />
               ed in any way? It is not limited, because 
               <br />
               it assumes that there shall be that right of 
               <br />
               appeal where there is legislation against 
               <br />
               any right or privilege of the minority. Here 
               <br />
               we have legislation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁecting</span> a right or pri- 
               <br />
               vilege of a minority. The right of appeal 
               <br />
               could never be intended to mean an appeal 
               <br />
               from this parliament back to this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment a‘gain. As I understand the right of 
               <br />
               appeal, and as I think every hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               in this House will understand it, it means 
               <br />
               the right to take any matter in controversy 
               <br />
               from an inferior to a superior tribunal 
               <br />
               Now, We are enacting legislation here in 
               <br />
               these Bills <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁecting</span> a right or privilege and 
               <br />
               the constitution says there shall be an 
               <br />
               appeal in regard to that right or privilege. 
               <br />
               How are the minority in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories going to employ the right of 
               <br />
               appeal ? Is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tthere</span> any right of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appeal</span> 
               <br />
               after we pass this legislation ? There is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not,</span> because when the minority of these two 
               <br />
               provinces apply to the legislature to remedy 
               <br />
               what has been passed here and to set rig t

               what has been made wrong against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the%</span> 
               <br />
               rights and privileges, they ﬁnd that the local 
               <br />
               legislature has no power to deal with the 
               <br />
               question. Then they turn to this parlia-

               <br />
               can they come here with any hope of hav-

               so to speak, and therefore that being the 
               <br />
               case I conclude that by this legislation the 
               <br />
               greatest safeguard We hays secured by the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, namely, the 
               <br />
               right to appeal against legislation concern- 
               <br />
               ing a right or privilege in regard to edu-

               cation, is entirely taken away from the 
               <br />
               minority of these provinces. For that rea- 
               <br />
               son I again say that an injustice will be 
               <br />
               done to the minority if this legislation 
               <br />
               is passed. In regard to that matter it has 
               <br />
               been argued here that under the ordinances 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories the people there 
               <br />
               have acquired certain rights which have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> referred to here by hon. gentlemen dis- 
               <br />
               cusssin’g the question as vested rights. I 
               <br />
               want to look at that for a few moments. 
               <br />
               Just at the outset I would ask any hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman who entertains the idea that un- 
               <br />
               less these Bills are passed in the form in 
               <br />
               which they are presented to the House 
               <br />
               these vested rights are going to be swept 
               <br />
               away to strike out of this Bill every word 
               <br />
               and every clause relating to education, then 
               <br />
               read the Bill and see if there is one word 
               <br />
               or sentence that prohibits the establishment 
               <br />
               of separate schools in these two provinces. 
               <br />
               He will look in vain for such. There is not 
               <br />
               a single enactment, or word, or phrase that 
               <br />
               would prohibit the establishment of separate 
               <br />
               schools. It is not so in regard to the ma- 
               <br />
               jority. These Acts are prohibitive as far 
               <br />
               as they concern the majority these Acts say 
               <br />
               to the majority of the people in those new 
               <br />
               provinces: Thou shalt not, to use a scrip- 
               <br />
               tural phrase, but you shall establish a certain 
               <br />
               system of schools in spite of yourselves, no

               matter what your wishes or desires may 
               <br />
               he in the matter. It appears to me that it 
               <br />
               is no more necessary to have this provision 
               <br />
               in these Bills to protect the rights of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ininority‘in</span> these new provinces than it is 
               <br />

               <br />
               the rights of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> and I cannot see, 
               <br />
               in view of what I have already said as to 
               <br />
               my view of the constitution in regard to 
               <br />
               that matter, that there is any necessity for 
               <br />
               it one way or the other.

               <br />
               to that. What are these rights ? Is the 
               <br />
               maintenance of separate schools in these 
               <br />
               provinces a right that has been acquired or 
               <br />
               is it a right that is to be acquired <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per—mam</span> 
               <br />
               ently ? It is an acknowledged principle of 
               <br />
               law that I think no lawyer will contradict 
               <br />
               or dispute that a right cannot be acquired 
               <br />
               against a superior right so long as there is 
               <br />
               notice and there has been no abrogation 
               <br />
               of that superior right. Now, in this parti- 
               <br />
               cular case under discussion, we have both 
               <br />
               the notice, we have the superior rights and 
               <br />
               we have no abrogation of those rights. What 
               <br />
               are those superior rights ? First the right 
               <br />
               to erect or to create portioas of the North-
