               onto newspapers ? I wonder if the aver- 
               <br />
               age farmer of the province of Ontario has 
               <br />
               ever been taught in his school—I hope he 
               <br />
               has—what the Catholic clergy have done 
               <br />
               for this country of ours. I wonder if he 
               <br />
               has been taught that that same clergy have 
               <br />
               rendered eminent and inappreciable services 
               <br />
               to the British Crown during the last 140 
               <br />
               years, especially in the acute and critical 
               <br />
               days of early British rule in America. I 
               <br />
               wonder if he has been taught that, if he 
               <br />
               has been informed of the Catholic clergy's 
               <br />

               the good farmers of the province of On- 
               <br />

               <br />
               clergy in the province of Quebec have re- 
               <br />
               sisted time and again temptations and in- 
               <br />

               days what education in the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               colleges and universities has done towards 
               <br />
               supplying this country with men who have 
               <br />
               gained distinction in literature, in the pro-

               fessions and in agriculture, and who, every 
               <br />
               one will admit, will stand comparison with
