               <br />
               Quebec of their rights. When my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the Minister of Agriculture was making 
               <br />
               that ﬁne appeal to Protestants and Catho- 
               <br />
               lics in this House which he made on the 
               <br />
               second reading of the Bill and when he was 
               <br />
               pointing out the generous treatment which 
               <br />
               was given to the Protestants of Quebec I 
               <br />
               heard a member of this House make the re— 
               <br />
               mark that perhaps if we did less for the 
               <br />
               Protestants of Quebec it would be better. 
               <br />
               I denounce that kind of argument, but I am 
               <br />
               afraid it is going to be the kind of argument 
               <br />
               which is going to be heard later on. The 
               <br />
               Liberal papers of the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               denounce me as an unfaithful supporter of 
               <br />
               the government, they say that I am a dema- 
               <br />
               gogue, they say that I am not a man ﬁt for 
               <br />
               a country like this which is composed of 
               <br />
               Protestants and Catholics, and it is said that 
               <br />
               perhaps if we did a little less for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fanati—</span> 
               <br />
               cal Protestants of Quebec it would be better. 
               <br />
               That is not my policy. There is only one 
               <br />
               kind of justice and that kind of justice must 
               <br />
               be the same for all. Even if all the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces treated us as we have been treated 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories I would still 
               <br />
               say that I am ready to treat the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority of the province of Quebec with 
               <br />
               justice and generosity. If this country is 
               <br />
               to last and to achieve greatness it is not by 
               <br />
               trying to ﬁnd within the four corners of an 
               <br />
               article of the constitution in what way we 
               <br />
               may deprive a minority of a privilege or a 
               <br />
               right. If this country is to last it will only 
               <br />
               be by adopting the principle of equal rights 
               <br />

               gory and all read out of the same list. These 
               <br />
               were the provincial rights for which'the Re- 
               <br />
               form party stood, which the Reform papers 
               <br />
               advocated and which carried that 
               <br />
               party into power in Ontario time after 
               <br />
               time. It was on the same principle 
               <br />
               of provincial rights that the Reform 
               <br />
               party stood in 1896, when they fought 
               <br />
               the Conservative party on the question of 
               <br />
               remedial legislation in Manitoba. It was not 
               <br />
               contended then that the provinces had not 
               <br />
               absolute and sole right in regard to educa— 
               <br />
               tion except in Ontario and Quebec, because 
               <br />
               it was claimed that the provisions in re- 
               <br />
               gard to those two provinces did not apply 
               <br />
               to the others and it was only in connection 
               <br />
               with the debate which took place within 
               <br />
               the last few months that the contention has 
               <br />
               been put forward that no province has the 
               <br />
               absolute right to control its own educational 
               <br />
               affairs. That argument was advanced by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice only a short time 
               <br />
               ago, and the explanation he gave, although 
               <br />
               it may be satisfactory to his own mind, will 
               <br />
               not, I think. satisfy the people of the coun-
