               Let me give another illustration. 
               <br />
               conduct of the right hon. gentleman was 
               <br />
               characterized in the same way upon the 
               <br />
               question of preferential trade. We all 
               <br />
               know, from his reported speeches delivered 
               <br />
               during the time he was in England, the 
               <br />
               position he took upon that question there. 
               <br />
               We know the speech he made in the city 
               <br />
               of Toronto when he returned from Eng- 
               <br />
               land, and we recollect the questions that 
               <br />
               were put to him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> that occasion and the 
               <br />
               answers that he gave. He was charged 
               <br />
               there with having made speeches in Eng- 
               <br />
               land on that question that were entirely in- 
               <br />
               consistent with the position that he took 
               <br />
               before his Toronto audience; and what 
               <br />
               was his conduct when he was accused in 
               <br />
               that way? He had the audacity to tell 
               <br />
               that intelligent audience that when he was 
               <br />
               speaking in Great Britain, he was only 
               <br />
               fooling the people there. or, to use his own 
               <br />
               language, he was only luring them on, thus 
               <br />
               admitting that he was playing a double 
               <br />
               game.

               Let me proceed a little further in this his-

               was a perfect agreement, and that the Bill

               be amended or improved in any particular ; 
               <br />

               House by the power which the right hon.

               gentleman had behind him. But, Sir, the

               very same thing characterized his conduct

               <br />
               another minister from his cabinet. Let us 
               <br />
               take another illustration. .Look at the posi- 
               <br />
               tion taken by the right hon. gentleman in 
               <br />
               1896 upon this very school question. At that 
               <br />
               time, with all the ability and eloquence at 
               <br />
               his command, he stood up and proclaimed 
               <br />
               that the minority of the province of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba should not have remedial legislation at 
               <br />
               the hands of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span> He was then 
               <br />
               denying to the people of his own faith, 
               <br />
               his own church, the rights they were clamour- 
               <br />
               ing for. To—day he is making a complete 
               <br />
               right about face upon that important ques- 
               <br />
               tion. While in 1896 he was declaring hands 
               <br />
               off Manitoba and that the minority should 
               <br />
               not have Separate schools in that province, 
               <br />
               you ﬁnd him to-day just as strongly advocat- 
               <br />
               ing in just as eloquent and forcible language 
               <br />
               that this parliament shall for all time to 
               <br />
               come fasten upon these two new provinces 
               <br />
               the system of separate schools. Again the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman has been playing a 
               <br />
               double game. Let me ask me why he is 
               <br />
               playing this double game ? What inﬂuence is 
               <br />
               it that is making him do so ? It is certainly 
               <br />
               not the advice of the one minster who above 
               <br />
               all others should advise him in this particular 
               <br />
               instance. N , it is due to a pandering to out— 
               <br />
               side inﬂuence and a total disregard of that 
               <br />
               particular minister to whom he should have 
               <br />
               listened. And upon this, the third occasion, 
               <br />
               he has lost the most valuable member in his 
               <br />
               cabinet. 80 I might go through almost every 
               <br />
               branch of the government, nearly every par- 
               <br />
               ticular measure which has come within the 
               <br />
               attention of this government since 1896, and 
               <br />
               draw the very same conclusion I have drawn 
               <br />
               from these two or three matters to which I 
               <br />
               have referred the House.
