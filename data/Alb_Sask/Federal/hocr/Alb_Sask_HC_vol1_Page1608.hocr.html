               there had been anything to the contrary, Mr.

               <br />
               lawyer, would have at once met the point 
               <br />
               I made and told me there was every protec—

               the government agreed to guarantee interim

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chrysler:</span> Is there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> provision

               in the contract whereby a certain 
               <br />
               percentage of the progress estimates 
               <br />
               is reserved until the completion of the 
               <br />
               work. He said: No. I therefore pointed 
               <br />
               out, that, while in the original contract, 
               <br />
               the government might have been willing 
               <br />
               and might safely have issued an interim 
               <br />
               bond which was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject</span> to adjustment and 
               <br />
               would have to he taken up before it got into 
               <br />
               the hands of the public. it would be a very 
               <br />
               different thing to at once issue instead of 
               <br />
               that interim bond a permanent bond that 
               <br />

               <br />
               antee of the government. Mr. Chrysler met 
               <br />
               that in only one way. He said: I assume 
               <br />
               that the government will not issue more 
               <br />
