               been put squarely before the true Liberals

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stead</span> of seeking subterfuges as we have

               parliament and in the country, justice would 
               <br />
               have been done. I know that the elections 
               <br />
               of London and Oxford have been carried 
               <br />
               on just as if this amendment had not been 
               <br />
               presented. Did the electors in London and 
               <br />
               North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Oxford</span> enter into all the ﬁne distinc- 
               <br />
               tions that have been made by the lawyers 
               <br />
               in the House? No, Sir, they were appealed 
               <br />
               to by gentlemen on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House: Don’t vote for Hyman and the Pope 
               <br />
               and Sbarretti. So I say, Sir, if the electors 
               <br />
               of London and North Oxford have shown 
               <br />
               themselves intelligent enough, as I was sure

               they would, to resist that cry, is there a true 
               <br />
               Liberal in this House who will contend that

               upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governmi</span> nt by the member for 
               <br />
               Brandon (Mr. Sifton) they would have gone

               back, they would not have voted for Hyman 
               <br />
               and Sharrettl and the Pope just the same ? 
               <br />
               No, Sir, I repeat what I have said. In the 
               <br />
               discussion on this whole question on both 
               <br />
               sides of the House there has been shown a 
               <br />
               lack of courage and a lack of sincerity that 
               <br />
               is not to the credit of the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada at a time when we are going to 
               <br />
               constitute two of the largest provinces of 
               <br />
               the Dominion. This language which I have 
               <br />
               quoted from Sir John Thompson and the 
               <br />
               Minister of Inland Revenue (Mr. Brodeur) 
               <br />
               disposes of that argument which is now 
               <br />
               made in Quebec by the government's organs, 
               <br />
               by 'Le Canada’ and ‘Le Soleil,’ that if we 
               <br />
               are now bound to submit to the terms dic- 
               <br />
               tated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:by</span> the member for Brandon (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton) it is because the Conservative gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in 1892 did not disallow the ordin— 
               <br />
               ance. That is no excuse: it does not excuse 
               <br />
               the government of 1905 for not doing their 
               <br />
               duty because the government of Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson was not up to their duty.

               <br />
               mained for some time. In 1896 it was re-

               French language was practically the same as 
               <br />
               it was in 1892; but on this point I would like 
               <br />
               to have my mind made clear by some higher 
               <br />
               legal authority than myself. The other day 
               <br />
               I understood some member of this House, 
               <br />
               I do not know on which side, to speak of 
               <br />
               the guarantee given to the minority that 
               <br />
               their language would be taught in the fu- 
               <br />
               ture, in the separate schools- or the public 
               <br />
               schools, and I understood the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice to say that there was no guarantee 
               <br />
               whatever, either in the clause now sub- 
               <br />
               mitted or in the previous one. with regard 
               <br />
               to the teaching of the French language. 
               <br />
               an I ask the minister if I am right on 
               <br />
               that point ?
