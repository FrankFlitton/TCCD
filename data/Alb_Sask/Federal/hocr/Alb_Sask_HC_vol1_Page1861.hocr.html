               upon the conduct of the government of the

               day whether in Dominion or local politics 
               <br />
               on the record of the government. It was 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considerable</span> revelation to me when I 
               <br />
               met this hon. gentleman at Braemar to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that it was a hot campaign of anti-Catho- 
               <br />
               licism from start to ﬁnish and not one word 
               <br />
               about the policy of this government, nothing 
               <br />
               in regard to that phase of the responsibility 
               <br />
               of the government, nothing but popery in 
               <br />
               the beginning, popery in the middle and p0- 
               <br />
               pery in the end. That was the whole song 
               <br />
               of the hon. member who is coming here 
               <br />
               and asking you to pass judgment upon me 
               <br />
               because I crossed swords with him on that 
               <br />
               occasion. What was his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst</span> act when 
               <br />
               he arrived at the meeting? Himself and 
               <br />
               another gentleman landed there loaded with 
               <br />
               newspapers (in a carriage) the London ‘ Free 
               <br />
               Press ’ with all its blazing head lines about 
               <br />
               Sbarretti, the Pope and Hyman, that had 
               <br />
               been used in all those cartoons up there. 
               <br />
               They had their carriage loaded with these 
               <br />
               papers and the hon. gentleman, his friend 
               <br />
               the doctor and the driver started out to dis- 
               <br />
               tribute that stuff the moment they got 
               <br />
               there. That was the ﬁrst thing that I was 
               <br />
               up against. It was a new line to me and 
               <br />
               I appeal to the hon. leader of the opposi— 
               <br />
               tion to say if in the province that I come 
               <br />
               from we carry on elections on questions of 
               <br />
               that kind. We never make an issue of 
               <br />
               that kind. The hon. member at the open- 
               <br />
               ing of the meeting showed his generosity 
               <br />
               by conﬁning myself and another gentleman 
               <br />
               to forty-ﬁve minutes While giving to him- 
               <br />
               self aud his friends two hours. That was 
               <br />
               the very ﬁrst start. If we had been in- 
               <br />
               truders at that meeting, it would have 
               <br />
               been a different thing. We were invited to 
               <br />
               be there. Their posters said that discussion 
               <br />
               was invited. When we went there in re- 
               <br />
               sponse to that invitation we were told 
               <br />
               for-sooth that we would get forty-ﬁve min— 
               <br />
               utes between the two of us and that we 
               <br />
               could do what we liked with that time. 
               <br />
               Mr. McKay spoke for ﬁfteen minutes and 
               <br />
               I occupied the balance of the time. I want 
               <br />
               to point out to you the syllogism or logic 
               <br />
               of this thing to show how it came about. 
               <br />
               The hon. member was not speaking ten 
               <br />
               minutes when he made the statement that 
               <br />
               it had come to a ﬁne pass in this country 
               <br />
               when the laws of the country were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dictatedv</span> 
               <br />
               written and handed to her premier by the 
               <br />
               representative of the Pope. That was the 
               <br />
               very ﬁrst statement.

               once to the hon. member (Mr. Porter) : You

               I will show you that Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
               <br />
               was interrogated on that point, and he did 
               <br />
               not deny it. I challenge the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               now to prove his statement with regard to 
               <br />
               the drafting of that clause. If he can 
               <br />
               prove now that the Minister of Justice did 
               <br />
               not draft that clause, but that His Excel- 
               <br />
               lency Monseigneur Sharretti drafted it, I 
               <br />
               will stand by my promise and resign my 
               <br />
               seat if he will do the same. The hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman (Mr. Porter) said he would resign 
               <br />
               his sent if he did not prove his proposition, 
               <br />
               but he never touched on his proposition at 
               <br />
               all to-night. That is the kind of a gentle- 
               <br />
               man that comes before you to—night pro- 
               <br />
               ducing one half of the evidence only. When 
               <br />
               he made the statement about the party who 
               <br />
               drafted clause 16, number 1 as alleged, I 
               <br />
               said to the people of Braemar: Gentle- 
               <br />
               men, even if it were true that Sir Wil- 
               <br />
               frid Laurier did consult Monseigneur Shar- 
               <br />
               retti about this question, what is there 
               <br />
               wrong in that; this is the man beyond 
               <br />
               all men in Canada who represents the 
               <br />
               religious denomination that is particularly 
               <br />
               affected by this legislation ; and if Sir Wil- 
               <br />
               frid Laurier or any other man at the 
               <br />
               head of a government in this country did 
               <br />
               consult the special representative of a church 
               <br />
               about legislation that concerns it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particuv</span> 
               <br />
               larly, is there anything wrong about that? 
               <br />
               I took occasion to point out that the 
               <br />
               Presbyterian General Assembly was then 
               <br />
               sitting in the city of Kingston, and I said 
               <br />
               that if Sir Wilfrid Laurier went to King- 
               <br />
               ston and spoke to the Venerable Doctor 
               <br />
               Armstrong about something that particular- 
               <br />
               ly concerned the Presbyterian Church, 
               <br />
               would it be fair or honourable for anybody 
               <br />
               in this country to arraign him because, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for-sooth,</span> he consulted the Moderator of the 
               <br />
               General Assembly upon a subject that par- 
               <br />
               ticularly concerned the Presbyterian Church 
               <br />
               in Canada ? That is the argument I used. 
               <br />
               I said to the people that it was cowardly 
               <br />
               and contemptible—I did not mention this 
               <br />
               gentleman’s name—I said it was cowardly 
               <br />
               and contemptible for any man in the midst 
               <br />
               of a Presbyterian and Protestant body, 
               <br />
               and miles away from any Catholic that 
               <br />
               could take his own part, to start a discus- 
               <br />
               sion on religion and denunciatiou of the 
               <br />
               Catholic church, I said such a man was a 
               <br />
               .slanderer and a coward, and I repeat that 
               <br />
               statement now. The House will remember
