               Sir, as I conceive the responsibility which 
               <br />
               rests upon the leader of the Conservative 
               <br />
               party, owing to the declaration which Sir 
               <br />
               John Thompson made in 1894, the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition in arguing thus did not 
               <br />
               discharge his duty. And as to this argu- 
               <br />
               ment of the leader of the opposition I dif- 
               <br />
               fer just as strongly with it, as I am 
               <br />
               opposed to the contention of the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister that the constitution required him to 
               <br />
               pass this legislation. I quite conceîve that 
               <br />
               the declaration of the Prime Minister was 
               <br />
               based upon, not only the legal obligation, 
               <br />
               but upon the moral obligation as well, yet 
               <br />
               even so I cannot agree with him. I ven- 
               <br />
               ture respectfully to say, that the conclu- 
               <br />
               sion that one must come to is, that if we 
               <br />
               are to dispose of this question properly 
               <br />
               and to accept our responsibilities, in the 
               <br />
               true spirit, there should be a declaration 
               <br />
               from both parties as to their policy on this 
               <br />
               question. There should be a declaration as 
               <br />
               to whether you are prepared to say: As a 
               <br />
               matter of policy, as a matter of fairness, 
               <br />
               as a matter of justice, these provinces 
               <br />
               should be deprived of the exclusive right 
               <br />
               to manage their own educational system, 
               <br />
               or, if you are not prepared to say that or 
               <br />
               to controvert it, then, you are not dis- 
               <br />
               charging the responsibilities which rest 
               <br />
               upon you. It is very easy for the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition to say : Let the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion take its course. That standard is 
               <br />
               broad enough to cover every member of 
               <br />
               this House. I hope there are none here 
               <br />
               who are not prepared to abide by the law 
               <br />
               and the constitution, but at all events the 
               <br />
               Conservative party in this country cannot 
               <br />
               get united under that banner, and cannot 
               <br />
               subscribe to the device written on it. We 
               <br />
               have heard _from three or four of the gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen opposite that they are not prepared 
               <br />
               to come under that standard. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron), 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. 
               <br />
               Monk), two of the Conservative leaders 
               <br />
               from the province of Quebec, have told 
               <br />
               us that they are going to support the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment on this issue and that they will 
               <br />
               not subscribe to the splendid device: let 
               <br />
               the constitution take its course. Far be it 
               <br />
               from me to suggest that these gentlemen are 
               <br />
               not loyal ; I would rather say, that it makes 
               <br />
               one hesitate as to whether that device so 
               <br />
               applied is not a sham. Is it a device that 
               <br />
               conveys a meaning which is hidden, or is 
               <br />
               it written so that the leader of the opposi— 
               <br />
               tion and his friends may seek shelter un- 
               <br />
               der it. and so that they may not have to 
               <br />
               declare their policy upon this question, but 
               <br />
               rest content with saying, in the words of 
               <br />
               their leader:

               of his four hours speech, I failed to ﬁnd

               <br />

               withstanding that he is an old champion, 
               <br />
               was playing a new role. After twenty

               years—in this House the member for North 
               <br />
               Toronto (Mr. Foster) branches out upon a

               tely swallowed every principle he once 
               <br />
               cherished upon this question. Speaking

               Now, Sir, this is the language of the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman (Mr. Foster) who in the 
               <br />
               years between 1882 and 1896 supported the 
               <br />
               Jesuits Estate Bill—a Bill which recognized 
               <br />
               if any Bill ever did, the Papal power in this 
               <br />
               country, and which conveyed over $1,000,- 
               <br />
               000 to be disposed of under the dictation of 
               <br />
               the Papal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power.</span> The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster), also supported the ofﬁcial use of 
               <br />
               the dual language in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, and he endeavoured to coerce Mani- 
               <br />
               toba into accepting separate schools. He 
               <br />
               also refused in 1894 to strike out this very 
               <br />
               'clause, which is the cause of all the difﬁ- 
               <br />

               <br />
               son when he said, in 1894:
