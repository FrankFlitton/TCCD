               Now we come to the consideration of the 
               <br />
               school system as we ﬁnd it in the Canadian 
               <br />
               Northwest to-day and which it is proposed 
               <br />
               by statutory legislation to render permanent. 
               <br />
               1n the ﬁrst place we ﬁnd that there exists the 
               <br />
               basic right of dissent, that where, in a com- 
               <br />
               munity, there are Roman Catholic taxpayers, 
               <br />
               these taxpayers may unite and have a separate 
               <br />
               school. They may then elect Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               trustees and these Roman Catholic trustees 
               <br />
               may engage a Roman Catholic teacher. The 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic in the Canadian Northwest to- 
               <br />
               day, cannot be taxed twice and that is prac- 
               <br />
               tically his only advantage. After the 
               <br />
               school has been constituted in the Can- 
               <br />
               adian Northwest, it cannot deviate in any 
               <br />
               particular from the ﬁxed national type. That 
               <br />
               school becomes immediately under the con- 
               <br />
               trol of the government. There is a minister, 
               <br />
               or a commissioner of education and that com- 
               <br />
               missioner of education is aided by a council, 
               <br />
               but mark you, that council is very different 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the council of public instruction such as 
               <br />
               we know it in Quebec. There is a very great 
               <br />
               difference, because, as I said, our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘council</span> 
               <br />
               passes regulations, looks after the administra- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘tion</span> of the schools and is very rarely in any 
               <br />
               way interfered with, but the council which 
               <br />
               exists in the Canadian Northwest is a purely 
               <br />
               advisory body. It has absolutely no right to 
               <br />
               vote. It can simply suggest, counsel, consider 
               <br />
               and make reports. It meets once a year and 
               <br />
               is simply a sort of expert advisory board to 
               <br />
               the government which may accept or reject the 
               <br />
               report submitted to it. The Northwest system 
               <br />
               as I said is completely under the control of the 
               <br />
               government. The Minister of Education is 
               <br />
               himself a member of the government, respon- 
               <br />
               sible to the legislature and to the people, and 
               <br />
               under him there exists a uniform system of 
               <br />
               national schools throughout the Canadian 
               <br />
               Northwest. We have one normal school and 
               <br />
               every one who would be certiﬁcated as a teach- 
               <br />
               er must either pass one examination or go 
               <br />
               through that normal school. No teachers are 
               <br />
               permitted to teach in the Canadian Northwest 
               <br />
               unless they are duly certiﬁcated. It would 
               <br />
               be impossible for members of religious orders to 
               <br />
               teach in these schools as members of these 
               <br />
               orders. They may teach as teachers and cases 
               <br />
               are on record where certain of the nuns have 
               <br />
               been at considerable diﬂiculty and trouble to 
               <br />
               pass through. the normal school at Regina just 
               <br />
               as every one else must do in order that they 
               <br />
               may be qualiﬁed by certiﬁcate to teach in the 
               <br />
               separate schools of the Canadian Northwest.

               Then, I come to the question or religious 
               <br />
               teaching which has so often been referred to 
               <br />
               in this House. It is permissible to open the 
               <br />

               <br />
               to have religious instruction. But that can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               only be given in case the parents themselves 
               <br />
               petition for it and the trustees consent to it. 
               <br />
               In such case a minister or priest may teach 
               <br />
               from half-past three to tour o’clock, but, it is 
               <br />
               specially provided that any scholar may absent

               himself from this teaching if his parents so 
               <br />
               desire. and also that any scholar who may be

               <br />
               his marks counted ltO his advantage in the 
               <br />
               general total. We also ﬁnd that the university 
               <br />
               which they have by recent legislation decided 
               <br />
               to establish in the Northwest shall be strictly 
               <br />
               non-sectarian in principle and that no religious 
               <br />
               dogma or creed shall be taught and no religious

               system in vogue in the Canadian Northwest 
               <br />
               is not only a non-sectarian system, but I mighb'

               system which prevails in the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories, and to illustrate the extraordinary 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">growthrof</span> education in that portion of Can- 
               <br />
               ada. In 1898, there were 509 schools. In 
               <br />
               1904, just six years later, the number had 
               <br />
               more than doubled, having increased to 
               <br />
               1,235. And yet we are informed that to- 
               <br />
               day there are really only twelve separate 
               <br />
               schools in the entire Northwest Territories, 
               <br />
               two of them being Protestant schools. All 
               <br />
               the schools, separate as well as public, have 
               <br />
               regularly and properly licensed teachers. We 
               <br />
               judge of the eﬂiciency of the schools of a 
               <br />
               country by the curriculum that is taught 
               <br />
               in them and by the character of the teachers 
               <br />
               who teach in them. The curriculum of the 
               <br />
               public schools of the Northwest is of the 
               <br />
               highest type and equal, in point of standard, 
               <br />
               to that of any province in the Dominion. 
               <br />
               The efﬁciency and capability of the teache s 
               <br />
               is beyond question. There the salam s 
               <br />
               of teachers are the highest of any 
               <br />
               paid in Canada. The elementary teach- 
               <br />
               ers in the Territories receive from $40 
               <br />
               to $45 a month for their services.

               In the province from which I come a teacher 
               <br />
               in a similar school can not earn more than
