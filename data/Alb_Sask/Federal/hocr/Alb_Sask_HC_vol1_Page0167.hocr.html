               ed. But is this education, Mr. Speaker— 
               <br />
               denominational education? So much has 
               <br />
               been said that is displeasing, that is hurtful, 
               <br />
               we have heard so much about the hierarchy, 
               <br />
               about priestly control, about endowing the 
               <br />
               Catholic Church in the Northwest. I have 
               <br />
               met men who have told me this: We are 
               <br />
               ready to give every facility to our Catholic 
               <br />
               fellow-countrymen in the Northwest, but 
               <br />
               we are not prepared to endow a church. 
               <br />
               This is the way they understood this en- 
               <br />
               actment. Well, it is reasonable, it seems 
               <br />
               to me, to ask ourselves what is in reality 
               <br />
               the effect of this enactment? Is it the 
               <br />
               endowment of a church ? Is it even denom- 
               <br />
               inational education, as they have it freely 
               <br />
               all over England? It is not denominational 
               <br />
               education at all, because that supposes 
               <br />
               that the education in denominational schools 
               <br />
               is entirely under the control of men of a 
               <br />
               particular denomination. It supposes that 
               <br />
               the particular creed of that denomination 
               <br />
               is taught with the same care as other 
               <br />
               branches of knowledge. It supposes that the 
               <br />
               education in the schools, the text books, 
               <br />
               the qualiﬁcations of teachers, all that goes 
               <br />
               to make up denominational education, is 
               <br />
               under the control, not of clerics, not of 
               <br />
               priests or bishops, but of men who belong 
               <br />
               to that denomination. This is not at all 
               <br />
               the character of the education that is being 
               <br />
               provided for in these new provinces. Let 
               <br />
               me just indicate to you what has already 
               <br />
               been indicated, but what cannot be re- 
               <br />
               peated too often in view of what has been 
               <br />
               said, that under the new regime in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories there is no Council of 
               <br />
               Public Instruction. There is a commissioner 
               <br />
               of education who with his department con- 
               <br />
               trols everything that is important in edu- 
               <br />
               cation—controls absolutely the formation 
               <br />
               of school districts, controls everything con- 
               <br />
               nected with normal schools for forming 
               <br />
               teachers; regulates the qualiﬁcations of 
               <br />
               those teachers, and can revoke them at 
               <br />
               any moment ; controls the books, the courses 
               <br />
               of study, the hours, the holidays, compulsory 
               <br />
               attendance of pupils, the requirements of 
               <br />
               the schools in regard to sites and buildings. 
               <br />
               All these matters remain absolutely under 
               <br />
               the control of the government, at present a 
               <br />
               government entirely Protestant. It is true, 
               <br />
               there is an educational advisory board com- 
               <br />
               posed of ﬁve members, two of whom are 
               <br />
               Catholics, to whom these matters are refer- 
               <br />
               red. But that board can only advise; it 
               <br />
               has no power of deciding; and, as a mat- 
               <br />
               ter of fact, the control of education in 
               <br />
               what are called separate schools, though 
               <br />
               they are really not so, is absolutely in the 
               <br />
               hands of the government. What, then, is 
               <br />
               the power of the Catholics under this legis- 
               <br />
               lation which we are called upon to sahct- 
               <br />
               ion ? Well, they engage teachers, but these 
               <br />
               teachers must have the qualiﬁcations which 
               <br />

               <br />
               voked; they provide for the half-hour of 
               <br />
               religious instruction, and they levy the rate 
               <br />
               of taxation; and even in regard to these 
               <br />
               matters they are absolutely accountable to 
               <br />
               the government, are inspected by an in-

               their own creed. Under these circumstances 
               <br />
               I do not think we are imposing a great deal 
               <br />
               on the Northwest Territories, nor introduc-

               <br />
               best proof of that may be found in the 
               <br />
               appreciation given by Archbishop Taché of 
               <br />
               the legislation which at present exists, and 
               <br />
               we are anxious to preserve, because it keeps 
               <br />
               for the minority some shred of what they 
               <br />
               had before. Archbishop Taché, speaking of 
               <br />
               the schools in the Northwest, said :

               The Catholic schools are under the control 
               <br />
               and direction of a council of public instruction 
               <br />
               (now it is a. commissioner) in which there is 
               <br />
               not a Catholic who has a right to vote. The 
               <br />
               choice of all the books, both for'teachers and 
               <br />
               for pupils, is entirely in the hands of Protest- 
               <br />
               ants, as well as the ﬁnal formation ot teachers 
               <br />

               The inspectors may all be Protestants, and

               ing the system of education condemns the

               system and as a matter of fact those who 
               <br />
               have seen that system of schools in opera- 
               <br />
               tion in the Northwest Territories, who have 
               <br />
               been called upon as Catholics to take part 
               <br />
               in it, have time and again been obliged to 
               <br />
               apply to the authorities for the redress of 
               <br />
               grievances which must necessarily take 
               <br />
               place under such a system of law. I shall 
               <br />
               give as an example the case of religious 
               <br />
               orders going up there to teach, nuns and 
               <br />
               Christian brothers. They are obliged to 
               <br />
               qualify under the ordinance of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories and Without this qualiﬁca-

               tion on certain occasions they have not been 
               <br />
               allowed to teach. This has given rise to a 
               <br />
               great deal of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty.</span> As I said before 
               <br />
               everything depends in an educational law on 
               <br />
               the manner in which it is administered and 
               <br />
               what we are claiming by this enactment is 
               <br />
               little enough. The Catholics in the North- 
               <br />
               west will have to a very large extent to 
               <br />
               depend on the generosity and broadminded- 
               <br />
               ness of the majority there in order to be 
               <br />
               able to carry into effect the legal privileges 
               <br />
               which they have kept up to this day. These 
               <br />
               are the reasons which have led me to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that the very least we can do, 
               <br />
               taking my interpretation of the constitution, 
               <br />
