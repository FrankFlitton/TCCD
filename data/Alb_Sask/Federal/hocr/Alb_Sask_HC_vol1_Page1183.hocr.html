               <br />

               <br />
               posal of the provinces was that the limita- 
               <br />
               tions with regard to population should be 
               <br />
               removed. In the resolutions which were 
               <br />
               adopted by the provincial premiers some 
               <br />
               years ago in Quebec, I think they included 
               <br />
               a provision that they should receive eighty 
               <br />
               cents per head up to a certain population, 
               <br />
               but that Where a population was thickly 
               <br />
               settled and its needs would not be so great 
               <br />
               as those of a population sparsely settled, 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subsidy</span> for the additional population

               were paid eighty cents per head of their 
               <br />
               population, ﬁxed I may say in a rather ar- 
               <br />
               bitrary manner. because. so far as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub</span> 
               <br />
               sidies for Ontario and Quebec are concerned, 
               <br />
               they still remain on the basis of the popu- 
               <br />
               lation of 1861, while the subsidies to the 
               <br />
               other provinces are not so ﬁxed. I am not 
               <br />
               complaining of that. The Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance has said that a country sparsely set- 
               <br />
               tled requires more per head than a country 
               <br />
               thickly settled. Assuming that the province 
               <br />
               or Quebec‘doubled its population, I do not ' 
               <br />
               know that it would cost very much more 
               <br />
               to govern it than it'does at the present time, 
               <br />
               because the population might not be in— 
               <br />
               creased by reason of more territory being 
               <br />
               populated, but by reason of the population 
               <br />
               becoming more dense in the ctities, towns 
               <br />
               and villages. However, what I want to draw 
               <br />
               attention to is this, that the principle is 
               <br />
               bad. I do not blame the fathers of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion for the system they adopted in 1867. 
               <br />
               Possibly it was the only way out of the dim- 
               <br />
               culty that they had to deal with. But we 
               <br />
               are on a diﬂerent basis <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> We are 
               <br />
               dealing with a province which has neither 
               <br />
               customs nor excise revenue. Why apply to 
               <br />
               such a province the same principle that was 
               <br />
               applied to the old provinces ? It seems to 
               <br />
               me that an opportunity is offered now of 
               <br />
               getting rid of a bad principle, something we 
               <br />
               do not approve of, but the only one which 
               <br />
               so far as we can see could be acted upon in 
               <br />
               1867.

               I do not see anything in the argument that
