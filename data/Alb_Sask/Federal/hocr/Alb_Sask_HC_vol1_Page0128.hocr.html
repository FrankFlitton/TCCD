               Come with me down to the fair city of 
               <br />
               Halifax and what will you ﬁnd? The Ro—

               <br />
               and leases it to the school trustees. What 
               <br />
               would they say to that in the Northwest ? 
               <br />
               The Roman Catholic authorities receive con- 
               <br />
               sideration and this is one of the means 
               <br />
               whereby we bring about that happy con- 
               <br />
               dition which obtains down there. The sister 
               <br />
               of charity teaches in our schools wearing 
               <br />
               the garb of her order, and many of the sis- 
               <br />
               tcrs are among the best teachers in our 
               <br />
               province. There are schools in the city of 
               <br />
               Halifax which will be pointed out to you 
               <br />
               as Roman Catholic schools, and so they 
               <br />
               are. The Prime Minister once when in 
               <br />
               Halifax visited one of these schools and he 
               <br />
               alluded to it as a separate school, and 
               <br />
               one of the sisters interrupted him and said : 
               <br />
               no, 1Sir, it is a public School of the province 
               <br />
               of Nova Scotia. And so it was, but it was 
               <br />
               a school which was recognized as a Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic school and it was attended only 
               <br />
               by Roman Catholic pupils, and it was taught 
               <br />
               by the Roman Catholic sister of charity 
               <br />
               wearing the garb of her order and the cross 
               <br />
               upon her breast. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“7e</span> have made conces-

               sions to our Roman Catholic brethren in 
               <br />
               the province of Nova Scotia. Why, If a 
               <br />
               vacancy occurs in the teaching staff of one 
               <br />
               of the Catholic schools of Halifax, the 
               <br />
               Protestant commissioners have no vote in 
               <br />
               the selection of a successor; the Catholic 
               <br />
               Commissioners only have the right to vote. 
               <br />
               Such is the system in the city of Halifax, 
               <br />
               and substantially the same system exists in 
               <br />
               many of the larger communities in the prov-

               Let us not conceal from ourselves certain 
               <br />
               facts; let us be frank with one another. 
               <br />
               Let us say that the gravity of this situation 
               <br />
               is even more serious than many think. If 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               is to retire from oiﬁce, as he would be oblig- 
               <br />
               ed to do, if this Bill were defeated, what 
               <br />
               then ? Under ordinary circumstances the 
               <br />
               retirement of a minister or the retirement 
               <br />
               of a government means very little after all. 
               <br />
               The public adapt themselves to new con- 
               <br />
               ditions; one government goes out and 
               <br />
               another comes in. Party interest may suf- 
               <br />
               fer. But that is not the situation to- 
               <br />
               day. There are interests involved in this 
               <br />
               question which far outweigh any mere party 
               <br />
               consideration. What matters it if one gov- 
               <br />
               ernment should go out and another come 
               <br />
               in? But think for a moment of what 
               <br />
               would happen under the present state of 
               <br />
               aiiairs. Some one will say: what matter 
               <br />
               if the Prime Minister goes out, somebody 
               <br />
               else will come in. Sir, no government 
               <br />
               could be formed undersuch circumstances 
               <br />
