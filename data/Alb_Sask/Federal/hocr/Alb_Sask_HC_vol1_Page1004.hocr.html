               Mr. FISHER. What is the object of 
               <br />
               having two sets of books and papers, one 
               <br />

               ciation has agreed to come here and has 
               <br />
               transferred its books here, as all the other 
               <br />
               associations have ? But there is this fur- 
               <br />
               ther to be said. The association at Tor- 
               <br />
               onto was a provincial association. It cal- 
               <br />
               led itself The Dominion Shorthorn Breeders’ 
               <br />
               Association, but it was under a provincial 
               <br />
               charter. The people in Nova Scotia, 
               <br />

               tories and British Columbia want to

               have this work done at the capital

               a very limited extent, I grant, but still to a 
               <br />
               certain extent. The question was thorough- 
               <br />
               ly thrashed out and discussed, and the 
               <br />

               cst request on my part, took the initiative 
               <br />
               in the matter. The live stock men came 
               <br />
               to me last year and asked me to carry this 
               <br />
               out. All that I have done, and all that
