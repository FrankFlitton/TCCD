               that period Japan does not seem to have

               insisted on reciprocal treatment. She gave

               advantage to these nations without getting 
               <br />
               equivalent tariff reduction-s. At that time

               certain judicial and almost administrative

               <br />
               friend from Victoria and Haiiburto’n (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sam Hughes) has said in regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">patents,</span> I 
               <br />
               may say that one clause in these four spe- 
               <br />
               cial treaties entities the respective coun- 
               <br />
               tries mentioned to reciprocal advantages in 
               <br />
               regard to the patent laws. Japanese pa- 
               <br />
               tentees have the same rights within each 
               <br />
               of these foreign countries that the natives 
               <br />
               of these countries have in Japan in regard 
               <br />
               to the patent law. There are also several 
               <br />
               clauses in relation to the shipping trade 
               <br />
               and coast trade; in relation to the privi- 
               <br />
               leges and treatment of the subjects of these 
               <br />
               different countries in Japan and the treat- 
               <br />
               ment of Japanese subjects in these treaty 
               <br />
               countries. These clauses were at one time 
               <br />
               considered to be objectionable to us in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Liew</span> 
               <br />
               of the possibility that Canada might wish 
               <br />
               to discriminate against the Japanese in 
               <br />
               Canada. I am happy to be able to say 
               <br />
               that it is to-day the policy of this govern- 
               <br />
               ment—and I think in that we represent the 
               <br />
               whole people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada—that</span> we should not 
               <br />
               discriminate against Japanese in Canada, 
               <br />
               or think or consider of any such discrimina- 
               <br />
               tion. Therefore in regard to that matter I 
               <br />
               think I may say we are free from any idea 
               <br />
               of fear that this clause in the treaty might 
               <br />
               hamper us in that direction. As a result 
               <br />
               of discussion and consideration, just lately, 
               <br />
               the following des-patch was sent to the 
               <br />
               Colonial Ofﬁce in England, to be transmitted 
               <br />
               to the Foreign Ofﬁce, With the object of in- 
               <br />
               quiring whether the Japanese government 
               <br />
               would overlook the fact that the period
