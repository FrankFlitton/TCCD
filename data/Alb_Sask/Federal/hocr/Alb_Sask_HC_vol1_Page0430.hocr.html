               the remarks of clergymen and public men

               entirely satisﬁed with the school system of

               that country, it may be well to hear what

               the hon. gentleman (Mr. Sifton) has to say

               about the separate schools as they existed in

               <br />
               to a condition of things said to exist over

               twenty years ago, were represented as hav-

               <br />
               that in my constituency there was not a 
               <br />

               of these expressions are very harsh, but I
