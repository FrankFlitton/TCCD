               Now, Sir, hon. gentlemen opposite preach 
               <br />
               to us a great deal about tolerance. We have 
               <br />
               had many lectures read to us on tolerance, 
               <br />
               but I wonder if you can ﬁnd anything that 
               <br />
               has been said on this side of the House 
               <br />
               during this debate so intolerant as the 
               <br />
               speeches of the hon. member for Brandon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yes,</span> 1 will go further, and ask hon. gentle—

               by Conservatives inside or outside of this 
               <br />

               <br />
               the hon. gentlemen themselves in 1896. So 
               <br />
               far as I am concerned. I can point to my 
               <br />
               record in the county in which I live, and no 
               <br />
               one can say that I have not been tolerant 
               <br />
               and just towards the people of all denomi— 
               <br />
               nations. I believe that in that county there 
               <br />
               is no man more respected than I am by the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic people, because I have been 
               <br />
               their friend and they have been my friends. 
               <br />
               I want to say, Sir, that in the county of 
               <br />
               Haldimand, the Roman Catholic people are 
               <br />
               among the best citizens we have in a social 
               <br />
               way and a business way. When you talk 
               <br />
               about intolerance at the last general election 
               <br />
               in the county ot‘ Haldimand, let me tell you 
               <br />
               that Michael McConnell, a splendid type 
               <br />
               of Irish Roman Catholic, was the candidate 
               <br />
               of the Conservative party, and was loyaliy 
               <br />
               supported by that party. We live there in 
               <br />
               perfect harmony, there are no religious cries, 
               <br />
               no religious differences. Although the Catho- 
               <br />
               lic people in Haldimand and Monk have 
               <br />
               some of the best churches in the county, 1 
               <br />
               am glad to say that there are no separate 
               <br />
               schools in that county, their children all go 
               <br />
               to the public schools. That, I believe, is the 
               <br />
               proper system, and I want to place myself 
               <br />
               on record as being an advocate of a public 
               <br />
               school system in this country. I do not be- 
               <br />
               lieve that separate schools are in the inter- 
               <br />

               than they are in the interest of the Protes- 
               <br />
               tant people. I believe the children of both 
               <br />
               Protestants and Catholics should go to 
               <br />
               school together, should play together, and

               friendship formed in boyhood days in the

               <br />

               <br />
               I said to him : ‘ I thought you were :1 Con-

               Bill now before the House simply means 
               <br />

               identical school as other children, with the 
               <br />
               same books, with the same curriculum, the 
               <br />
               same school inspector, the same qualiﬁed 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">teachers—that</span> everything is the same in the 
               <br />
               two systems of schools, only that one is a 
               <br />
               separate school and the other is a public 
               <br />
               school. Now, I want to say that I consider 
               <br />
               that is the most absurd feature in the whole 
               <br />
               Bill. I say that the Prime Minister might 
               <br />
               better have stood by his ﬁrst Bill than to 
               <br />
               give us a Bill which is such as they now de- 
               <br />
               scribe it to be. I want to say, as I have al- 
               <br />
               ready said, that I do not believe that such 
               <br />
               is the case. If, as some hon. members say, 
               <br />
               it is simply a duplication of the public 
               <br />
               school system, why, in the name of common 
               <br />
               sense, should there be two schools, and 
               <br />
               these schools exactly alike? If you had 
               <br />
               granted a church school, then the question 
               <br />
               would have been settled for all time to 
               <br />
               come, and the, Roman Catholic minority 
               <br />
               would have been satisﬁed, but I claim they 
               <br />
               will never be satisﬁed with schools such as

               <br />
               and we have evidence of that in the fact

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{that</span> the hon. member for Dabelle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span>

               <br />
               most ridiculous feature of the whole Bill; it 
               <br />
               is a duplication of the whole system; we 
               <br />
               have two schools exactly alike, as hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen opposite have told us, one on one side 
               <br />
               of the road for Catholics and the other on 
               <br />
               the other side of the road for Protestants. 
               <br />
               That is a ridiculous feature of the Bill, and 
               <br />
               if there were no other reason than that for 
               <br />
               opposing the Bill, it should of itself be a 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient reason. Hon. gentlemen talk about 
               <br />
               the separate schools of the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec. The separate schools of Quebec are 
               <br />
               the public schools, and they are entirely 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerent</span> from the public schools of On-
