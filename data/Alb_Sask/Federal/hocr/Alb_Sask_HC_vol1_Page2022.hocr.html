               Mr. SCOTT. My hou. friends opposite

               applaud the remark. I am, therefore, giving

               an accurate discription of What they have

               attempted. We had some reference here

               a few days ago to 21 Northwest conference 
               <br />
               called by Mr. Haultain and to the matters 
               <br />
               discussed there. I proposed a motion at

               that conference with regard to the redistri—

               <br />
               not as I stated, but was that we should 
               <br />
               hold out together to get our land and min-

               self or by the hon. member for Qu’Appelle 
               <br />

               <br />
               that we should stand out for the absolute 
               <br />
               transfer of our public lands. What I did 
               <br />
               at that conference however, was to attempt 
               <br />
               to get it to take the position—not by mo- 
               <br />
               tion, but by suggestion ; and that is doubt— 
               <br />
               less what has misled the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Alberta—that we should unitedly and resol- 
               <br />
               utely stand out for the principle that the 
               <br />
               public lands belong to the people of the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories and that we should have their actual

               Mr. SCOTT. It is my hon. friend who 
               <br />
               admits the mistake. I suggested that 
               <br />
               we should unitedly take the position, 
               <br />
               and hold to it resolutely, that the lands 
               <br />
               were ours. and that we should get an 
               <br />

               jority of the people of he Northwest, even 
               <br />
               of Mr. Haultain himself—because he has 
               <br />
               said so in a public letter—we have got a
