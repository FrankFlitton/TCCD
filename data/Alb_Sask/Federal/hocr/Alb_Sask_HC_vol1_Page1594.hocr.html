               are the ﬁgures, the total population, the 
               <br />
               total recorded vote, the total number of

               of my hon. friend from Calgary, heard him 
               <br />
               Say that according to the ﬁgures which I 
               <br />
               gave to the House of the registered votes. 
               <br />
               the votes polled and the population, 10 
               <br />
               members ought to be given to the south 
               <br />
               and 5 to the north. That is the point which 
               <br />
               we have to elucidate. I say that the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               which I gave yesterday and the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               which I gave to—day do not warrant that 
               <br />
               conclusion. In so far as I can make any- 
               <br />
               thing out of these ﬁgures there is absolute 
               <br />
               justice done to everybody. How do I make 
               <br />
               that out? I do not know whether my hon. 
               <br />
               friend followed my argument today, but I 
               <br />
               make that out by showing that if you have 
               <br />
               11 constituencies north of Red Deer and 11 
               <br />
               south of Red Deer there are more registered 
               <br />
               votes in the southern constituency than in 
               <br />
               the northern constituency. The difference 
               <br />
               is not great, but I grant that. If you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take</span> 
               <br />
               the population you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘ﬁnd</span> that there are 5,200 
               <br />
               souls more in the north than in the south 
               <br />
               giving there the advantage to the north. 
               <br />
               Under such circumstances, can my hon. 
               <br />
               friend come to the conclusion that any in- 
               <br />
               justice has been done to the south to beneﬁt 
               <br />
               the north? I am sure that the ﬁgures which 
               <br />
               I have given do not show that conclusion.

               Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY. The statement I 
               <br />
               made yesterday was that the local distri- 
               <br />
               bution of 1902 was 9 in the south and 6 in 
               <br />
               the north. I said that on that basis there 
               <br />
               should be 15 in the south and 10 in the 
               <br />
               north. I did not make the statement, or if 
               <br />
               I did I did not intend to make the statement, 
               <br />
               that the division should be as 15 to 10 ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the census of 1901. But the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁg—</span> 
               <br />
               ures show that since the distribution of the 
               <br />
               local house in May, 1902 the inﬂux of popu- 
               <br />
               lation had been south. That was my inten— 
               <br />
               tion ? Then, as to the census the popula— 
               <br />
               tion has more than doubled since 1901 and 
               <br />
               as I understand the right hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               government admits that there are consider- 
               <br />
               ably more voters—I did not catch the exact 
               <br />
               ﬁgures—and a considerably greater number 
               <br />
               of names on the list south than there are 
               <br />
               north. The census being practically ﬁve 
               <br />
               years old it would be a manifestly unfair 
               <br />
               guide to take.
