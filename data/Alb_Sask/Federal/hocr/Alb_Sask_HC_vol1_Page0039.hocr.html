               the farmer, might be considered by that

               committee. And for what purpose? So

               that the committee could call before them

               <br />

               Bill to the Committee on Agriculture. When 
               <br />
               a Bill comes up that is of interest to the

               <br />
               Bill on the one hand and the railways on 
               <br />
               the other. That Bill is sent to the Rail- 
               <br />
               way Committee, where railway interests al- 
               <br />
               ways seem to be dominant. The govern- 
               <br />
               ment iusist on sending it to that committee. 
               <br />
               And with what result? Such Bills are 
               <br />
               nearly always killed in the Railway Com- 
               <br />

               <br />
               regard to ditches and water-courses, giving 
               <br />
               property owners the right to drain across 
               <br />
               the railways. though the farmers are inter- 
               <br />
               ested, the Bill goes to the Railway Com-

               mittee on railways, where the railway in- 
               <br />
               terests are dominant. So, when a Bill is 
               <br />
               introduced in this House which aiïects the 
               <br />

               <br />

               Minister of Agriculture took charge of the

               <br />
               fore the Agricultural Committee. You can- 
               <br />
               not bring the seedsmenhere and ask them 
               <br />
               questions before a Committee of the Whole 
               <br />

               <br />
               evidence here, but there you can take the 
               <br />
               evidence of all parties concerned. While 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> might name a private committee that 
               <br />
               “ould be perhaps equally valuable with the 
               <br />
               Agricultural Committee, still I hold that the 
               <br />
               Agricultural Committee is the proper one 
               <br />
               to deal with this Bill, where it can be con- 
               <br />
               sidered from a farmers’ standpoint, and 
               <br />
               where the farmers themselves can be asked 
               <br />
               their views upon it. If, after doing this, 
               <br />
               we could manage to prepare a Bill that 
               <br />

               <br />
               I am not opposing the Bill, because I be-

               lieve it to be one of great importance, but

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W‘M.</span> WRIGHT. When this Bill was 
               <br />
               in committee I expressed the conviction that 
               <br />
               ir would be found unworkable it it be- 
               <br />
               came law. I think the penalty clause of 
               <br />
               the Bill is objectionable. It provides a 
               <br />
               penalty for selling seed as No. 1 which does 
               <br />
               not come up to the requirements of this 
               <br />
               measure. I want to ask the Minister of 
               <br />
               Agriculture whether he knOWS that seed is 
               <br />
               sold by the wholesale seedsmen of this Dom- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inion-us</span> No. 1. I know from personal ex- 
               <br />
               perience that some of the largest wholesale 
               <br />
               seedsmen in the country do not sell seeds 
               <br />
