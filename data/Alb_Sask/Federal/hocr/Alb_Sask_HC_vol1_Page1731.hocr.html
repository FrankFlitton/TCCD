               <br />
               that election. I asked how that was, and 
               <br />
               he said that when the census was taken

               three years ago every family in the Con-

               necticut valley was counted as belonging

               to Quebec. So I presume the same game

               Mr. LEMIEUX. I have heard another 
               <br />
               story, I was told in Boston that the voters 
               <br />
               came from Ontario, and not from Quebec. 
               <br />
               But even if they came from Quebec, my 
               <br />
               hon. friend should not blame those voters, 
               <br />
               it shows their attachment to Canada, that 
               <br />
               they take an interest in this country, and 
               <br />
               are not annexed to the republic to the south
