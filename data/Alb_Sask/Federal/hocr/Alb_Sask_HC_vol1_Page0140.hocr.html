               unsuited to their needs and conditions, are

               we giving them home rule? But we are 
               <br />
               told that the fathers of confederation ac-

               cepted the principle of separate schools 
               <br />
               rather than jeopardize confederation. Sir, 
               <br />
               the great principle was not that of separate 
               <br />
               schools. The great difﬁculty the fathers of 
               <br />
               confederation had to confront was the dead- 
               <br />
               lock between the different sides of the 
               <br />
               House. It was not the question of separate 
               <br />
               schools which was the disturbing element 
               <br />
               between upper and lower Canada. Not at 
               <br />
               all. But when the fathers of confederation 
               <br />

               sumption on his part that the member for

               <br />
               member for East Grey was in that category. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vell,</span> I think that the hon. member for East

               same rights and privileges with regard to

               separate schools as we gave Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec? I say emphatically no. and I am 
               <br />
               conﬁrmed in that conclusion by the advice 
               <br />
               of that high authority, Mr. Christopher 
               <br />
               Robinson, whose opinion I have cited. In 
               <br />
               my judgment the question we have to settle 
               <br />
               is this. Is it proper to interfere with the 
               <br />
               rights of these provinces in the matter of 
               <br />
               education ? The Minister of Finance says 
               <br />
               there is a moral obligation resting on us to 
               <br />
               do it. But is that moral obligation sufﬁ- 
               <br />
               ciently strong to justify our interfering with 
               <br />
               provincial rights and compelling the major- 
               <br />
               ity of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> to do what they say it is 
               <br />
               impossible to carry out successfully under 
               <br />
               their present conditions. Would that be sound 
               <br />
               policy? These are the questions that ap- 
               <br />
               peal to our judgment to-day. In the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place is it right, as a question of principle ? 
               <br />
               In the second place is it sound as a question 
               <br />
               of policy-9 It might possibly be right in 
               <br />

               schools for all time whether suited to the
