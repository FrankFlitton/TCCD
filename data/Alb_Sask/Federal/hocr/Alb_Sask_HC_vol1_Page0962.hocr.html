               1896 was the most deceptive political cam-

               paign ever carried on in 
               <br />
               fact of the matter is that the people had it

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perfectly</span> ﬁxed in their minds that the Lib-

               when the present administration came into

               opposed to the educational clauses of this 
               <br />

               <br />
               omitting them altogether? But how could 
               <br />

               in favour of leaving the' question of

               <br />
               see that the position of the ‘Globe‘ at that

               who edited that paper at that time take 
               <br />
               a different position in 1905 than that which
