               <br />
               the fact that he waited upon the Apostolic 
               <br />
               delegate at his residence. There is another 
               <br />
               statement that the Papal ablegate presented 
               <br />
               to him these amendments which he desired 
               <br />
               to be put in the school law of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               and that is the question before the people 
               <br />
               of Canada to—day. Did this Archbishop of 
               <br />
               Ephesus, the delegate Apostolic to Canada, 
               <br />
               this delegate of the Pope—did he pre- 
               <br />
               sent these amendments to one of the 
               <br />
               ministers of the province of Manitoba? 
               <br />
               And what were they ? They were in the 
               <br />
               shape of a command that members of 
               <br />
               the government of Manitoba should stultify 
               <br />
               themselves by making provision in the law 
               <br />
               in Manitoba for a separate school establish- 
               <br />
               ment, after it had been refused by the legis- 
               <br />
               lature and by the people of that country, 
               <br />
               and after the right hon. gentleman had .re- 
               <br />
               fused to pass remedial legislation or to take 
               <br />
               any hand in securing remedial legislation 
               <br />
               for the Catholic minority of that province. 
               <br />
               Well, that much has been proved. What 
               <br />
               more has been proved? What more has 
               <br />
               not been denied here <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> ? What is 
               <br />
               singular is that which has not been denied. 
               <br />
               Probably the right hon. gentleman is in no 
               <br />
               position to deny it. Mr. Rogers says :

               This invitation was accepted and His Excel-

               lency then presented the following [memo- 
               <br />
               randum, remarking that if we would place this

               on the statute-book of our province it would 
               <br />
               greatly facilitate an early settlement of our 
               <br />
               mission, the ﬁxing of our boundaries, which 
               <br />
               would be extended to the shores of Hudson 
               <br />
               bay. His Excellency further added that our 
               <br />
               failure to act in the past had prejudiced our 
               <br />

               Now is that true or is it not ? Is it true 
               <br />
               that the delegate of the Pope told this mem— 
               <br />
               ber of the Manitoba government that their 
               <br />
               failure to act in the past had prevented an 
               <br />
               extension of their western boundary, and 
               <br />
               that if they would give him this remedial 
               <br />
               legislation now—for it is remedial legisla- 
               <br />
               tion that he was seeking—they would get

               their request for an extension to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               know to-day if that statement was really 
               <br />
               made. There has been no denial of it to- 
               <br />
               day. The Prime Minister says he cannot 
               <br />
               deny it, but the people of Canada want to 
               <br />
               know if it is true before any such Bill as that 
               <br />
               now before the House is passed. What more 
               <br />
               took place ? There has been no denial to 
               <br />
               another statement of Mr. Rogers, namely, 
               <br />
               that this ofﬁce of Papal delegate to Canada 
               <br />
               was created by the hon. gentlemen opposite, 
               <br />
               or rather was created at their request—there 
               <br />
               is no denial of that. It is known now to 
               <br />
               all the people of this country that we have 
               <br />
