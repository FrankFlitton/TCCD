               Mr. BARKER. In the Bill, the Act of 
               <br />
               1871 is recited as the origin of the authority 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘of</span> this parliament to create this province. 
               <br />
               That is not so. Our authority begins with 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1867. 
               <br />
               That Act was followed by the statute of 
               <br />
               1871 and again <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.by</span> the Act of 1886. and it 
               <br />
               is under the provisions of the whole of 
               <br />
               these three Acts that we are proceed- 
               <br />
               ing to create this province. I submit 
               <br />
               that it is not pr0per to recite a part 
               <br />
               only of the authority. In fact, we on this 
               <br />
               side do not agree with the interpretation of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice, or at all events with 
               <br />
               :the interpretation put by many gentlemen 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(opposite</span> on the Act of 1871. I do not think 
               <br />
               it gave absolute power to this parliament to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">create</span> a province without‘ regard to the 
               <br />
               ; provisions of the Act of 1867. Therefore it 
               <br />
               .is important, in showing our powers here, 
               <br />
               to recite all the Acts under which we are 
               <br />
               proceeding. For that reason I would make 
               <br />
               the full recital. I think that would have 
               <br />
               been the course of a conveyancing counsel 
               <br />
               in settling deeds in matters of importance. 
               <br />
               LIIe Would not omit such important recitals 
               <br />
               as British North America Act and the Act 
               <br />
               of 1886.

               Mr. FITZPATRI'CK. I wish to say that

               it is my intention to drop Bill (No. 157) re— 
               <br />
               specting the district of Mackenzie, and _Bill 
               <br />
               (N0. 158) to amend the Keewatin Act. I 
               <br />
               do not think these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rBills</span> will be necessary 
               <br />
               .in view of the amendments which I propose 
               <br />
               to make to the Northwest Territories Act. 
               <br />
               I am making provision for another system
