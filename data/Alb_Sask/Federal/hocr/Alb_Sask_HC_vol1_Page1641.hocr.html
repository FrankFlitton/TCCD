               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I did not in- 
               <br />
               tend to convey the idea that I thought that 
               <br />
               this matter should be settled between the 
               <br />
               opposition and the government sitting as we 
               <br />
               are now at this table, but I thought this was 
               <br />
               a matter which might well be settled by the 
               <br />
               members who were representing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-</span> 
               <br />
               west Territories. I am sorry it was not done 
               <br />
               in that way. If it were not done in that way 
               <br />
               we might have done it in one of two other 
               <br />
               ways. One way was to refer it to a commis- 
               <br />
               sion of judges as the hon. leader of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition and the hon. member for Calgary have 
               <br />
               proposed. My hon. friend has referred to 
               <br />
               the precedent, as he calls it, of the Bill of 
               <br />
               1899. The Bill of 1899 was introduced for 
               <br />
               a speciﬁc object only and for nothing else; 
               <br />
               that is to say, to rectify certain things which 
               <br />
               the party on this side of the House thought 
               <br />
               had been done injuriously to them. It was 
               <br />
               proposed that certain counties should be 
               <br />
               divided and others united and the Bill pro- 
               <br />
               posed that when there was to be a division 
               <br />
               of a county into two or more ridings the 
               <br />
               work should be done by a commission. but 
               <br />
               at no time was it the policy of the party to 
               <br />
               which I belong that we should entrust the 
               <br />
               work of preparing the constituencies in this 
               <br />
               House, because we had only to deal with 
               <br />
               this House, to a commission of judges. We 
               <br />
               thought that, on the contrary, we should deal 
               <br />
               with that matter in accordance with British 
               <br />
               precedent and that we should have the work 
               <br />
               done by the House itself and not delegated 
               <br />
               to any judiciary authority. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               stated to the House that according to British 
               <br />
               precedent this work should be referred to 
               <br />
               judges, but I beg to say that in this matter 
               <br />
               he is in error. At no time in Great Britain, 
               <br />
               as far as my information goes, and I think 
               <br />
               upon this point it is absolutely accurate, and 
               <br />
               under no circumstances in Great Britain has 
               <br />
               the work of distribution of seats in the

               <br />
               mission of judges. The work has been done 
               <br />

               Mr. Gladstone agreed to the suggestion. The

               the Conservative party were afraid that if
