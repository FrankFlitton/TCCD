               Hon. gentlemen opposite have had read

               ‘Le Soleil’ and other Liberal papers, and

               sought to hold the government responsible

               for their utterances. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               has given his answer. But here is the org-an 
               <br />
               of the Tory party in the city of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hamilton,</span> 
               <br />
               where dwells the chief organizer, as I under- 
               <br />
               stand it—Mr. Barker——and I ask the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition : Is that .the policy of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liberal-Conservative</span> party under him ? 
               <br />
               Well, Sir, if it be, all I can say is that it 
               <br />
               is unworthy of any party or any paper to 
               <br />
               take such a position as that which he has 
               <br />
               taken. Sir, what is implied in it, and what 
               <br />
               is in it ? That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twoﬁfths</span> of the people of 
               <br />
               this country can never expect to have one 
               <br />
               of their number, no matter how gifted, no 
               <br />
               matter how pre—eminent his abilities may 
               <br />
               be. to ﬁll the ﬁrst position in this land; 
               <br />
               he cannot have that position because he is 
               <br />
               :1 French Canadian. That is something 
               <br />
               which I think the people of my province 
               <br />
               will not endorse. That is something which 
               <br />
               the people of this country will not endorse, 
               <br />
               and I hope to hear a repudiation of that 
               <br />
               from hon. gentlemen opposite, for it will be 
               <br />
               better for them to denounce such sentiments

               as that. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:Sir,</span> all I want to say in conclu- 
               <br />
               sion is this: The attempt is made by the 
               <br />
               party opposite, in order to secure power, 
               <br />
               and it is made through their press, to at- 
               <br />
               tack the leader of this government, knowing 
               <br />
               the strong man that he is, and believing 
               <br />
               that if they can strike him down, they 
               <br />
               might then hope to attain ofﬁce, and to this 
               <br />
               end you will ﬁnd such articles as I have 
               <br />
               read to you and such expressions in this 
               <br />
               House. These attacks are made in order 
               <br />
               that he may be struck and that, by striking 
               <br />
               him and by possibly weakening his power, 
               <br />
               they will weaken the party which he leads.

               how? Are these separate schools, as they 
               <br />
               are termed in the Bill, in the Northwest

               them '? Then why have they kept them, as 
               <br />

               <br />
               by the hon. member for Assiniboia (Mr.

               them as a whole, there are several localities

               where the Protestants are in the minority, 
               <br />
               and if in some of these they desire to have 
               <br />
               their minority schools, they are, under the 
               <br />
               law which it is proposed to continue, the 
               <br />

               <br />
               As far as he is concerned, by taking out the

               clauses in the Bill that now gives liberty to

               casion that for three successive elections 
               <br />
               this question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(had</span> been fought and the 
               <br />
               Liberal party sustained, and, therefore, as 
               <br />
               long as grass grew and waters ran, he did 
               <br />
               not feel disposed to go against that will as 
               <br />
               thus three times expressed upon that ques- 
               <br />
               tion. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir,</span> a principle, if it is right, is right 
               <br />
               all the time. If minority rights were sacred 
               <br />
               in his eyes, as he said they were in 1896, 
               <br />
               minority rights ought to be sacred to him 
               <br />
               now, no matter how the election went. Sir, 
               <br />
               I am not going into the question; I have 
               <br />
               spoken once, and I do not want to again 
               <br />
               take the opportunity of doing so. I am re-

               <br />
               have said in their speeches.
