               which I do not, I could quote reports which

               do not bear out all the statements of Mr.

               bers of this House. He also speaks of Grand 
               <br />
               Prairie which has an area of 00 x 20 miles, 
               <br />
               not one quarter of the area of the Canadian

               <br />
               bourhood of Calgary. Will there be a 
               <br />
               denser population in the next six months 
               <br />
               in the Grand Prairie region which is. I sup-

               <br />
               by Mr. Breden are statements showing that 
               <br />
               he is too wrapped up in the future of that 
               <br />
               country to bear disinterested testimony. If 
               <br />
               it is such a grain producing country why has 
               <br />
               it not been developed ? I will not say any-

               thing detrimental to that country. but I will 
               <br />

               bear out what I say. We have been told

               <br />

               <br />
               some information in regard to these steam- 
               <br />

               Mr. PERLEY. The hon. Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior and the hon. member for Strathcona 
               <br />
               gave us some ﬁgures :1 little while ago which 
               <br />
               purported to show that the amendment pro- 
               <br />
               posed by the hon. leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               was unfair to the north, and amongst other 
               <br />
               things they quoted the votes cast at the last 
               <br />
               election. It seems to me that it is very un- 
               <br />
               fair to bring up the number of votes cast in 
               <br />
               the southern part of Alberta when it is 
               <br />
               known perfectly well what the reason was 
               <br />
               last fall why there was a smaller percentage 
               <br />
               of votes cast in the southern part than there 
               <br />
               was in the north. That fact does not prove 
               <br />
               that the voters were not there. I propose to 
               <br />
               show. from the ﬁgures given by the right hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the government, that the division 
               <br />
               between the north and south proposed by 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition is absolutely fair. 
               <br />
               Under his proposition there would be 12 
               <br />
               constituencies south of township 34. Under 
               <br />
               his proposition this mysterious line, township 
               <br />
               38. is changed to township 34 and each of 
               <br />
               the 12 constituencies south of township 3—1 
               <br />
               would have. according to the ﬁgures given 
               <br />
               by the right hon. leader of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span> 
               <br />
               10,153 votes cast at the last election. The 
               <br />
               northern part of township 34 comes almost 
               <br />
               in the middle of the proposed constituency of 
               <br />
               Innisfail. so that I have taken the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               for the constituencies south of the middle 
               <br />
               line of Innisfail, with half of Innisfail and 
               <br />
               that makes 10,153 votes cast at the last 
               <br />
               election. The leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               suggests that they should be given 12 seats, 
               <br />
