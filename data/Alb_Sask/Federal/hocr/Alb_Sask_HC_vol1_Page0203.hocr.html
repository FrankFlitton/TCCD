               observe that on this particular occasion 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition, in conduct-

               ing the debate, if he has control of its 
               <br />
               conduct, is apparently of the view of that 
               <br />
               great American humorist, Mark Twain, who 
               <br />
               declared the less he knew of the subject the 
               <br />
               more ﬂuently he could speak on it. I notice 
               <br />
               that his colleagues sitting beside him, mem- 
               <br />
               bers of a government who themselves, not 
               <br />
               so many years ago, were painfully interested 
               <br />
               in a certain school question, have not so far 
               <br />
               replied to the three ministers of the cabinet 
               <br />
               who have dealt with the question in this 
               <br />
               debate. The duty of replying to one of the 
               <br />
               most important speeches that has been made 
               <br />
               on this occasion has been relegated to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend who has just sat down (Mr. 
               <br />
               Northrup), and I think all will agree with 
               <br />
               me that-n0 serious light has been thrown 
               <br />
               upon the subject, that the speech has not 
               <br />
               done credit either to the cause or its leader, 
               <br />
               nor has it done discredit to the ex-Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior or to the cause which he 
               <br />
               champions. It seems to be the strong point 
               <br />
               in the argument of these gentlemen that 
               <br />
               because they do not see ﬁt to see something, 
               <br />
               that, therefore, it is not there. Now, there 
               <br />
               is no one so blind as he who will not see; 
               <br />
               and the gentleman who can see no difference 
               <br />
               between the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provisions</span> of clause 16 as ori- 
               <br />
               ginally introduced and the provisions as they 
               <br />
               now stand for the approval of the House, is 
               <br />
               certainly very blind; I won’t say that it is 
               <br />
               because he does not want to see, very prob- 
               <br />
               ably it is because he cannot see. The differ- 
               <br />
               ence between these two provisions, as I 
               <br />
               understand them, is radical. I do not say 
               <br />
               that it was intentional. We have had en- 
               <br />
               ough disputations in regard to constitutional 
               <br />
               points in this House during this debate to 
               <br />
               leave us all with the full knowledge that 
               <br />
               there may be honest differences-of opinion 
               <br />
               with regard to all these points. To my mind 
               <br />
               the difference is very important. As stated 
               <br />
               by the ex-Minister of the Interior here to- 
               <br />
               day—and I speak as one who knows some- 
               <br />
               thing of this matter, as one who has had ex— 
               <br />
               perience in regard to school legislation, as 
               <br />
               one of those members of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Assembly who made the change in the 
               <br />
               Northwest school law between what it was 
               <br />
               before 1891 and what it is to—day—I say the 
               <br />
               difference, as I understand it, is a difference 
               <br />
               between clerical control of schools and na- 
               <br />
               tional control of schools. If that is not a 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference,</span> then I do not under- 
               <br />
               stand what we are disputing about. I think 
               <br />
               it is a radical difference. It is what threw 
               <br />
               this country into a turmoil in 1896 and 
               <br />
               caused a change of government at that time. 
               <br />
               It is the reason why those gentlemen are 
               <br />
               sitting on that side of the House instead of 
               <br />
               on this side.

               worry to him that two years ago several 
               <br />
               members representing the Northwest had 
               <br />
               the temerity to vote against his proposal for 
               <br />
               immediate provincial autonomy to the North 
               <br />
               west Territories. He objected very strongly 
               <br />
               to the reasons given on that occasion. I can 
               <br />
               only say that the reasons seemed to be suf- 
               <br />
               ﬁcient to him at the time and afterwards, 
               <br />
               because, although he alleged that the meas- 
               <br />
               ure was immediately important at that time 
               <br />
               it was the last reference he made to it, so 
               <br />
               far as I can recollect, until the measure was 
               <br />
               brought down this year. The reasons given 
               <br />
               were suﬁicient apparently to satisfy him 
               <br />
               that the question was not pressing, was 
               <br />
               not so immediately important. I think I 
               <br />
               can satiSfy the House that there were very 
               <br />
               good reasons why members representing the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories should not be anxious 
               <br />
               to accept the suggestion of provincial au- 
               <br />
               tonomy without knowing very well what the 
               <br />
               terms of that autonomy were to be. I think 
               <br />
               the events of this debate are suﬂicient to 
               <br />
               prove that; and I think what has occurred 
               <br />
               since the opening of this seSSion and since 
               <br />
               these Bills were brought down is evidence, 
               <br />
               if evidence were needed, that western mem-

               agreed to, and possibly have had some in-

               In considering the question of autonomy, 
               <br />
               we have to consider our peculiar position. 
               <br />
               We have to consider our position as compar-

               ed with the condition of other provinces.

               vince of Ontario we may make a compari- 
               <br />
               son. The settled part of the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario is perhaps 400 miles long by 100 
               <br />
               miles wide. In that area is contained all 
               <br />
               there is in Ontario, in the way of agriculture, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> any rate. There are the roads, there are 
               <br />
               the schools, there are all the expenditures 
               <br />
               practically which the provincial government 
               <br />
               has to provide for. In these Northwest Ter-

               ritories, in the province of Saskatchewan. 
               <br />
               we will say, there is an area of 300 by 300 
               <br />
               miles of agricultural country, over which 
               <br />
               agricultural settlement must spread, over 
               <br />
               which roads must be made, throughout 
               <br />
               which schools must be provided and muni- 
               <br />
               cipal institutions taken care of. In Alberta 
               <br />
               we claim a distance of 800 miles in length 
               <br />
               by no less than 200 or 300 miles in width of 
               <br />
               agricultural country, over which settlement

               will spread, throughout which roads must be

               built, municipalities organized and schools 
               <br />
