               <br />
               grave cause. I'know that it is claimed that 
               <br />
               the law of 1875 was a temporary law, that 
               <br />
               it could haVe been abrogated or repealed by 
               <br />
               this parliament at any time and that this 
               <br />
               parliament could do so to-day. That is true, 
               <br />
               but this parliament has not done so and 
               <br />
               the law has remained in force. I know also 
               <br />
               that it is impossible to bind future genera- 
               <br />
               tions by an Act of the present. I know 
               <br />
               that the present generation, if it found any 
               <br />
               special law or even bargain, passed by our 
               <br />
               great grandfathers, to be particularly irk- 
               <br />
               some would feel bound to honour it. 
               <br />
               If it had to be so, if we were positively 
               <br />
               bound by every bargain, possibly entered 
               <br />
               into in good faith by our great grand- 
               <br />
               fathers, there would be no progress made in 
               <br />
               this world, nothing could be changed. But 
               <br />
               on the present occasion, I do not feel that 
               <br />
               there have been any special changes in the 
               <br />
               situation that would warrant us in depart- 
               <br />
               ing from the policy which has been followed 
               <br />
               in the past in regard to the privileges of the 
               <br />
               minority in the Northwest Territories. I 
               <br />
               feel that if I were in a legislative body that 
               <br />
               was properly empowered to deal with the 
               <br />
               matter and I felt assured of the power of 
               <br />
               that legislative body to deal with. it, and 
               <br />
               this question coming before me, it would 
               <br />
               be impossible to pass over the vested rights, 
               <br />
               if I may call them so, and the customs of 
               <br />
               thirty years unless there could be shown 
               <br />
               the very gravest reasons of state for doing 
               <br />
               so. I was interested a short time ago in a 
               <br />
               discussion which I had with a Roman Ca- 
               <br />
               tholic friend in regard to these schools, to 
               <br />
               hear him say that although there had been 
               <br />
               a great deal of legislation from time to time 
               <br />
               and although apparently privileges were 
               <br />
               given to Roman Catholic minorities in re- 
               <br />
               gard to schools they had failed to get what 
               <br />
               they expected or what they thought the 
               <br />
               law gave them and that it was the shadow 
               <br />
               and not the substance which they had ob- 
               <br />
               tained. I was rather surprised at that de- 
               <br />
               claration and I endeavoured to look into 
               <br />
               the events in regard to education in the var- 
               <br />
               ious provinces and see if they would sub- 
               <br />
               stantiate it. In looking over the legisla- 
               <br />
               tion in regard to education, ﬁrst, in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario, I felt that the claim was 
               <br />
               not a good one. In the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               I believe that the compact of confederation 
               <br />
               in regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> schools has been hon- 
               <br />
               ourably kept. More than that I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the law in that respect has been amended in 
               <br />
               such a way as to increase the usefulness 
               <br />
               and proper working of the Act in regard to 
               <br />

               provinces of New Brunswick <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*Nova</span> 
               <br />
               Scotia, iii which no special provision had 
               <br />
               been made and in which at one time there 
               <br />
               appeared to have been a little friction I 
               <br />
               realize that a modus vivendi has been 
               <br />
               found, that, as far as we can judge is satis— 
               <br />
               factory; so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mhat</span> in all these provinces 
               <br />
               there appears to be no ground for this com- 
               <br />
               plaint that I refer to. But, when I come to 
               <br />
               Manitoba and the west the question takes 
               <br />
               on a different appearance. Our Roman Ca- 
               <br />
               tholic friends claims, and I am afraid they 
               <br />
               claim with a considerable amount of force, 
               <br />
               that they have not received entirely what 
               <br />
               they are entitled to, and I cannot say that 
               <br />
               the record in the province is satisfactory in 
               <br />
               regard to the form assumed by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislaq</span> 
               <br />
               tion, or in regard to the reasonable way in 
               <br />
               which the legislation has been introduced, 
               <br />
               or in regard to the way in which the com- 
               <br />
               pacts of legislation have been adhered to. 
               <br />
               And when I come to the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories that are in question now and consider 
               <br />
               the privileges given by the law of 1875 and 
               <br />
               the infringements, if I may call them ‘so. 
               <br />
               of these privileges by the later ordinances, I 
               <br />
               say again there is some ground for the com- 
               <br />
               plaint. In the consideration of the ques- 
               <br />
               tion it struck me that there is a reason and 
               <br />
               that reason, I think, is largely found in this 
               <br />
               fact that the provinces coming together and 
               <br />
               speciﬁcally entering into a bargain as pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, knowing What they had to do, have 
               <br />
               honourably kept that bargain, but when you 
               <br />
               come to provinces such as Manitoba and the 
               <br />
               Territories of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest“</span> who, them- 
               <br />
               selves, have not been parties to the bargain, 
               <br />
               and who have been legislated for rather 
               <br />
               than legislating for themselves, there is a 
               <br />
               difference in their attitude. There is an 
               <br />
               antagonism <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> any restraints we may 
               <br />
               put upon them, and I think in the very

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notion</span> of this province and these Territo- 
               <br />
               ries, there is a warning to us as to the 
               <br />
               manner in which we shall be Wise to deal 
               <br />
               with them and with this question.

               that hope was not borne out by subsequent
