               Mr. LALOIt. I must accept the statement 
               <br />
               when he says he did not make it, but I must 
               <br />
               certainly say that my ears on that particular 
               <br />
               day must have been in a rather strange con- 
               <br />
               dition.

               Mr. BLACK. Your ears were about as 
               <br />
               badly impaired as your tongue is now.

               Mr. LALOR. I think the member for 
               <br />
               Hunts, when he speaks about curiosities has 
               <br />
               presented to the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight</span> as great a 
               <br />
               curiosity almost as we will expect to ﬁ-nd 
               <br />
               anywhere. He has been constantly trying 
               <br />
               to get on his feet to speak, and to assure the 
               <br />
               House that he did not make certain state— 
               <br />
               ments which it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has“</span> been insinuated he has 
               <br />
               made. The Minister of Customs has enter- 
               <br />
               tained us to—night in reference to the election 
               <br />
               in Edmonton. He has told us that if we 
               <br />
               could have got ﬁve men to sign a requisition 
               <br />
               we might have had a candidate out there. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Customs is a gentleman of 
               <br />
               wide experience in election campaigns. 1 
               <br />
               have heard gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">styled</span> as W‘andering 
               <br />
               Willies, but I think the Minister of Customs 
               <br />
               has wandered around a good deal in his po- 
               <br />
               litical experience. He formerly represented 
               <br />
               South Brant in this House. Then the elec- 
               <br />
               tions in South Brant did not go his way and 
               <br />
               he had to go up to Grey. The late member 
               <br />
               for Grey informed me that North Grey was 
               <br />
               a pure county so far as elections were con- 
               <br />
               cerned. that they never knew what it was to 
               <br />
               have a dollar spent in North Grey until the 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs went up there and then 
               <br />
               they spent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$20.0“)</span> in order that he might be. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Customs wandered
