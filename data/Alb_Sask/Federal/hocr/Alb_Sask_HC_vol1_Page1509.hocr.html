               The Minister of Justice also says that

               he has merely deﬁned the word ‘pro—

               friend is too good a lawyer to require

               to be told that express <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> may 
               <br />
               be aiïected by deﬁnition. Here it is 
               <br />
               just the same as if he had substituted a 
               <br />
               new section containing the interpretation 
               <br />
               Which he has given to those words. There 
               <br />
               cannot be any doubt about that. and I know

               that my hon. friend has not any doubt on 
               <br />
               that point. My hon. friend also observed 
               <br />
               at page 6201, unrevised ‘Hansard,’ that un-
