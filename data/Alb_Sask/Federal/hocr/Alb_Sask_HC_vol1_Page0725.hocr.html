               to think not. In my humble opinion, the 
               <br />
               solution which the government has reached 
               <br />
               is an admirable one, and I ﬁrmly believe it

               would be considered good legislation if the

               law to apply to all the provinces, which 
               <br />
               would be on the same lines as that under

               the existing legislation which it is sought to

               the minority or of the majority, and which 
               <br />
               provides for the teaching of the Christian 
               <br />
               religion in which the children have been 
               <br />
               born,—-a law which appears to me to be the 
               <br />
               highest wiSdom in respect of educational

               of Canada more than another, it has been 
               <br />
               religious discord. In these enlightened 
               <br />
               days cannot we be big enough, and broad 
               <br />
               enough, and charitable enough, to take a 
               <br />

               <br />
               ourselves closer in touch with the teachings

               of the Master—the founder of Christianity ? 
               <br />
               Cannot we take the view taught by him 
               <br />
               that charity in the broadest sense of 
               <br />
               the term is the essence of true religion? 
               <br />
               How utterly opposed to that true spirit of 
               <br />
               charity is the position taken to-day by the 
               <br />
               extremists and agitators in both of the great 
               <br />
               religious families. No good ever resulted 
               <br />
               from the discords of the past. No good can 
               <br />
               ever result from such agitations which are 
               <br />
               so foreign to the true spirit ot‘ Christianity.
