               <br />
               proper or unreasonable, the leader of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               tlemen behind him would have tried to do

               men and all of us know, there are circum-

               stances and conditions which govern in the 
               <br />
               distribution of seats besides the mere con- 
               <br />
               sideration of population. It is necessary 
               <br />
               that the people with common interests shall 
               <br />
               be grouped together. And this principle 
               <br />
               which prevented the absolute recognition 
               <br />
               of the equality of representation pre— 
               <br />
               vails in the province of Alberta as it 
               <br />
               does elsewhere. And why should it not? 
               <br />
               And, if in all other parts of the Dominion, 
               <br />
               we regard local conditions and circumstances 
               <br />
               and do not regard only the equality of popu- 
               <br />
               lation, why should we not do the same for 
               <br />
               Alberta ? Although these schedules and 
               <br />
               maps have been before the people of Alberta 
               <br />
               for a month or more there has not been a 
               <br />
               complaint from any section against this dis- 
               <br />
               tribution on the ground that one constituency 
               <br />
               was larger than another. The only com- 
               <br />
               plaint that has been voiced in this House or 
               <br />
               anywhere else is the complaint as between 
               <br />
               the south and the north, and not as between 
               <br />
               constituency and constituency. And when 
               <br />
               these hon. gentlemen presume to argue that 
               <br />
               injustice is proved because one constituency 
               <br />
               has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con</span> votes and the other has 1,000 votes

               House and the country. The evidence is in

               was that there was no attempt to have a

               conference; and when that had to go by 
               <br />

               <br />
