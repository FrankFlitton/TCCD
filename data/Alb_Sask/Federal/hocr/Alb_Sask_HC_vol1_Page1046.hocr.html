               This section is wide enough for all the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enactments</span> which we hope to make by the 
               <br />
               present Bill. It is true that a subsequent 
               <br />
               British North America Act, known as the 
               <br />
               Act of 1886, was passed, which says that 
               <br />
               the Acts must be read together, and it is 
               <br />
               on that point that the hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition bases his argument. He says that 
               <br />
               we must read into that statute these words: 
               <br />
               ‘Subject to the provisions of this Act.’ I 
               <br />
               submit, with all deference to his opinion, 
               <br />
               that those words occurring in section 146 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act of 1867 
               <br />
               apply only to the provinces and colonies 
               <br />
               mentioned in that section. They can only 
               <br />
               apply Where they can be applied ; and they 
               <br />
               cannot be applied to territories. We must 
               <br />
               construe all portions of a statute in such 
               <br />
               a way as to give them their true and rea— 
               <br />
               sonable meaning, and the only way in 
               <br />
               which we can give the words of this section 
               <br />
               ,a reasonable meaning is to apply them to 
               <br />
               the colonies or provinces enumerated in it; 
               <br />
               because by no interpretation which .I can 
               <br />
               imagine, or by nothing in the Act itself, 
               <br />
               can it be said that these words have any 
               <br />
               reference to territories. If there are any 
               <br />
               words about territories in that Act, will 
               <br />
               some hon. member point them out ? I will 
               <br />
               withdraw all I have said it it can be shown 
               <br />
               that within the four corners of the Act of 
               <br />
               1367 there is anything expressed or implied 
               <br />
               regarding territorial legislation or the con— 
               <br />
               stitution of a province out ot‘ territories.

               Now, reading the Acts together, what is 
               <br />
               the rule ? The rule is well established, that 
               <br />
               where there is a general enactment followed 
               <br />
               by a special enactment, the language of the 
               <br />
               special enactment shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governthe</span> language 
               <br />
               of the general enactment. That is a cardi-

               nal rule in the interpretation of statutes. 
               <br />
               I can express it in the language of the text-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> My hon. friend, the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion, says we cannot constitute a province 
               <br />
               on a different basis from that on which the 
               <br />
               other provinces are constituted. .I do not 
               <br />
               know where he ﬁnds authority for such a 
               <br />
               statement, unless it be in a foot note in 
               <br />
               Mr. Clement’s work on the Canadian Con- 
               <br />
               stitution, but that is only an editorial note. 
               <br />
               not supported by any authority. Yet it is 
               <br />
               relied upon in toto by the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition. Can we constitute a province 
               <br />
               ou a diŒerent basis from that on which 
               <br />
               any other province is constituted ? Ishould 
               <br />
               say certainly we can. There is ample 
               <br />
               power given in the Confederation Act, and 
               <br />
               what is more we have done so time and 
               <br />
               time again and our right has never been 
               <br />
               challenged. Why, take the province of 
               <br />
               British Columbia and take section 91 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1867, and 
               <br />
               what do we ﬁnd ? We ﬁnd that although 
               <br />
               by section 91 the question of marriage and 
               <br />
               divorce rests exclusively within the juris- 
               <br />
               diction of the parliament of Canada. yet 
               <br />
               they have their divorce courts in British 
               <br />
