               For, until recently it has been the general 
               <br />
               impressiOn in that country that the whole 
               <br />
               area would be made one province. And that 
               <br />
               has been the View expressed by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) when he 
               <br />
               held meetings in that country last fall. It 
               <br />
               was also the desire of the First Minister of 
               <br />
               the Territories. For my part I can see no 
               <br />
               reason why there should be two provinces. 
               <br />
               1 do not know what objection may he raised 
               <br />
               in the east against creating the Territories 
               <br />
               into one province, but, so far as the people 
               <br />
               of the west are concerned, they would prefer 
               <br />
               that there should be only one province. I feel 
               <br />
               sure that I can speak for the constituency 
               <br />
               l have the honour to represent on that point. 
               <br />
               The reasons are plain. It would avoid the 
               <br />
               duplication of public ofﬁcials and public 
               <br />
               buildings, thus elÏecting a saving to the new 
               <br />
               provinces. and it would be less expensive to 
               <br />
               the Dominion administration as well. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But.</span>

               Sir. it the Territories must be divided into

               two provinces then I say there are several

               objections to the line drawn at the fourth

               law making a brand a badge of ownership 
               <br />
               of cattle and horses, and another province 
               <br />
               may not require any brand at all. One 
               <br />
               province may enact that cattle and horses

               not branded with a registered brand may 
               <br />
               be sold irrespective of the owner. You 
               <br />
               will have these large herds along that 
               <br />
               dividing line, and you break that great 
               <br />
               ranching country into two parts and des- 
               <br />
               troy the range. One province might adopt 
               <br />
               a free open range while another might 
               <br />
               make some restrictions. One province may 
               <br />
               impose a tax on cattle running on the

               range and another will not. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.It</span> is going 
               <br />
               to lead to all sorts of confusion at the 
               <br />
               boundary. Another objection to the line 
               <br />
               as proposed is that it will leave a very 
               <br />
               small proportion of the lands capable of 
               <br />
               irrigation in the eastern province. I un- 
               <br />
               derstand that under the proposed Bill, power 
               <br />
               is going to be retained by the Dominion 
               <br />
               parliament over the question of irrigation. 
               <br />
               though I understood from the remarks of 
               <br />
               the member for Brandon that that would 
               <br />
               only be for a short time until certain in- 
               <br />
               ternational difﬁculties had disappeared, and 
               <br />
               then irrigation would be handed back to 
               <br />
               the respective provinces. Before this dis- 
               <br />
               cussion closes I intend to move an amend— 
               <br />
               ment specifying that this line shall go 
               <br />
               from the 8th range north to the south of 
               <br />
               the Saskatchewan river, then. west along 
               <br />
               the river against stream to range twenty 
               <br />
               and follow that range north. We have 
               <br />
               heard that there is a larger population in 
               <br />
