               who forced the right hon. gentleman to 
               <br />
               change his clause. The Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance had an easy job to gather about him a 
               <br />
               few men who are always ready to follow, 
               <br />
               and who said. unless that change is made 
               <br />
               we cannot support the government. I 
               <br />
               thought the Prime Minister had more force 
               <br />
               of character than that, but he gave way. 
               <br />
               I think I recollect hearing the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman say one day: It takes me some 
               <br />
               time to make up my mind, but when I have 
               <br />
               made up my mind I_ stick to it. He did not 
               <br />
               do it on that occasxon, he gave in. It is a 
               <br />
               dangerous thing for the chief of a party 
               <br />
               to give in once. Well, the consequence was 
               <br />
               that we had clause 16, No. 2, that does not 
               <br />
               mean anything at all. Here I want to re- 
               <br />
               peat what the hon. member for Labelle said 
               <br />
               yesterday in such eloquent language, that 
               <br />
               clause 16 is worse even than the amend- 
               <br />
               ment of the leader of the opposition,I be— 
               <br />

               <br />
               opposition does not prevent Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lics from having separate schools if they 
               <br />
               want <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them,</span> But it this amended section 16 
               <br />
               becomes law, it will for ever prevent the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics from having denomina- 
               <br />
               tional schools in the province of Alberta. 
               <br />
               First of all, as was said yesterday, it is only 
               <br />
               the minority who will have separate schools, 
               <br />
               the majority will have public schools. But 
               <br />
               what kind of schools have they got there ? 
               <br />
               I take the honest word of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance, who said they were public schools 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">everywhere,</span> there are no separate schools 
               <br />
               anywhere. The word ‘separate’ reminds 
               <br />
               me of a story I heard of an old man in Onta- 
               <br />
               rio who was mad because the dual lan- 
               <br />
               . guage had been adopted. He said, you can’ 
               <br />
               talk to me in French or you can talk to me 
               <br />
               in English, but I dare you to talk to me in 
               <br />
               that dual language. We have been speak- 
               <br />
               ing so much about separate schools that 
               <br />
               the word ‘ separate’ has ceased to have any 
               <br />
               meaning. We should speak about denomina- 
               <br />
               tional schools instead of separate schools. 
               <br />
               I ask the Minister of Finance: What is the 
               <br />
               meaning of the word <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘lsciparate’</span> in the law 
               <br />
               which is now before the House ? It will be 
               <br />
               separate schools for the Protestants if they 
               <br />
               are in a minority, and separate schools for 
               <br />
               the Catholics if they are in a minority. We 
               <br />
               mean something when we speak of deno- 
               <br />
               minational schools, but the word ‘separate ’ 
               <br />
               conveys no meaning at all. It follows that 
               <br />
               in places where the Roman Catholics are in 
               <br />
               a majority they must have the public school, 
               <br />
               which is left in the hands of trustees, who 
               <br />
               themselves are responsible to the board of 
               <br />
               education, under the control of a minister 
               <br />
               who has arbitrary powers, and can.dismiss 
               <br />
               the trustees and do anything he likes with 
               <br />
               that educational board. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now the desire for denominational schools 
               <br />
               is no mere caprice. I want my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance to understand that. 
               <br />
               I have a great deal of respect for the Min-

               <br />
               premier of his province, and I will give him 
               <br />
               credit for the fact that the Catholics in the 
               <br />
               province of Nova Scotia, so far as I know, 
               <br />

               <br />
               a word of complaint. So I will give him

               credit of being a broadminded man, so far

               as the question of separate schools in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia is concerned. Well, there is a strong 
               <br />
               sentiment at the bottom of this question of 
               <br />
               schools. I am convinced that it is a good 
               <br />
               sentiment, it is a most respectable senti- 
               <br />
               ment, and I propose soon to read from the 
               <br />
               speeches of some English Protestants to 
               <br />
               show that it is more than a respectable 
               <br />
               sentiment, and we should grant them either 
               <br />
               to the French or the English in order to have 
               <br />
               peace and contentment. Now, Sir, who was 
               <br />
               it that ﬁrst spoke about separate schools in 
               <br />
               this country ? Who was it that ﬁrst object- 
               <br />
               ed to all the children being educated to- 
               <br />
               gether ? I met a gentleman yesterday who 
               <br />
               said, Why should the children not all eat 
               <br />
               the same thing and all eat at the same table? 
               <br />
               I did not think the example was very con- 
               <br />
               vincing; but it meant this: Why should 
               <br />
               not the little Catholic boys go to the same 
               <br />
               school with the little Protestant boys ‘? At 
               <br />
               ﬁrst sight that looks very reasonable. But 
               <br />
               there is something behind all that, and those 
               <br />
               who are not au courant of that sentiment 
               <br />
               cannot understand it, because there is a 
               <br />
               great deal in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> But this idea of separation 
               <br />
               did not start with the Roman Catholics. I 
               <br />
               want to show, and I want it recorded on 
               <br />
               the ‘ Hansard,’ who it was that ﬁrst spoke 
               <br />
               about separating the children in the schools. 
               <br />
               My impression is that we would never have 
               <br />
               heard of separate schools if they had not 
               <br />
               been. asked for by the Protestant population 
               <br />
               of Quebec. 1 am convinced that at the 
               <br />
               time of confederation there was no question 
               <br />
               of separate schools, nobody thought about 
               <br />
               them. It may have been a lack of pru- 
               <br />
               dence on the part of our people, because 
               <br />
               our people are very honest in their way—of 
               <br />
               thinking, they do not apprehend that any- 
               <br />
               body will do them any harm, that is their 
               <br />
               character. But the English population of 
               <br />
               Quebec were more prudent, and I do not 
               <br />
               blame them. We must remember, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, that this question of religion is 
               <br />
               deeply rooted in the heart of every man, 
               <br />
               and you cannot play with it. More than 
               <br />
               that, I want to tell my right hon. friend that 
               <br />
               you cannot compromise with that sentiment. 
               <br />
               You can compromise on everything else, you 
               <br />
               can compromise on the tariff; you can
