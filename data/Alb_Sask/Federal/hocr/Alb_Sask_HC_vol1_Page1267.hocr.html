               Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. A new seat of

               government. I do not think we should take

               Athabaska out of the Territories at the 
               <br />
               present time, but we ought to retain the

               northern boundary of these two new prov- 
               <br />

               <br />
               it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> I believe there is room in that

               country, including Athabaska, Mackenzie 
               <br />
               and the Yukon, to establish a territorial 
               <br />
               government. That territory ought to be 
               <br />
               immediately organized, it should have a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governor-land</span> a council and we ought to 
               <br />
               begin to develop it just as we have deve- 
               <br />
               loped the country to the south of it. I 
               <br />
               believe there will be economic conditions 
               <br />
               developed when we begin to know that coun-

               <br />
               dary of these two new provinces remaining 
               <br />
               for the present at the southerly limit of 
               <br />
               Athabaska, but, if, in later years, we see tit 
               <br />
               to extend the boundary of these provinces 
               <br />
               to the north, we can do it. I believe the 
               <br />
               requirements of the country and the develop- 
               <br />
               ment that is now going on would justify 
               <br />
               the immediate creation of another territorial 
               <br />
               government with a capital some place in 
               <br />
               Athabaska, with some kind of representative 
               <br />
               institutions, a legislative council or a terri- 
               <br />
               torial government similar to what they have 
               <br />
               in the present Territories for that whole 
               <br />
               country including Keewatin, Yukon and 
               <br />
               Franklin. I think that country should have 
               <br />
               a government right away. I spoke here the 
               <br />
               other day about a proposal of the American 
               <br />
               Captain Peary, who is going to the north. 
               <br />
               I read only yesterday a quotation from an 
               <br />
               article <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> "Harper’s Weekly’ containing a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement</span> by Captain Peary, which shows 
               <br />
               that he has a very ambitious project in hand 
               <br />
               and if any one will read this article he will 
               <br />
               observe that the names that he speaks of 
               <br />
               are such as Grant Sound. Grant Land, &amp;c. 
               <br />
               A great deal of the country has been given 
               <br />
               American names, and apparently they are 
               <br />
               attempting to exercise jurisdiction. The 
               <br />
               sooner we organize these territories, estab- 
               <br />
               lish a new territorial government further to 
               <br />
               the north, raise our ﬂag up and put our laws 
               <br />
               in force over that whole country the better 
               <br />
               it will be for us. I do not wish to see the 
               <br />
