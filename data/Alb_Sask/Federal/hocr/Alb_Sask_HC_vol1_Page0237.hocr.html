               We have had some resignations from the 
               <br />
               cabinet in the last few years. The Minister 
               <br />
               of Public Works resigned during the last 
               <br />
               parliament, and the Minister of Railways 
               <br />
               and Canals left the government as well. 
               <br />
               These gentlemen differed from their col- 
               <br />
               leagues on important questions and resigned 
               <br />
               their positions in the cabinet; they thought 
               <br />
               their differences were sufﬁcient to justify 
               <br />
               them in resigning from the government. I 
               <br />
               have very little to say about these hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen, they are not in the House, and there- 
               <br />
               fore I will not say much about them. I 
               <br />
               will say, however, that the people of Can- 
               <br />
               ada were disappointed- in that these gentle- 
               <br />
               men, after having left the government, did 
               <br />
               not go into the country and defend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> 
               <br />
               principles which they considered were in the 
               <br />
               best interests of the people of this country. I 
               <br />
               think it was their duty to go before the elec- 
               <br />
               tors and endeavour to uphold their views. 
               <br />
               But these hon. gentlemen did not do 
               <br />
               that. We have had another resignation 
               <br />
               within the past few days in the case of the 
               <br />
               late Minister of the Interior, who left the 
               <br />
               government upon this school question. He 
               <br />
               just stepped outside the cabinet, some peo- 
               <br />
               ple say he is going back into it. I know 
               <br />
               nothing about that; if he does, some hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the other side will be very 
               <br />
               much disappointed, I am sure. The people 
               <br />
               of Canada expect better things from the 
               <br />
               hon. member from Brandon (Mr. Sifton). He 
               <br />
               had been ﬁghting in opposition to separate 
               <br />
               schools in his own province of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               and he came down to Ottawa and entered 
               <br />
               the government of the right hon. gentleman. 
               <br />
               In the preparation of these Bills. he says 
               <br />
               he was not consulted on the educational 
               <br />
               clauses. Well, I have not much sympathy. 
               <br />
               with the hon. gentleman on that point. He 
               <br />
               had been taking an active part in the pre- 
               <br />
               paration of the western country for pro- 
               <br />
               vincial autonomy. When the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man knew that these Bills were coming 
               <br />
               up to be considered in this House, it was 
               <br />
               his duty, as a representative of the North- 
               <br />
               west, to see to it that the educational clauses 
               <br />
