               House, because we never heard anything of 
               <br />

               <br />
               was one in which we acquiesced in 1903; 
               <br />
               although we at that time thought it should 
               <br />
               go further, and that there should be a com-

               mission of independent men to delimit the 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the two sides of the House by means of 
               <br />
               a committee, and our deliberations, the right

               ascertain whether we could not, in that in- 
               <br />
               formal and private way, come to a conclu- 
               <br />
               sion as to some matters respecting which 
               <br />
               we were likely to diﬂ'er in opinion. We were 
               <br />
               not altogether satisﬁed with the conclusion 
               <br />
               or the conference on that occasion; some 
               <br />
               alterations were made by the right hon.

               proceedings of last night in the ‘ Hansard,’ 
               <br />
               he would have seen that there was a direct 
               <br />
               statement made by three members on this 
               <br />
               side of the House that there was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confer-</span> 
               <br />
               ence held in which the question of the di- 
               <br />
               vision between the two districts was dis- 
               <br />
               cussed, and during which, according to the 
               <br />
               statement of the hon. member for Alberta 
               <br />
               (Mr. Herron), other questions in that con- 
               <br />
               nection were disTcussed; and that the con- 
               <br />
               ference was not continued because it was 
               <br />
               evident from the results of the meeting that 
               <br />
               there was no use in continuing it. There 
               <br />
               was no refusal on the part of members of 
               <br />
               this side to go on, but there was an absence 
               <br />
               of willingness on the part of members on the 
               <br />
               other side of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(House</span> when it was desired
