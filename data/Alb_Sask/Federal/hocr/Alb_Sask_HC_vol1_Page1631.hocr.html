               still point to the fact that the redistribu-

               <br />

               that the seats for these three provisional

               was no serious criticism of this measure.

               only one to introduce an amendment which

               was to the effect that there should be 36 
               <br />
               seats. The question was where would the 
               <br />

               has been something wrong in the distribu-
