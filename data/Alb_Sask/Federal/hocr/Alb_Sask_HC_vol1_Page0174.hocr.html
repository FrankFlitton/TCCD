               every serious minded man will admit

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> under no possible circumstances

               the immigration policy which we have been

               carrying on, and which the government 
               <br />
               proposes to carry on in the future. That 
               <br />
               is a thing which demands the most careful 
               <br />
               thought and consideration at the hands of 
               <br />
               this parliament. It was suggested by 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition, and has been 
               <br />
               suggested by others who take the opposite 
               <br />
               View, that the handing over of the public 
               <br />
               lands of the Territories to the provincial 
               <br />
               government would not seriously interfere 
               <br />
               with the conduct of immigration. Well, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, I have had on my shoulders the 
               <br />
               duty of carrying on a policy of immigration, 
               <br />
               and of harmonizing the operations of the 
               <br />
               lands department of the government and 
               <br />
               of the immigration department for the last 
               <br />
               eight years, and it taxes the efforts of the 
               <br />
               department to the utmost, when both the 
               <br />
               land department and the immigration 
               <br />
               branch are in the same hands and under 
               <br />
               the same control, to avoid the difﬁculties 
               <br />
               which constantly present themselves in the 
               <br />
               administration of this work. It would be 
               <br />
               difﬁcult satisfactorily to carry on that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">won;</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">even</span> if we had the land department in an- 
               <br />
               other branch of the same government; it 
               <br />
               would be embarrassing and difﬁcult to an 
               <br />
               extent that few men appreciate who have 
               <br />
               not had the duty of actually carrying on this 
               <br />
               business. But if you hand over the land 
               <br />
               to three provincial governments—because 
               <br />
               you would have to treat Manitoba in 
               <br />
               the same way as you are treating the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories—if</span> you hand over the land 
               <br />
               .to three separate provincial governments.

               if the federal government has to deal with

               <br />
               I do not know that we could blame them 
               <br />
               very much if they did so. But if they did

               I would say that nothing could be done
