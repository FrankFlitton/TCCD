               Fortunately the territorial government has 
               <br />
               been so far most satisfactory and we must 
               <br />
               be careful now not to undo any of the 
               <br />
               good work that has been done in the past. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst provision of this Bill which I 
               <br />
               want to discuss relates to the ﬁnancial terms 
               <br />
               arranged for the new provinces. They, of 
               <br />
               course, are the most important ones, at 
               <br />
               least they are very important to the well- 
               <br />
               being of the provinces, and looking at them 
               <br />
               as a whole I may say that the representa- 
               <br />
               tives of the Territories are satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               the provision which has been made. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that the income which has been pro- 
               <br />
               vided for them will enable them to conduct 
               <br />
               their internal affairs in a satisfactory man- 
               <br />
               ner. They are not in the position of re— 
               <br />
               _ mittance men. They have had a fair set- 
               <br />
               tlement and they can go on and develop the 
               <br />
               country in a perfectly independent manner. 
               <br />
               Each province will have over a million dol- 
               <br />
               lars to start with and as their population 
               <br />
               increases so will their income, and thus 
               <br />
               they will have increasing means with the 
               <br />
               increasing demands which will be made 
               <br />
               upon them for the support and establish- 
               <br />
               ment of schools, roads and different public 
               <br />
               improvements of one kind or another. If 
               <br />
               the lands were handed over to the provinces 
               <br />
               they have to be used immediately as a 
               <br />
               source of income. We would have to get 
               <br />
               revenue out of them. The present policy 
               <br />
               of the Dominion government is to settle the 
               <br />
               lands and not to make them a revenue- 
               <br />
               producing property. Every settler that 
               <br />
               goes into the Northwest is a valuable asset 
               <br />
               to the Dominion of Canada. He contributes 
               <br />
               to the general revenue so that it is a great 
               <br />
               beneﬁt to the Dominion, and looking at it 
               <br />
               from the purely ﬁnancial point of view it 
               <br />
               is proper that the government should get 
               <br />
               as many settlers into the country as pos- 
               <br />
               sible, but as these settlers necessitate ex- 
               <br />
               penditure on the part of the provinces it is 
               <br />
               also necessary that their income should in- 
               <br />
               crease with the advent of new people. If 
               <br />
               the lands had been handed over to the new 
               <br />
               provinces it would be a most difﬁcult mat- 
               <br />
               ter to determine the interests of each. A 
               <br />
               large amount of land in the Territories has 
               <br />
               already been disposed of and it will be al- 
               <br />
               most impossible to say how much was 
               <br />
               taken from one or the other and to adjust 
               <br />
               matters between them. Under the proposi- 
               <br />
               tion as adopted all trouble of this kind is 
               <br />
               avoided and there is no material for dispute 
               <br />
               between the provinces. Beth are satisﬁed 
               <br />
               with the liberality of the terms and feel 
               <br />
               that they have been fairly dealt with. 
               <br />
               Many possible complications have been dis- 
               <br />
               posed of by this settlement and there is no 
               <br />
               room for further discussion in the matter. 
               <br />
               In regard to the boundary question, I 
               <br />
               believe that the division of the Territories 
               <br />
               has been a most ideal one. There was at 
               <br />
               one time some difference of opinion as to 
               <br />
               Where the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«line</span> should be. Many people con-

               sidered that the north country, bounded by 
               <br />
               the North Saskatchewan river, should be 
               <br />
               made into one province and that the south 
               <br />
               country should be made into another pro- 
               <br />
               vince. I myself at one time held that 
               <br />
               opinion, but on further considering the mat- 
               <br />
               ter and hearing the views of others express- 
               <br />
               ed, I can easily see that this is an equally 
               <br />
               good division, and we are all satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               it. Only one objection, and one only, has 
               <br />
               been raised against the dividing line de- 
               <br />
               cided on, and on examination that objection 
               <br />
               proves to have very little force. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Calgary (Mr. M. S. McCarthy) 
               <br />
               states that the 104th meridian will divide 
               <br />
               the ranching country and that confusion is 
               <br />
               likely to arise between the different cattle 
               <br />
               brands in the new provinces. If this objec— 
               <br />
               tion were a valid one, it would entail taking 
               <br />
               the boundary east to the western boundary 
               <br />
               of Manitoba, which would be out of the 
               <br />
               question. There are cattle brands extending 
               <br />
               all over that country, and therefore the 
               <br />
               adoption of another boundary would not re- 
               <br />
               move what he regards as a serious objection. 
               <br />
               It would entail making this whole territory 
               <br />
               into one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«province.</span> I consider then that the 
               <br />
               present dividing line is as nearly ideal as is 
               <br />
               possible, and that the two provinces will be 
               <br />
               closely equal in their present population, in 
               <br />
               their prospects of increased population, in 
               <br />
               their natural resources and in the income

               There has been much discussion on the 
               <br />
               subject of the extension of the Manitoba 
               <br />
               boundaries to the west. On this question I 
               <br />
               am fully in accord with the sentiments of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Assiniboia (Mr. 
               <br />
               Turriﬁ') and the hon. member for Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan (Mr. Lamont). To quote the words of 
               <br />
               the latter-gentleman, I believe that if such 
               <br />
               an extension were seriously contemplated 
               <br />
               it would raise such a storm in the west that 
               <br />
               our friends of the opposition who talk so 
               <br />
               persistently of the agitation of public 
               <br />
               opinion, of conﬂagrations and storms, would 
               <br />
               really see what 3. Northwest hurricane does 
               <br />
               mean. In this case they would not have to 
               <br />
               whistle for a breeze. The storm would be 
               <br />
               on them in very short order. There is no 
               <br />
               question, Mr. Speaker, as to the temper of 
               <br />
               the west on this subject. Public opinion is 
               <br />
               crystallized, and they have very clear-cut 
               <br />
               ideas on the subject. That opinion is grow- 
               <br />
               ing every day. There was a time when union 
               <br />
               with Manitoba might have been accepted, 
               <br />
               but dating from the day of that meeting held 
               <br />
               at Indian Head, a joint meeting which Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain and Mr. Roblin, premier of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba, attended, and at which meeting Mr. 
               <br />
               Roblin actually threatened to hold up the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories if they did not accede 
               <br />
               to his desires in this matter, there has been 
               <br />
               a change of sentiment. From the moment 
               <br />
               that Mr. Roblin attempted to tell these peo— 
               <br />
               ple that if they did not consent to join with 
               <br />
               Manitoba, if they did not fall in with his 
               <br />
               views at that time expressed, he would 
               <br />
               make certain reprisals upon them, a feeling
