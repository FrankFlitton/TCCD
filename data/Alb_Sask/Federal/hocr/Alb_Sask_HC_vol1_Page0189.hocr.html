               seems to be oblivious of the terms on which 
               <br />
               Manitoba came into confederation. It came 
               <br />
               in under very peculiar circumstances. The 
               <br />
               people of Manitoba treated with the people 
               <br />
               of the Dominion and made a compact. The 
               <br />

               <br />
               toba alike wished to have a provision for 
               <br />
               separate schools. We all know the history 
               <br />
               of these things ; We know that it was un- 
               <br />
               certain whether the Roman Catholics or 
               <br />
               the Protestants would be in the majority in 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and it being wholly uncertain 
               <br />
               whether there would be an invasion of R0- 
               <br />
               man Catholics from Quebec that would 
               <br />
               make Manitoba a Catholic province, or an 
               <br />
               invasion of Protestants from England and 
               <br />
               Ontario which would make it a Protestant 
               <br />
               province, the Roman Catholics and Protest- 
               <br />
               ants combined in asking the legislature to 
               <br />
               make such provisions that the minority would 
               <br />
               have separate schools. And so it was that 
               <br />
               the Act was passed, an Act not worth very 
               <br />
               much on its face, but being a compact be- 
               <br />
               tween the people of Manitoba and this Do-

               <br />
               that one of the conditions we insisted on

               <br />
               wished to do was, as loyal Canadians to

               it was intended to give separate schools to 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and that this legislation was 
               <br />
               strong enough to give them had it been

               wiped that clause out of the statute-book

               minion of the protection they had, is that 
               <br />
               no one can conceive of any circumstances 
               <br />

               <br />
               Ottawa with a stronger case than that 
               <br />
               with which Manitoba came here.‘ Every 
               <br />
               one knew that separate schools were meant 
               <br />
               to be given, that the attempt was made to 
               <br />
               then give it, and that it was believed that 
               <br />
               that attempt was effective. Every one knew 
               <br />
               that Manitoba itself understood that the 
               <br />
               separate schools were established. And, 
               <br />
               under these circumstances, the strongest 
               <br />
               that could arise, the minority in Manitoba 
               <br />
               came asking us not to coerce the province, 
               <br />
               but to give the minority the rights which, 
               <br />
               it was intended to give them. And when 
               <br />
               the government of the day, though anxious 
               <br />
               to live up to the spirit of confederation and 
               <br />
               protect minorities , they were prevented from 
               <br />
               doing so by the right hon. Prime Minister 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Sir</span> Wilfrid Laurier). If the local legis- 
               <br />
               lature of Quebec should repeal every law 
               <br />
               that has been made to assist the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority since confederation—and many of 
               <br />
               them have been passed—if the provincial 
               <br />
               legislature of Ontario should repeal the laws 
               <br />
               under which the separate schools of that 
               <br />
               province have been maintained, they have 
               <br />
               the legal power to do it. It is beyond 
               <br />

               <br />
               forbearance of-the majority. All the pro-

               visions for the protection of separate 
               <br />
               schools under the constitution are practi- 
               <br />
               cally worthless because they are unwork- 
               <br />
               able. Therefore, I say the right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) should speak 
               <br />
               with some reticence on the educational 
               <br />
               question in view of the lament-able exper—

               <br />
               right hon. gentleman himself. I would not 
               <br />
               have dealt with this subject of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               had it not been referred to by the Prime

               Minister in presenting the Bill, and last

               evening by the Minister of Customs (Mr.

               <br />
