               <br />
               the Minister of Customs has a record on 
               <br />
               this very question. In what thundering

               <br />
               against provincial rights. Where is he to- 
               <br />
               day ? Is he a friend of the Northwest, or 
               <br />
               does he believe in the school clause as it is, 
               <br />
               and has he been one of those who has fa- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               statements he made in 1896 were as strong 
               <br />
               as ginger; were stronger in fact. Does he

               stake. And. like the autocratic Czar oi 
               <br />
               Russia, the Prime Minister rushing his Bill 
               <br />
               in before his ministers can get together to 
               <br />
               consult him. declaring the Bill to embody his 
               <br />
               doctrine and the doctrine on which he is 
               <br />
               bound to stand. What is the weakness of 
               <br />
               the Czar of Russia to-day ? It is because 
               <br />
               he does not consult the people; it is worse 
               <br />
               than that: it is because while not consult- 
               <br />
               ing the people he consults only the Grand 
               <br />
               Dukes. The Prime Minister of Canada is in 
               <br />
               the same position to-day. The people, are 
               <br />
               the 500,000, out in the west for whom he 
               <br />
               legislates. Who are the grand dukes? We 
               <br />
               know right well whom he has not con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               sulted if there has been any consulting. I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">am</span> bound to say that. if anybody is to be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consulted</span> it is the members of this House 
               <br />
               primarily, and it is essentially the repre-

               sentatives ot‘ the people of the great North-

               west for whom we are legislating in this 
               <br />
               matter. When my friend the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition put his question and put his case 
               <br />
               to—day, every man in this House noticed 
               <br />
               how he was answered. The question was: 
               <br />
               Why so much haste to get the Bill down 
               <br />

               ministers could arrive here, when three

               weeks have since elapsed without a step 
               <br />
               in advance ? That was a fair honest ques- 
               <br />
               tion. What was the answer the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman gave? Did he himself believe 
               <br />
               în that answer ‘? Did any man who heard 
               <br />
               him believe in it ? He tried to make it ap- 
               <br />
               pear that this delay was all due to the fact 
               <br />
               that my hon. friend from Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
               <br />
               asked him not to be in too great a hurry to 
               <br />
               bring on the second reading of the Bill. I 
               <br />
               ask the right hon. gentleman now: Is that 
               <br />
               the reason of this delay of three weeks ‘? 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman knew it was not

               the attention of the Prime Minister to the 
               <br />
               fact that this is all the worse because there 
               <br />
               are now two departments of government 
               <br />
               which are in hypothec, so to speak; they

               nominal headship of my old friend Sir 
               <br />
               Richard Cartwright, but Sir Richard Cart- 
               <br />
               wright is in another House. and the deputy

               minister is not physically able to transact 
               <br />
               the business. That is not a live depart-

               <br />

               us how little anybody else know about that
