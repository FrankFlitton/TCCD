               try under the sun and they advocate Cal- 
               <br />
               gary as the seat of government. When you 
               <br />
               pass along to Red Deer they say they have 
               <br />
               got the ﬁnest country, and that Calgary or 
               <br />
               Edmonton are not in it with Red Deer. So 
               <br />
               it is when you reach Edmonton. Now they 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«are</span> to be credited for that spirit, and I 
               <br />
               have no fault to ﬁnd with it. But knowing 
               <br />
               that to be true. and knowing that a govern— 
               <br />
               ment seat is to be chosen for the new pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Alberta, it is evident that great 
               <br />
               efforts will be put forth by the people of 
               <br />
               these three towns to obtain the government 
               <br />
               seat. That is common sense, that is per- 
               <br />
               fectly true, and no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man,</span> can deny it. Now 
               <br />
               at the time these schedules were to be pre- 
               <br />
               pared. in whose hands were they placed ? 
               <br />
               They were placed in the hands of two gentle- 
               <br />
               men. one representing Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) 
               <br />
               and the other Strathcona (Mr. Talbot).

               government. Now these two gentlemen had 
               <br />
               the preparation of these schedules. We have

               and acting. in their interest, and in their

               <br />
               of the Interior at that time was a private

               <br />
               not representing Alberta or Calgary. As a

               result, what did the member for Strathcona 
               <br />
               admit in this House? Why, he said, I 
               <br />
               looked over Athabaska, I ﬁgured out all
