               farcial part of the play. The session was 
               <br />
               called. The Minister of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Interior (Mr, 
               <br />
               Sifton), previous to calling the session, had 
               <br />
               to go away to a health resort. He was so 
               <br />
               nervous he could not help with the Bill, and 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister thought it not well to 
               <br />
               advise him of the clauses of the Bill for 
               <br />
               fear of the effect it might have upon his 
               <br />
               nerves. The Bill was introduced in his 
               <br />
               absence. It was introduced also in the ab- 
               <br />
               sence of the Minister of Finance who also 
               <br />
               had a call away from Ottawa before this 
               <br />
               parliament was called. Parliament met. 
               <br />
               The Bill was introduced. The Prime Min—

               ister. contrary to all parliamentary usage, 
               <br />
               made a great speech on the introduction of 
               <br />
               the Bill. Two days afterwards the ex—Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rSifton)</span> comes home 
               <br />
               on the run. When he came here he did not 
               <br />
               look at all as if lie-had been sick. As soon 
               <br />
               as he read the First Minister’s speech, play- 
               <br />
               ing his part of the Act, he tendered his resig- 
               <br />
               nation. But he came back again. He came 
               <br />
               back under an arrangement it is said. And 
               <br />
               the arrangement was this: After the row, 
               <br />
               and after he had resigned, an amended 
               <br />
               clause was to be brought down by the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, which is practically the same as 
               <br />
               the original clause, but the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(ax-Minister</span> of

               appointed High Commissioner for Canada 
               <br />

               ballot in his hand, only waits for next elec-

               Mr. FIELD‘ING. I do not think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the hon. 
               <br />
               member for West Toronto (Mr. Oszler) has paid 
               <br />
               me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> compliment of trying to understand 
               <br />
               what I was presenting to the House. Again I 
               <br />
               repeat—and I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">want</span> to guard against any mis- 
               <br />
               apprehension, I want to give the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man who said ‘ shame ’ an opportunity to say 
               <br />
               it again, because I want to_ state the situation 
               <br />
               as it actually exists. I say this is becoming a 
               <br />
               religious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> Who denies it ? My hon. 
               <br />
               friend the leader of the opposition said as much 
               <br />
               to—day.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I beg my hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend's</span> 
               <br />
               pardon, I said nothing of the kind. It so under- 
               <br />
               stood. I desire to disclaim any such intention. 
               <br />
               I argued this question, as my right hon. friend 
               <br />
               the First Minister did in the ﬁrst instance, on 
               <br />
               the constitutional ground, because in his re- 
               <br />
               marks to this House, both on the 21st February 
               <br />
               and again <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'to-day,</span> he put the question solely on 
               <br />
               that ground.

               Mr. FIELDING. The point is not important. 
               <br />
               I understand my hon. friend, the leader ot the 
               <br />
               opposition, to have spoken, in the course of. his 
               <br />
               speech <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vto—day,</span> of the religious dlﬁerences which 
               <br />
               unhappily would arise in this matter. I think 
               <br />
               that will be found somewhere in ‘Hansard'; 
               <br />
               but it is not important, and if he says he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span> 
               <br />
               no allusion of the kind, I withdraw the remark. 
               <br />
               But I say that it is in the minds of a large 
               <br />
               portion of the people ot Canada a religious 
               <br />
               question. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take</span> the responsibility of saying— 
               <br />
               and every man opposite knows it—that this 
               <br />
               question to-day is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">largely</span> shaping itself as a 
               <br />
               religious question. We have on the one side 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholic body, largely united and 
               <br />
               on the other side a large portion or the Pro- 
               <br />
               testant body who are agitating against this 
               <br />
               Bill on What may be called religious lines. I
