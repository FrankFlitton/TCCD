               of our own honour, to maintain those rights 
               <br />

               constitutional, it will be so declared by the 
               <br />
               courts. If the minority, under section 93 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act, have full 
               <br />
               protection, this Act is surplusage. The same 
               <br />
               question would arise if we went beyond 
               <br />
               what section 93 assures, if we gave more 
               <br />
               than they have at the present time, or if we 
               <br />
               took from them something which has always 
               <br />
               been secured. But we are merely assuring 
               <br />
               to them the rights which they possess at 
               <br />
               the present time. In this connection, let me 
               <br />
               say that we have before us three drafts of 
               <br />

               As I at ﬁrst felt under my interpretation 
               <br />
               of our Constitutional Act, I assumed that in 
               <br />
               regard to all school legislation the Act of 
               <br />

               <br />
               back to the 1st of July, 1867, and I say that 
               <br />
               that disposition of law went even farther 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the date of the Union in 1867, the min-

               ority in these new provinces might proper-

               <br />
               the present time and therefore under that

               <br />
