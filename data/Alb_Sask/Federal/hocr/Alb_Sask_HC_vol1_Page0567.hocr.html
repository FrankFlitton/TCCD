               or eight years; you brought him for those 
               <br />

               <br />
               own him. If that is not cowardice, then

               But my right hon. friend does worse than

               <br />
               this country, and says: ‘If Monseigneur

               other, which is more searching still: When

               <br />

               other representative of every other church.

               But can you compare a bishop of the Me-

               thodist church or a bishop of the Anglican 
               <br />
               church with Monseigneur Sbarretti? Who 
               <br />
               does not know that, with my right hon. 
               <br />

               <br />
               holds out a hope, through his authority of 
               <br />
               a fulﬁlment that can be given by no other

               church or collectiOn of churches in this 
               <br />
               country. Now, I can see that some one 
               <br />
               will rise on the other side and declare that 
               <br />
               I have made an incendiary speech. Why. 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman himself, seeing 
               <br />
               that he had no argument, had to have re- 
               <br />
               course to that kind of declamation, and it 
               <br />
               was very signiﬁcant of the weakness of

               <br />
               my respect for Monseigneur <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Sbarretti</span> by 
               <br />
               clearing him of the imputations which the 
               <br />
               position of my right hon. friend fasten-s up- 
               <br />
