               Toronto ‘ Globe ’ had said : that it was not a

               question of separate schools versus national 
               <br />
               schools ; it was purely a question of provin- 
               <br />
               cial rights. That is to say, it was a dry 
               <br />
               constitutional subject, purely a matter of 
               <br />
               constitutional law, and on that principle the 
               <br />
               Toronto ‘ Globe ’ took its stand. The Toron-

               <br />
               not care to take that view of the question, 
               <br />

               What was the spirit that guided the fathers 
               <br />
               of confederation in 1866 and 1867 ? Surely it 
               <br />
               was the spirit of toleration ; more than that, 
               <br />
               it was the spirit of solicitude for the con- 
               <br />
               scientious convictions, not to say the un- 
               <br />
               doubted rights, of minorities; and the same 
               <br />
               spirit which actuated the fathers of con- 
               <br />
               federation in 1867 should actuate us in 1905 
               <br />
               when we are extending confederation—be- 
               <br />
               cause it is really one and the same thing. 
               <br />
               In organizing these Territories into prov- 
               <br />
               inces, we ﬁnd that the minority has been 
               <br />
               for over a quarter of a century in possession 
               <br />
               of certain school privileges. I say we should 
               <br />
               respect these rights. Nay, more, we should 
               <br />
               put it beyond per-adventure that these rights 
               <br />
               shall be maintained to them. It has become 
               <br />
               the fashion to say that these minority rights 
               <br />
               amount to very little, that they are very 
               <br />
               triﬂing, and, therefore, we may leave them. 
               <br />
               While such may be the fact, I do not think 
               <br />
               that in itself would constitute a ground 
               <br />
               for perpetuating those rights. The ground 
               <br />
               is broader and deeper than that. It has 
               <br />
               its root and being in a great and gen-~ 
               <br />
               erous principle, and that is, respect and care 
               <br />
               that the weaker party be protected and be 
               <br />
               treated with consideration, so that its con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdence may be won and retained. I would 
               <br />
               not seek to make this Bill palatable by say- 
               <br />
               ing that it is nothing. I would say that by 
               <br />
               law and by right the minority have certain 
               <br />
               educational privileges in the Northwest, and 
               <br />
