               ﬁrst been arranged by a conference between 
               <br />
               the tWo sides. Five commissioners were 
               <br />
               appointed on the 29th of November 1884, 
               <br />
               and on-the 5th of December they began 
               <br />
               their preliminary work. Shortly afterwards 
               <br />
               the judges called in Ofﬁcers of the Royal 
               <br />

               <br />
               ter the preliminary divisions had been map- 
               <br />
               ped out, notice was given of an inquiry in 
               <br />

               inquiry much additional valuable informa—

               tion was obtained, and the commissioners 
               <br />
               were able to make many improvements in 
               <br />
               the preliminary boundaries. This took place 
               <br />
               even in a country so-thickly populated and 
               <br />
               so well known as Great Britain, in England,

               <br />
               gentleman stood by that principle in 1899. 
               <br />
               Whether or not the measure which he intro- 
               <br />
               duced then was a measure for a complete 
               <br />
               redistribution, or whether, as he says, it was 
               <br />
               a measure to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">correct</span> wrongs in the redis- 
               <br />
               tribution previously made, is immaterial; 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman then stood upon 
               <br />
               the principle and I quote his language : 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The principle which we want to lay down and 
               <br />
               which we act upon is this, that whenever a 
               <br />
               oounty has to be divided into ridings, whenever 
               <br />
               a, county which up to that time is entitled to 
               <br />
               only one member, becomes entitled to two or 
               <br />
               three members, the division should take place 
               <br />
               by judicial decision and authority.

               <br />
               hon. gentleman stood then, and I repeat 
               <br />
               once more, it is not only a principle which 
               <br />
               is absolutely applicable to the delimitation 
               <br />
               of ridings in these new provinces, but it is 
               <br />
               one which is tenfold more necessary in those 
               <br />
               new provinces than it was in Ontario when 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman laid down that

               him a few moments ago. I asked him how it 
               <br />
               was that the voting strength in these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ—</span> 
               <br />
               ent ridings varied so remarkably, and the 
               <br />
               only answer he has made to me is that 
               <br />
               Stony Plain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> a rural constituency and Cal- 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst place 
               <br />
               the principle of giving less representation to 
               <br />
               a, city constituency has never been ap- 
               <br />
               plied to cities of the size of Edmonton 
               <br />
               and Calgary ; certainly no such principle as 
               <br />
               that was acted upon in the redistribution of 
               <br />
               Ontario in 1903, and I challenge my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend to point to one instance in Onta- 
               <br />
               rio where any such principle was act- 
               <br />
               ed upon. It was applied to Toronto and 
               <br />
               Montreal, 1 do not remember that it was 
               <br />
               applied to any other cities although it may 
               <br />
               possibly have been taken into consideration 
               <br />
               with regard to Hamilton or Ottawa, but cer- 
               <br />
               tainly in no cities of less size and import- 
               <br />
               ance than those to which I have just refer- 
               <br />
               red. Therefore it seems to me we can put 
               <br />
               aside at' once any suggestion of that kind 
               <br />
               We then acted upon the basis of population; 
               <br />
               we are acting upon the basis of population 
               <br />
               to—day according to the hon. gentlemen op- 
               <br />
               posite, and we have 584 who voted in 
               <br />
               Stony Plain, and 2,052 in Calgary. But we 
               <br />
               shall leave that aside. We have 608 in Red 
               <br />
               Deer and 1,168 in Medicine Hat. Are there 
               <br />
               any natural divisions ‘? Are there any local 
               <br />
               conditions ? Are there any municipal divi- 
               <br />
               sions which make it necessary that there 
               <br />
               should be such a discrepancy? 
               <br />
               the electoral lists we ﬁnd for Stony 
               <br />
               Plains, 748 and for Calgary, 2,682. 
               <br />
               Omit Calgary if you please, and we have 
               <br />
               Stony Plains with 748 and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pinrcher</span> Creek 
               <br />
               with 1,678. The right hon. gentleman, when 
               <br />
               we draw this discrepancy to his attention, 
               <br />
               suggests that we desire to deprive Stony 
               <br />
               Plains of representation. We desire nothing 
               <br />
               of the kind. We desire to have some prin- 
               <br />
               ciple whereby the electors of Stony Plain 
               <br />
               will have just the same voice and repre- 
               <br />
               sentation in parliament as those in Pincher 
               <br />
               Creek and I do not know that there is any 
               <br />
               reason why they should have more. There 
               <br />
               is a reasonable allowance to be made. That 
               <br />
               allowance has been ﬁxed at 10 per cent in 
               <br />
               the case of the Transvaal. I do not know 
               <br />
               any reason why you should depart from 
               <br />
               that principle. I do not know why you 
               <br />
               should have Stony Plain with 748 and Pin- 
               <br />
               cher Creek with 1,678, an allowance of mere 
               <br />
               than 100 per cent instead of 10 per cent as 
               <br />
               in the Transvaal. The right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has no answer to this except the suggestion 
               <br />
               that a rural voter should have more voice 
               <br />
               than a city voter. The constituency of Pin- 
               <br />
