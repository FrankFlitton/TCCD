               province of Manitoba had been extended 
               <br />
               westward, even if it were only one meri-

               tional argument of the Prime Minister into 
               <br />
               a cocked hat. And if Manitoba were ex-

               tended westward, that portion included in it 
               <br />

               <br />
               could be settled in a local way, and which 
               <br />
               should not be spread out in the Dominion

               as I am concerned, I wish to tell him now 
               <br />
               that no legislation of the character that he 
               <br />
               has introduced without consulting the peo- 
               <br />

               <br />
               will be associated with me in that work.

               a statement which will clear them of the 
               <br />
               charge made to-day. The denial which has 
               <br />
               been made is no denial. It is not even an 
               <br />
               explanation to the country, which to-day is 
               <br />
               demanding that an answer be made to the 
               <br />
               statement made in that letter of Mr. Rogers 
               <br />
               and no answer is forthcoming. The people 
               <br />
               want to know if those two propositions were 
               <br />
               submitted to the Minister of Public Works 
               <br />
               of Manitoba. The people want to know if 
               <br />
               there was a reference in that interview to 
               <br />
               the question of the Manitoba boundaries; 
               <br />
               and, if it is true, they want to know what 
               <br />
               the government of Canada intend to do. 
               <br />
               We know what President Cleveland did 
               <br />
               with the British ambassador. The moment 
               <br />
               he was trapped into making a statement 
               <br />
               which he should not have made, President 
               <br />
               Cleveland gave him his passport. I Say 
               <br />
               that the right hon. gentleman, as a member 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Dominion government, and the forty

               with him, are bound to send Mr. Russell to 
               <br />
               Rome, even at the expense of the Dominion.
