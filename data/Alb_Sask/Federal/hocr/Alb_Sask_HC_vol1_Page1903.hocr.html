               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Before this 
               <br />
               motion is disposed of, I think it is due to 
               <br />
               the House that I should give reasons Why 
               <br />
               it cannot be accepted by the government. I 
               <br />
               venture to express the opinion that when, 
               <br />
               in a few years from this, my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) reviews 
               <br />
               the events of this day, he will have no cause 
               <br />
               to rejoice or feel proud of the position he 
               <br />
               has assumed. The motion he has made, in 
               <br />
               my estimation, cannot be defended in any 
               <br />
               way, either on the ground of constitutional 
               <br />
               rights or usefulness to the race to which he 
               <br />
               and I belong ? The object of this motion 
               <br />
               is to limit the right of the new provinces in 
               <br />
               the matter of language and to do for the 
               <br />
               French language what we have done for 
               <br />
               the schools. This proposed legislation would 
               <br />
               crystallize the use of the French language 
               <br />
               in the provinces, to a large extent at all 
               <br />
               events, if not absolutely. There is great 
               <br />
               difference, my hon. friend will admit, be— 
               <br />
               tween the position given to the French 
               <br />
               language under the constitution and that 
               <br />
               given to the schools. My hon. friend has- 
               <br />
               not attempted this afternoon to base his 
               <br />
               motion upon anything that can be found in 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. That Act 
               <br />

               the matter is very different. There is no

               use discussing again the provision of the

               discussing it for months. But let me re- 
               <br />
               peat, for the purpose of this debate, that the 
               <br />
               law says in, so many words, that where a 
               <br />
               separate school system is found to exist 
               <br />

               <br />
               be given the privileges provided in section

               93. No such prirvilege,-however, exists for 
               <br />
               the use either of the English or French or 
               <br />

               <br />
               stand my hon. friend even to attempt to 
               <br />
               pretend that the constitutional right which 
               <br />
               he claims for the French language in the 
               <br />
               Territories is to be found in the four corners 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act. There— 
               <br />
               fore let any such contention as this be 
               <br />
               discarded. There is nothing in the British 
               <br />
               North America Act to support the motion 
               <br />
               made by my hon. friend. Where then is the 
               <br />
               constitutional right invoked by my hon. 
               <br />

               Ottawa in 1870, after the important events 
               <br />
               of the year before in that distant part of 
               <br />
               the country. The delegates who came to 
               <br />
               Ottawa, in my judgment—and I submit it 
               <br />
               as a fact which belongs to history—did not 
               <br />
               represent the whole people of Rupert’s 
               <br />
               Land. They represented simply a portion 
               <br />
               of the people of Rupert’s Land. No doubt 
               <br />
               they claimed to represent the whole peo- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plæthe</span> people not only of Red River <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colony;</span> 
               <br />
               but also of Rupert's Land. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">/It</span> is easy to 
               <br />
               show in any public document that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peoé</span> 
               <br />
               ple of such and such a place profess to 
               <br />
               represent the whole country just as the 
               <br />
               three tailors of Tooley Street said: ‘We 
               <br />
               the people of England.’ It was easy for the 
               <br />
               delegates to say : ‘ We represent the people 
               <br />
               of Rupert’s Land’; but there was super— 
               <br />
               abundant reason why they could not repre— 
               <br />
               sent the whole people of that section of 
               <br />
               country. They represented only the people 
               <br />
               of the Red River valley, because—and I 
               <br />
               submit this also as a matter of history— 
               <br />
               there were no White people then except in 
               <br />
               the valley of the Red River. There were no 
               <br />
               white people in the valley of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskata</span> 
               <br />
               chewan. I doubt even if there were any, 
               <br />
               except a few isolated individuals, anywhere 
               <br />
