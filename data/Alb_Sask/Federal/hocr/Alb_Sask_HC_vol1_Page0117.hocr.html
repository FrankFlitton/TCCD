               tions other than the constitutional question

               and greater than the constitutional question

               venture to proceed to discuss before 
               <br />
               this House. Now, the ﬁrst question to be 
               <br />
               considered, only for a moment, because, 
               <br />
               happily, there is no division of opinion upon 
               <br />
               it. is whether or not the time has come 
               <br />
               when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.we</span> shall give a provincial con- 
               <br />
               stitution to these new Territories in 
               <br />
               the west. Happily, I say, there is no differ— 
               <br />
               ence of opinion on that. It is now thirty- 
               <br />
               ﬁve years since these lands were acquired 
               <br />
               and brought under the control of the Can- 
               <br />
               adian authorities. From the beginning, 
               <br />
               governments and legislatures have gone on 
               <br />
               preparing the people for the work of self- 
               <br />
               government. At an early stage the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba was carved out and set up in 
               <br />
               housekeeping. At a later stage the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories were given another form 
               <br />
               of organization. That form was developed 
               <br />
               from time to time and at this moment they 
               <br />
               have in the Northwest Territories a very 
               <br />
               considerable measure of self-government, 
               <br />
               but inasmuch as it fails short of the ordin- 
               <br />
               ary powers, privileges and authority .of a 
               <br />
               province, we all agree that the time has come 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\vhœi</span> we shall give a provincial constitution

               Mr. FIEDDIN-G. I think some opinions

               have come from the other side of the House 
               <br />

               <br />
               that for the purpose of arguing it but I am 
               <br />
               only mentioning it incidentally. When We 
               <br />
               consider the question of the population of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories to-day we can 
               <br />
               readily agree that the population of the 
               <br />
               Territories is not too much for one pro- 
               <br />
               vince. The population in the Territories 
               <br />
               to-day is about the same as the population 
               <br />
               of one of our smaller provinces, or of the 
               <br />
               greatest of the maritime provinces. But. 
               <br />
               we are well aware of the fact that the po- 
               <br />
               pulation of the Territories will increase 
               <br />
               very rapidly, and inasmuch as there is a 
               <br />
               vast area of land to be occupied it has 
               <br />
               been deemed Wise to divide the Territories 
               <br />
               into two portions and establish a separate 
               <br />
               government for each. There may be some 
               <br />
               difference of opinion on that point, but it is 
               <br />
               not a very serious difference and we may 
               <br />
               say that we are happily agreed that there 
               <br />
               shall be two provinces. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The next question to which we come is 
               <br />
               the question as to what shall be done with 
               <br />
               the Dominion lands. My hon. friend, (Mr. 
               <br />
               R. L. Borden) in the small portion of 
               <br />
               his speech in which he did not deal 
               <br />
               with the constitutional question, devoted 
               <br />
               himself to the question of Dominion 
               <br />
               lands. We have provided in this Bill 
               <br />
               that the Dominion lands shall be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span> 
               <br />
               tained by the Dominion. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               takes very strong ground in favour of these 
               <br />
               lands being given over to the provinces. He 
               <br />
               argues that inasmuch as by the British 
               <br />
               North America Act the lands were left to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'</span> possession of the original provinces we 
               <br />
               should apply the same principle and leave 
               <br />
               these lands to the new provinces of Alberta 
               <br />
               and Saskatchewan. That argument is by 
               <br />
               no means conclusive. We know that there 
               <br />
               are strong reasons Why these lands should 
               <br />
               be retained within the control of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion. We have not the slightest doubt 
               <br />
               that during the development of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories it is a Wise provision that 
               <br />
               the Dominion and not the provinces should 
               <br />
               retain the management and control of the 
               <br />
               public lands. My hon. friend can see no 
               <br />
               reason why a distinction should be made 
               <br />
