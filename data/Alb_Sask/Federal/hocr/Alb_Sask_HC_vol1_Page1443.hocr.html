               that I have noticed, relating to the disposal

               <br />
               years ago. I assume that my hon. friend 
               <br />
               (Mr. Fitzpatrick) has had these provisions 
               <br />

               <br />
               is: Whether, assuming that the policy of 
               <br />
               the government had been the reverse of that 
               <br />

               sidered the sections from that standpoint.

               As we have decided to retain the control

               from the other standpoint whether or not 
               <br />
               we would have left to us that share or part

               the policy of the government on this ques-

               that. He has based his argument solely
