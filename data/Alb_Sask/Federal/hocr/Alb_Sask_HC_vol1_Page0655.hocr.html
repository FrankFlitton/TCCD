               to constitutional practice, he should have 
               <br />
               done? Was it that he had one of those

               which he is so fond of talking about? Why, 
               <br />
               during the election hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               were dumb on the school question. Not only 
               <br />
               that, but in 1901 the Minister of the Inter- 
               <br />
               ior told this House that one of the reasons 
               <br />
               why the question of Northwest autonomy 
               <br />
               could not be taken up at that .time Was 
               <br />
               this, that in the absence of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance, they could not consider it, they 
               <br />
               could not talk about it—in fact, you must 
               <br />
               not think about it. We know what hap- 
               <br />
               pened afterwards. The Speaker objected 
               <br />
               the other night when an 'hon. member inti- 
               <br />
               mated that the premier was paying his 
               <br />
               political debts. I will not say it in an of- 
               <br />
               fensive way; but I will say that the indi- 
               <br />
               cations are that the premier renewed his 
               <br />
               promises of 1895 and 1896—renewed the 
               <br />
               promise which he made to the hierarchy or 
               <br />
               to the supporters of separate schools in 1896 
               <br />
               and again in 1897, and that the new watch- 
               <br />
               word then was : instead of making an agita- 
               <br />
               tion throughout the country, keep quiet, work 
               <br />
               silently and make the proper preparations. 
               <br />
               and when the time comes for giving auton-

               <br />
               got an instalment and they would get 
               <br />
               more. The premier in Quebec explained 
               <br />
               that they had only got an instalment and 
               <br />
               they would get more and as Mr. Russell 
               <br />
               explained in his letter it was the beginning 
               <br />
               of justice. This brings us to the turning

               <br />
               that time we cannot say—although I have 
               <br />
               great doubts myself—whether the premier 
               <br />
               was honest or sincere or whether he was 
               <br />
               playing a game, but from that time on, 
               <br />
               he was climbing down. he was beginning to
