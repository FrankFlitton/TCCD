               attention has been given by this parlia—

               <br />
               has been made which goes to establish the 
               <br />
               fact that the settler or farmer who is ﬁfteen

               the importance and magnitude of the ques-

               In replying to the admirable speech with

               which these Bills were introduced by the

               had formed the subject matter of discussion

               seem to me to be quite in keeping with the

               kind of discussion which might be expected

               such a measure as this, before a body as

               this House. The hon. gentleman sought to

               First Minister and his government had 
               <br />

               cial autonomy should be granted to the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest Territories. And,

               in his endeavour to sustain a very weak 
               <br />
               position, he sought to make use of a remark

               ter on one occasion about two years ago. 
               <br />
               It was alleged that the Prime Minister had 
               <br />
               said ‘Hear, hear,’ when the hon member

               Mr. Speaker, I listened with a great deal

               of interest to theable address given to the

               be presumptuous on my part to say so, I 
               <br />

               represent the district of Qu’Appelle. Of 
               <br />
               course, I do not quite agree with every one

               of the statements made by that hon.

               <br />
               that he made the class of speech that friends-

               <br />
               autonomy was determined, before the 
               <br />
               details and terms were determined ; it was 
               <br />
               the class of speech which the true friend 
               <br />
               of the Northwest felt it proper to make, and 
               <br />
               just the class of speech I have made myself 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst session I came into this parliament. 
               <br />
               But I cannot agree with quite all the

               things which my hon. friend stated as
