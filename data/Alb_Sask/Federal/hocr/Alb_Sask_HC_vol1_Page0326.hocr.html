               separate schools in Manitoba were good

               schools and the teachers were good teachers. 
               <br />
               In most cases, the people not having the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brandon</span> knows that politics had a great

               <br />
               There was some railway business which 
               <br />
               put the government into a very bad position. 
               <br />
               and something was needed to divert public 
               <br />
               opinion from the deeds of the ministers. 
               <br />
               Our friend Mr. Dalton McCarthy had gone 
               <br />
               ron a tour through the province of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               He was dissatisﬁed because Sir John Thomp- 
               <br />
               .-son had been chosen as Minister of Justice. 
               <br />
               He had hopes of being offered that position, 
               <br />
               although he might have refused it, and he 
               <br />
               went to Manitoba and inﬂamed the passions 
               <br />
               of the people. He told them that some— 
               <br />
               thing should he done to deliver them from 
               <br />
               the inﬂuence of the hierarchy. It was there 
               <br />
               that he commenced his ﬁght against the 
               <br />
               hierarchy, and questions of that sort will 
               <br />
               always greatly inﬂame public opinion. In 
               <br />
               a short time the hon. member for Lisgar 
               <br />
               (Mr. Greenway), who was at the head of 
               <br />
               the Manitoba government, and the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) deprived 
               <br />
               the minority of that province of what they 
               <br />
               were entitled to. We have been told that 
               <br />
               the question in Manitoba was not the same 
               <br />
               question that we are discussing to-day—that 
               <br />
               in Manitoba, the provincial government had 
               <br />
               given separate schools and that the provin— 
               <br />
               cial government withdrew separate schools 
               <br />
               and the ofﬁcial use of the French language ; 
               <br />
               and that was provincial rights. The minori- 
               <br />
               ty complained. I need not give the whole 
               <br />
               history of the case. The question came be- 
               <br />
               fore parliament; and I may say in passing 
               <br />
               that the Northwest ordinanCc was passed 
               <br />
               while we were in the midst of that turmoil. 
               <br />
               The question was before the Privy Council 
               <br />
               and before the courts. We were taunted on 
               <br />
               the stump everywhere.- because the Conserv- 
               <br />
               ative government had not disallowed the 
               <br />
               Aet of the legislature of Manitoba. My 
               <br />
               right hon. friend the leader of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment was sitting 011 this side of the House 
               <br />
               at that time, when the Hon. Edward Blake 
               <br />
               moved a resolution declaring that it would 
               <br />
               be wise for the Dominion government not 
               <br />
               to use the right of veto in cases involving 
               <br />
               religion or nationality, and that resolution 
               <br />
               was looked upon as such a wise one that 
               <br />
               Sir John A. Macdonald, sitting Where my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend does now, rose and said: 
               <br />
               ‘This is a motion which should have the 
               <br />

               <br />
               bad. This is Why that Act was not vetoed.

               legislature had the right to pass a law taking 
               <br />

               <br />
               province, the minority had a grievance, and 
               <br />
               it was within the rights and the powers of 
               <br />
               the Dominion government to come to its 
               <br />
               rescue and remove that grievance. Then we 
               <br />
               had the Remedial Bill submitted to the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion parliament, and we all know what 
               <br />
               happened. When my right hon. friend moved 
               <br />
               the six months hoist, we were at the end of 
               <br />
               the session. But when the second reading 
               <br />
               of that Bill was proposed and carried by 
               <br />
               a majority of the House, who were the mem- 
               <br />
               bers that voted for it? Who were those 
               <br />
               who voted to do justice to the minority of 
               <br />
               Manitoba and to stand upon the rock of the 
               <br />
               constitution ? It was, Mr. Speaker, the 
               <br />
               Conservative party which took that stand. 
               <br />
               And I say it to the honour of the Protestants 
               <br />
               and the Orangemen of Ontario and the mari- 
               <br />
               time provinces, that they voted to do justice 
               <br />
               to the Catholic minority. I remember well 
               <br />
               Mr. Fairbairn, an old representative of the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario, declaring in this House, 
               <br />
               that although he was an old Orangeman he 
               <br />
               was going to vote in favour of the Catholic 
               <br />
               minority because he had sworn to be a de- 
               <br />
               fender always ot‘ minorities, whether Catholic 
               <br />
               or Protestant. I am reminding the House of 
               <br />
               these facts in order that, in these days, when 
               <br />
               we read so much in the newspapers about 
               <br />
               the intolerance on this side of the House, 
               <br />
               I may give my testimony on behalf of the 
               <br />
               Conservative English Protestants of this 
               <br />
               Dominion. In my opinion, the news- 
               <br />
               papers are in many instances doing 
               <br />
               more harm than good and inﬂaming 
               <br />
               passions and prejudices where it should 
               <br />
               be their endeavour to allay them. I 
               <br />
               have seen caricatures published of my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend which did not at all meet 
               <br />
               my approval and I have also seen caricatures 
               <br />
               of some of my hom friends <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> this side which 
               <br />
               I think were altogether out of place. I regret 
               <br />
               these methods. I regret this holding up of our 
               <br />
               public men to undeserved ridicule and oblo- 
               <br />
               quy, because it cannot fail to have a mis- 
               <br />
               chievous effect on the people. I can sympa- 
               <br />
               thize with my right hon. friend in his pre— 
               <br />

               in which he found himself, when the ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) came 
               <br />
               back and took him by the throat and pos- 
               <br />
               sibly threatened to inﬂame public opinion. I 
               <br />
               l' an well understand that my right hon. friend 
               <br />
