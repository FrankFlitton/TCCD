               Mr. SCOTT. It is clear to every person 
               <br />
               that the provinces of Nova Scotia, New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario own their 
               <br />
               public domain, they are entirely unrestricted 
               <br />
               in the usage of their public domain, it is 
               <br />
               their chief source of revenue. The province 
               <br />
               of Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rScotia</span> gets much more from its 
               <br />
               public domain than it does from the federal 
               <br />
               subsidy, so with the province of Ontario, so 
               <br />
               with the province of Quebec. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend’s suggestion was, if I understood him 
               <br />
               right, that we were not free to deal with 
               <br />
               these new provinces with regard to the 
               <br />
               lands in any other way than thOSe four pro- 
               <br />
               vmces were dealt with; but then, he said, if 
               <br />
               there is a reasonable objection against that, 
               <br />
               why not put in this restriction? ‘Would 
               <br />
               it not be the statesmanlike thing to ﬁnd a 
               <br />
               _way of adopting the power of the provinces 
               <br />
               m their disposal of these lands,’ he suggest- 
               <br />
               ed. As I pointed out in my speech on the 
               <br />
               second reading, it would be a restriction 
               <br />
               that would amount to scores of millions of 
               <br />
               dollars to come.

               Mr. SCOTT. My hon. friend knows my

               view with regard to the proposals which are 
               <br />
               before the House. My view is that this 
               <br />
               parliament has the discretion to give such 
               <br />
               constitution to these new provinces as it 
               <br />
               chooses to give. We are proposing to pay 
               <br />
               a certain amount of money to them in lieu 
               <br />
               of their public domain. I have been out in 
               <br />
               that country recently and have conversed 
               <br />
               with scores of men who take an interest 
               <br />
               in this question, and they all agree with 
               <br />
               me that this proposal is far better for the 
               <br />
               provinces even than the proposal to trans- 
               <br />
               fer the land unrestrictedly to the new 
               <br />
               provinces, and that as between the projosal

               <br />
               my hon. friend’s restriction, there is 
               <br />
               no comparison at all. With respect to the

               <br />
               more momentous question than is the ques- 
               <br />
               tion that divides my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:hon.</span> friend from

               Carleton and myself with regard to separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools. There is a certain question 
               <br />
               between him and myself as to whether 
               <br />
               the settler out there shall have the pri- 
               <br />
               vilege to send his child to a school-house 
               <br />

               <br />
               section 14. But the settler in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories is more concerned to know 
               <br />
               whether he is going to have money enough 
               <br />
               to educate his child either in the school- 
               <br />
               house <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on}</span> section 14 or in the school— 
               <br />
               house on section 11, than in the minor ques-

               tion as to which section his child shall travel 
               <br />

               recently, in company with some of my

               hon. friends from the Territories and the

               up in the constituency of Edmonton, passed

               through the constituency of Strathcona, 
               <br />
               spent four or ﬁve days in the district of 
               <br />
               Calgary, came <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span> my own district, and 
               <br />
               put two days in at Regina. During that

               time I conversed with scores, if not with 
               <br />
               hundreds, of gentlemen, perhaps most of 
               <br />
               them Liberals, as would naturally be the 
               <br />

               also, and not a single man of them raised

               any objection against the land proposition

               Mr. COOKSHUCDT. When the Bill was 
               <br />
               up for the second reading, I took the oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of opposing this particular clause re- 
               <br />
               lating to the ﬁnancial terms. I think there ~ 
               <br />
               are very good reasons why these -clauses 
               <br />
               should be opposed. I have listened during 
               <br />
               the afternoon and evening to hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
