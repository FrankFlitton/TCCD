               to remarks antagonistic to the course of 
               <br />
               the government, and still concluded by de- 
               <br />
               claring that he would vote with the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment. I am afraid that the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Labelle has found a very ready 
               <br />
               imitator in that respect, in the person of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Beauharnois—in fact <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               the hon. member (Mr. Bergeron) has gone 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Labelle one better: 
               <br />
               the whole speech to which we have just 
               <br />
               listened, has been—I say it without of- 
               <br />
               fence—a tirade against the government of 
               <br />
               the day. He did not say at the end how 
               <br />
               he would vote, but I presume he will vote 
               <br />
               against the amendment.

               Mr. B—EDOOURT. Then, what has been 
               <br />
               said has been well said. The Canadian 
               <br />
               national family will extend to the two 
               <br />

               congratulations when. on the ﬁrst of July

               next, they take their place in the family

               that by that time the note of discord which 
               <br />
               has been heard in one part of this country

               will have ceased to sound—I believe in fact 
               <br />
               that that will be the case, and that even

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span> it still sounds, it will not mar the chorus
