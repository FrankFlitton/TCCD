               was sent out by direction of the hon. mem-

               was the production of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey. I thought the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               would not lower himself to anything of the 
               <br />

               said emanated from my hon. friend from 
               <br />

               Grey did not produce any such document, 
               <br />
               on the contrary, he did not approve of the

               It was a resolution passed by some lodge. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from East Grey had nothing 
               <br />
               to do with it, and yet the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Shefford gets up and attributes it to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend. He said that some little bird 
               <br />
               had whispered into the ear of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from East Grey that a Bill of this kind was 
               <br />
               to be introduced. Did not the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man hear the speech from the Throne when 
               <br />
               the Governor General announced that these 
               <br />
               Autonomy Bills would be introduced this

               <br />
               man as a little bird whispering in the ears 
               <br />
               of members of this House ? He referred to 
               <br />
               the fact that ministers had stated in the 
               <br />
               campaign that autonomy would be given. 
               <br />
               Had it depended on the statement of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mid</span> 
               <br />
               isters, no person, not even my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from East Grey, would have paid any atten- 
               <br />
               tion to it, but when the Governor General 
               <br />
               came down and announced that these 
               <br />
               Autonomy Bills would be introduced, my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from East Grey then had every 
               <br />
               right to say to his friends in the country 
               <br />
               that they were going to be introduced. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Shefford, like every one 
               <br />
               who has preceded him in this debate, closed 
               <br />
               his remarks with a eulogy of the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier)——the 
               <br />
               greatest man‘ that ever lived on earth. He 
               <br />
               would be worth millions to Barnum if he 
               <br />
               had him. That is all in line with the course 
               <br />
               pursued by other members of the party. 
               <br />
               They eulogize the minister and they take 
               <br />
               the patronage. The hon. member for Shef- 
               <br />
               ford did not deal very much with the Bill 
               <br />
               before the House ; therefore, I do not pro-

               <br />
               all you say. and am very much pleased that the

               The position to—day is quite different from 
               <br />
               the Manitoba question. Then lt was the min— 
               <br />
               ority appealing under the provisions of the 
               <br />
               constitution for their rights. When Manitoba 
               <br />
               was given a. constitution these rights of separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools were provided, but the Greenway 
               <br />
               government abolished them. The decision of 
               <br />
               the Privy Council was that the legislature had 
               <br />
               exclusive jurisdiction in dealing with educa- 
               <br />
               tional matters, but the minority had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3.3119“</span> 
               <br />
               ance. and under the constitution had a. right to 
               <br />
               appeal to the Dominion parliament for remedial 
               <br />
               legislation. But it is very singular that the 
               <br />
               parties headed by Sir Wilfrid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Laurier</span> were the 
               <br />
