               Mr. A. LAVERGNE. If I remember

               aright, that declaration of Lord Carnarvon 
               <br />

               earl said on the 19th of February. I fancy 
               <br />
               the noble earl was too much of a statesman 
               <br />

               be satisﬁed as to that when he sees what 
               <br />
               the noble earl did say on the 22nd of 
               <br />
               February and contrasts it with what he

               said on the 19th. But if the hon. gentleman

               he justiﬁes the omasculation that was made

               important questions which have occupied a

               <br />
               to self—government of the new provinces, 
               <br />
               the question as to whether this Bi-ll gives the

               has now been disclosed, some very awk- 
               <br />
               ward similes. He introduced this Bill as a 
               <br />
               measure which was going to give the new 
               <br />
               provinces ‘the fulness of the rights that 
               <br />
               appertain to provinces; that he was go-

               to ‘crown them ’—mark the term, nothing

               could be stronger, or Wider, or broader—With 
               <br />

               <br />
               examine the Bill we ﬁnd that it falls far 
               <br />
               short of granting them the freedom of self-

               hard to see where the crown of local self— 
               <br />
               government is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preeminent</span> in the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of these provinces. Now, ﬁrst with re- 
               <br />
               gard to their position in respect to the lands. 
               <br />
               When the right hon. gentleman welcomed 
               <br />
               these provinces into the Dominion sister- 
               <br />
               hood, he welcomed them as one would wel— 
               <br />
               come, by analogy, the heir who comes of 
               <br />
               age. But with what rights does he clothe 
               <br />
               the heir that comes to his majority and is 
               <br />
               entitled to his heritage and his patrimony? 
               <br />
               Does he say to the heir, -to these provinces : 
               <br />
               ‘Yon have now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attained</span> your majority, and 
               <br />
               we will now clothe you with all that per- 
               <br />
               tains to your majority ?’ But this Bill says 
               <br />
               another thing. 'The Bill says that the heir 
               <br />
               shall have no heritage; the Bill says that 
               <br />
               the heir shall have no estates. The right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s fulsome speech and elo- 
               <br />
               quent word-s indicate that the heir shall 
               <br />
               come to his full estate, that he shall have ab- 
               <br />
               solute power to guide his own destinies. 
               <br />
               that he shall have the fulness of rights that 
               <br />
               appertain to the provinces; at the same 
               <br />
               time he says in his Bill : You shall have nc 
               <br />
               estates so far as the lands are concerned. 
               <br />
               you shall have no right to deal with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> 
               <br />
               lands, you shall have no heritage, nothing 
               <br />
               to pass on to your children, for all time yot 
               <br />
               shall be dominated by your father, you shal' 
               <br />
               be restricted to the pocket money that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span> 
               <br />
               doled out to you by him, and you shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               tied to him, instead of having the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">freedom</span> 
               <br />
               which the words of the right hon. gentle
