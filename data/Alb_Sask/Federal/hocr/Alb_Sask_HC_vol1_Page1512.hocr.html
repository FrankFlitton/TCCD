               hon. friend the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitz-

               said to—day. For he took particular pains, 
               <br />
               it seems to me, not to state that there was 
               <br />
               any real difference between section 16, No. 1, 
               <br />
               and section 16, No. 2. He only said, so far 
               <br />
               as section 16, No. 1, is concerned, that the 
               <br />
               meaning of it was expressed in the earlier 
               <br />

               it; but then he goes on to tell us what is 
               <br />
               his view as to section 16, No. 2. I do not 
               <br />
               ﬁnd in his opinion, after all, anything that is

               we should differ ; because I had hoped that

               on a matter of this sort the lawyers in the
