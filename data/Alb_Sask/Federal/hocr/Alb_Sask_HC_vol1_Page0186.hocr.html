               stituted that territory 35 years ago; 30 
               <br />
               years ago you established separate schools; 
               <br />
               you said when you were doing it that you 
               <br />
               intended it to be permanent; those who 
               <br />
               made speeches when the .Bill was presented 
               <br />
               to parliament, said we bring this Bill to 
               <br />
               parliament because we want the people of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories to know what 
               <br />
               Lind of institutions they are going to have, 
               <br />
               and among others they are going to have 
               <br />
               separate schools. Half a million people 
               <br />
               have gone into the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               knowing what the laws were. Although 
               <br />
               I am not absolutely convinced by the argu- 
               <br />
               ment made by these gentlemen, yet I know 
               <br />
               that out of that population of half a million 
               <br />
               there are 125,000 Roman Catholics, and I 
               <br />
               further know that many of these people 
               <br />
               actually went to the educational department 
               <br />
               at Regina by their authorized representa- 
               <br />
               tives and got copies of these school ordin- 
               <br />
               ances so that they might know whether 
               <br />
               they would be allowed to have separate 
               <br />
               schools before they came into the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. Therefore, our friends say: 
               <br />
               here is a state of affairs existing for thirty 
               <br />
               years, carried on under your direction, creat— 
               <br />
               ing vested rights in 125,000 people who have 
               <br />
               gone there upon the strength of your guar- 
               <br />
               antee. And so, with some degree of plausi- 
               <br />
               bility they argue: you are far more bound 
               <br />
               to maintain that state of affairs than if it 
               <br />
               had been created by the province, because 
               <br />
               you are responsible for it yourselves. Here 
               <br />
               we have two separate and irreconcilable 
               <br />
               propositions. If I talked for ever I do not 
               <br />
               think I would convince the gentlemen who 
               <br />
               do not think as I do upon this subject. I 
               <br />
               do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not,</span> think I could convince them that we 
               <br />
               should leave the legislature of the Northwest

               am for my part convinced after the history

               hon. friend the Minister of Finance put it 
               <br />
               very well the other evening. He said:

               What are you going to do ? what are you 
               <br />
               going to decide ? The King's government

               <br />
               only one of two ways in which this question 
               <br />
               can be decided. The Protestant people of 
               <br />
               Canada can say to the Roman Catholic peo- 
               <br />
               ple: You cannot convince us, we cannot 
               <br />
               convince you, but there are more of us than 
               <br />
               there are of you, and we are going to vote 
               <br />
               you down. I put aside a proposition of that 
               <br />
               kind. There is no man in this government

               <br />
               power. Least of all would my hon. friend 
               <br />
               who leads the opposition desire to see a pro- 
               <br />
               position of that kind carried out, no matter 
               <br />
               what his views on the merits of the ques- 
               <br />
               tion might be. Then, what are you going to 
               <br />
               do ? What is the position of affairs going 
               <br />
               to be ? You cannot make a political reli-
