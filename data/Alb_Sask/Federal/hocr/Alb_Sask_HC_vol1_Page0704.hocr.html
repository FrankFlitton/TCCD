               ways intended that the boundaries of Maui- 
               <br />

               have a greater area than we have at the 
               <br />
               present time. We have been clipped <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">OK</span> 
               <br />
               to the east, and we are naturally asking 
               <br />
               for an extension to the west, and all that I 
               <br />
               have to say upon this western extension is 
               <br />
               that that territory lying immediately to the 
               <br />
               west of us belongs geographically, com- 
               <br />
               mercially and socially to the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and it would be much-to the 
               <br />
               interest of these people, although they may 
               <br />
               not see it now, to come into the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba. If they came in we would 
               <br />
               be able to extend to them the fully devel- 
               <br />
               .oped facilities that we now have. We would 
               <br />
               be willing to extend to them our good rail- 
               <br />
               way policy, a policy that has saved the 
               <br />
               people of the province of Manitoba hund- 
               <br />
               reds of thousands of dollars. There are 
               <br />
               many arguments that might be adduced to 
               <br />
               show that it would be to the advantage to 
               <br />
               the people of the west of us to come in but 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentlemen say: We cannot 
               <br />
               extendthe boundaries to the west of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba because the people of the west object. 
               <br />
               I wonder if the people of the west are agree- 
               <br />
               ing with all the features of the present Bill ; 
               <br />
               I rather think not. But we cannot get an 
               <br />
               extension to the west for the reason I have 
               <br />
               just stated and when it comes to asking 
               <br />
               an extension to the north, up to the Hud- 
               <br />
               son bay, what are we told? Oh. you can- 
               <br />
               not get an extension in that direction until 
               <br />
               I consult my native and beloved province 
               <br />
               of Quebec! Sir, I think it has been pro- 
               <br />
               perly said that to consult Quebec in this 
               <br />
               matter is an insult to the province of Mani— 
               <br />
               toba. I do not think that term is a bit 
               <br />
               too strong; there may be some reason why 
               <br />
               Ontario should be consulted in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter</span> 
               <br />
               but so far as the province of Quebec is 
               <br />
               concerned. I do not think it is entitled to 
               <br />
               have anything to say other than through 
               <br />
               the hon. members who represent the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec in this House. What would 
               <br />
               an extension to the north mean? As an 
               <br />
               agriculturist of the province of Manitoba, I 
               <br />
               would like to say a word upon the point. 
               <br />
               If we get our extension to the north we will 
               <br />
               have a deep water outlet, the natural outlet 
               <br />
               of that great western country and the pro- 
               <br />
               gressive government of Manitoba will im- 
               <br />
               mediately undertake the construction of a 
               <br />
               line of railway to Hudson bay. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> will 
               <br />
               that mean ? It will mean to the agriculture 
               <br />
               producers of that country that we are plac- 
               <br />
               ed 1.000 miles closer to the markets of the 
               <br />
               world than we are now. Any hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men w-ho know anything about transporting 
               <br />
               stock of any kind to the markets of the 
               <br />
               world know that it is easier upon the stock 
               <br />
               to rtransport by water than by rail and 
               <br />
               therefore I claim as an agriculturist—it 
               <br />
               would be much to our interests. and there 
               <br />
               are many more arguments which 1 might

               re—adjusting the affairs in the west, the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment will see ﬁt to give to the hospitals 
               <br />
               a large increase in the grant which they 
               <br />
               now receive. The provincial government 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gave</span> last year to the hospital at Winnipeg 
               <br />
               the sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">952138737,</span> whereas this govern— 
               <br />
               ment only gave to the hospital the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sum</span> of 
               <br />
               $2.653.'27. Owing to the facilities which the 
               <br />
               hospital offers to immigrants brought into 
               <br />
               this country, surely the federal government 
               <br />
               should deal more liberally with it.
