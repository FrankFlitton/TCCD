               Mr. LALOR. The member for East Grey 
               <br />
               is pretty well able to take care of himself. 
               <br />
               Gentlemen opposite have tried to cry him 
               <br />
               down, they have called ‘order’ they have 
               <br />
               called him an Orangeman, they have called 
               <br />
               him a bigot, they have said everything they 
               <br />
               could against him, but he is alive and ﬁght- 
               <br />
               ing and able to take care of himself. I am 
               <br />
               anxious to see this session ended, because 
               <br />
               we want to get home to attend to our busi— 
               <br />
               ness and look after our families, and the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice could shorten the ses- 
               <br />
               sion if he felt so disposed. I am pleased to 
               <br />
               hear that there is an arrangement that he 
               <br />
               is to tell us on Monday next, what this school 
               <br />
               clause means. We have had the member 
               <br />
               for Centre York (Mr. Campbell) and the 
               <br />
               member for Saskatchewan and other Liberal 
               <br />
               members telling us that the Bill meant na- 
               <br />
               tional schools with religious teaching for 
               <br />
               one half hour each day, and if the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice will conﬁrm these statements, 
               <br />
               then we shall know what we are doing. It 
               <br />
               is unfair to parliament and to the country, 
               <br />
               that this Bill should be before the House 
               <br />
               for weeks and that there should be such di- 
               <br />
               vergencies of opinion expressed as to its 
               <br />
               meaning, While the Minister of Justice has 
               <br />
               declined to tell us exactly what the Bill 
               <br />
               means so that we may vote intelligently 
               <br />
               on it.

               Mr. INGRAM. I want to say a few words
