               <br />
               extreme friends in the province of Quebec ? 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> are those rights? What is the con-

               dition in Quebec? The schools which we 
               <br />
               call public schools in other provinces are 
               <br />
               church schools there; and I say all credit 
               <br />
               to the Roman Catholics for insisting on an 
               <br />
               education in religion in the schools. I think 
               <br />
               it would be better for Protestants if they 
               <br />
               did the same; but unfortunately the divis— 
               <br />
               ions among them prevent that desirable 
               <br />
               consummation. But in the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec, as a matter of fact the majority have 
               <br />
               their schools conducted on religious lines. 
               <br />
               There is a great difference between a Pro- 
               <br />
               testant going to what is practically a church 
               <br />
               school and being trained in the doctrines of 
               <br />
               the Catholic faith, and a Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               child in the Northwest going to a public 
               <br />
               school of which the worst said is that he is 
               <br />
               not trained in his own faith. Surely there 
               <br />
               is all the difference, to use the language of 
               <br />
               the prayer book, between commission and 
               <br />
               omission in the two acts. And so, when hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite plead with us to give 
               <br />
               to the Northwest the same rights that are 
               <br />
               given to Quebec and Ontario, I venture to 
               <br />
               say that, the Protestants, being in such an 
               <br />
               immense majority in the Northwest, in 
               <br />
               many cases it would be a practical impos- 
               <br />
               sibility for the Roman Catholics to have 
               <br />
               their separate schools. They would feel 
               <br />
               that a gross injustice was being done to a 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic child if we set up a national 
               <br />

               tinctive tenets of Protestantism were 
               <br />

               we should pass this Bill, which is in effect 
               <br />
               a statement that in the United States there 
               <br />
               is no religion taught in the national schools; 
               <br />
               that in Canada you have national schools 
               <br />
               without religion for Protestants and separate 
               <br />
               schools for Roman Catholics ; and that the 
               <br />
               consequence is that under this educational 
               <br />
               system Canada has escaped the murders, 
               <br />
               divorces and lynchings so common in the 
               <br />
               United States. Now, what does that mean 
               <br />
               if logic means anything? 
               <br />

               I will not try to put it in words because 
               <br />
               one is so apt to be misquoted or misreported 
               <br />
               that I am afraid somebody will be unkind 
               <br />
               enough to say afterwards that I charged the 
               <br />
               Catholics of the United States when it is 
               <br />
               the right hon. the Prime Minister who has 
               <br />
               done that, and I stand here to defend them.
