               It was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">murmured—I</span> know not with what 
               <br />
               truth—that one of the special reasons ad- 
               <br />
               vanced by my hon. friend the ex-Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior (Mr. Sifton) for his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disagree-</span> 
               <br />
               ment with his colleagues was the circum- 
               <br />
               stance that this amendment had been made, 
               <br />
               and that thereby the moneys set apart for 
               <br />
               a certain purpose under the provisions of 
               <br />
               the Dominion Lands Act were supposed to 
               <br />
               be diverted from the purpose for which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> 
               <br />
               were originally intended. Has that been 
               <br />
               changed ? Let us read the provision which 
               <br />
               is now proposed to be substituted for it. 
               <br />
               and I will venture to say that there is a 
               <br />
               great deal less difference between the amend- 
               <br />
               ed section and the original section proposed 
               <br />
               by the government than there is between 
               <br />
               either one or other of these sections and 
               <br />
               section 93 of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. The amendment does not differ so 
               <br />
               much from the section as originally draft- 
               <br />
               ed as either one or the other of those sec- 
               <br />

               <br />
