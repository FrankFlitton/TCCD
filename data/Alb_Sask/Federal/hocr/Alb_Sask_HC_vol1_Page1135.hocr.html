               <br />
               view was that it was possible that these 
               <br />
               might be construed as applicable exclusively 
               <br />
               to a province, and could not be made ap- 
               <br />
               plicable to these Territories as brought in, 
               <br />
               and my ﬁrm determination was that there 
               <br />
               should be nothing left to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">uncertainty,</span> so 
               <br />
               far as my responsibility went. My object 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> make section 93 applicable, and my 
               <br />
               object was also to avoid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> repetition of the 
               <br />
               Manitoba diﬂiculty. I wanted to perpetuate 
               <br />
               the existing conditions, with which every- 
               <br />
               body in the Territories professes to be satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed. Now, if you take section 16 and read 
               <br />
               it in the light of that declaration. how would 
               <br />
               the law be with respect to these Territories? 
               <br />
               It would read as follows:

               intention of the government in 1870 to give

               to the minority in Manitoba the right to 
               <br />
