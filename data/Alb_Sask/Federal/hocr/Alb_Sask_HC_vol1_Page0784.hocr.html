               And, again, the speech with which the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister introduced this clause, was, 
               <br />
               in my humble opinion, not calculated to se- 
               <br />
               cure for it that reception which I know he 
               <br />
               desired, that reception which all peace-16v-

               <br />
               sire in the case of a question of this kind. 
               <br />
               I have endeavoured to analyse the speech, 
               <br />
               in order, if possible to see what the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister had in his mind when he was de- 
               <br />
               ﬁning the original educational clause before 
               <br />
               this House. And his line of reasoning as 
               <br />
               I found it, was something like this :——What 
               <br />
               are separate schools ? For a reply he re- 
               <br />
               views their history in Canada. He describes 
               <br />
               the separate schools before confederation. 
               <br />
               He traces the evolution of school law in 
               <br />
               Quebec from 1841 to 1863. He emphasizes 
               <br />
               the basic differences in matters of dogma 
               <br />
               between Catholics and Protestants. He 
               <br />
               shows how and why the separate schools 
               <br />
               of old Canada were established. He recalls 
               <br />
               the acrimonious debates of 1863 and George 
               <br />
               Brown’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vigorous</span> denunciations. He re- 
               <br />
               minds Canadians th-at for ﬁfty, years they 
               <br />
               have disagreed on this subject. He reviews 
               <br />
               the agitation from 1841 to the deadlock of 
               <br />
               1864 ; reminds us how separateschools were 
               <br />
               ‘a necessary condition to confederation,’ 
               <br />
               claims similarity of conditions as regards 
               <br />
               the new provinces of the Northwest, em- 
               <br />
               phasizes how Manitoba avoided the separate 
               <br />
               school system, how the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories cannot thus escape, and ﬁnally, though 
               <br />
               refusing to discuss the merits, denounces 
               <br />

               Now, what is the impression created by 
               <br />

               <br />

               to my own constituency a few days ago and 
               <br />
               tried to ﬁnd out what was the impression 
               <br />
               which existed there with reference to the 
               <br />
               contemplated legislation. And I failed to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd a single man who did not understand 
               <br />
               that the contemplated action of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment was to duplicate in the Canadian 
               <br />
               Northwest a system of separate schools 
               <br />
               similar to that found in Ontario and Que- 
               <br />
               bec. Now, that, I claim, is a misapprehen- 
               <br />
               sion; but that certainly is the idea ﬁxed

               unusual course of delivering a speech on the

               the House. Now, there are those who be- 
               <br />
               lieve that the separate school system, as 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd it in Ontario and Quebec, was a 
               <br />
               ‘ necessary condition of confederation,’ 
               <br />
               men who are willing that it should 
               <br />
               then be established and who are to- 
               <br />
               day willing that it should be contin- 
               <br />
               ued, but who are not willing that the 
               <br />
               same system should be duplicated in 
               <br />
               new, unorganized territories. And we can 
               <br />
               not blame them. They are as honest and 
               <br />
               sincere in their opinions as are those who 
               <br />
               differ from them; but it is their opinion. 
               <br />
               and, as such, it must be accepted and reckon- 
               <br />
               ed with. Now, it seems to me that the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister and the members of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, foreseeing that this question would 
               <br />
               bring on a discussion that was very likely 
               <br />
               to be a difﬁcult and trying one, should ﬁrst 
               <br />
               have agreed among themselves upon a 
               <br />
               clause that they could all accept. They 
               <br />
               should then have submitted it to their cau- 
               <br />
               cus and secured the support of their own 
               <br />
               members. That clause should have been 
               <br />
               so precise, so distinct, so clear, that there 
               <br />
               could be no misinterpretation of it. If the 
               <br />
               clause was intended to give nothing more or 
               <br />
               nothing less to the. minority in the North- 
               <br />
               west than that which they now enjoy, that 
               <br />
               should have been distinctly and speciﬁcally 
               <br />
               stated to the House. That clause should be 
               <br />
               so clear as to lead to no misunderstanding. 
               <br />
               And, had the Prime Minister, having secured 
               <br />
               the agreement of the members of his cabinet, 
               <br />
               having consulted his rank and ﬁle and se- 
               <br />
               cured their endorsement, had he then come 
               <br />
               in with a clause to perpetuate the privileges 
               <br />
               of the minority in the Northwest, and had 
               <br />
               he frankly stated to the House and people 
               <br />
               that this was all that could be read into 
               <br />
               the clause, he could have appealed to the 
               <br />
               spirit of tolerance and Christian charity of 
               <br />
               which he has spoken, and I believe that 
               <br />
               the country from one end to the other would 
               <br />
               have accepted what he proposed. I believe 
               <br />
               the country would have accepted it had not 
               <br />
               the apprehensions been created in the minds

               of the people to which the original clause
