               Let me call attention to the position between 
               <br />
               the premier of the Northwest Territories <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> 
               <br />
               the government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘It</span> is admitted to be a 
               <br />
               vexed question as to what school system 
               <br />
               shall prevail in the Northwest Territories, 
               <br />
               and whether there shall be the vindication or 
               <br />
               the subversion of provincial rights. Thatmat— 
               <br />
               ter was only referred to incidentally and 
               <br />
               not discussed at all the very day when the 
               <br />
               Bill was introduced with the original clause 
               <br />
               16, which caused so much trouble, and 
               <br />
               which is causing so much trouble in the 
               <br />
               House to-day in its amended form. The 
               <br />
               right hon. Prime Minister thinks that 
               <br />
               he was perfectly justiﬁed in treating 
               <br />
               the premier of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               in a way that has been often described in 
               <br />
               this House, so much so that he cannot fail 
               <br />
               to realize that the people of the west are 
               <br />
               feeling that they have been slighted through 
               <br />
               their representative because of the manner 
               <br />
               in which he has been treated. Enough 
               <br />
               has probably been said about that, but new 
               <br />
               matters arise to-day in connection with the 
               <br />
               same kind of treatment meted out to the 
               <br />
               representatives of Manitoba. We have had a 
               <br />
               certain amount of quibbling by hon. mem— 
               <br />
               bers on the other side of the House as to 
               <br />
               whether or not the premier did or did not 
               <br />
               promise to give these gentlemen another 
               <br />
               interview. I do not care about that. From 
               <br />
               the evidence I read this afternoon, from 
               <br />
               other evidence and from the intrinsic evid- 
               <br />
               ence of the case, I am convinced that the 
               <br />
               country is satisﬁed that there was an under- 
               <br />
               standing at the time these gentlemen parted 
               <br />
               from the premier and we know the unfortu- 
               <br />
               nate position of the right hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               putting it in the best way we can. When 
               <br />
               we go to the records, when we go to ‘Han- 
               <br />
               sard’ and take the language of the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman himself no more unfortunate 
               <br />
               condition, no more unfortunate position as 
               <br />
               regards the Dominion in relation to the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces could possibly exist than that which 
               <br />
               is recorded at page 4110 of the unrevised 
               <br />
               ‘ Hansard’ in the language of the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman himself. It comes to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               he left these gentlemen upon the under- 
               <br />
               standing and with the statement that he 
               <br />
               would let them know in a few days What 
               <br />
               his policy would be, and he never let them 
               <br />
               know until he introduced his Bill into the 
               <br />
               House on the 21st February. Is that the 
               <br />
               way to treat provinces? It is a little pro- 
               <br />
               vince, it is true. It is said to have offended 
               <br />
               the government, but it is said to have pleased 
               <br />
               the masses of the people in this country. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman said that it 
               <br />
               should have no extension of its boundaries. 
               <br />
               It is a discussable question, I admit, 
               <br />
               Whether the boundaries shall be extended or 
               <br />
               not, but I claim that for the provinces that 
               <br />
               they must be treated as sovereignties even 
               <br />
               by the sovereign and federal parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada. When the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               said, as he told us, that he would let them

               are dealing with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> ; that the manner in 
               <br />
               which the whole Autonomy question has 
               <br />
               been conducted and the whole line of policy 
               <br />
               pursued by the premier are the result of 
               <br />
               a deliberate scheme, of a deliberate plan 
               <br />
               by which the Territories were to be deceived 
               <br />
               upon this school question. We know very 
               <br />
               well with what unseemly haste, in so Ifar as 
               <br />
               the premier of the Northwest Territories is 
               <br />
               concerned, the right hon. gentleman intro- 
               <br />
               duced the Bill, and with what unfortunate 
               <br />
               haste as regards the then absent members 
               <br />
               of his government. There is no evid- 
               <br />
               ence even that the Bill, after having been 
               <br />
               prepared by the sub-committee, was sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to the Council before it was intro- 
               <br />
               duced into the House. I take the responsi- 
               <br />
               bility of the statement that there was a plan 
               <br />
