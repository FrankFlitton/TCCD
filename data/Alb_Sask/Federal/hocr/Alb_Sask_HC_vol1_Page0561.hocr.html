               in this interview which I might comment 
               <br />
               upon. It is quite evident from the explan- 
               <br />
               ation of His Excellency, and is indeed ob- 
               <br />
               vious to all, that this interview was not a 
               <br />
               public discussion, it was merely a friendly 
               <br />
               conversation between two gentlemen who 
               <br />
               had met together to discuss a question 
               <br />
               which they had previously discussed. Now, 
               <br />
               my hon. friend has hinted, or has attempted 
               <br />
               to create the impression, that the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada was actuated by sinister 
               <br />
               motives with regard to the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. and that we refused to extend 
               <br />
               her boundaries because we wished to punish 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba for having abolish- 
               <br />
               ed separate schools. To establish his point 
               <br />
               he quotes a statement in a Quebec news- 
               <br />
               paper, t‘.ic ‘Soleil.’ which is a newspaper 
               <br />
               friendly to myself and which claims to be 
               <br />
               my organ. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Sir, it is very strange that whenever a 
               <br />
               newspaper friendly to the government says 
               <br />
               something which the hon. gentleman thinks 
               <br />
               is favourable to themselves, he at once 
               <br />
               holds the government responsible for the 
               <br />
               statement. “'en, does he hold me respon- 
               <br />
               sible, for instance, for the attitude of the 
               <br />
               ‘Globe’ upon this occasion, or of the other 
               <br />
               newspapers who do not support the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment? And if. I am not to be held re— 
               <br />
               sponsible for the attitude taken by the 
               <br />
               ‘ Globe,‘ why in the name of common sense 
               <br />
               should I be held responsible for the opinion 
               <br />
               of the ‘Solei-l <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'.“</span> There would be just as 
               <br />
               much reason in one-as in the other. ‘Le 
               <br />
               Soleil ‘ is a paper friendly to myself. But, 
               <br />
               because ‘Le Soleil’ is friendly to myself 
               <br />
               and wants to serve me, surely it does not 
               <br />
               follow that under any circumstances, I am 
               <br />
               bound to be responsible for everything ap- 
               <br />
               pearing in ‘Le Soleil,’ or in any newspaper. 
               <br />
               lt would be absurd to say that because men 
               <br />
               agree upon political matters, they will there— 
               <br />
               fore see eye to eye in everything. There 
               <br />
               are other matters than politics on which men 
               <br />
               can differ in opinion. And it is, to my 
               <br />
               thinking, a position unworthy of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) to say that the 
               <br />
               government should be supposed to have been 
               <br />
               actuated by belief in a certain line of policy 
               <br />
               because that policy was supported by a 
               <br />
               certain newspaper. The day has not yet come 
               <br />
               when the Canadian government must look 
               <br />
               for its policy or the ground for its opinions 
               <br />
               to newspapers, however respectable those 
               <br />
               newspapers may be. We decide these mat- 
               <br />
               ters upon our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dines</span> and according to 
               <br />
               our best judgment. But the hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               man has endeavoured to convey the idea— 
               <br />
               he did not say it in so many words——that 
               <br />
               there had been a sort of understanding. He 
               <br />
               did not use the word ‘conspiracy,’ but he 
               <br />
               intended to convey the idea, if he meant 
               <br />
               anything at all, that there had been a con- 
               <br />
               spiracy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">between</span> the government of Can-

               such an assertion as that made by my 
               <br />

               <br />
               stated yesterday. we received in the month 
               <br />
               of January, towards the end of it, the re— 
               <br />
               quest of the Manitoba government for a 
               <br />
               conference. We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agreed</span> to that conference, 
               <br />
               and it took place on the 17th of February. 
               <br />
               There were present a subcommittee of coun- 
               <br />
               cil and the question was discussed. We 
               <br />
               told the delegates that they should have an 
               <br />
               answer at an early day. That answer they 
               <br />
               had on the ﬂoor of this House four days 
               <br />
               later. on the 21st of February, when I intro- 
               <br />
               duced the Autonomy Bills, and in the course 
               <br />
               of my explanation stated our position with 
               <br />
               regard to the boundaries of Manitoba was 
               <br />
               clearly deﬁned. It was two days after- 
               <br />
               wards, on the 23rd of February. that the 
               <br />
               conference <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">took</span> place between His Excel- 
               <br />
               lency Monseigneur <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sbarre'tti</span> and Mr. Camp- 
               <br />
               bell. When that conference took place, the 
               <br />
               decision of this government was already 
               <br />
               known. We had stated what we would do. 
               <br />
               We had stated that we would reserve the 
               <br />
               northern portion of Saskatchewan to be an- 
               <br />
               nexed to Manitoba or not as circumstances 
               <br />
               might suggest, and the extension of the 
               <br />
               boundaries should take place to Hudson 
               <br />
               bay if there was an opportunity to do so, 
               <br />
               after conference. The policy of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment was thus determined, and could 
               <br />
               not be affected by anything that might 
               <br />
               take place in the conference between His 
               <br />
               Excellency the apostolic delegate and Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell. But, Sir, there is more. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) wants to 
               <br />
               know whether or not there was any ques- 
               <br />
               tion between the government of Canada and 
               <br />
               Monseigneur <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">S‘barretti</span> as to the extension 
               <br />
               of the boundaries of Manitoba. As I said a 
               <br />
               moment ago, I have not seen the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">state—</span> 
               <br />
               ment of His Excellency,—I have not read it 
               <br />
               critically—but the answer to my hon. 
               <br />
               friend’s question he already has before him—- 
               <br />
               he has only to read that statement. He 
               <br />
               has read it, and in it he ﬁnds that Monsei— 
               <br />
               gneur Sbarretti says explicitly that the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment had nothing at all to do with his 
               <br />
               own action. That ought to suit the purpose 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend and ought to convince 
               <br />
               him that he cannot make any political cap— 
               <br />
               ital on that line. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I‘have</span> only to refer to 
               <br />
               the words of Monseigneur Sbarretti when 
               <br />
               he says himself—and his words are in the 
               <br />
               memory of every member of this House— 
               <br />
               that he stated to Mr. Campbell that if they 
               <br />
               would restore the separate schools in Man-
