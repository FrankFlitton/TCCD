               myself. I went to Rome, as I have already 
               <br />
               stated. as a Roman Catholic to bring a griev- 
               <br />

               Roman Catholics, before the head of my 
               <br />
               church. I will say this, that it is to me, and I 
               <br />
               believe to many others, a source of comfort, a. 
               <br />
               source of gratiﬁcation, to feel that while we 
               <br />
               belong to a religious body in which there are 
               <br />

               <br />
               humble he may be, can go to Rome, and within

               what I did, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> is what I boast of. I say

               And <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> is more of it. Now, I am not 
               <br />
               questioning one word of it. I am not 
               <br />
               referring to it in any sneering way. I think 
               <br />
               it is a matter of great gratiﬁcation to those 
               <br />
               who belong to that communion. But I be— 
               <br />
               lieve in the church to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which»</span> I belong and I 
               <br />
               respectfully submit that in this country of

               sparse population where we must work 
               <br />
               united‘ly to advance the interests of the coun-

               try, that the time has not yet come when we 
               <br />
               should cause a re—union of church and state. 
               <br />
               Having determined that question at the time 
               <br />
               of secularization of the clergy reserves, and 
               <br />
               the subject having been discussed on many 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bushings</span> and settled, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as‘we</span> believed, for all 
               <br />
               time by the wise action of that day, there 
               <br />
               is nothing in the circumstances of the coun- 
               <br />
               try to indicate that we should endeavour 
               <br />
               to create a union between church and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">state</span> 
               <br />
               again. Now, what was the result of the mis- 
               <br />
               sion ? The hon. gentleman tells us that 
               <br />
               somebody came back. And we know who 
               <br />
               came back. The result of the mission was 
               <br />
               that the clamour that was about the ears 
               <br />
               of the Prime Minister ceased, that an un- 
               <br />
               derstanding was to come to ? Was that it ? 
               <br />
               Or was it that he was released from his 
               <br />
               obligation. Was it that he was told: We will 
               <br />
               not exact a fulﬁlment of your promise; we 
               <br />
               Will let you off ? I do not think so. Be- 
               <br />
               cause the Minister of Justice, and the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister as well, said: It is only an instal-
