               attention of the committee to some other 
               <br />
               facts. All of us from the west know that 
               <br />
               the southern part of Alberta is chieﬂy a 
               <br />
               ranching country and is thinly settled. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”records</span> of the Department of the Interior 
               <br />
               show that north of township 38 there are 
               <br />
               51 ranching leases and south of township 
               <br />
               38 there are 408 ranching leases, many of 
               <br />
               them covering very large areas—a ranch is 
               <br />
               a lease of land from the government to stock 
               <br />
               raiser-s. The area under lease north of 
               <br />
               township 38 is 11,520 acres ; the area under 
               <br />
               lease south of township 38 is 1,550,720. 
               <br />
               North of township 38 applications for leases 
               <br />
               are in for 54,400 acres; south of township 
               <br />
               38 applications are in for 5,514,560 acres, and 
               <br />
               the men who make applications for these 
               <br />
               leases base their claims upon the fact that 
               <br />
               this land is not agricultural land and is ﬁt 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> nothing but pasture. Now, if this

               <br />

               St. Albert, 570; Victoria, 641; Strathcona, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">645;</span> Lacombe, 871; Wetaskiwin, no vote; 
               <br />
               the member being elected by acclamation ; a 
               <br />
               total vote of 3,832, or an average of 766. If 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite will say that was a 
               <br />
               fair and just distribution, I maintain that 
               <br />
               it was not. I am aware that there was no 
               <br />
               motion of censure made in the legislative 
               <br />
               assembly of Regina in regard to that dis- 
               <br />
               tribution, because that would result in no 
               <br />
               good, but the people in the north, of whom I 
               <br />
               was one. were certainly dissatisﬁed. Now, 
               <br />
               under the schedule which we have prepared, 
               <br />
               which I think 'I can prove to be eminently 
               <br />
               fair to all parties, the following would be 
               <br />
               the result. South of Red Deer there would 
               <br />
               be a rural vote of 8,380, and north of Red 
               <br />
               Deer, 8,220, an average for the 10 consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies south of Red Deer of 838, and an 
               <br />
               average for the 10 constituencies north of 
               <br />
               Red Deer of 822, and the Red Deer consti- 
               <br />
               tuency with 843. I maintain that the old 
               <br />
               part of Alberta is divided by the schedule 
               <br />
               as fairly as it can possibly be done. The 
               <br />
               only portion in regard to which any one 
               <br />
               could have reason to ﬁnd fault is the added 
               <br />
               portion of the district of Athabaska. Now, 
               <br />
               I did not consent that Athabaska should 
               <br />
               be divided into two constituencies without 
               <br />
               giving the matter grave thought. I con- 
               <br />
               sidered the immense area of that district. 
               <br />
               The proposed constituency of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Athalbaska</span> 
               <br />
               will be nearly 150 miles one way and 300- 
               <br />
               miles the other way. During the past few 
               <br />
               years it has attracted an immense number 
               <br />
               of people. They may not stay there all the 
               <br />
               time, but they go and trade and make money 
               <br />
               there. Many of the wealthiest men in the 
               <br />
               northern part of Alberta have made their 
               <br />
               fortunes in that very portion of the country, 
               <br />
               and we all know that in the southwestern 
               <br />
               portion of Athabaska, in the valley of Peace 
               <br />
               River, there is a fertile country. I have
