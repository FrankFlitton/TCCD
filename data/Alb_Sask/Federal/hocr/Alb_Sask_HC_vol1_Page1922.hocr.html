               As far as the French language is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concerned,</span> 
               <br />
               on the contrary, the British North America

               Act simply declares that the French lan— 
               <br />

               courts created by the parliament of Can- 
               <br />
               ada, or that it shall be used in the proceed- 
               <br />
               ings before the Supreme Court, or in the 
               <br />
               proceedings before the courts and the legis-

               <br />
               So I say our contention is absolutely in con— 
               <br />
               formity with the constitution of Canada, 
               <br />
               and I am sure that nobody will attempt to 
               <br />
               argue that our position on the question of 
               <br />
               .the French language is not in harmony 
               <br />
               with the position which we took on the 
               <br />
               school question. As a question of fact is 
               <br />
               the French language used to-day in the 
               <br />
               courts in the Northwest Territories? Is it 
               <br />
               used to-day in the publibation of the ordin- 
               <br />
               ances? I have been informed that the 
               <br />
               ordinances have not been published in 
               <br />
               French for many years, and that there never 
               <br />
               was any request for their publication in 
               <br />
