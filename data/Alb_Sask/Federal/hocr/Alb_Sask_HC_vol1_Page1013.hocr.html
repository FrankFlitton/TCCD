               sidered. As I have said before, I belong to

               a church which has exerted itself to create 
               <br />
               a religious sentiment in the west, and I 
               <br />
               have given you from leading men in that 
               <br />
               church evidence to show that the schools. 
               <br />
               as they are now constituted in the west, 
               <br />
               are satisfactory to the people belonging to

               that fact we should attach a great deal of 
               <br />
               weight—the man who took such an interest 
               <br />
               in education in the Northwest, Dr. Robert- 
               <br />
               son, never said a word against the school 
               <br />
               system as it existed there in 1882. And if 
               <br />
               we read through the ordinances, we cannot 
               <br />
               but help coming to the conclusion that. 
               <br />
               from a Protestant standpoint, these schools 
               <br />
               are very much nearer a national system 
               <br />

               zens and a great country, surely we must 
               <br />
               remember that righteousness exalteth a na-

               <br />
               if it is not taught to our children at every 
               <br />
               opportunity? I come from Scotland. where, 
               <br />
               in many of our schools. there was but very 
               <br />
               little taught besides the Bible and the 
               <br />
               Presbyterian Catechism, and I have yet to 
               <br />
               meet a Scotchman who is ashamed of him- 
               <br />
               self and his education. Where will you 
               <br />
               ﬁnd men better educated than the Scotch~ 
               <br />
               men? I come from that country, and I 
               <br />
               feel that, as noble sons of Canada, we should 
               <br />
               imbue into our school system a little more 
               <br />
               religion. Perhaps our boys and girls might 
               <br />
               not have such an education as they other- 
               <br />
               wise would in some other things. but we 
               <br />
               know that the teaching of the Bible will 
               <br />
               impart to them a moral training which no 
               <br />
               other teaching can give. It gives them a 
               <br />
               training such as no other book can give. 
               <br />
               Why should we, a lot of intelligent men, 
               <br />
               spend weeks and weeks in this House dis- 
               <br />
               cussing the question of whether we should 
               <br />
               try to deprive forty per cent of our people
