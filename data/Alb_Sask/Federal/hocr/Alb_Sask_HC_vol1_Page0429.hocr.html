               hands, abandoned the constitutional argu-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fou</span> forcing these schools on the people of 
               <br />
               that western country, he asserted that we

               we were morally bound to perpetuate that 
               <br />
               system. We have had legal authorities 
               <br />
               quoted in this House. We have heard the 
               <br />
               opinion of Mr. Christopher Robinson, who 
               <br />
               backed up the opinion from the legal stand- 
               <br />
               point which was given by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition. We have had 
               <br />
               other gentlemen eminent in their profession 
               <br />
               agreeing with the same opinion. It is only 
               <br />
               right and proper for me to say that there 
               <br />
               was another hon. gentleman who particu- 
               <br />
               larly laid down a different opinion in his 
               <br />
               most emphatic manner and with the same 
               <br />
               assurance that usually characterizes all the 
               <br />
               utterances of that hon. gentleman in the 
               <br />
               House. I refer to the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Alberta (Mr. Oliver). That opinion is de- 
               <br />
               serving of all the respect it is entitled to. 
               <br />
               In the face of that high legal opinion I im- 
               <br />
               agined that I saw the right hon. leader of.

               <br />
               to a political supporter of his within six 
               <br />
               months after he was called to the premier- 
               <br />

               <br />
               gentleman writing a letter in these words:

               <br />
               require a lawyer for a judgeship, but still 
               <br />
               there are premier-ships, lieutenant governor- 
               <br />
               ships and several other positions up there 
               <br />
               at the disposal of the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               and I will venture to say that so long as 
               <br />
               we have these positions dangling before 
               <br />
               the eyes of the hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />

               these schools were wiped out of existence, 
               <br />
               though to do him justice I must say that it 
               <br />
               was a stronger man who dictated this policy 
               <br />

               <br />
               the hon. Joseph’s lead and the schools were 
               <br />
               abolished. Where is the hon. ex-Minister of
