               <br />
               to them. Personally, I believe it would

               be better to have all our children edu-

               <br />
               make better citizens. But I have al—

               ways lived in a mixed community such 
               <br />
               as we have in Ottawa, and I consider 
               <br />
               that the rights and feelings of every 
               <br />

               that it would be impossible to carry

               the impression that he expected the 
               <br />
               measure to be strongly objected to by 
               <br />
               the Protestants of this country. That is 
               <br />
               exactly what happened. Petitions began to 
               <br />
               pour in at once, and a few days afterwards 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               resigned his ofﬁce. After that. a whole

               month elapsed before the modiﬁed educa—

               ment, and this agitation throughout the 
               <br />
               country kept on growing. I believe the 
               <br />
               storm of disapproval would never have 
               <br />
               arisen if the right hon. Prime Minister had
