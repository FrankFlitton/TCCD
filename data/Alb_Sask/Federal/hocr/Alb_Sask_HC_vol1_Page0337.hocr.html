               <br />
               the union. I have not the slightest doubt

               that the principal reason which prompted 
               <br />
               the Act of 1871. was the very doubt to 
               <br />
               which I have referred. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“But</span> the passing of 
               <br />
               the Act of 1871 has, to my mind, removed

               any doubt which could have existed to that

               <br />

               <br />
               out by others. was to establish a national 
               <br />
               partnership between then fully independent 
               <br />
               and autonomous provinces or colonies sub- 
               <br />
               ject only to one jurisdiction. and that was

               the imperial jurisdiction, whatever it may 
               <br />

               <br />
               from one case to the other. But the idea 
               <br />
               of the fathers of confederation was to make 
               <br />
               an agreement—a partnership agreement I 
               <br />

               ly in order to get over that very difﬁ- 
               <br />
               culty. It was thought at that time, after 
               <br />
               Manitoba and the Territories had been taken 
               <br />
               in, in 1870, that the provisions of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. 1867, were insufﬁcient 
               <br />
               to cover the case of the Territories. There 
               <br />
               arose a doubt at that time Whether all the 
               <br />
               provisions of the Act of 1867 were ap- 
               <br />
               plicable to the Territories upon their ad- 
               <br />
               mission. There also arose another doubt as 
               <br />
               to whether the powers of this parliament in 
               <br />
               admitting territories as such under the pro- 
               <br />
               visions of section 146 had not been exhaust- 
               <br />
               ed. It was thought by some that we had 
               <br />
               exercised the power given to us by section
