               I was desirous of pointing out that vari- 
               <br />
               ous amendments have been made to this 
               <br />
               Bill since it came before the House. Some 
               <br />
               of these we have been able to comprehend, 
               <br />
               others we have not. I must say that it 
               <br />
               remains in a very unsatisfactory state now, 
               <br />
               in so far as I have been able to gather the 
               <br />
               opinion of the House on the matter. The 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Agriculture yesterday, for 
               <br />
               some reason or other, was in very poor 
               <br />
               voice for him. We could not very well hear 
               <br />
               what he said, and therefore we were unable 
               <br />
               to take that part in th debate which we 
               <br />
               should like to have ta <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(en.</span> Therefore, I 
               <br />
               feel called upon to move this amendment 
               <br />
               which I have just <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁered</span> to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”House.</span> In 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place, I desire to point out that 
               <br />
               the time mentioned in clause 1 is too limit- 
               <br />
               ed. That I have previously drawn atten- 
               <br />
               tion to, and it is not necessary to give fur— 
               <br />
               ther reasons than simply to say that this 
               <br />
               is a serious objection to the Bill. Then 
               <br />
               clause 3, providing for the placarding of the 
               <br />
               sacks, is aISO a most objectionable one. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has had pointed out to him 
               <br />
               time and again that it was impossible to 
               <br />
               carry out this provision of the Bill, but he 
               <br />
               refuses to take any notice of that objection, 
               <br />
               which, all the trade will tell him, is abso- 
               <br />
               lutely well-founded. It is impossible to 
               <br />
               placard these bags even if we were willing, 
               <br />
               because if the seed should contain any of 
               <br />
               these weeds which are enumerated, it is 
               <br />
               necessary to placard the bag with the names 
               <br />
               of these weeds. It is impossible to do that. 
               <br />
               Further, seed for the foreign market would 
               <br />
               not be accepted in bags placarded in this 
               <br />
               way, and for that reason I desire again to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’point</span> out to the hon. minister that it is im- 
               <br />
               possible that this provision can be carried 
               <br />
               out. Then as to the exemption of the grow- 
               <br />
               er while the dealer is prohibited from sell- 
               <br />
               ing this article, I desire again to point out 
               <br />
               that there are serious objections to this pro— 
               <br />
               vision. The hon. minister announced that 
               <br />
               his object in bringing in this Bill was to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ensure'the</span> purity of seed, but it turns out, 
               <br />
               in View of this provision of the Bill, that 
               <br />
               it is not for pure seed at all. If that were 
               <br />
               the object of the Bill, that clause should 
               <br />
               not stand for a moment. That particular 
               <br />
               clause cannot stand the test of good judg- 
               <br />
               ment at the hands of this House; there— 
               <br />
               fore, I think the hon. gentleman should re— 
               <br />
               call that clause. Then in regard to the 
               <br />
               standard for seed that he sets up. I have 
               <br />
               submitted, and I am sure it has not been 
               <br />
               controverted by the hon. gentlemen opposite, 
               <br />
               nor can it well be, that it is impossible to 
               <br />
               comply with the provisions of clause 
               <br />
               4, I think it is. It is impossible for 
               <br />
               us to get a large amount of seed of No. 
               <br />
               1 quality. No. 1 quality will be a very 
               <br />
               scarce article according to the Bill. The 
               <br />
               Bill makes it difﬁcult to procure No. 1 quali- 
               <br />
               ty, but when you have procured that quality 
               <br />
               you have not a ﬁrst—class seed by any means. 
               <br />
               That, I think, is a very serious objection to 
               <br />
               the Bill. The hon. minister sets up a stan- 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 188 2546 944 2581">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               dard for No. 1 quality, and after he has

            </p>

               obtained that quality, according to the test 
               <br />
               of purity which he makes, he has a very 
               <br />
               inferior quality of seed, as he takes no 
               <br />
               stock in the colour of the seed nor in the 
               <br />
               size of its development. These are two very 
               <br />
               important factors in seed which the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman discards entirely. The evidence 
               <br />
               taken by the Royal Commission that în— 
               <br />
               quired into the.matter in England discloses 
               <br />
               the fact that two of the prime necessities 
               <br />
               of No. 1 seed are that it shall be of large 
               <br />
               well developed size and have a good bold 
               <br />
               colour. Both of these items are absent in 
               <br />
               the hon. minister’s estimate of No. 1 seed. 
               <br />
               There is another very good reason why the 
               <br />
               clause setting up a standard for No. 1 seed 
               <br />
               should meet with the opposition of the 
               <br />
               House. The requirements of the clause are 
               <br />
               such that only a limited quantity will pass 
               <br />
               the tests, and will not be the best of seed 
               <br />
               by any means. But it must be placarded 
               <br />
               nevertheless as inferior if it contains ﬁve 
               <br />
               out of a thousand weed seeds. That is 
               <br />
               surely a great injustice to a large amount 
               <br />
               of the product of this country, because hav— 
               <br />
               ing to be placarded it makes it comparative— 
               <br />
               ly unsaleable. It is placed at a discount on 
               <br />
               the market, because you have branded upon 
               <br />
               it all the various impurities which it con- 
               <br />
               tains, though they may be very limited in 
               <br />
               quantity. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It is quite possible under this Bill that 
               <br />
               these weed seeds may prevail to the ex- 
               <br />
               tent of 10, 15 or 20 to the thousand, and 
               <br />
               still you will have a very much better ar- 
               <br />
               ticle than you would have with a sample 
               <br />
               that is poor in germination. but true to 
               <br />
               name and which at the same time may 
               <br />
               have only ﬁve weed seeds to the thousand. 
               <br />
               Therefore, I think the hon. gentleman has 
               <br />
               missed the object of the measure entirely 
               <br />
               in setting up his standard. He has not got 
               <br />
               a good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">standard</span> for No. 1 seed after having 
               <br />
               graded it according to this Bill. For this 
               <br />
               and for various other reasons that have 
               <br />
               already been adduced in the House, and 
               <br />
               that are convincing to the judgment of all 
               <br />
               men who desire to have a good practicable 
               <br />
               and workable measure, I believe that this 
               <br />
               Bill should be submitted to a special com- 
               <br />
               mittee where the evidence of those well 
               <br />
               qualiﬁed to judge can be obtained and the 
               <br />
               matter can be fully threshed out before a 
               <br />
               committee of farmers, growers, dealers and 
               <br />
               all concerned. Let every clause stand on 
               <br />
               its merits and if it is found that the Bill 
               <br />
               will pass before this committee and is be— 
               <br />
               lieved to be a workable and practical meas— 
               <br />
               ure which will serve the best interests of 
               <br />
               agriculture in this country by all means let 
               <br />
               us pass the Bill. But if it is not found to
