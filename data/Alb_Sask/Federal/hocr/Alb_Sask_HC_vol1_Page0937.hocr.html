               <br />
               60 miles further east it would take in practi- 
               <br />
               cally the whole of what is known as the 
               <br />
               range country in the new province of Al- 
               <br />
               berta. Here I may mention that one hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman on the other side of the House, I 
               <br />
               think the hon. member for West Assiniboia 
               <br />
               (Mr. Scott), stated with reference to this 
               <br />
               boundary question that the stock interests 
               <br />
               shipped more cattle at Yorkton, out of this 
               <br />
               stock. country, than they did' from Alberta, 
               <br />
               and that therefore Yorkton must be in a 
               <br />
               stock country also. You might just as 
               <br />
               well say that the province of Quebec is a 
               <br />
               stock country because a lot of stock is 
               <br />
               shipped from the city of Quebec, but the 
               <br />
               stock comes from the west and is shipped 
               <br />
               through Quebec. Now I wish to show the 
               <br />
               House how the proposed boundary line af— 
               <br />
               fects the stock business. Suppose that in 
               <br />
               the new province of Saskatchewan a tax 
               <br />
               of ﬁve cents a head is put on cattle, and 
               <br />
               that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alberta</span> a tax of ten cents per head 
               <br />
               is imposed ; hon. gentlemen can see the 
               <br />
               diiﬁculty stock men would he in. That is 
               <br />
               an illustration of what would be the result 
               <br />
               in only one line of business. The owners 
               <br />
               of these cattle never count them. I suppose 
               <br />
               they have not been counted for twenty 
               <br />
               years in some herds, numbering from 5,000 
               <br />
               to 15.000. head. As I have said. they are only 
               <br />
               recognized by their owners by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(liﬁerent</span> 
               <br />
               brands. If you cut square through the cen- 
               <br />
               tre of that country where those large herds 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.of</span> wild stock are running, and make a boun- 
               <br />
               dary line dividing the stock interests of the 
               <br />
               two provinces, I think the House will un- 
               <br />
               derstand that it is very important to the 
               <br />
               stock interest where that line is put. I hope 
               <br />
               that when this Bill gets into committee 
               <br />
               some amend-ment may be made to it in this 
               <br />
               direction. I do not see that there could be 
               <br />
               any objection to it from either side, or from 
               <br />
               any other province, and it would be of great 
               <br />
               advantage to the people of the two new 
               <br />
               provinces. You must remember, Mr. Speak- 
               <br />
               er, that this is theonly stock country we 
               <br />
               have in the whole of Canada, indeed it is 
               <br />
               the only stock country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to—day</span> on this conti- 
               <br />
               nent, where stock runs out the year through. 
               <br />
               It is a very large business, and will conti- 
               <br />
               nue to grow for years <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> come, and I think 
               <br />
               it would be a pity for this parliament to 
               <br />
               legislate in any way that would injure 
               <br />

               we consider it a very serious one in our

               Now, with reference to the land <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question-</span> 
               <br />
               As I said at the beginning, that question 
               <br />
               has been an issue at all the elections we 
               <br />
               have had in the Northwest Territories, and 
               <br />
               I suppose that the result of those elections 
               <br />
               may be taken as a fair test of the feelings 
               <br />
               of the people. The test of the last election 
               <br />
               was that provincial autonomy be granted. 
               <br />
               The people of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               asked for one province, and I am of the 
               <br />
               opinion that one province would have been 
               <br />
               quite suﬂiicient for the present needs of that 
               <br />
               country and perhaps for all time to come. 
               <br />
               The people of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               were unanimous, or very nearly so, that 
               <br />
               one province would be suﬁicient. That was 
               <br />
               a question that was left undecided in Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain’s draft Bill, but one question that 
               <br />
               they were decided upon was that they 
               <br />
               should themselves handle the lands and 
               <br />
               minerals in that country. I think there is 
               <br />
               no question as to what the decision of the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest Territories was on 
               <br />
               that point. Mr. Hau-ltain went to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coun</span> 
               <br />
               try in 1902 ; that question was discussed on 
               <br />
               every platform, and after the elections were 
               <br />
               over and the returns were counted, while 
               <br />
               a few dissented from Mr. Haultain’s opinions 
               <br />
               in regard to the general principles of ad- 
               <br />
               ministration, on the principle of provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy there was not one dissenting 
               <br />
               voice at the ﬁrst meeting of the assembly. 
               <br />
               I think that is one of the best indications 
               <br />
               of the way the people in the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories feel on this question. Hon. mem— 
               <br />
               bers have read letters from people in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories and, as I stated a 
               <br />
               moment ago, one hon. member read a letter 
               <br />
               from a gentleman in Alberta saying that the 
               <br />
               people desired that the Dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment should retain control of their lands. 
               <br />
               You can only compare that with what oc— 
               <br />
               curred in 1002 in the elections. One of the 
               <br />
               reasons why we are so much in favour of 
               <br />
               retaining our own lands in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories is this: We have laboured from 
               <br />
               the early days under the disadvantage of 
               <br />
               railway and other corporations owning a 
               <br />
               great deal of the land. It makes no differ- 
               <br />
               ence wha-t government is responsible for it, 
               <br />
               the fact exists, and we have to deal with it 
               <br />
               as we ﬁnd it. lIt must be recognized that 
               <br />
               it is a hardship to the people in that country 
               <br />
               to be at the trouble and expense cf improving 
               <br />
               land that other people may derive the bene— 
               <br />
               ﬁt from their efforts. Every dollar that we
