               of fair-play and justice of the people in the 
               <br />
               new territories. I was proceeding to tell 
               <br />
               the House that we must in this matter 
               <br />
               remember Manitoba, when I was interrupt- 
               <br />
               ed by the member for North Toronto (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster). I wish to say that in my own judg— 
               <br />
               ment in matters of this kind we ought to do 
               <br />
               what good busineSS people do in every day 
               <br />
               dealings and transactions. Whilst people be- 
               <br />
               lieve and take it for granted that other 
               <br />
               people are honest and intend to be honest 
               <br />
               until the contrary is proven, yet they make 
               <br />
               an agreement, when they decide upon some- 
               <br />
               thing, they reduce it to writing. Until the 
               <br />
               day of universal fair-play and justice, until 
               <br />
               the day of universal honesty, which I think 
               <br />
               most will admit is not going to be in the 
               <br />
               very near future, I think people will con- 
               <br />
               tinue to have more conﬁdence in and to 
               <br />
               place more reliance upon the written agree- 
               <br />
               ments of other people than they will upon 
               <br />
               their spirit of fair-play and justice. That 
               <br />
               rule applies to nations as well as to în— 
               <br />
               dividuals.

               We have made an agreement, we have 
               <br />
               decided what is to be done with reference 
               <br />
               to those new provinces and it is far better 
               <br />
               for the peace of this country, far better 
               <br />
               for every consideration, that that agreement 
               <br />
               should be. committed to writing as it is by 
               <br />
               enacting section 16. When we look at 
               <br />
               what section 16 merely perpetuates it is 
               <br />
               astounding to hear the objections that are 
               <br />
               made to it. Section 16 simply consecrates 
               <br />
               the principle of religious instruction in the 
               <br />
               school, and I should like to ask: What prin- 
               <br />
               ciple is violated ; what wrong, legal, moral, 
               <br />
               natural, or constitutional is done ? Does the 
               <br />
               exercise of the privilege claimed by the 
               <br />
               minority cause injury to anybody; does it 
               <br />
               entail upon any one in this wide Dominion 
               <br />
               the deprivation of any right or any pri- 
               <br />
               vilege; does it take anything away from 
               <br />
               anybody; does it hurt, hamper or injure 
               <br />
               any one in the slightest degree; does it do
