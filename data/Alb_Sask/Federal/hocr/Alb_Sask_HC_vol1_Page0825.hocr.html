               In all we have there enumerated 21 den-

               of 48,247. The right hon. gentleman, to 
               <br />
               whom I have already referred, went on 
               <br />
               to show that inasmuch as the differences 
               <br />
               between the Protestants were small as com-

               <br />
               testants were great, he could properly divide 
               <br />
               this country into two great classes—Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics and Dissentient sects, the latter, 
               <br />
               as mentioned by the hon. Solicitor General 
               <br />

               f the population. Now, surely that is a 
               <br />
               strange class of reasoning. Here we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the Roman Catholic Church is put 
               <br />
               down in the census as containing almost 
               <br />
               three times as many adherents as the larg- 
               <br />
               est of the other denominations in Canada. 
               <br />
               By what class of reasoning, by what right 
               <br />
               of reasoning can hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               say: We are the minority ? I say that 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholics of this country are 
               <br />
               the majority, the vast majority as is proved 
               <br />
               by a careful examination of the returns 
               <br />
               showing the populations of the various den- 
               <br />
               ominations. Now I think that all this 
               <br />
               sympathy that hon. gentlemen opposite are 
               <br />
               working up in regard to minorities is a 
               <br />
               farce. This is an argument that has led 
               <br />
               many hon. gentlemen astray in discussing 
               <br />
               this question. They have said: Let us 
               <br />
               consider the views of the minority; let 
               <br />
               us guard and safeguard the interests of 
               <br />
               the minority. The right hon. First Minister, 
               <br />

               <br />
               Roman Catholic fellow—citizens on the one 
               <br />
               side, goes on and puts the other 60 per 
               <br />
               cents together classing them as dissentient 
               <br />
               sects, classing them as Protestants, and 
               <br />
               telling us there is very little difference 
               <br />
               between us. It will make interesting read- 
               <br />

               tist, Anglican and Congregational friends 
               <br />
               to tell them that there is very little dif-

               of them so peculiar that they cannot even 
               <br />

               <br />

               no church or no denomination in this country

               possesses to the extent that the Roman

               never go out and this fact is symbolic of 
               <br />
               the church itself. It has a united front, 
               <br />
               an irresistible front, and the fact that it 
               <br />
               is marching through this country conquering 
               <br />
               and to conquer shows to me and shows to 
               <br />
               you that it does not need consideration as a 
               <br />
               feeble minority. That is the view in so 
               <br />
               far as I understand it that is held by many 
               <br />
               of the Protestant denominations of Ontario. 
               <br />
               It may be right in your estimation, or it 
               <br />
               may be wrong, but I give it as my genuine 
               <br />
               conviction that in so far as minorities are 
               <br />
               concerned, if that is the only ground upon 
               <br />
               which you make your appeal, there is not 
               <br />
               a single denomination amongst those con- 
               <br />
               tained in the list in this census book which 
               <br />
               is less entitled to consideration than those 
               <br />
               for whom so much has been said on this 
               <br />
               occasion. They are not feeble, they are not 
               <br />
               weak, and therefore, this argument in regard 
               <br />
               to extending to them a tolerance and a for- 
               <br />
               bearance that would not be extended to 
               <br />
               other bodies in this country is not one which 
               <br />
               is well founded, and I believe that hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen opposite have fallen into a worse 
               <br />
               error because they have based their argu- 
               <br />
               ments upon false premises and have there- 
               <br />
               fore been led to false conclusions.

               That, so far as I understand, is in a nut- 
               <br />
               shell the attitude of the Protestant denomi— 
               <br />
               nations of Ontario. It has been charged 
               <br />
               across the ﬂoor of this House, that Ontario 
               <br />
               is exhibiting intolerance. For my part I 
               <br />
               believe that charge to be false. I believe 
               <br />
               the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tolerance,</span> exists in Ontario to-day 
               <br />
               as has always existed, and as has always 
               <br />
               been extended to the people of all relig1ous 
               <br />
               convictions. That tolerance is just as 
               <br />
               marked to-day in Ontario as ever it was, 
               <br />
               so that it is neither right nor just that a 
               <br />
               charge of intolerance should be levied 
               <br />
               against my native province. Why are the 
               <br />
               English—speaking members of the cabinet 
               <br />
               from Ontario silent, when they hear this 
               <br />
               aspersion cast on the province they are sup- 
               <br />
               posed to represent ? Why are they not on 
               <br />
               their feet to defend Ontario ? Who have we 
               <br />
               in the cabinet from the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               to repel these insults ? The Postmaster 
               <br />
               General and the Minister of Customs are 
               <br />
               the only members who seem to grace the 
               <br />
               seats of this House as representing Ontario ; 
               <br />
               the most populous province in the Dominion, 
               <br />
               the province that pays almost one-half the 
               <br />
               taxes of this country. When the most im- 
               <br />
               portant legislation that has probably ever 
               <br />
