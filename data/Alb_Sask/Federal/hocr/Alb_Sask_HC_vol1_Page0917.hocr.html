               theory of provincial rights must be limited 
               <br />
               and restricted. But in the opinion of some, 
               <br />
               the educational clauses in the Bill ought 
               <br />
               not to be numbered as one of the exemp— 
               <br />

               <br />
               the clause restricts the power of the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial legislatures to take away from the 
               <br />
               minority their right to have their children

               mendable exception to the theoretical doc- 
               <br />
               trine of provincial rights, and one which 
               <br />
               makes for peace, harmony and unity in 
               <br />
               our new provinces. And as parliament, in 
               <br />
               my opinion, has the power to give to these 
               <br />
               provinces Whatever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iconstziltution</span> it \likes, 
               <br />
               and as we in the Territories do not want a

               school question for a foot—ball in provincial 
               <br />
               politics, this parliament'ought to give us 
               <br />
               a plain and clear law which we can all un- 
               <br />
               derstand, and which Will make provision 
               <br />
               [or an efficient high grade national school 
               <br />
               system, and at the same time respect the 
               <br />
               conscientious principles of the minority to 
               <br />
               have their children given religious instruc-

               tion in the school. Sir, in conclusion, I 
               <br />
               would like to call the attention of the east- 
               <br />
               ern members to the fact that when the 
               <br />
               Northwest began to develop, the Dominion 
               <br />
               began to prosper, and the more it developed, 
               <br />
               the more the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prospered,</span> and I 
               <br />
               believe that prosperity will continue and 
               <br />
               increase under the new constitutions about 
               <br />
               to be established, and we are anxious that 
               <br />
               nothing he done to create strife and friction 
               <br />
               among the different nationalities and reli- 
               <br />
               gions in the new provinces, but that we be 
               <br />
               given a law in reference to education which 
               <br />
               is of our own making, and one peculiarly 
               <br />
               suited to us, and one which gives us the

               the government has secured the services of 
               <br />
               an expert? The matter has been brought 
               <br />
               to my attention by a number of people 
               <br />
               interested in the manufacture of carbide and 
               <br />
               in the sale of acetylene gas as an illumin— 
               <br />
               ant. They think very properly that an ex- 
               <br />
               plosion of acetylene gas just when that 
               <br />
               substance is beginning to be extensively 
               <br />
               used as an illuminant is calculated to do 
               <br />
               serious injury to that industry. Their pre- 
               <br />
               tension is that acetylene gas submitted to 
               <br />
               a pressure of over 30 pounds becomes ex— 
               <br />
               tremely dangerous, and that where it is 
               <br />
               submitted to a pressure of 180 pounds, as I 
               <br />
               am told it was in the case of the accident 
               <br />
               at Kingston, the danger is much increased, 
               <br />
               and such would be the effect, not only with 
               <br />
               acetylene, but other gases as well. They, 
               <br />
               therefore, consider it very important that 
               <br />
               an expert, a man quite conversant with'the 
               <br />
               uses to which acetylene gas may be put, 
               <br />
               should be joined to that commission of in-

               <br />
               brought out and made widely known, and 
               <br />
               that this industry, which is now being con- 
               <br />
               siderably developed, should not suffer be-

               Mr. TAYLOR. I think the inquiry should 
               <br />
               be extended. The constituents I have the

               <br />
               may come along and tamper with them. 
               <br />
               No person is in charge of them. The ex-
