               <br />
               said that there were on the voters' lists in

               12,863—a mere <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> of 3,032. But if 
               <br />
               the average of each constituency on the 
               <br />
               lists is 1,200, which I understand it to be 
               <br />
               practically, there are two constituencies and 
               <br />
               a-half given to the north, even taking the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures of the First Minister, more than to 
               <br />
               the south. Therefore, the north is appar-

               ently getting an advantage which I for one 
               <br />
               would like to see somewhat rectiﬁed. In these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures Athabaska has been left out again. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman says that in the

               thirteen constituencies. It does not seem

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“fair</span> to discuss this matter with regard to

               I propose to say a few words with regard 
               <br />
               to Athabaska. In the ﬁrst place, the sug- 
               <br />
               gestion of some hon. members on this side 
               <br />
               that Athabaska should be added to another 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituency</span> has been taken up wrongly 
               <br />
               by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span> gentlemen opposite. There has been 
               <br />
               no suggestion on this side that these people 
               <br />
               in Athabaska shou1d have no representation 
               <br />
               We have gone beyond the time when we 
               <br />
               think people should be deprived of repre- 
               <br />
               scnatio'n if that can possibly be avoided. 
               <br />
               But what hon. members on this side do say 
               <br />
               is that Athabaska should not have two con- 
               <br />
               stituencies given it for comparatively few 
               <br />
               voters and the constituencies on the south 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lze</span> deprived of their rights. By being added 
               <br />
               to another constituency the people of Atha— 
               <br />
               baska would have their representation, but 
               <br />
               they would only have what is due them 
               <br />
               and not the extraordinary representation 
               <br />
               proposed by this Bill.

               He says that money does not have votes, 
               <br />
               that it is the people who have votes. Well, 
               <br />
               that is what we want them to have. We 
               <br />
               want the people to get votes, one vote for 
               <br />
               one man and no more, but if the govern— 
               <br />
               ment give to the unoccupied part of Atha- 
               <br />
               baska two constituencies to elect members 
               <br />
               it seems to me that the minister will have 
               <br />
               to register a lot of white ﬁsh and spruce 
               <br />
               trees hp there to get the proper number of 
               <br />
               voters for these constituencies. The hon. 
               <br />
               minister has made a strong plea for the 
               <br />
               representation of the northern part of this 
               <br />
               new province on account of its great future. 
               <br />
               We will grant that it is going to have a 
               <br />
               great future. I do not think it was neces- 
               <br />
               sary for the hon. minister to set forth this 
               <br />
               argument about the future of the country 
               <br />
               because I do not think any one will say 
               <br />
               it is not going to be a great country. We 
               <br />
               all hope and expect it will and we will all 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.very</span> much disappointed if we are mis- 
               <br />
               taken. But. I submit that the future of
