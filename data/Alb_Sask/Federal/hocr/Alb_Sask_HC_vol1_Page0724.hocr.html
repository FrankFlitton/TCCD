               then, is: Do we secure efﬁciency under the 
               <br />
               existing school laws of the Northwest Ter-

               ritories which this government proposes to

               perpetuate? The answer is easy and ob- 
               <br />
               vious. The Territories are proud of their 
               <br />
               school law. The fundamental principles of 
               <br />

               <br />
               uniform. All the children have the same 
               <br />
               advantages and the same privileges. The 
               <br />
               legislation now introduced by this govern- 
               <br />

               <br />
               laws from time to time in amendment of 
               <br />
               the existing laws, in a direction of eﬂiciency. 
               <br />
               The principle of efficiency is secured, and is

               nutshell, it is that, after the usual school 
               <br />
               hours the children of the minority, or indeed 
               <br />
               of the majority can be taught religion by 
               <br />
               their religious instructors for half an hour, 
               <br />
               and the minority have the right to have a 
               <br />
               school of their own, but that school is subject 
               <br />
               to the same laws as to eﬂiciency, &amp;c., as all 
               <br />
               the other schools. To put it in another way, 
               <br />
               a suﬁicient number of Roman Catholics in 
               <br />
               any school district can decide to have their 
               <br />
               children taught in a separate national 
               <br />
               school. but religion cannot be taught those 
               <br />
               children unless after school hours, and then 
               <br />
               for half an hour only. As the Minister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> 
               <br />
               Finance put it some time ago. it seems to 
               <br />
               me that this is a very small thing to quarrel 
               <br />
               about. Why should they not teach religion 
               <br />
               to the children ? Sir, I believe the very best 
               <br />
               thing for this country would be to have a 
               <br />
               little more religious education in the schools 
               <br />
               —that is the ground I take upon this ques— 
               <br />
               tion. In these days of rush and hurry, when 
               <br />
               the average man is kept busy from morning 
               <br />
               till night providing bread and butter for his 
               <br />
