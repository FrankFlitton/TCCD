               the time we are creating these new prov- 
               <br />
               inces. We would not want in the slightest 
               <br />
               degree to be unjust to the new provinces. I 
               <br />
               am not suggesting that. We want to be 
               <br />
               generous to them in every possible way. 
               <br />
               They are deserving not only of fair but of 
               <br />
               generous treatment from this parliament. I 
               <br />
               am merely suggesting this for the purpose 
               <br />
               of convenience, because when, parliament 
               <br />
               is creating these new provinces, it would be 
               <br />
               much more convenient, it seems to me, to 
               <br />
               treat the whole subject from the standpoint 
               <br />
               of some better principle, if it can be found, 
               <br />
               than it will be years afterwards, or 
               <br />
               even one or two years afterwards, 
               <br />
               when these provinces may be calling upon 
               <br />
               this government _to make good certain claims 
               <br />
               which my hon. friend the ex—Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior (Mr. Sifton) foresaw in respect to 
               <br />
               the question of lands, for example. i do 
               <br />
               not know whether the government have

               taken the question of the revision of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub‘</span> 
               <br />
               sidies sufﬁciently into consideration to give 
               <br />
               to the House any information as to what 
               <br />
               their proposals are at this moment. I would 
               <br />
               infer not, from what my right hon. friend 
               <br />
               has said, but I can only express my regret 
               <br />
               that the government have not been able to 
               <br />
               overtake that question, if they do propose to 
               <br />
               deal with it, in time to present it to the 
               <br />
               House concurrently with the question we 
               <br />
               are now considering. It may be that it is 
               <br />
               impossible to do so. I know how much 
               <br />
               political duties interfere with administrative 
               <br />
               and executive duties on the part of any gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, but still I think it is a matter for 
               <br />
               very great regret that the question is not 
               <br />
               dealt with at this time if it is proposed to 
               <br />
               deal with it in the near future.

               there was no logical reason for adopting the 
               <br />

               <br />
               adopting the 800,000 in this. It is an esti- 
               <br />
               mate of the probable growth, and we know

               that in these Territories the growth is likely

               Mr. FIELDING. I think I am correct in 
               <br />
               stating that in the United States they have 
               <br />
               no system in regard to subsidies at all but 
               <br />
               that each state has to regulate its own 
               <br />
               ﬁnances. I admit that there is something to 
               <br />
               be said in favour of the provinces doing so 
               <br />
               here if we could start afresh. I want 
               <br />
               to say a word in defence of the fathers 
               <br />
               of confederation, and I am not very 
               <br />
               much given to defending the fathers of 
               <br />
               confederation in reference to the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               arrangements that were adopted at the 
               <br />
               time of confederation. If we had been 
               <br />
               dealing with the provinces as we are now 
               <br />
               dealing with the provinces of the west we 
               <br />
               might have demanded from them such terms 
               <br />
               as we pleased. We might have said : Get 
               <br />
               your taxation in any way you please. But. 
               <br />
               that was not the condition in 1867. Each of 
               <br />
               these provinces was an independent body 
               <br />
               when it was asked to come in, and the
