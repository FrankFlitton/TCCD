               the very part that he alluded to was where 
               <br />
               I said that it was not usual to give the

               had asked for. That is how it came out. 
               <br />
               How is it that he saw the answer to that

               part of the question and forgot about the

               Hon. H. R. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">EMMERSON</span> (Minister of 
               <br />
               Railways and Canals). With reference to 
               <br />
               the return relating to the mason inspector, 
               <br />
               my information from the deputy minister 
               <br />
               was that the whole correspondence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was'in—</span> 
               <br />
               eluded in the return. I have not been able 
               <br />
               to question him further because of his ab- 
               <br />
               sence since the attention of the House was 
               <br />
               called to the matter by my hon. friend. I 
               <br />
               have the return with respect to the expen— 
               <br />
               ditures on the Drummond Counties section 
               <br />
               of the Intercolonial Railway. which I shall 
               <br />
               take the liberty now of laying on the table 
               <br />
               of the House. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This”on1y</span> came into my 
               <br />
               hands yesterday afternoon. The return 
               <br />
               with respect to rails is one that I have re- 
               <br />
               peatedly asked Mr. Pottinger for, and he 
               <br />
               has stated that he is furnishing it with all 
               <br />
               the expedition possible, but that it covers a 
               <br />
               wide ﬁeld and the information takes a great 
               <br />
               deal of time and labour to secure. I have 
               <br />
               urged him to have it forwarded as soon as 
               <br />
               possible.

               Mr. FOSTER. With reference to the re- 
               <br />
               turn of which the minister has spoken, 
               <br />
               there must be some mistake. because I have 
               <br />
               in my possession two or three letters and
