               friend is learning from the Minister of the

               on this side not wanting those people to have 
               <br />
               representation, because they are poor half-

               breeds. No person on this side of the House 
               <br />
               has said anything of the kind. Hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen on this side of the House 'are eager

               that every person in the Northwest whether

               that the representation is not properly map—

               <br />
               be gagged or throttled. That is the reason 
               <br />
               we are ﬁnding fault with the legislation

               government in this country should be in— 
               <br />
               creased, that he thinks it is a matter of very

               little importance to create two provinces 
               <br />
               instead of one, and he ﬁnds fault with the

               opposition because they complain of this 
               <br />
               unnecessary addition to the cost of govern-

               cannot believe that the people of New

               <br />
               did believe that our New Brunswick friends 
               <br />

               their views better to have the Territories 
               <br />
               administered by one government than by 
               <br />
               two. My hon. friend wanted to know 
               <br />
               what all the trouble was about, and he has 
               <br />
               characterized the different things we have

               at obstruction, such as he claims we are 
               <br />
               indulging in on this side. Evidently that
