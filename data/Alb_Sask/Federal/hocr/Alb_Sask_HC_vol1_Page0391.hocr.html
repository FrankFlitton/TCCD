               the Dominion will retain control of the Terri-

               <br />

               <br />
               cure the former, the inducement of free home- 
               <br />
               steads must continue to be offered, and to secure 
               <br />
               railway extension, lands, or the proceeds of lands 
               <br />
               are usually granted. Thus, we see, that if the 
               <br />
               new provinces owned the unallotted lands they 
               <br />
               should have practically to give them away. At 
               <br />
               the same time the cost of land administration 
               <br />
               would have to be borne. The duties of the Im- 
               <br />
               migration Department, too, would follow the 
               <br />
               land. The new provinces could not be easily 
               <br />
               equipped for these onerous duties. It took the 
               <br />
               federal authorities many years to _bring immi- 
               <br />
               gration work up to its present status. They 
               <br />
               have it now in a state of high efﬁciency, with 
               <br />
               experienced agents at work in various parts of 
               <br />
               the world. It is important that the good work 
               <br />
               shall continue to go on undisturbed. A hand— 
               <br />

               <br />
               bearing credit, will suit the new provinces much 
               <br />
               better than the extra responsibilities which are 
               <br />
               involved in the ownership and control of the

               haps more contentious in its nature, a1-

               though I am obliged to repeat again that 1

               think that a totally disproportionate amount

               <br />
               a phase of the educational matter. The mat—

               ter of education is one of very prime import- 
               <br />
               ance, the most important matter to the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of any province and the most important 
               <br />
               subject that could possibly be dealt with 
               <br />
               by any parliament or local legislature. But 
               <br />
               the matter that is being debated in the 
               <br />
               House is the narrowest kind of an issue as 
               <br />
               between the proposition of the government 
               <br />
               and the proposition, as it is explained by 
               <br />
               himself, of the hon. member for Carleton. 
               <br />
               However, before actually taking up the 
               <br />
               educational clause, let me make another 
               <br />
               brief reference. The year of confederation, 
               <br />
               1867, chances to be also the year in which I 
               <br />
               was ushered into this world and it will not

               be a matter of surprise, therefore, that some

               of the negotiations and some of the events 
               <br />
               that occurred prior to that time are not 
               <br />
               very deﬁnitely Within my recollection. I 
               <br />
               was thrown into circumstances which did 
               <br />
               not conduce to a great deal of research or 
               <br />
               study historical or constitutional. Probably

               there are many people in Canada, in On—

               <br />
