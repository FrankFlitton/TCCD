               <br />

               Mr. BRODEUR. Yes, that is my opinion.

               <br />
               are broad enough to even cover that. And

               we had not the right to change the law

               We see that this subsection is much 
               <br />
               broader than subsection 1. Subsection 1 
               <br />
               simply protects the minority with regard to 
               <br />
               separate schools. But, under subsection 3 
               <br />
               not only the rights of the minority with 
               <br />
               respect to separate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools</span> are protected, 
               <br />
               but all the rights of the minority in re- 
               <br />
               lation to education. So it comes to this,— 
               <br />
               if the legislature of the Northwest, after 
               <br />
               the Bill has been passed, should try to 
               <br />
               prevent the minority in any section of the 
               <br />
               province establishing schools to give edu- 
               <br />
               cation satisfactory to them or to use the 
               <br />
               French in these schools, there would be 
               <br />
               occasion to discuss the advisability of press- 
               <br />
               ing remedial legislation and exercising-the 
               <br />
               power of disallowance of the Act. ‘So, I 
               <br />
               think the argument of my hon. friend from 
               <br />
