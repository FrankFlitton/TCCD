               lPerhaps I could put it in another way to

               make my meaning clearer. The court re-

               mains as it is. The high court has its duties. 
               <br />
               They will remain and the court continues 
               <br />
               to be the high court for Alberta and Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan. But when the legislatures of 
               <br />
               the provinces constitute a different court, 
               <br />
               then, of course,, we will have to make the 
               <br />
               usual provision.

               move this as the schedule to this section. In

               presenting this schedule I am quite aware 
               <br />
               that we are approaching a very delicate 
               <br />
               subject and one in regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,which</span> it would 
               <br />
               be difficult to come to any unanimous con-

               not without hope at all events that we 
               <br />
               ought to be able to come to something like 
               <br />
               unanimity. We have taken the existing con—

               some criticism that the distribution propos-

               very meagre information as to the actual 
               <br />
               population to-day. I would have thought 
               <br />
               that in this case above all others, it would 
               <br />
               have been proper to refer this question to 
               <br />
               some independent tribunal which could in— 
               <br />
               vestigate and if necessary take evidence 
               <br />
               upon the subject, and in that way prepare 
               <br />
               a schedule, which whether it was 
               <br />
               satisfactory to one party the other 
               <br />
               would at least have the merit of 
               <br />
               having been made by an independent 
               <br />
               tribunal and upon proper investigation 
               <br />
               and evidence. I had hoped the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister would pursue that course, and as 
               <br />
               he has not seen ﬁt to do so we shall have 
               <br />
               to make our own investigation as best we 
               <br />
               may under very difﬁcult conditions. I re- 
               <br />
               peat that a decision cannot be arrived at 
               <br />
               by us in the same thorough and satisfac- 
               <br />
               tory manner, as if the suggestion which I 
               <br />
               have just made had commended itself to 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister.
