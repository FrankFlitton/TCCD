               leader of the opposition as to the legal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*eiiect</span> 
               <br />
               of the language used in these two sections. 
               <br />
               No. 2 goes as far as No. 1, as originally 
               <br />
               introduced by the right hon. First Minister ; 
               <br />
               and if we attempt to Whittle down the 
               <br />
               meaning of No. 2 by saying that it does not 
               <br />
               go as far as No. 1, then the duty is cast 
               <br />
               upon those who argue in that direction to 
               <br />
               show Where there is a limitation. I can 
               <br />
               ﬁnd none in the section itself, and I have 
               <br />
               not understood the Minister of JustiCe to 
               <br />
               make the statement on the ﬂoor of the 
               <br />
               House that there is a less power in section 
               <br />
               16, No. 2, than there is in section 16, No. 
               <br />
               l. I did not understand the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice to say so to—day; I did not understand 
               <br />
               him to say so when he made his explanation 
               <br />
               the other day. I think section 16, No. 2, 
               <br />
               is as full and ample to give separate schools 
               <br />
               to the constitutions of the new provinces 
               <br />
               as section 16, No. 1. I may be mistaken 
               <br />
               about that. I would like to hear from the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice as to whether he is of 
               <br />
               opinion that section 16, No. 2, does not 
               <br />
               go as far as section 16, No. 1. If the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice will make that statement, 
               <br />
               I would like him to say in what respect he 
               <br />
               is of opinion that it does not go as far.

               is concerned, they have no right or privil-

               ege whatever secured to them under that

               clause. The minority in the district, where

               it happens to be Roman Catholic, will have 
               <br />
               certain rights and privileges secured to it 
               <br />
               under clause 2; but where the Roman- 
               <br />
               Catholic minority of the Territories hap- 
               <br />
               pens to be a majority in the school <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">district.</span> 
               <br />
               then it has no right whatever. Then, the;e
