               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. The mistake 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend from Labelle is that he 
               <br />
               argues as it‘ we had the constitutional power 
               <br />
               to make the laws for the Territories. We 
               <br />
               have no such power. My contention has 
               <br />
               always been that our powers are very limit- 
               <br />
               ed constitutionally and that the only one we 
               <br />
               have is to perpetuate the condition existing 
               <br />
               in the Territories. Whether I be right or 
               <br />
               wrong. that is the constitution as I under- 
               <br />
               stand it. My hon. friend from Halton (Mr. 
               <br />
               Henderson) said that the rights of the prô- 
               <br />
               vinces are unlimited in this respect. On 
               <br />
               the contrary they are limited.

               <br />

               I bring it forward now to save time, and 
               <br />
               do not wish to discuss it at length, as I can

               <br />
               may be possible—in fact it is very probable

               —that the language of that section would 
               <br />
               have the same result as that which I pro-

               pose to offer in place of it. But I do not re-

               gard the expressions used in section 2 with 
               <br />
               regard to the- date at which the province
