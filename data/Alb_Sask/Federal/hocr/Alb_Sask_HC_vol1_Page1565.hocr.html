               distribution of seats which was made by the 
               <br />
               local assembly after the election of 1902 
               <br />
               was a prOper basis of representation. He 
               <br />
               takes the ground that because the North— 
               <br />
               west assembly made that distribution, it 
               <br />
               therefore must be right—a distribution 
               <br />

               Mr. OLIVER. I was speaking of the 
               <br />
               old district of Alberta. I am speaking now 
               <br />
               of the new province of Alberta to which 
               <br />
               we gave nine seats in the south to six in 
               <br />
               the north. But the Northwest assembly 
               <br />
               gave the old province of Alberta eight seats 
               <br />
               on the south to six in the north. In the 
               <br />
               votes that were polled _on the 3rd November 
               <br />
               last, the six northern seats polled 9,817 
               <br />
               against 9,666 polled in the eight southenn 
               <br />
               seats. The hon. member takes that pro- 
               <br />
               portion of seats as a fair basis of represen- 
               <br />
               tation, and I leave his argument to the 
               <br />
               House for its consideration. We say that 
               <br />
               it is not a fair basis.
