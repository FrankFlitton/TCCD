               <br />
               manner offer my congratulations to my learn- 
               <br />
               ed and honourable friend—because I under-

               wonderful mental dexterity and alertness 
               <br />
               which he has displayed in making, by a cir—

               this subject. Round and round the subject, 
               <br />
               after the calm and deliberate discussion of

               this House for many weeks, that hon. gen-

               him to get to the centre of the subject and 
               <br />
               to touch the real question involved, namely, 
               <br />
               for what reason or purpose and with What 
               <br />

               perhaps be able, when he goes back to his

               saying that some drastic clauses are object-

               ionable, is rousing passion and prejudice in 
               <br />
               this country and encouraging that current 
               <br />

               <br />
               country in 1896, an imputation which rests

               now heavy as a dark cloud over the govern—

               What does that mean? My hon. friend 
               <br />
               talks of a desire expressed on the part of 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition to impose some- 
               <br />
               thing on the new provinces to which they 
               <br />
               were not subject before. I am not so well 
               <br />
               versed and so astute in reading statutes as 
               <br />
               he has shown himself in his speech, but I 
               <br />
               desire to say that I cannot by any stretch 
               <br />
               of my imagination, by any stretch of logic, 
               <br />
               by any kind of trite reasoning read into that 
               <br />
               amendment any other than a moderate de- 
               <br />
               sire to adhere strictly to the lines of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights and not to take away from 
               <br />
               the provinces those rights which appertaiu 
               <br />
               to provinces, the withdrawal of which 
               <br />
               rights would be a violation of the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion. I am sorry to say, Sir, that is the 
               <br />
               sort of reasoning that in several instances 
               <br />
               we have heard on this clause. Much is it 
               <br />
               to be regretted, and my friend will live to 
               <br />
               regret that ever the accusation of intoler- 
               <br />
               ance was thrown across the ﬂoor of this 
               <br />
               House against the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               in connection with that amendment. That 
               <br />
               charge will not bear the light, the language 
               <br />
               of that amendment refutes the charge and 
               <br />
               the only conclusion, the only inference one 
               <br />
               can draw from the attack which has been 
               <br />
               made upon my honoured leader is the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that my hon. friend desires to throw 
               <br />
               across the ﬂoor of the House an imputation 
               <br />
               which is absolutely groundless. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend has invoked the dictum of Edward 
               <br />
               Blake that it is a good thing to tell the 
               <br />
               people beforehand what law they are going 
               <br />
               to have. That is an excellent proposition 
               <br />
               and one to which nobody can take excep- 
               <br />
               tion, but do we forget that the tide of immi- 
               <br />
               gration which set in many years ago has 
               <br />
               been steadily ﬂowing into these western 
               <br />
               countries, and that it has been ﬂowing into 
               <br />
               these western countries as the result of a 
               <br />
               policy inaugurated by this or a former gov-

               ernment under a Minister of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior.</span> 
               <br />
               Do we forget that representations have 
               <br />
               been made by the hon. member for Brandon 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) when Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior, with regard to what these im- 
               <br />
               migrants may expect in the shape of edu- 
               <br />
               cation ? Does my hon. friend deny that 
               <br />
               the ex-Minister of the Interior has for years 
               <br />
               circulated abroad pamphlets to the effect 
               <br />
               that the schools in the Northwest are non- 
               <br />
               sectarian or national schools ? If so, it is 
               <br />
               a good thing to tell the people beforehand 
               <br />
               what to expect and when that cloud of 
               <br />
               immigration comes in and settles down and 
               <br />
               the new-settlers, if this Bill passes, ask: 
               <br />
               Where are the non-sectarian schools spoken 
               <br />
               of in the pamphlets ? What answer Would 
               <br />
               my hon. friend be disposed to give them ? 
               <br />
               Would he be uisposed to answer with the 
               <br />
