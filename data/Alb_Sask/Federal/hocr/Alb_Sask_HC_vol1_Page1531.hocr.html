               strictly narrow, judicial interpretation of 
               <br />
               the statute. ‘It is the interpretation which a 
               <br />
               court of justice might give, and I think I am 
               <br />
               stating the case fairly when I say that the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition informed the House 
               <br />

               be given by a judge if that section were

               Mr. BELGOURT. Permit me to say that 
               <br />
               in my opinion the canons which should be 
               <br />
               adopted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:by</span> parliament in interpreting a 
               <br />
               statute differ in many respects from the 
               <br />
               canons which govern a court of justice. 
               <br />
               The interpretation by a judge is according 
               <br />
               to the language of the statute and that only ; 
               <br />
               a judge does not look to the extraneous or 
               <br />
               surrounding circumstances which existed 
               <br />
               at the time the law was passed; a judge 
               <br />
               would simply interpret the language to the 
               <br />
               best of his ability according to the dictionary 
               <br />
               and according to jurisprudence. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliament,</span> 
               <br />
               in interpreting a statute, must and should 
               <br />
               adopt a much wider view; parliament, I 
               <br />
               submit, must, in interpreting a statute, look 
               <br />
               at the conditions as they were at the time 
               <br />
               the law was passed ; parliament must look 
               <br />
               at the intention of the legislature which 
               <br />
               passed that law ; it must look at past his- 
               <br />
               tory; it must look at every circumstance 
               <br />
