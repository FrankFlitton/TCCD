               They are in close neighbourhood to many

               of the Thousand Islands, Where hundreds 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               short distance of the town, and if another 
               <br />
               explosion took place similar to that which I 
               <br />
               have mentioned, our town would be blown 
               <br />
               out of existence. A most rigid inquiry 
               <br />
               should be made. I warned the government 
               <br />
               when they ﬁrst proposed to adopt this sys— 
               <br />
               tem of lighting that it was dangerous, and 
               <br />
               would surely result in accidents. An acci- 
               <br />
               dent has occurred already, and even more 
               <br />
               disastrous than I expected. At every place 
               <br />
               in the country where people have adopted 
               <br />
               this system of lighting, accidents have oc- 
               <br />
               curred; but the government, for some rea- 
               <br />
               son or other, went on and adopted it and are 
               <br />
               using it now. The people in Gananoque at 
               <br />
               present are very nervous on account of this 
               <br />

               <br />
               think this commission should be enlarged; 
               <br />
               and if the stulÏ is found to be dangerous, it 
               <br />
               should be removed out of the municipality 
               <br />
               at once.

               I thought it advisable to bring this de- 
               <br />
               spatch to the attention of the government, 
               <br />
               because it is unusual to have an announce- 
               <br />
               ment of this character made by a private 
               <br />
               member of parliament, more particularly 
               <br />
               when parliament is in session. If Mr. Jack- 
               <br />
               son is well informed, i-t‘ seems to me the 
               <br />
               proper course would have been for the First 
               <br />
               Minister or some other member of the ad- 
               <br />
               ministration, having particular charge of 
               <br />
               matters of this character, to make the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an‘</span> 
               <br />
               nouncement in parliament. For that rea- 
               <br />
               son, I venture to inquire whether or not 
               <br />
               Mr. Jackson’s statement is well founded; 
               <br />
               and if so, why is it that the government has 
               <br />
               seen ﬁt to have the communication made to 
               <br />
               the people in this informal way ?

               Sir WILÆ‘RID LAURIER. I have read 
               <br />
               the despatch to which my hon. friend has 
               <br />
               just called attention. I do not understand 
               <br />
               from it that Mr. Jackson presumed to speak 
               <br />
               on behalf of the government or to say that 
               <br />
               any policy had been arrived at and ﬁnally 
               <br />
               determined upon. What I understood him 
               <br />
               to say was that there had been conferences 
               <br />
               between members from the districts of Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan and Alberta and the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and that they had come to a con- 
               <br />
               clusion that an arrangement could be made 
               <br />
               which would be acceptable. Should that 
               <br />
               prove to be the case, and should the govern-
