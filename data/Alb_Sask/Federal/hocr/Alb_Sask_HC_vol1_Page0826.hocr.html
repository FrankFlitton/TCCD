               <br />
               up in his own county of York. Only yester-

               day in the columns of the ‘ Globe ’ Mr. Tarte 
               <br />

               eral <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stop</span> all this fanaticism in Ontario ? 
               <br />
               Fanaticism indeed. The Postmaster Gen- 
               <br />
               eral cannot control the feelings of his 
               <br />
               province, because he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is'</span> not in touch 
               <br />
               with his province, and neither is the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Customs, my hon. good friend and 
               <br />
               neighbour, quite so much in touch with the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario as he appeared to think 
               <br />
               he was when he spoke. I have the honour 
               <br />
               to come from the same town and from the 
               <br />
               same county as the Minister of Customs. 
               <br />
               All our lives we have been strong friends, 
               <br />
               but when it comes to debating matters of 
               <br />
               this nature and of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such.</span> importance, I feel 
               <br />
               I am justiﬁed in criticising the action of 
               <br />
               even my closest friend, and in asserting the 
               <br />
               principles which I believe in. I am re— 
               <br />
               luctantly compelled to criticise the action 
               <br />
               of the Minister of Customs in the two 
               <br />
               speeches he has delivered on this important 
               <br />
               subject. I do not think these speeches were 
               <br />
               calculated to allay the feeling in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario or in the county of Brant. 
               <br />
               I do not think the Minister of Customs set 
               <br />
               me, as a junior member from that county, 
               <br />
               or set this House the good example that we 
               <br />
               would have expected from a minister who 
               <br />
               has been thirty-two years in parliament. 1 
               <br />
               do not believe that the utterances of the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Customs represent what I esteem to 
               <br />
               be the true feeling of the various Christian 
               <br />
               and Protestant denominations of the pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario. I believe that no country 
               <br />
               under Heaven is blessed with a people hav- 
               <br />
               ing stronger religious principles, more ready 
               <br />
               to stand for what is right and true and just, 
               <br />
               and more ready to exhibit religious toler- 
               <br />
               ance, than, is the banner province of On~ 
               <br />
               tario. That province has received a vast 
               <br />
               amount of criticism in this debate, criticism 
               <br />
               which I believe is not justiﬁed. No one in 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario is asking that sepa- 
               <br />
               rate schools be removed from that province. 
               <br />
               That is not the question. We know they 
               <br />
               are there; we are willing to bear the burden, 
               <br />
               and we bear it in good faith and with true 
               <br />
               heart because we know we are helping our 
               <br />
               fellow subjects in the province of Quebec, 
               <br />
               and we will not go back on fair and square 
               <br />
               terms. We are ready to hear that burden 
               <br />
               still in our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province,</span> but what we con- 
               <br />
               tend is that when we are creating two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces in the Northwest; two provinces the 
               <br />
               like of which the sun does not shine on in 
               <br />
               this or any other country, we should be 
               <br />
               careful to give them a fair start in the race 
               <br />
               of life. We should not handicap them by 
               <br />
               placing upon the statute-books of this coun- 
               <br />
               try a provision which prevents them deal- 
               <br />
               ing with a matter, which so far as I under- 
               <br />
               stand the constitution of the country, they 
               <br />
               alone have the right to deal with. The Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Finance, who I am glad to see is in 
               <br />
               his seat, has given us an exposition of the 
               <br />
               difference between the national and the pro-

               posed separate schools, and he tells us that 
               <br />
               the question resolves itself simply into the 
               <br />
               one-half hour's religious instruction at the 
               <br />
               end of the day. I hope I do not misinterpret 
               <br />
               what the Minister of Finance said in that 
               <br />
               respect, but I have his words by me if it is 
               <br />
               necessary to read them. Well, Sir, it is un- 
               <br />
               fortunate for the Minister of Finance and 
               <br />
               his friends on the other side of the House, 
               <br />
               that this little matter as he calls it is big 
               <br />
               enough to separate. It is unfortunate that 
               <br />
               that name ‘Separate’ which has been re- 
               <br />
               sponsible for much heartburnings and strong 
               <br />
               language during the last ﬁfty or sixty years, 
               <br />
               should be introduced for so small a cause. 
               <br />
               The half hour‘s religious instruction at the 
               <br />
               close of the day which divides the national 
               <br />
               schools from the religious schools may not 
               <br />
               be of itself a very great matter but it ap— 
               <br />
               pears to be sufﬁcient to separate, and that 
               <br />
               is the real grievance. The First Minister 
               <br />
               told us in his speech, that comparatively 
               <br />
               small barriers separated the various reli- 
               <br />
               gious bodies in this country. But. Sir, it 
               <br />
               these small matters separate, they are sufﬁ- 
               <br />
               cient to cause division and division is not 
               <br />
               the less regrettable. If the division is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁ-</span> 
               <br />
               ciently marked to cause the establishment of 
               <br />
               separate schools, then it is something which 
               <br />
               we do not want, and as I have shown from 
               <br />
               the census report we cannot afford to set up 
               <br />
               separate schools in these new Territories 
               <br />
               where so many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> creeds are repre- 
               <br />
               sented. Take a farm say of 100 acres, two 
               <br />
               ﬁfths of which is set apart in one high <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">en-</span> 
               <br />
               closure, containing a Roman Catholic church; 
               <br />
               all of the other 60 acres is divided into 
               <br />
               various ﬁelds of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dilierent</span> sizes, but every 
               <br />
               one of them is fenced off the one from the 
               <br />
               other, and though the First Minister may 
               <br />
               argue that the fences are small and light 
               <br />
               and that breachy cattle could go over them 
               <br />
               if they Wished, still they are separated and 
               <br />
               divided and no longer in the same ﬁeld. 
               <br />

               So these barriers, small though they may 
               <br />
               seem, mark a separated and divided people; 
               <br />
               and what we are here to-day to preach is 
               <br />
               not separation, but union, not division, but

               <br />
               when it comes to going to school together, 
               <br />
               we cannot stand it, and for evermore there 
               <br />
               must be separation and division. Is that 
               <br />
               intolerance on our part ? We want to come
