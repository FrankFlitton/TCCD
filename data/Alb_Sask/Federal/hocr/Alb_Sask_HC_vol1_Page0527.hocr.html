               gentleman can make that clear to us, but 
               <br />
               for the moment I cannot understand it. If 
               <br />
               you have one route from Montreal which 
               <br />
               reaches St. John by the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way and another route which readhes from 
               <br />
               St. John to Montreal by the Canadian Pa- 
               <br />
               ciﬁc Railway, and they are competing ; and 
               <br />
               if it is a good principle where there is com- 
               <br />
               petition with the government road that the 
               <br />
               Railway Commission should have jurisdic- 
               <br />
               tion, I would think that ﬁt would logically 
               <br />
               follow, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessarily</span> follow, that the Railway 
               <br />
               Commission should have jurisdiction over 
               <br />
               the Intercolonial Railway. I should think 
               <br />
               that would be an exact deduction from the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s premises, not only a logical 
               <br />
               deduction, but a necessary deduction. That 
               <br />
               is a matter for some discussion perhaps. 
               <br />
               What I do not understand in the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman’s statement is this: How can we 
               <br />
               operate from Parry Sound to Halifax or St. 
               <br />
               John as a through line—and apparently it 
               <br />
               is only with through trafﬁc we are dealing; 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has not explained that 
               <br />
               we are to do local business 'on the line be— 
               <br />
               tween Montreal and Parry Sound—I am 
               <br />
               dealing now only with through rates, and I 
               <br />
               do not yet understand, notwithstanding the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman's explanation, how it is that 
               <br />
               for &amp; portion of that through route the Rail- 
               <br />
               way Commission, under the Railway Act, 
               <br />
               shall have jurisdiction and over the rest of 
               <br />
               the line it shall not have jurisdiction. Of 
               <br />
               course, I quite understand that so far as 
               <br />
               the operation of trains is concerned, there 
               <br />
               might be jurisdiction of the Railway Com— 
               <br />
               mission over one part and not over another 
               <br />
               part, but it is not over trains and over the 
               <br />
               operation of the road alone that the Rail- 
               <br />
               way Commission exercises its jurisdiction. 
               <br />
               It also exercises jurisdiction as to rates 
               <br />
               and as to a great many other matters. What 
               <br />
               I am trying to ascertain from my hon. friend 
               <br />
               is how the Railway Commission is to act

               <br />
               The hon. gentleman will, of course, remem- 
               <br />
               ber that the Railway Commission has not 
               <br />
               only the right to ﬁx a maximum rate, but 
               <br />
               has a right also to ﬁx a minimum rate. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman says that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> government 
               <br />
               will ﬁx the rate. Well, if the government 
               <br />
               ﬁxes the rate the Railway Commission can— 
               <br />
               not. There would be two inconsistent juris- 
               <br />
               dictions. Suppose, for example, the Railway 
               <br />
               Commission Iﬁxes a minimum rate from 
               <br />
               Parry Sound to Halifax or St. John over 
               <br />
               some other route, or from some point on 
               <br />
               the Georgian bay, which may be fairly com- 
               <br />
               pared with Parry Sound, to Halifax or St. 
               <br />
               John. How is the Railway Commission to 
               <br />
               deal with the situation if it has jurisdic- 
               <br />
