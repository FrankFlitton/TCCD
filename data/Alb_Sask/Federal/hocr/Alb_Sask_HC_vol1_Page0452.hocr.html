               reverend gentleman, I think belonging to 
               <br />
               my own church, saying that he hoped the 
               <br />
               day would arrive when one common ground 
               <br />
               of education could be reached, and when 
               <br />
               some form of religion could be taught in 
               <br />
               the schools upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> all could agree. 
               <br />
               Well, Sir, if there was any hope of reaching 
               <br />
               that state of affairs, I would be very glad. 
               <br />
               But we have been nearly a hundred years 
               <br />
               in trying to agree upon that point, and we 
               <br />
               do not seem to be any nearer to it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> 
               <br />
               than we were then. I ﬁnd that in 1854 there 
               <br />
               was a separate school law in the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario ; I ﬁnd that they repealed it and 
               <br />
               in 1863 they put it again on the statute—book, 
               <br />
               and they now have separate schools in the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario. Seeing that neither in 
               <br />
               Quebec nor in Ontario can the present 
               <br />
               system be changed, it seems to me there 
               <br />
               is not much hope of being able to do away 
               <br />
               entirely with the principle of separate 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools.</span> Now, this very point was consider- 
               <br />

               ﬁrmly convinced, after many years of actiVe 
               <br />
               experience, that the teaching of religion can-

               gether. I am a ﬁrm believer in the divine 
               <br />
               injunction: ‘Train up a child in the way

               he should go and when he is old he will not

               the state to see that as much as possible the 
               <br />
               cardinal principles of the Christian religion 
               <br />
               are thoroughly instilled into the youthful 
               <br />
               minds of the nation. I believe that this all-

               important purpose can only be accomplished 
               <br />
               by Protestants of all classes agreeing upon a

               Canada are doing the right thing when they 
               <br />
               insist upon the teaching of their children in 
               <br />
               the religious principles of their church.

               is no religious teaching in our na-

               <br />
               your children as it is for ours ; that is quite 
               <br />
               true, and that view is worthy of some res-

               pect. But, our Roman Catholic friends say: 
               <br />
               We know that what you say is true and we

               know that our children will not be in any

               way interfered with in the common schools. 
               <br />
               But that is not enough ; we want our child— 
               <br />
               ren to receive religious instructions every 
               <br />
               day in the school and we want those in- 
               <br />
               structions to be guided and inspired by the 
               <br />
               teachings of our church and we want the

               <br />
               ly from their standpoint, that commends it- 
               <br />
               self to me, and one which I most cheerfully 
               <br />
               commend to the Protestants of Canada. As

               one who has been for the last twenty years 
               <br />
               in close touch with the public schools of the 
               <br />
               province of Nova Scotia, I take the res- 
               <br />
               ponsibility of telling my Protestant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> 
               <br />
               men that they cannot be too soon in follow- 
               <br />
               ing the example of their Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               brethren in insisting upon religious teaching 
               <br />
               in every school of the land.

               That is the position which I take in respect

               _to religion in the schools. I believe it is 
               <br />
               the proper thing to have it and if we must 
               <br />
               have separate schools in order to have re-
