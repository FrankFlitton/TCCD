               <br />
               this fact that the law of 1875 put in cer-

               tain prescriptions which were binding on 
               <br />
               the legislative powers. These prescriptions 
               <br />
               were that the minority or the majority in 
               <br />
               any school district would have the power 
               <br />
               to establish such a school system as they 
               <br />
               thought ﬁt. Now, Sir, let me call the at— 
               <br />
               tention of the House to this, that no less an 
               <br />
               authority than Sir John Thompson gave his

               no existence in law. Let me again quote

               it to contain, but merely contains the provision 
               <br />
               that the minority may establish a separate 
               <br />
               school in an organized public school district,

               the law in force in the Territories, was 
               <br />
               unconstitutional, was ultra vires, was null.

               He did not recommend the disallowance of 
               <br />
               it, and it was not disallowed ; but if it was 
               <br />
               null at that time, it remains null to this

               day. Therefore what would be the law to-

               day ? If you say that section 93 of the Brit-

               ish North America Act should apply, to 
               <br />
               what would it apply ? To the law as it was

               in the ordinances of 1901, or as it was in 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875 ? This is a serious question, 
               <br />
               and it is a question we ought to settle. We 
               <br />
               do not want it left unsettled to be a bone of 
               <br />

               <br />

               When he is asked what that Act means, he 
               <br />
               says that is for the courts to determine. Is 
               <br />
               that satisfactory? Is that the manner. in

               his amendment, he has introduced purely 
               <br />
               and simply section 93 of the Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1867—</span> 
               <br />
               why he has left out the other provisions of— 
               <br />
               the constitution, as contained in the Act of 
               <br />
               1871, the Act of 1875, and the Act of 1886 ? 
               <br />
               As I understand, the constitution of Can- 
               <br />
               ada is to be found in these four Acts, and 
               <br />
               my hon. friend proposes to introduce into 
               <br />
               this Bill which we are now discussing the 
               <br />
               provisions of the Act of 1867 only. Why 
               <br />
               has he left out the others ? 
               <br />

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I will answer my 
               <br />
               hon. friend. It is very unfortunate for his 
               <br />
               friends that he should have asked that ques- 
               <br />
               tion. In the ﬁrst place, I followed what the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman seems to consider the very 
               <br />
               bad example of the government, who in 
               <br />
               section 16, deal specially with section 93 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If</span> we are 
               <br />
               to deal with section 93 specially in a parti- 
               <br />
               cular section, I want to take it exactly as it 
               <br />
               is, and not with any amendment or altera— 
               <br />
               tion. My hon. friend has made a very 
               <br />
               good point, namely, that we are making no 
               <br />
               reference to the Act of 1867. He has doubt- 
               <br />
               less observed that there is no reference to 
               <br />
               that Act in the preamble. and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my»</span> hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Hamilton has introduced an
