               and they can place it wherever they think

               argument with regard to railway construc-

               at the line of the Canadian Northern and 
               <br />
               where the Grand Trunk Paciﬁc is looking

               for a line, he will ﬁnd that it will open

               just as much country in the south as it will 
               <br />
               in the north. I submit that this capital

               should not be chosen on the ground of ex- 
               <br />

               hon. friend will pretend that there is a 
               <br />

               <br />
               that Calgary is in the centre of a very large

               section of surveyed land, while Edmonton 
               <br />
