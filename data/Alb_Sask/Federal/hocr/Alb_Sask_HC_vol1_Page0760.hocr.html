               Now, .Sir, I have listened with great atten— 
               <br />
               tion to all that has been argued on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this House as to the right of these pro- 
               <br />

               rection of this parliament. But I must 
               <br />
               confess that I cannot see the cogency of the 
               <br />
               reasons which hon. gentlemen opposite have 
               <br />
               brought in support of the policy of 
               <br />
               refusing to grant the administration of 
               <br />
               the lands to the provinces. I cannot 
               <br />
               see in the reasoning. of the hon. mem— 
               <br />
               ber for Brandon the ex—Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior (Mr. Sifton) any suﬁicient ground 
               <br />
               for withholding these lands. I fail to 
               <br />
               see at the outset why, if these provinces 
               <br />
               are ﬁt for self-government, if they are ﬁt 
               <br />
               to assume all the responsibilities which ap- 
               <br />
               pertain to local autonomy they should be de— 
               <br />
               prived of the right to administer their own 
               <br />
               lands, and should also be restricted in the 
               <br />
               beneﬁts which would accrue to them from 
               <br />
               the administration of those lands. It the 
               <br />
               provinces themselves are not the best judges 
               <br />
               of the methods by which the lands might be 
               <br />
               made the most productive and the most 
               <br />
               fertile sources of improvement, then who 
               <br />
               would be ‘? Would this parliament be ? Can 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> this parliament say for all time that it would 
               <br />
               be the best dictator as to what policy should 
               <br />
               be adopted in regard to these lands ? There 
               <br />
               are different policies in regard to different 
               <br />
               kinds of lands in the Northwest. As I 
               <br />
               understand there are farming lands, grazing 
               <br />
               lands and mining lands and a certain small 
               <br />
               area of timber lands. Different policies have 
               <br />
               to be enunciated in regard to the adminis- 
               <br />
               tration of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂerent</span> lands and these 
               <br />
               policies necessarily have to be changed as 
               <br />
               time goes on, and as these provinces ﬁll up 
               <br />
               as they will in the proportion in which they 
               <br />
               have ﬁlled up recently. Where, I ask, would 
               <br />
               these policies by which these lands are to 
               <br />
               be administered best be worked out with the 
               <br />
               autonomy that is to be granted by this Bill 
               <br />
               and when these Territories have become 
               <br />
               part ot‘ confederation ? At Ottawa, the

               <br />
               distance is concerned, and who are certainly 
               <br />
               not as directly in touch with the needs and 
               <br />
               necessities of the district in which those

               tical parasite in withholding these lands 
               <br />
               in the Northwest provinces. There will 
               <br />
               be an opportunity of using these lands 
               <br />
               for political purposes and of placing the 
               <br />
               heritage of the Northwest provinces at the 
               <br />
               disposal of the political birds of prey in 
               <br />
               power at Ottawa. That is a factor to be 
               <br />
               considered. We are human and we know 
               <br />
               that political expedients are resorted to in 
               <br />
               connection with the administration of these 
               <br />
               lands. I therefore say that it would be an 
               <br />
               unwise policy to put it in the power of the 
               <br />
               government at Ottawa for all time to per- 
               <br />
               mit, whether knowingly or unknowingly, 
               <br />
               their political friends of whatever complex- 
               <br />
               ion to use for political purposes the lands 
               <br />
               which properly belong to the Northwest 
               <br />
               provinces. There is also the danger that 
               <br />
               these lands may be used to create trouble, 
               <br />
               dissention and dissatisfaction among the 
               <br />
               people of these Northwest provinces. There 
               <br />
               are instances in which complaints have been 
               <br />
               made that the ordinary settler, the man who 
               <br />
               is the pioneer in that country, the man who 
               <br />
               bears the burden of civilization, has been 
               <br />
               obliged to pay more for the land which he 
               <br />
               has obtained than some more favoured in- 
               <br />
               dividual who has not been subjected to the 
               <br />
               hardships of the settler’s life. There are 
               <br />
               instances where political inﬂuences could be 
               <br />
               used to the deprivation of the colonist who 
               <br />
               should, of the most vital necessity, be en- 
               <br />
               couraged. There is then the question to 
               <br />
               consider as to who should have the adminis- 
               <br />
               tration of these lands. I have seen it 
               <br />
               stated, and it cannot be denied as a pro- 
               <br />
               position that because the lands in these 
               <br />
               newly formed provinces are administered 
               <br />
               from Ottawa, or administered by a govern- 
               <br />
               ment which is not responsible directly to the 
               <br />
               people, they may suffer from their malad— 
               <br />
               ministration.- What consequences, may I
