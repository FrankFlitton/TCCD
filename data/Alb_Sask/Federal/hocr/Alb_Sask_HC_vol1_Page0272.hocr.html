               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is:</span> this: What potent and soporiﬁc drug

               <br />
               phrased clause concealed within its innocent 
               <br />
               outside the foundation and formation of an 
               <br />
               irrevocable constitutionally ear-marked sect-

               been none greater in the history of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               only one of two alternatives: Either he 
               <br />
               did not know what was in that clause, and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequently</span> he is unworthy of his posi-

               tion; or he did know it, and he assented 
               <br />
               to it ; and if it had not been for the super- 
               <br />
               ior nerve of the Minister of the Interior, 
               <br />
               this country would have been no wiser to 
               <br />
               this day, that clause might have gone 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">though,</span> and the Postmaster General would 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">haxe</span> had to fat1'he1 the responsibility of it.

               \‘ow has the Postmaster General any ex-

               <br />
               Did he assent to what the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">err—Minister</span> of

               <br />
               lash. but he assented to it. What excuse 
               <br />
               has he, with his forme1 recmd staring him 
               <br />

               ment as that for sectarian purposes in the

               great Northwest ? That is a question which 
               <br />
               the Postmaster General must answer. The 
               <br />

               ﬁrst, is in pursuance of an hypothesis that 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister had determined to put 
               <br />
               this thing through, cost What it might, and 
               <br />
               these are the methods he has taken to put 
               <br />
               it through—the autocratic methods. What 
               <br />
               is the inducement that brought 'back the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior and joined him 
               <br />
               again to his colleagues, his leader and his 
               <br />
               party, in the advocacy—110, not in the advo- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cacy,</span> but in the voting support of this 
               <br />
               measure that is now before the House? 
               <br />
               What was the inducement—because there 
               <br />
               were strong inducements 0n the other side. 
               <br />
               Un the other side Were his principles, on 
               <br />
               the other side was his record from the old 
               <br />
               Manitoba times up to the present; on the 
               <br />
               other side was his reputation before the 
               <br />
               country as an adherent of principle. What 
               <br />
               was on this side in order to induce 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior to come back 
               <br />
               and put himself en rapport with his 
               <br />
               leader and his party on a question and
