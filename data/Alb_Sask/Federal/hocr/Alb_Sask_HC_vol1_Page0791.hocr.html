               might act as we should see ﬁt, on the 
               <br />
               merits, but the fact that this parlia-

               ment has for thirty years permitted separate 
               <br />

               <br />
               —-it may be only a moral obligation, but cer- 
               <br />
               tainly it imposes a limitation—on this par— 
               <br />
               liament, and according to my way of think- 
               <br />
               ing makes it imperative upon this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment to permit the minority to continue to 
               <br />
               be safeguarded in the rights they presently 
               <br />
               enjoy. I feel that it is of the highest im- 
               <br />
               portance that this parliament should keep 
               <br />
               faith with itself. I feel that, not only the 
               <br />
               minority in the west, but throughout this 
               <br />
               Whole land, considers that this parliament 
               <br />
               has gone on record in favour of a limited 
               <br />
               separate school system in the west; I feel 
               <br />
               that if any portion of our community con- 
               <br />
               ceives the idea that parliament can or will 
               <br />
               break faith with them, that breaking of faith 
               <br />
               Will be a shock to such and to the whole 
               <br />
               country that will be a serious injury to all. 
               <br />
               Although this parliament may ﬁnd itself in 
               <br />
               the position of him ‘who sweareth to his 
               <br />
               hurt and chan-geth not,’ still it seems to me 
               <br />
               that if this is good doctrine for the indivi— 
               <br />
               dual it is the same for the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada. I know that there is a strong feel- 
               <br />
               ing of western pride that resents the im- 
               <br />
               position of the slightest limitation on the 
               <br />
               powers of the new provinces. This is what 
               <br />
               would be expected of those who breathe the 
               <br />
               free air of the western plains. But let it 
               <br />
               not be forgotten that these new provinces 
               <br />
               when they come into our sisterhood of pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, where they will enjoy the advantages 
               <br />
               of confederation, also assume their full 
               <br />
               share of responsibilities, and must also be 
               <br />
               expected to bear their share of the burden, 
               <br />
               sacriﬁcing for the common weal some of 
               <br />
               their privileges. So in this particular case, 
               <br />
               while we are prepared to grant them the 
               <br />
               fullest autonomy, we must still ask them to 
               <br />
               protect, to a certain extent, the engagements 
               <br />
               and obligations which this parliament in the 
               <br />
               last thirty years has incurred. A short time 
               <br />
               ago the legislature of British Columbia pass- 
               <br />
               ed legislation discriminating <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,against</span> the 
               <br />
               Japanese coming into their country and 
               <br />
               against those already there. This legisla- 
               <br />
               tion was promptly disallowed by the im- 
               <br />
               perial parliament. Why? Because the im— 
               <br />
               perial parliament was on friendly terms 
               <br />
               with Japan, because the two nations were 
               <br />
               in close alliance, and because any act of 
               <br />
               this kind would tend to weaken the bond of 
               <br />
               unity between them. We have a somewhat 
               <br />
               similar case here. British Columbia may re— 
               <br />
               pass that legislation, but ultimately British 
               <br />
               Columbia must consent to restrict her own 
               <br />
               liberties to that extent because she is a 
               <br />
               part of the Canadian federation, because 
               <br />
               she is a part of the British empire. And 
               <br />
               so these new provinces may be called upon 
               <br />
               -—and I think would cheerfully respond—to 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce a certain modicum of the liberties 
               <br />
               which they would otherwise enjoy, in order 
               <br />

               tative of the Protestant minority in Quebec. 
               <br />
               Most of what I had intended to say was 
               <br />
               stated by the Minister of Agriculture <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr“</span> 
               <br />

               be necessary for me to make my remarks

               very lengthy. It is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary</span> for me to 
               <br />
               remind this House of the way in which 
               <br />
               the legislation of 1869 came to be passed, 
               <br />
               how it was enacted in the fulﬁlment of the 
               <br />
               of the agreement which Cartier had made 
               <br />
               prior to confederation, and how that law of 
               <br />
               1869 established fully and completely as 
               <br />
               satisfactory a system as the minority in 
               <br />
               Quebec could ask, a system that has been 
               <br />
               practically unchanged down to the present 
               <br />
               day. In fact, Mr. Speaker, we in Quebec, 
               <br />
               in many ways have been given more than 
               <br />
               was in the bond of the Act of 1869 and its 
               <br />
               subsequent amendments. We have the 
               <br />
               Council of Public Instruction, of which I 
               <br />
               have spoken, two-thirds of whom are Catho— 
               <br />
               lics and one-third Protestants. At the time 
               <br />
               the law was passed the Protestant minority 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec constituted one— 
               <br />
               sixth only of the population, to—day they 
               <br />
               constitute 13-3 per cent or one—eighth, and yet 
               <br />
               their representation on the educational coun- 
               <br />
               cil is the samee as it was 35 years ago, and 
               <br />
               there is not the slightest expectation that 
               <br />
               that representation will be reduce]. In the 
               <br />
               matter of the amount voted annually by the 
               <br />
               provincial government for schools we again 
               <br />
               have generous treatment. The money which 
               <br />
               is received for superior and for elementary 
               <br />
               education is divided according to population 
               <br />
               in absolute strictness on the basis of popula- 
               <br />
               tion as shown by the last census. But, 
               <br />
               when we come to the normal school grant 
               <br />
               of $42,000 per annum, we ﬁnd that the Pro- 
               <br />
               testants are getting one—third and the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics two-thirds. Yet, this is in direct 
               <br />
               contravention of the law of 1869 and the set- 
               <br />
