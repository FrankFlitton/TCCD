               have plenary power to do what we like, 
               <br />
               that we should not shoot from behind 
               <br />
               hedges, that we should be prepared to say

               enough to say that, I do not think you are

               <br />
               is a sham, and I think the result will be 
               <br />
               that if the courts have to decide that they 
               <br />

               <br />

               view, I must admit, is not very clear to my 
               <br />
               mind. He started out upon a discussion 
               <br />
               which I imagined would lead. him some- 
               <br />
               where, but he, like some hunters, came out 
               <br />
               just where he went in. I will do no discour- 
               <br />
               tesy to my hon. friend if I decline to accept 
               <br />
               the invitation to discuss with him or with 
               <br />
               the House the particular legal propositions 
               <br />
               which he enunciated. I did venture to 
               <br />
               call his attention to the fact that he was 
               <br />
               not giving a fair version or interpretation 
               <br />
               of the very able argument presented by 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               (Mr. R. L. Borden), but notwithstanding that 
               <br />
               he still followed in the error of his ways 
               <br />
               and persisted to the end in giving his own 
               <br />
               interpretation of it. Well, Sir, if his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inter-</span> 
               <br />
               pretation of the law is not more reliable 
               <br />
               than his interpretation of the speech of my 
               <br />
               hou. friend the leader of the opposition, I 
               <br />
               am afraid it is not such an interpretation 
               <br />
               as wise men would care to follow. I did 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notice</span> that there was method—I will not 
               <br />
               say in his madness—but method in his 
               <br />
               argument to a certain extent and that was 
               <br />
               that he should tell us once again—and I 
               <br />
               hope this once again will be for the last time 
               <br />
               -—the history of the McCa‘rthy family. May 
               <br />
               1 remind my hon. friend, and so as to do no 
               <br />
               injustice I except the vigorous living branch 
               <br />
               of the family of that gentleman who sits on
