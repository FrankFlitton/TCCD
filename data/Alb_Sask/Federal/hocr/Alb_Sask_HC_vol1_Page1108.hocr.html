               <br />

               the recognition of these diversities is the

               tlement as applied to the provinces at that

               <br />
               to—day to the new provinces. I have 
               <br />
               not the slightest doubt that it was the 
               <br />
               intention of the framers of the consti- 
               <br />
               tution that when these Territories should 
               <br />
               enter the confederation, the educational 
               <br />
               rights of the minorities should be protected 
               <br />
               just as the educational rights of the mi- 
               <br />
               norities in the other provinces were pro- 
               <br />
               tected by section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act; and any attempt to disturb 
               <br />
               this policy which has been lived up to 
               <br />
               in the past would, I believe, he disas- 
               <br />
               trous to the country. This is the only way 
               <br />
               in which we can secure national content- 
               <br />
               ment and national unity. Canada to—day 
               <br />
               is making such progress as to satisfy 
               <br />
               the aspirations -of the most ambitious 
               <br />
               of us; and, as an hon. gentleman said the 
               <br />
               other day, we are simply at the morning 
               <br />
               star, at the cock-crowing, of our national 
               <br />
               existence, but any interference with those 
               <br />
               rights which have been established, and 
               <br />
               which are so dear to certain classes of our 
               <br />
               population would, I fear, seriously injure 
               <br />
               the country. To maintain our present posi-

               tion and develop further with the years 
               <br />
               to come internal calm is necessary. It 
               <br />
               would take little to disturb the unity of 
               <br />
               the Canadian spirit, and perhaps threaten 
               <br />
               the compact of confederation. It is our 
               <br />
               duty to face our conditions and build up 
               <br />
               our growing country on lines that will 
               <br />
               meet our conditions. It is due to our

               national integrity that we religiously ad-

               Mr. Speaker, since the commencement of

               the debate on _the Bill which the right hon. 
               <br />
               the First Munster has brought before the 
               <br />
               House, I have listened to the speeches de- 
               <br />
               livered on both sides, and have endeavoured 
               <br />
               to form an independent and unbiased opin- 
               <br />
               ion that would guide me in registering my 
               <br />
               vote when the time came for a division on 
               <br />
               this important question. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Notwithstanding the fact that the Bill 
               <br />
               contains many clauses relating to the distri- 
               <br />
               bution of lands, public moneys and educa- - 
               <br />
               tional matters, only one clause seems to 
               <br />
               have occupied the time of the House to 
               <br />
               any extent, and that is the educational clause. 
               <br />
               Whether due to a religious zeal or for other 
               <br />
               reasons. all other questions seem to pale 
               <br />
               before this one, and to such an extent that 
               <br />
               the man on the street speaks not of the 
               <br />
               Autonomy Bill but of the Separate School 
               <br />
               Bill. So many and so varied are the argu- 
               <br />
               ments brought forward by hon. members 
               <br />
               on either side of the House and so diamet- 
               <br />
               rically opposed are the views expressed 
               <br />
               that a layman, of non-legal mind and at- 
               <br />
               tainments might well pause and wonder 
               <br />
               where we are at. For that reason, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, I think it would have been wiser 
               <br />
               and more in the interest of peace and har- 
               <br />
               mony if the government had submitted this 
               <br />
