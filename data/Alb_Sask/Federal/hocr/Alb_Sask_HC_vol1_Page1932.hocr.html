               I agree with what has been said by my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from South Grey (Mr. Miller) 
               <br />
               as to the value which we ought to attach to 
               <br />
               the French language in this country and the 
               <br />
               respect which we should pay to it. I have 
               <br />
               endeavoured, not so much by precept, but 
               <br />
               a little by example to manifest my belief 
               <br />
               in the principles which my hon. friend has 
               <br />
               voiced to-night and I am free to say to- 
               <br />
               night, as I have said on other occasions. 
               <br />
               that I think that perhaps it would be much 
               <br />
               more to the credit of the English speaking 
               <br />
               people of this country if they would teach 
               <br />
               their children the French language which 
               <br />
               is the mother tongue of more than 2,000,000. 
               <br />
               An hon. gentleman on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House referred the other evening to the cir- 
               <br />
               cumstance that every educated Englishman 
               <br />
               who comes to this country is able to speak 
               <br />
               to our French Canadian friends in their own 
               <br />
               language, and that very circumstance which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I.</span> have noticed over and over again 
               <br />
               has made me a little ashamed more than 
               <br />
               once because I have not been able to do this 
               <br />
               to my own satisfaction, or to the same ex- 
               <br />
               tent. However, that is to a certain extent 
               <br />
               beside the question. We are dealing with 
               <br />
               the question of the enactment of a statute. 
               <br />
               I again repeat that the attitude which the 
               <br />
               government has taken in this connection to- 
               <br />
               night is a very ample justiﬁcation for those 
               <br />
               of us who have taken a certain attitude in 
               <br />
               the past, and that the very strong criticism 
               <br />
               which has been used in regard to myself in

               contention yet. After four months I do not

               want to continue the discussion and with 
               <br />
               this remark I close that part of the debate.

               <br />
               hon. friend in regard to the courts of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. I stated that in my 
               <br />
               judgment the reason why the use of the 
               <br />
               French language was continued in the courts 
               <br />
               in 1880 when the matter came before the 
               <br />
               House was that the courts in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories were not provincial courts but 
               <br />
               were directly under the jurisdiction of this 
               <br />
               parliament. I understand my hon. friend 
               <br />
               to controvert this point. I have no better
