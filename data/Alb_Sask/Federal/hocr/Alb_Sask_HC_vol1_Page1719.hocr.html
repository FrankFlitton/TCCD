               <br />
               guided in the redistribution _of 1903 one of 
               <br />
               which was adherence to municipal bound-

               it would be a departure from that principle,

               <br />
               we shall cut a line through the centre of a

               town. Is the community of interest there

               there is nothing unfair in 'this at all and that

               it is perfectly acceptable. No doubt it is

               satisfactory to their friends who live in the.

               accepted by this parliament as a fair distri—

               <br />
               one the Minister of the Interior who resides

               in Edmonton, the prospective capital, and the 
               <br />
               other who resides adjacent to that prospec— 
               <br />
               tive capital, the hon. member for Strathcona 
               <br />
               (Mr. Peter Talbot). The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Strathcona has not been here very long and 
               <br />
               we have not had an opportunity of gauging 
               <br />
               his fairness, but his conduct during the last 
               <br />
               day or two in the House in connection with 
               <br />
               these schedules would lead us to form the 
               <br />
               opinion that he is a very apt pupil of the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior. We know how 
               <br />
               much dependence to place upon the indepen- 
               <br />
               dence of the Minister of the Interior. It is 
               <br />
               true that he came into this parliament as a 
               <br />
               so-called independent. He mighty soon lost 
               <br />
               that as was evidenced by his occupying a 
               <br />
               seat by accident and temporarily in the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment in order to do which he had to 
               <br />
               swallow his independent convictions. He 
               <br />
               has produced in this parliament a schedule 
               <br />
               that he wishes the members of the opposition 
               <br />
               to take as fair and just to his political oppon- 
               <br />
               ent. Well, if the hon. gentleman were as 
               <br />
               sure of its fairness to the south as well as to 
               <br />
               the north as he pretends to be, What reason 
               <br />
               would he have for objecting to have it trans- 
               <br />
               ferred for adjudication by a commission 
               <br />
               composed of impartial men ? If they would 
               <br />
               do justice, whatever the decision they might 
               <br />
               come to I am sure that the people in the 
               <br />
               north and the south would heartily coincide 
               <br />
               in adOpting their decision. I think we have 
               <br />
               the best evidence that in his own heart of 
               <br />
               hearts the hon. gentleman does not believe 
               <br />
               that he is doing justice to the south and that 
               <br />
               he desires to force this measure through par- 
               <br />
               liament by the aid of a subservient majority.
