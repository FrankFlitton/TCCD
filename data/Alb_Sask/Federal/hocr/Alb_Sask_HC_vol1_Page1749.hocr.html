               Mr. LAKE. I purpose moving an amend- 
               <br />
               ment having in "view the carrying out of 
               <br />
               the principles of confederation in regard 
               <br />
               to the provincial ownership of Crown lands. 
               <br />
               A good deal of discussion has already taken 
               <br />
               place on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> matter, and I do not consider 
               <br />
               it necessary to say very much more now. 
               <br />
               The British North America Act is very ex— 
               <br />
               plicit and precise in regard to the distribu— 
               <br />
               tion of legislative authority as between the 
               <br />
               Dominion and the provinces. There are 
               <br />
               certain rights and powers assigned to the 
               <br />
               provinces. An organized territory without 
               <br />
               full provincial powers is in my opinion a ter- 
               <br />
               ritory still, and not ,a province in the full 
               <br />
               meaning of the word. If the word ‘pro- 
               <br />
               vince’ is to be retained in these ‘Bills the 
               <br />
               ordinary rights and powers of a province 
               <br />
               ought to be given to these new organiza- 
               <br />
               tions It seems to me that comparatively 
               <br />
               little change is being made in the status of 
               <br />
               these two territories, and that the two so- 
               <br />
               called provinces will be provinces merely 
               <br />
               in name and not in actual fact. That be- 
               <br />
               ing so they should have some distinctive 
               <br />
               name applied to them to distinguish <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> 
               <br />
               status from the status of the older provin- 
               <br />
               ces. I have protested on a former occa- 
               <br />
               sion against depriving these new districts of 
               <br />
               the ordinary rights and powers enjoyed by 
               <br />
               the older provinces of the Dominion. I 
               <br />
               have said that the designs of confederation 
               <br />
               cannot be said to have been successfully ac- 
               <br />
               complished when there are two grades of 
               <br />
               provinces existing in the Dominion: upper 
               <br />
               and lower grade provinces. A confeder— 
               <br />
               ation in which a citizen has greater rights 
               <br />
               in one province than in another cannot be 
               <br />
               enduring. I contend that when a Canadian 
               <br />
               goes from the province of Quebec or of On- 
               <br />
               tario to reside in Alberta he should not be 
               <br />
               deprived of any of the rights of his citizen- 
               <br />
               ship. One of the essential attributes of a 
               <br />
               province is the possession of its public 
               <br />
               lands. It has been the fashion during the 
               <br />
               debate on this Bill to criticise the fathers 
               <br />
               of confederation ; I do not join in that criti- 
               <br />
               cism. I consider that the principle of the 
               <br />
               possession by the provinces of the public 
               <br />
               lands within their limits, was one of the 
               <br />
               wisest provisions adopted by the fathers of

               <br />
               ing this same principle used an expression 
               <br />
               which I thought a very apt one. He spoke

               <br />
               strange manner he appears lately to have 
               <br />
               changed his opinion on that subject. The

               <br />
               authorities as those who have to open up

               Saskatchewan than has been meted out to 
               <br />
               the older provinces. The management of

               the land by the local government would be 
               <br />

               faction and contentment to the settlers—al- 
               <br />
               ways a most important factor in inducing 
               <br />
               immigration. I have on &amp; previous occa- 
               <br />
               sion pointed out the utterly inadequate com- 
               <br />
               pensation being made for the loss .of the 
               <br />
               public domain. Other provinces Will be

               <br />
               their resources by the judicious administra— 
               <br />
               tion of their public domain when Alberta 
               <br />
               and Saskatchewan are having to resort to 
               <br />
               direct taxation for the ordinary purposes of 
               <br />
               local government. One excuse that has 
               <br />
               been urged is the difference of the position 
               <br />
               of the original provinces in regard to their 
               <br />
               lands at confederation and the two territo—
