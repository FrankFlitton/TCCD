               Mr. FIELDING. I understood my hon. 
               <br />
               friend to ask if there was any correspon- 
               <br />
               dence from the Northwest government in 
               <br />
               regard to suggesting any other methods than 
               <br />
               this, and it was to that question I replied 
               <br />
               there was no correspondence. The govern— 
               <br />
               ment of the Northwest, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in‘the</span> Haultain Bill, 
               <br />
               has suggested precisely the same method of 
               <br />
               dealing with this matter as that which we 
               <br />
               have adopted. I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understand</span> that the 
               <br />
               principle of this matter has been a failure. 
               <br />
               What is the principle ? That the provinces 
               <br />
               shall receive some portion of the revenues 
               <br />
               which the people pay to the Dominion gov— 
               <br />
               ernment. I do not think that principle has 
               <br />
               been a failure, and there is not a province 
               <br />
               în the Dominion today that would be will- 
               <br />
               ing to abandon it. The working out of .the 
               <br />
               details has not always been satisfactory 
               <br />
               and the amount not always suﬂicient, but 
               <br />
               the principle that the government at Otta- 
               <br />
               wa shall pay a subsidy to the provinces is a 
               <br />
               principle that has not been a failure. No 
               <br />
               province will admit that it is a failure. 
               <br />
               though they will all be glad to have a larger 
               <br />
               subsidy.

               bound now in dealing with the Northwest 
               <br />
               as we were bound in dealing with the prg— 
               <br />
               vinces which had the power to enter into a 
               <br />
               contract and to bargain, I admit my hon. 
               <br />
               friend’s argument, that if we followed the 
               <br />
               principle to its logical conclusion we would 
               <br />
               not give the Northwest anything. We would 
               <br />
               say: You are not in a position to bargain, 
               <br />
               and we will give you nothing. That would 
               <br />
               be manifestly unfair, and I .am sure my hon. 
               <br />
               friend would not pretend to take that view. 
               <br />
               Inasmuch as that principle has been adopt— 
               <br />
               ed, and inasmuch as we give back a portion

               Mr. HENDERSON. I am glad to hear

               the hon. gentleman say so, but his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">words</span> 
               <br />
               will be read. Permit me to say that I would 
               <br />
               favour 110 plan that would not deal reason- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ably.</span> generously with the people of the west, 
               <br />
               for the reason that if we did not do so we 
               <br />
               would be immediately called upon to do 
               <br />
               something more, and there would be a con- 
               <br />
               tinuous agitation. I am inclined to believe 
               <br />
               that we will require to be more than gener- 
               <br />
               ous at the start if we are to have peace 
               <br />
               and contentment in that western country, 
               <br />
               because the people who live there are a 
               <br />
               people who will stand up for their own 
               <br />
               rights. Therefore, I wish it to be under- 
               <br />
               stood that I am not going to be parsimoni- 
               <br />
               ous; I do not propose anything of that 
               <br />
               kind, but I simply reiterate what I said be- 
               <br />
               fore, that I think some new plan might now 
               <br />
               be suggested by which we could adopt con- 
               <br />
               ditions which would throw the responsibility 
               <br />
               on the people of these new provinces of con- 
               <br />
               serving what they do get, would make it 
               <br />
               more to their interest to protect and con- 
               <br />
               serve their revenues, and to economize with 
               <br />
               the moneys which come into their hands 
               <br />
               for the purpose of carrying on the govern- 
               <br />
               ment. It might be said that would perhaps 
               <br />
               he a sort of parental care, that we are a 
               <br />
               little too anxious. I think in the adminis- 
               <br />
               tration of the older provinces we have had 
               <br />
               some examples of lack of care to conserve 
               <br />
               the assets and revenues of the people. You 
               <br />
               may take, as an example, the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec ; I am afraid that in past years the 
               <br />
               people of Quebec received a severe lesson. 
               <br />
               There certainly was a time when they over- 
               <br />
               rode all principles in their expenditure, when 
               <br />
               they were reckless and seemed to throw 
               <br />
               money right and left, until they accumulat- 
               <br />
               ed a very large debt indeed, which is an 
               <br />
               undesirable thing :for a province having a 
               <br />
               ﬁxed revenue. A debt is a less serious mat-
