               the days of our grandparents ? We are liv-

               ing in a very rapid age, and I am afraid 
               <br />
               there is some room for the contention of 
               <br />
               our Roman Catholic brethren that religion 
               <br />
               will not be taught to the children of Canada 
               <br />
               unless the foundation of it is given to them 
               <br />
               in the schools. We who form the Protest- 
               <br />
               ant majority may not be able to agree with 
               <br />
               them on that point, but it is not because 
               <br />
               we object to religious instruction; most of 
               <br />
               us I‘think, would be pleased that our child-

               ious instruction in the schools ; but the trou- 
               <br />
               ble is that you cannot unite the people of 
               <br />
               any community in an agreement as to what 
               <br />
               is religion. Religion to many is creed and 
               <br />
               dogma and there Will be differences of creed 
               <br />
               and dogma, and inasmuch as it is not pos- 
               <br />
               sible to bring the people of a community to

               <br />
