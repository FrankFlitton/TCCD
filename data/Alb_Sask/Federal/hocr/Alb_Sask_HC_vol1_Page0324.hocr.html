               and they did not do justice to the minority. 
               <br />
               Well, Sir, if the Conservatives did wrong: 
               <br />
               they have had their day of reckoning, and if 
               <br />
               the Conservatives did wrong that is no- 
               <br />
               reason why a Liberal government in power- 
               <br />
               should perpetuate injustice. I have read the 
               <br />
               reasons which were given for not disallow- 
               <br />
               ing the ordinance of 1892, and I would hes1- 
               <br />
               tate long before I would come to the belief 
               <br />
               that Sir John Thompson would sacriﬁce the 
               <br />
               Catholic minority of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. I believe he would have come to 
               <br />
               their relief unless good and strong reasons 
               <br />
               prevented him. Sir John Thompson was 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice at the time, and I take 
               <br />
               it. for granted that he studied the case care- 
               <br />
               fully, and I believe if he had been able to 
               <br />
               disallow the Act of 1892, or if its disallow— 
               <br />
               ance would have been of any avail to the 
               <br />
               minority, Sir John Thompson would have 
               <br />
               disallowed it. But the ordinance of 1891 
               <br />
               remaining in force, and it being too late 
               <br />
               to disallow it, no good would be accomplish- 
               <br />
               ed by disallowing the ordinance of 1892. 
               <br />
               What is the use of splitting hairs on a ques- 
               <br />
               tion of this kind ‘? I want to take a large 
               <br />
               view of it ; I want to see what has happen- 
               <br />
               ed ; I want to know where we ﬁnd ourselves 
               <br />
               to-day and to what cause our grievance may 
               <br />
               be attributed. There is no doubt that since 
               <br />
               1892 there are no separate schools in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. Whether that be 
               <br />
               the fault of the Liberals or the fault of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lonservatives</span> does not amount to anything 
               <br />
               in the present discussion ;. that will have to- 
               <br />
               be settled before the electorate. Our duty 
               <br />
               here is to make laws and just laws. Per- 
               <br />
               haps it is, that because the Conservative 
               <br />
               government may have been guilty of neglect 
               <br />
               of duty in this particular, that when the 
               <br />
               present Bill was introduced into the House- 
               <br />
               of Commons it contained the original clause 
               <br />
               16, which was an intimation to me that at 
               <br />
               least this government was doing its duty— 
               <br />
               it did not do it long though. Let us refer 
               <br />
               for a moment to the ordinance of 1891. The 
               <br />
               rights and privileges of the minority in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               abruptly; there was a gradual encroach-
