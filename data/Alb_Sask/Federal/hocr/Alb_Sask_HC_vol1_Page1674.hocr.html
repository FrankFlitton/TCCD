               babiy in the Dominion. For the last ﬁve 
               <br />
               or six years, we have raised the best crops 
               <br />
               grown anywhere in the country, either 
               <br />
               wheat, oats, barley or potatoes or in fact 
               <br />
               vegetables of almost any kind. So that 
               <br />
               I do not see any reason why our southern 
               <br />
               country should not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considered</span> a ﬁrst- 
               <br />
               class country, likely to go ahead in the fut- 
               <br />
               ure even more rapidly than any part of 
               <br />
               the northern country referred to. As re- 
               <br />
               gards schools, it is well known that‘ in a 
               <br />
               stock country, the stock men evade the 
               <br />
               school tax in every way possible. That 
               <br />
               is easily understood by any one who under- 
               <br />
               stands the conditions under which these men 
               <br />
               live. There would be a large area covered by 
               <br />
               one of the stockmen, and the odd settlers 
               <br />
               who would go in there would naturally try 
               <br />
               to establish a school district. Eight children 
               <br />
               are suﬂicient to form a school district, but 
               <br />
               the stockmen wouldhave to pay the bulk 
               <br />
               of the taxes and naturally would oppose the 
               <br />
               establishment of schools, and therefore they 
               <br />
               did their best to keep out small farmers 
               <br />
               who would settle on 160 acres each. They 
               <br />
               discouraged the schools and dr0ve the small 
               <br />
               settlers into the town where their children 
               <br />
               could get schooling. That is one reason 
               <br />
               why there are not so many schools in the 
               <br />
               southern country as in the north. The local 
               <br />
               improvement districts are practically in the 
               <br />
               same position. A lot of farmers living to- 
               <br />
               gether would rather turn out and do their 
               <br />
               own work with their own teams in their 
               <br />
               spare time in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thevmonth</span> of June, than con- 
               <br />
               tribute $2.50 to the general treasury. 
               <br />
               Whereas on the other hand the stockmen. 
               <br />
               who do not use teams very much, 
               <br />
               would naturally prefer to contribute to the 
               <br />
               general assembly at Regina. and every one 
               <br />
               in the Northwest has the option <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> either 
               <br />
               paying to the local improvement dis— 
               <br />
               trict at Regina or forming a local district. 
               <br />
               I think eight men, or about that number. 
               <br />
               can form a local district and do their own 
               <br />
               work if they see ﬁt to do so. You can see 
               <br />
               from what I have said that the local improve- 
               <br />
               ment districts are not a very good ground 
               <br />
               for saying that there is more population in 
               <br />
               the north than in the south; neither do the 
               <br />
               post ofﬁces form a good index of population. 
               <br />
               The Minister of the Interior represented our 
               <br />
               district for the last eight years and I think 
               <br />
               he was more kind to the people of the north 
               <br />
               than to the south and for that reason there 
               <br />
               are more post offices in the north than in the 
               <br />
               south, although there is not so large a popula- 
               <br />
               tion. Many of our people have to go from 
               <br />
               ten to twenty miles for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> mail. I have 
               <br />
               been asking this session for post ofﬁces in 
               <br />
               districts where there are a dozen families 
               <br />
               in a settlement who have to travel seven or 
               <br />
               eight miles for their mail, but my applica- 
               <br />
               tions have been refused with the statement 
               <br />
               that it was impossible to establish post 
               <br />
               offices for that number of people. That I 
               <br />
               say is a good reason why post ofﬁces are not 
               <br />
               a good guide in which to estimateabasis of 
               <br />
               representation. The minister said it was

               <br />
               reason why the northern people should not 
               <br />

               <br />
               west Territories assembly should have been 
               <br />
               called together and have the feeling, of the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest put on record with 
               <br />
               reference to these new constituencies. The 
               <br />
               reasons for. not calling that legislature have 
               <br />
               been made clear to this House. There were 
               <br />
               seven vacant seats in the assembly, and the 
               <br />
               assembly held its annual session a year ago. 
               <br />
               The Northwest assembly received money 
               <br />
               from here as a sort of gift annually in the 
               <br />
               form of estimates, each item assigned to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> 
               <br />
               special service. I suppose the estimate of 
               <br />
               last year was taken in the usual form and 
               <br />
               was used by the ordinary session last year. 
               <br />
               As soon as the session was over these men 
               <br />
               resigned. In the ﬁrst place there was no 
               <br />
               money to hold the by—elections and I do not 
               <br />
               suppose there was anything provided where- 
               <br />
               with to hold a session of parliament. That I 
               <br />
               think 'is a good reason why the assembly was 
               <br />
               not called. Then it was well known or an- 
               <br />
               ticipated from the time parliament met and 
               <br />
               the Bill was introduced that the powers of 
               <br />

               <br />
               eventually get justice in that country, 
               <br />
               and‘ I have no doubt he was ﬁghting 
               <br />
               and living in hope that we would get 
               <br />
               the same justice in the south. I was sur- 
               <br />
               prised to hear the hon. member for 
               <br />

               opponent was in favour of this distribution 
               <br />
               of the seats. The Board of Trade of Leth- 
               <br />
               bridge has condemned it in the strongest 
               <br />
               terms possible, and I believe they have sent 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protest</span> to the First Minister. More than 
               <br />

               the nomination strictly.on condition that he
