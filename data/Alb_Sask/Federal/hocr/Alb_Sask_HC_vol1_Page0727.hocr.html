               i Instances will readily suggest themselves to 
               <br />
               the minds of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion,</span> members. Let us take 
               <br />
               the instance of confederation itself. Every 
               <br />
               Canadian is well aware that from the time 
               <br />
               the project of uniting together the scattered 
               <br />
               provinces of Canada came within the scope 
               <br />
               of politics there ensued a long period of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">most‘anxious</span> consultation and the fullest 
               <br />
               exchange of conﬁdences, not only among the 
               <br />
               provinces as between themselves and their 
               <br />
               public men, but also between the provinces 
               <br />
               on the one hand and the imperial authori- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ties</span> on the other. I think that no whisper 
               <br />
               of suspicion has ever been heard that any 
               <br />
               of the provinces which intended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[to</span> cast in 
               <br />
               their lot in the projected scheme of con— 
               <br />
               federation, or that the views of any public 
               <br />
               man whose position .in any suchprovince eu- 
               <br />
               titled him to be heard, were or was in the 
               <br />
               least degree slighted, or that any person was 
               <br />
               denied the hearing which he might properly 
               <br />
               have claimed. I think the same may be said 
               <br />
               in regard to the subsequent admission of the 
               <br />
               provinces of Manitoba, Prince Edward 
               <br />

               <br />
               of Australia. We all know that the various 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{states</span> now forming the confederacy under

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ï,</span> and that no statesman in those states whose

               But. Sir, it has remained for this so—called

               <br />

               <br />
               the present instance. and to deny consulta- 
               <br />

               <br />
               in their lot with Canada. In this case there 
               <br />
               has been practically no consultation with 
               <br />
               the Territories. Beyond question, neither 
               <br />
