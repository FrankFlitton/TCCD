               children meet together and that there are 
               <br />

               <br />
               That is their view. It may be Wrong or it 
               <br />
               may be right. Then they say that by that

               system we avoid the divisions into separate 
               <br />

               <br />
               and increased cost. Therefore, they say, 
               <br />
               we have a more efﬁcient system and we 
               <br />
               have also a less costly system. That is 
               <br />
               their point of view. Let manners and

               <br />
               inculcated. but no dogma of any sect. Let 
               <br />
               each class teach their dogma where they 
               <br />
               please; it may be in the Sunday school, or 
               <br />
               in the church, or in some other place, but if 
               <br />
               there is any sect, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Presbyterian,</span> Methodist,

               <br />
               is no prohibition. These are in broad terms 
               <br />
               the distinctive characteristics of the national 
               <br />

               <br />
               were to say: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> want dogmatic teaching. 
               <br />
               the answer to them would be: Provide for 
               <br />
               it as best you may: you have your churches, 
               <br />
               you have your Sunday schools, teach reli-

               <br />
               authority from them, against the disposi- 
               <br />
               tion and against the feelings of the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest so far as we can judge? 
               <br />
               Why is this attempt made to cripple 
               <br />
               these great provinces? Each of the other 
               <br />
               provinces, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island, British Columbia, 
               <br />
               Manitoba, is absolutely free and sovereign 
               <br />
               in so far as such legislation is concerned. 
               <br />
               Each one of these provinces of her own good 
               <br />
               will may enact a separate school system 
               <br />
               and it may also abrogate that law, but if it 
               <br />
               does abrogate it it has to show cause befdre 
               <br />
               the jurisdiction of the federal parliament 
               <br />
               and with the possible consequence of re- 
               <br />
               medial legislation. And if we can trust all 
               <br />
               these other provinces what reason in the 
               <br />
               world is there-that we should for ever tag 
               <br />
               with a badge of inferiority these two great 
               <br />
               coming provinces of the Northwest? When 
               <br />
               every other province stands clothed in the 
               <br />
               majesty of provincial rights, Why should we 
               <br />
               single out Saskatchewan and Alberta, and 
               <br />
               because we happen to be the guardian of 
               <br />
               the children put upon them for ever a badge 
               <br />
               of inferiority ? Is it not a retrograde 
               <br />
               step in thought and in practice to stand 
               <br />
               on our small platform of 1905 and to hold 
               <br />
               up a statute of limitations for ever in the 
               <br />
               face of two provinces, in which, as the cen- 
               <br />
               turies roll on changes must inevitably come, 
               <br />
               systems come and systems go, new methods 
               <br />
               take the place of old. But the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman stands up here with his small 
               <br />
               statute of limitation and he declares against 
               <br />
               the whole possible progress of these great 
               <br />
