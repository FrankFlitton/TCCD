               resolutions and petitions from the people of

               gentlemen do not represent the true senti—

               ment of the Northwest in many respects, 
               <br />
               because I am bound to give credence to the

               petitions sent here and signed by thousands

               of the people in that country who know 
               <br />
               what they want. One of these hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men told us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> other day that the people 
               <br />

               arrangement proposed in the Bill, and that

               they did not wish that the provinces should

               Mr. HENDERSON. Well, he is assum- 
               <br />
               ing a very dictatorial tone, more dictatorial 
               <br />
               than any minister ever assumed before, and 
               <br />
               I scarcely know what is to be the result. 
               <br />
               Perhaps you, Mr. Chairman, have been con- 
               <br />
               sidering it while we have been discussing 
               <br />
               other questions, and you will be able to 
               <br />
               tell the House What will be the outcome of 
               <br />
               the terrible threat of the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior. It would be a relief to us on 
               <br />
               this side of the House to know just exactly 
               <br />
               the position we are in. I am surprised at 
               <br />
               the language of the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior, and I would like to characterize 
               <br />
               it by a name which might not be very 
               <br />
               polite, because I think it is entirely un- 
               <br />
               called for. I shall leave the matter in 
               <br />
               your hands, Mr. Chairman, with the hope 
               <br />
               that you will give it your kindest and most 
               <br />
               conciliatory consideration, and that you will 
               <br />
               not expel us from the chamber in order to 
               <br />
               satisfy the new Minister of the Interior, 
               <br />
               who comes down here with such very high 
               <br />
               authority.

               Now with regard to the question that is
