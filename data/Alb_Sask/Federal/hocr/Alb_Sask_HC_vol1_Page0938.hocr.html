               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,the</span> Northwest Territories, which I have

               thing should be done before we become a 
               <br />

               exemption on their rolling stock, roadbed, 
               <br />
               yards and everything of that kind. I do 
               <br />
               not think that any one in the Northwest 
               <br />
               expects this government to step in and 
               <br />
               cancel the contract that exists between the 
               <br />
               Dominion government and the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway. I do not think that is at 
               <br />
               all the idea, but I believe the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest think—and I do not see What ob— 
               <br />
               jection there can be to it:—that this govern- 
               <br />
               ment should try to deal with this question 
               <br />
               in some way which would make the Do- 
               <br />
               minion government to some extent re- 
               <br />
               sponsible for the exemption clause in the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway contract. I think 
               <br />
               that every hon. member in this House knows 
               <br />
               that when'that railway was built across the 
               <br />
               continent it was not built expressly for the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of the people of the Northwest. It 
               <br />
               was built to fulﬁl a political compact made 
               <br />
               by the Dominion of Canada. When British 
               <br />
               Columbia came into confederation in 187.1 
               <br />
               she came in on the understanding that this 
               <br />
               railway would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tbe</span> built so as to connect 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> Columbia with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eastern</span> provinces 
               <br />
               in ten years. It is not necessary to go over 
               <br />
               ancient history, to recite the efforts made 
               <br />
               by different parties in the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada to induce the building of this road, 
               <br />
               but it is sufﬁcient to state that in the ﬁnal 
               <br />
               bargain that was made with the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway an exemption clause was 
               <br />
               inserted in the contract. We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">7claim</span> that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&gt;</span> this exemption was not given to help the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest, but to get British 
               <br />
               Columbia into the confederation, that it was 
               <br />
               given for the beneﬁt of the whole Dominion, 
               <br />
               and we think, therefore, that this parliament 
               <br />
               should deal with the question. We do not 
               <br />
               expect this government to repudiate previous 
               <br />
               contracts with railway corporations, but I 
               <br />
               think we are justly‘ entitled to believe that 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada should step in 
               <br />
               and deal with that question, and that the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest should not be 
               <br />
               further burdened. But that is not the worst 
               <br />
               feature. We have that burden on our 
               <br />
               shoulders at the present time, but now we 
               <br />
               are going further. We are going into an- 
               <br />
               other land deal, we are going into provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy, we are going to establish new 
               <br />
               provinces, and this Dominion parliament is 
               <br />
               going to retain the balance of the public 
               <br />
               lands in that country. I have already point-

               country, who are just as good ofﬁcials as 
               <br />
               there are in any country, who know their 
               <br />
               positions and who have not interfered in 
               <br />
               Dominion politics, but I wish to say, on the 
               <br />
               other hand, and -I say it without fear of 
               <br />
               contradiction, that quite a number of land 
               <br />
               agents have been nothing more nor less than 
               <br />
               common political organizers. It is easy to 
               <br />
               prove that statement, and I think this is 
               <br />
               one reason why the Dominion government 
               <br />
               is so anxious to retain our lands.
