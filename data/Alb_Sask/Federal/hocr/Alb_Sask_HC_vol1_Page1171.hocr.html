               I want to come to another question, the 
               <br />
               question of church and state. It is a well 
               <br />
               known doctrine in the United States that 
               <br />
               there is no connection between church and 
               <br />
               state, and we in this country are supposed 
               <br />
               to have no such connection. I do not 
               <br />
               know whether hon. gentlemen deny that 
               <br />
               or not, but let me read the law on the sub— 
               <br />
               ject. In 1851, the old province of Canada 
               <br />
               had to deal with an agitation that was 
               <br />
               then going on in regard to the connection 
               <br />
               between church and state. The Church of 
               <br />
               England had been established in the old 
               <br />
               province of Canada in the reign of King 
               <br />
               George III, and the Church of Scotland had 
               <br />
               "been established in this country then or at 
               <br />
               some later time; and so in 1851 the parliament 
               <br />
               of the old province of Canada had to legis- 
               <br />
               late on that subject. In 1851 it passed an 
               <br />
               Act. chapter 175, which was reserved for 
               <br />
               the signiﬁcation of Her Majesty’s wishes 
               <br />
               on the 30th of August, 1851, the royal as- 
               <br />
               sent was given by Her Majesty in Council 
               <br />
               on the 15th of May, 1852, and proclama- 
               <br />
               tion of'the Act was made in the same year. 
               <br />
               Let me read to this House a little of this 
               <br />
               legislation of the old province of Canada 
               <br />
               bearing on the connection between church 
               <br />
               and state :
