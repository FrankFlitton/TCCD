               —but somehow they omitted to specify the 
               <br />
               Warren Company’s patented monopoly for coal- 
               <br />
               tar, thus enabling their competitors to tender. 
               <br />
               The contract was never let, for when the ten- 
               <br />
               ders were opened, the Warren Company’s ten- 
               <br />
               der was found to be about 75 per cent higher 
               <br />
               than the lowest, so it was quite out of the 
               <br />
               question to give the contract to Mr. Robinette 
               <br />
               of Toronto who is largely interested in the 
               <br />
               Canadian branch of the American ﬁrm of the 
               <br />
               Warren Brothers of Boston. Now tenders were 
               <br />
               called for as per attached advertisement, and 
               <br />
               on April 29th (Saturday last) tenders were 
               <br />
               again received by the Department of Public 
               <br />
               Works, but this time they called for prices for 
               <br />
               Robinette’s Patent Warren pavement (similar 
               <br />
               to that laid last autumn opposite the Houses 
               <br />
               of parliament), also for prices on Trinidad 
               <br />
               asphalt pavement. On the former only the 
               <br />
               Warren <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Company</span> could bid, but on the asphalt 
               <br />
               pavement it was quite the reverse, being open 
               <br />
               to wide competition. The question is, will the 
               <br />
               government perpetrate on the city of Ottawa 
               <br />
               the injustice of laying a dusty, gritty, and un— 
               <br />
               satisfactory pavement on Wellington street, and 
               <br />
               for which the country will have to pay almost 
               <br />
               as much as they would for a ﬁrst-class asphalt

               I have inquired at the Public Works De-

               partment but can ﬁnd no record that this 
               <br />
               work in front of the building was let after 
               <br />
               public tenders had been called for. There 
               <br />
               may have been. of course, a formal tender 
               <br />
               just as there was in the case of the wire

               <br />
               with and told to put in a tender for this

               pavement, as far as the cost of preparation
