               on the map, contains 10 organized school

               districts which are conducted year in and 
               <br />
               year out, and most of those school buildings 
               <br />
               are quite equal to any in any country local— 
               <br />
               ity in eastern or western Canada. There is 
               <br />
               no part of Manitoba or of the Northwest

               <br />
               the settled portion of this particular district 
               <br />
               of Stony Plain, and there is no part more 
               <br />
               successful in its farming operation-s. But 
               <br />
               my hon. friend, by the scratch of a pen, ab- 
               <br />
               solutely wipes it out of existence. He says 
               <br />
               that the district of Athabaska might be just 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> as well represented by some one who lived 
               <br />
               somewhere else. Now if that argument of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend is to prevail, I suppose by 
               <br />
               the same reasoning some of the constitu— 
               <br />
               encies of Ontario and Quebec might be 
               <br />
               wiped out of existence because they are re- 
               <br />
               presented by non-residents, by gentlemen 
               <br />
               who live in Montreal and Quebec, or in 
               <br />
               Toronto. But the people of Stony Plain 
               <br />
               do not recognize that they are off the map, 
               <br />
               for they have been busy in selecting a 
               <br />
               resident candidate to represent them local- 
               <br />
               ly. My hon. friend mentioned some names 
               <br />
               as having some connection with this parti- 
               <br />
               cular constituency. These gentlemen have 
               <br />
               no connection with it, and that only shows 
               <br />
               that my hon. friend is not careful in the

               tion; it is only evidence that the Postmas-

               ter General has favoured that end of the

               tain town in his own constituency where the

               know what it is. I think, having regard to 
               <br />
               the action of the Postmaster General in 
               <br />
               granting post ofﬁces in his constituency, it 
               <br />
               is not fair of him to allege that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the‘</span> northern

               country has been favoured to a greater ex—

               tent than the part where he says the popula-

               tion is, particularly when he tells us that in

               this great district of Athabaska, with an 
               <br />
               area greater than that of all the rest of the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alberta,</span> the Postmaster General

               three years. He can have his argument 
               <br />
               that way if he likes. Either the Postmaster 
               <br />
               General is stingy with post <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ofﬁces</span> or he is 
               <br />
               liberal with post ofﬁces. If he is stingy with 
               <br />
               post oﬂices, then northern Alberta has not 
               <br />
               got more than it is entitled to in proportion 
               <br />

               <br />
               of fact, the question of the number of post 
               <br />
               oﬂices has only an indirect bearing on the 
               <br />
               question. The district of Athabaska is tra- 
               <br />
               versed by two great rivers—the Athabaska 
               <br />
               and the Peace. I think my hon. friend said 
               <br />
               there was no travel in the country. These 
               <br />
               two rivers are navigated by lines of steam- 
               <br />
               boats. There are plying on the waters 
               <br />

               <br />
               one belonging to the Hudson Bay Company, 
               <br />

               Hislop &amp; Nagle. On the Peace river they 
               <br />
               have three steamers, a large one and a small
