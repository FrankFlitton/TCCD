               we are now discussing; and I will venture to

               <br />
               Yesterday we had a number of ministers 
               <br />
               speaking, and the tone of their remarks 
               <br />
               was that although you could not depend 
               <br />
               upon the statement of the Hon. Mr. Rogers. 
               <br />
               you could depend upon that of the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Campbell, but that he would not speak 
               <br />
               —he had too much discretion to speak. But 
               <br />
               he speaks, and speaks deﬁnitely to-day. 
               <br />

               Before I refer to that, however, I might 
               <br />
               refer to a matter that casts a light upon the. 
               <br />
               extent of the privileges to be enjoyed 
               <br />
               by the minority in the Northwest in case 
               <br />
               this Act goes through in the form proposed. 
               <br />
               We have heard the statement constantly 
               <br />
               made, and it comes more particularly from 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance, that as a matter 
               <br />
               of fact, when you analyze the Acts, there 
               <br />
               is really nothing objectionable in the kind 
               <br />
               of schools which the government are im— 
               <br />
               posing upon the people of the Northwest— 
               <br />
               that there is only half an hour of religious 
               <br />
               instruction aft-er the school is dismissed, and 
               <br />
               that the schools are only separate schools 
               <br />
               in name, but not in fact. Let us see whether 
               <br />
               or not that is the fact. In 1897 the leader of 
               <br />
               the government said : 
               <br />

               The only thing I care for is that, whereas. 
               <br />
               under the Act, 1890, they had not the privilege 
               <br />
               of teaching their own religion in the schools.

               That is the statement of the premier. 
               <br />
               and it is to the effect, that he had carried 
               <br />
               on his negotiations in the west, and had 
               <br />

               statement of the Prime Minister which I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">haVe</span> just read, namely, that by his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11989“</span> 
               <br />
               tiations in 1896 he had secured for the mi- 
               <br />
               nority of Manitoba separate schools, in the 
               <br />
               sense of having their religion taught in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               schools and of having the enjoyment of the 
               <br />
               French language secured to them ; what is 
               <br />
               the result of taking these two matters to- 
               <br />
               gether ? It is that you have religion taught 
               <br />
               in the schools, and in addition to that, you 
               <br />
               have some greater advantage in the west. 
               <br />
               According to the ablegate, there is a broad 
               <br />
               distinction between the west and Manitoba 
               <br />
               ——distinction which is in his opinion sufﬁ- 
               <br />
               cient to bar the way to an extension of 
               <br />
               territory for Manitoba on the ground 
               <br />
               that the people in the added terri- 
               <br />
               tory would not enjoy equal privileges 
               <br />
               with those that they now enjoy. That 
               <br />
               lets in a pretty important side light as to 
               <br />
               the actual intention of this legislation. It 
               <br />
               shows that the government are not honest 
               <br />
               or fair, and that the statements of hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite are not correct when 
               <br />
               they say that this provision has been Whit- 
               <br />
               tled down to almost nothing, and that under 
               <br />
               it there will be only separate schools in 
               <br />
               name but not in fact. Let me say, although 
               <br />
               I do not propose to-day to discuss the legal 
               <br />
               question, that it Will be found, if the argu—

               ment of the ex-Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               is correct—and certainly he above all others 
               <br />
               should be in a position to judge of that 
               <br />
               matter, having, as he said, special means 
               <br />
               of studying the school question—that the, 
               <br />
               ordinances do not pare down the rights 
               <br />
               of the minority in the west, and that the 
               <br />
               schools <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provided</span> for in 1875 will be the 
               <br />
               class of schools that will be maintained un- 
               <br />
               der the Act now before the House. And 
               <br />
               there is good reason for that, although the 
               <br />
               Postmaster General has thrown out the 
               <br />
               suggestion that the government will dis— 
               <br />
               pute the law of the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               in that regard. If you turn to the Act 
               <br />
               uowbefore the House, you will ﬁnd that it 
               <br />
               embraces all the subsections of section 93 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act with the 
               <br />
               exception of subsection 1. That subsection 
               <br />
               does not deal with separate schools, but 
               <br />
               with denominational schools, and therefore 
               <br />
               has no bearing in Canada, where we have 
               <br />
               not what are properly known as denomi- 
               <br />
               national schools. The substituted subsec- 
               <br />
               tion is :
