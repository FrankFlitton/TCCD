               make a statement which concerned myself 
               <br />
               personally. and to dispute a statement which 
               <br />
               had appeared in the nchpapers on a pre-

               <br />
               lieve yet, when a member of this House 
               <br />
               finds himself attacked in a newspaper in a 
               <br />
               manner which he thinks is unwarranted. 
               <br />
               that he requires to give any notice of his 
               <br />
               intention to rise in his place and make an 
               <br />
               explanation, particularly when the matter 
               <br />
               is in no way controversial. It is also the 
               <br />
               general rule that when a member of the 
               <br />
               House gives his word in contradiction to 
               <br />
               alleged facts stated in a newspaper. his 
               <br />
               word is accepted. nor do I understand my 
               <br />
               hon. friend to dispute that rule. But to— 
               <br />
               day my hon. friend has thought it advis— 
               <br />
               able. for reasons of his own. to bring up a 
               <br />
               matter which is essentially controversial, 
               <br />
               because it implies a censure by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> House. 
               <br />
               and, therefore, I would have expected that 
               <br />
               the usual courtesy would have been extend- 
               <br />
               ed to me. Had I been informed of his in- 
               <br />
               tention. perhaps I would be in a better posi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               can give him nevertheless on this occasion.

               yesterday on the ﬂoor of this House. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend referred to my statement yes- 
               <br />
               terday that up to the month of January 
               <br />
               last we had no information, no ofﬁcial in- 
               <br />
               formation, of the intention of Manitoba to 
               <br />
               make an application for an extension of her 
               <br />
               boundaries. Why did I do that ? My hon. 
               <br />
               friend, for a reason, explained the alleged 
               <br />
               interview which was said to have taken 
               <br />
               place between Mr. Rogers, Mr. Campbell 
               <br />
               and the Apostolic delegate. In that inter— 
               <br />
               view Monseigneur Sbarretti was reported 
               <br />
               to have said that it would facilitate matters 
               <br />
               it‘ these gentlemen would consent to the res— 
               <br />
               toration of separate schools in Manitoba, 
               <br />
               and that if that had been done before it 
               <br />
               would have facilitated the extension of their 
               <br />
               boundaries towards the west. Well, Sir, I 
               <br />
               stated that I could hardly believe that His 
               <br />
               Excellency could have used such language, 
               <br />
               because then and there Mr.'R0gers Would 
               <br />
               have answered. and could have answered to 
               <br />
               the Apostolic delegate that there never had 
               <br />
               been by the government of Manitoba any 
               <br />
               demand upon this government to extend 
               <br />
               their boundaries prior to the month of Jan— 
               <br />
               nary last. and therefore Monseigneur Sbar- 
               <br />
               retti could not. in my judgment. have used 
               <br />
               such language in the presence of Mr. Rogers. 
               <br />
               Now to—day we have the conﬁrmation of my 
               <br />
               opinion that Monseigneur Sbarretti had 
               <br />
               never spoken in that way to Mr. Rogers. for 
               <br />
               the very good and obvious reason that Mons- 
               <br />
               eigneur Sbarretti never saw Mr. Rogers. 
               <br />
               There are many things in that interview 
               <br />
               published by Mr. Rogers which turn out 
               <br />
               to be not altogether according to the facts. 
               <br />
               You have the impression from the interview 
               <br />
               which was published yesterday, that the 
               <br />
               Apostolic delegate had sent an invitation to 
               <br />
               the delegates of the Manitoba government 
               <br />
               who were in Ottawa, to discuss with him 
               <br />
               this question of the extension of the boun- 
               <br />
               daries of the province of Manitoba. Is that 
               <br />
               according to the facts as we know them 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day‘!</span> No, Sir, we ﬁnd that the invita- 
               <br />
               tion of Monseigneur Sbarretti was not at
