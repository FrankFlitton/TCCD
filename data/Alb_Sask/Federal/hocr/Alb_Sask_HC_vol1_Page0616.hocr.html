               Customs said that their party was above

               their stock in trade, they never had any

               they to—day, what ﬁscal policy have they? 
               <br />
               Is it not the same policy that they opposed 
               <br />
               for 18 years in opposition, the policy of the 
               <br />
               Conservative party which they have changed 
               <br />
               a little, but the principle is the same ‘? What

               policy have they upon provincial autonomy, 
               <br />
               or any other question? So they went to 
               <br />
               the country. In the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               they used to say that it was impossible for 
               <br />
               the minority in Manitoba to obtain a redress 
               <br />
               of their grievances because, forsooth, the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister, Sir Mackenzie Bowel}, was 
               <br />
               an Orangeman; while in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario they said that the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               was bound hand and foot to the hierarchy 
               <br />
               of the province of Quebec. This was the 
               <br />
               way they treated that question throughout 
               <br />
               Canada. 
               <br />

               But, during all that time the Conservative 
               <br />
               party were endeavouring to do justice with 
               <br />
               a sincere desire to end this question in a 
               <br />
               way to render justice to the minority in 
               <br />
               Manitoba. They brought the question be— 
               <br />
               fore the courts, it went to the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court and then to the Privy Council, where 
               <br />
               it was decided that the law was intra vires 
               <br />
               of the provmce of Manitoba, as they had 
               <br />
               passed the law themselves and had changed 
               <br />
               that law, but it was declared later on by the 
               <br />
               Privy Council that the minority had a griev- 
               <br />
               ance, and that the Dominion government, 
               <br />
               according to the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               must come to the relief of the minority. 
               <br />
               Then when the Remedial Bill was presented 
               <br />
               to parliament, what did we see? We saw 
               <br />
               the friends of those gentlemen opposite— 
               <br />
               many of them have now disappeared from 
               <br />
               the House—opposing that Bill with all their 
               <br />
               might, speaking against time, knowing that 
               <br />
               parliament must dissolve on the°' 24th of 
               <br />
               April. They followed the lead of my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend who had proposed the six months 
               <br />
               hoist, knowing that he was defeating the 
               <br />
               Bill, knowing that that law was good, but 
               <br />
               knowing also that he was helping his party 
               <br />
               to obtain power. That was the way that he 
               <br />
               obtained his great name among the Protes- 
               <br />
               tants, which he has held for so many years, 
               <br />
               the name of being a tolerant man, of being 
               <br />
               above prejudice, the name of being so lib- 
               <br />
               eral minded that he had put his foot upon 
               <br />
               the hierarchy in the province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               But that was not the language used in 
               <br />
               Quebec. In Quebec, his French name and 
               <br />
               his eloquence were enough to help him and 
               <br />
               his- friends into power, and in that way he 
               <br />
               succeeded in overthrowing the Conservative 
               <br />
               government. Well, after he came into power 
               <br />
               what did we see? On the opening of the 
               <br />
               new parliament in the month of August, 
               <br />
               1896, in the debate on the address, he 
               <br />
               talked about the traditions of the Lib-

               He said: My hon. friend 'is now in power:

               he has a big majority; let him bring down

               the traditions of the party. This was not
