               the length and breadth of this land ? I believe 
               <br />
               that the great mass of the people to-day who 
               <br />
               are joining in petitions and holding meetings 
               <br />
               have not had time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\to</span> understand this question. 
               <br />
               I believe that they have an erroneous view as 
               <br />
               to what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> condition in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories is and as to what the condition which 
               <br />
               we propose to perpetuate is. When they dis-

               <br />
               which will ntake place in this House now and in 
               <br />
               the next few days, when the people of Canada 
               <br />
               shall :learn that we have in the west to-day a 
               <br />
               system which is practically a national school 
               <br />
               system, and that the only point of difference 
               <br />
               between us is with respect to that small mat- 
               <br />
               ter of a half hour of religious instruction, 1' 
               <br />
               think the great mass of the Protestant -people 
               <br />
               of Canada will say that they regret that there 
               <br />
               has been any agitation on the subject.

               dinances -to give the House a deﬁnite idea of

               what the condition of affairs was. Let me give

               what I conceive to be an accurate resumé of

               <br />
               teachers of all schools, separate and public;
