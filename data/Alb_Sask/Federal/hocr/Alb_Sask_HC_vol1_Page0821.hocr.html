               <br />
               because in the year 1896 they refused to 
               <br />
               the Manitoba minority in that province 
               <br />
               the privilege for which they were then 
               <br />
               asking. What was the course pursued by 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite in that connection ? 
               <br />
               I had the honour of being then, as I am 
               <br />
               now, a supporter of the Conservative party, 
               <br />
               but I was not enthusiastic with regard to 
               <br />
               the position taken on the Manitoba school 
               <br />
               question by the Hon. Sir Charles Tupper 
               <br />
               who then led the Conservative party. I 
               <br />
               never lifted up my voice on behalf of that 
               <br />
               policy. Not a word did I speak during the 
               <br />
               election of that year in favour of it. I had 
               <br />
               for a long series of years paid very close 
               <br />
               attention to the career of the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man who at that time was leading the Con- 
               <br />
               servative party, and I consider that in the 
               <br />
               annals of Canadian public men the name of 
               <br />
               Sir Charles Tupper will be handed down to 
               <br />
               posterity as one of the most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distinguished</span> 
               <br />
               statesmen this country has produced. But 
               <br />
               on that occasion I was not one of those who 
               <br />
               were enthusiastic with regard to Sir Charles 
               <br />
               Tupper’s policy on the Manitoba school 
               <br />
               question. I am glad now to be able to say 
               <br />
               that I was not enthusiastic with regard to 
               <br />
               that policy and did not support it, and there- 
               <br />
               fore my course at present is clear and 
               <br />
               straightforward. The same convictions which 
               <br />
               I had then animate me still. I have not 
               <br />
               found it necessary, in the course of my pub- 
               <br />
               lic career, to vary my attitude on this ques— 
               <br />
               tion. If I have attained in my neighbour- 
               <br />
               hood any reputation of any description in 
               <br />
               public matters, it is because, in dealing with 
               <br />
               public questions I have always treated them 
               <br />
               as questions upon which I had formed con- 
               <br />
               victions and upon which I never hesitated 
               <br />
               to give expression to those convictions: 
               <br />
               Whether with regard to separate schools 
               <br />
               or the tariff or the railway policy of this 
               <br />
               country or any other question, I do not 
               <br />
               believe that I can be accused by any hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman opposite with ever having hesi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ever become necessary for me to part with 
               <br />
               my convictions, I trust I shall be then also 
               <br />
               out of public life. for I have no desire to 
               <br />
               remain in public life if I cannot do so with- 
               <br />

               <br />

               difﬁculty and to state our convictions and 
               <br />
               beliefs. Hon. gentlemen opposite have ac-

               cused this side of the House with being 
               <br />
               bigoted and partisan and unwilling to lis- 
               <br />
               ten to the prayer of the minority. But I 
               <br />
               think the cause of this debate is to be found 
               <br />
               in the speech of the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               in introducing the Bill. If you will refer 
               <br />
               to that speech, you will see the reason why 
               <br />
               we are debating this question at such great 
               <br />
               length and dealing with a matter. concern— 
               <br />
               ing which opinions are so conﬂicting and 
               <br />
               passions cannot fail to be aroused. The 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman, in that speech, dwelt 
               <br />
               at great length upon the school clauses 
               <br />
               of the Bill before us. That in fact was the 
               <br />
               principal item that he dealt with. Into that 
               <br />
               feature of the measure he threw the whole 
               <br />
               force of his advocacy ; and I must say that 
               <br />
               from his standpoint he made a very able 
               <br />
               argument and one that no doubt carried 
               <br />
               conviction to the minds of many of his 
               <br />
               followers. In order that I may not be

               Before I proceed, let me make a few obser- 
               <br />
               vations to show the origin and object of all 
               <br />
               this legislation concerning separate schools. 
               <br />

               <br />
               I need not say that the Christian religion is 
               <br />
               not only a religion founded on moral laws, 
               <br />
               prescribing moral duties, but it is also a. re- 
               <br />
               ligion of dogmas. Dogmas from the earliest 
               <br />
               times have occupied just as strong and com—

               <br />
               tians as morals themselves. The reformation 
               <br />
               created a cleavage between Christians. The 
               <br />
               old section remained Roman Catholics; the 
               <br />
               new called themselves Protestants. Between the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics and Protestants there is 
               <br />
               a deep divergence in dogmas. Between the
