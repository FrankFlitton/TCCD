               the arrangement with Manitoba was made 
               <br />
               by their predecessors. They are willing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to,</span>

               their predecessors in some things, but see

               how diﬁerent Were the circumstances in 
               <br />
               Manitoba then as compared with what they 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> in the Territories. In Manitoba 
               <br />
               in the year 1870, there were only 12,000 peo- 
               <br />
               ple, and it was perhaps prudent to with- 
               <br />
               hold from that mere handful of people, un- 
               <br />
               accustomed to self-government, living on 
               <br />
               the banks of the Red river, their right to 
               <br />
               administer their public lands, but the condi- 
               <br />
               tions which then existed no longer remain 
               <br />
               nor do they exist in the new provinces about 
               <br />
               to be established. Whereas in Manitoba 
               <br />
               you had only 12,000 people in 1870, you have 
               <br />
               in the Territories today, if we are to be- 
               <br />

               <br />
               that go with self-government. But fourteen 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> later, when the same party was in

               <br />
               down to this parliament and asked to be] 
               <br />
               given control of its public lands and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its}</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               Manitoba agreed to waive her claim to the‘ 
               <br />
               public lands in consideration of an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">annual:</span> 
               <br />
               payment of $100,000. But it was her pri- 
               <br />
               vilege to do that, and that does not form a

               sides hon. gentlemen opposite have been 
               <br />
               holding themselves out as nation builders 
               <br />
               and carefully avoiding any errors into which 
               <br />
               previous governments have fallen, as all 
               <br />
               government must fall sometimes. But can 
               <br />
               any man, I ask, look into the negotiations 
               <br />
               which have taken place between Manitoba 
               <br />
               and the federal government, and say that 
               <br />
               the policy followed was a wise one ? Look at 
               <br />
               the negotiations which have taken place at 
               <br />
               frequent intervals between that province 
               <br />
               and the administration at Ottawa, and you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that the result of that policy has 
               <br />
               been continued dissatisfaction and continued 
               <br />
               agitation for better terms. Look at what 
               <br />
               has taken place. It is a record of almost 
               <br />
               annual pilgrimages from Manitoba to 0t- 
               <br />
               tawa for better terms. In 1876 her subsidy 
               <br />
               was increased to $90,000. In 1879 it was 
               <br />
               increased to $105,653. Again in 1882, she 
               <br />
               came knocking at the federal door, and her 
               <br />
               subsidy was increased to $215,000. In 1885 
               <br />
               she was still given further assistance. She 
               <br />
               was given swamp lands, 150,000 acres for 
               <br />
               a university, $100,000 a year in lieu of pub- 
               <br />
               lic lands, and a per capita grant on a basis 
               <br />
               of population of 150,000. But that was not 
               <br />
               the end. 'In 1898 further application was 
               <br />
               made and she was given a cash grant to 
               <br />
               construct the government house, and in 1899 
               <br />
               she was given better lands in exchange for 
               <br />
               the swamp lands. These are only a few of 
               <br />
               the begging trips of Manitoba; and I ask: 
               <br />
               Is it good policy, is it wise administration 
               <br />
               to keep the provincial government at the

               <br />

               ies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘9</span> Is it because the governments of the

               Territories are not capable of giving an 
               <br />
               honest administration ? No, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               that is not the reason. We have in that 
               <br />
               country to-day a large population accustom- 
               <br />
               ed to self-government, and no one has as 
               <br />
               yet ventured to sugest the merest suspicion 
               <br />
               against the competency of the people in 
               <br />
               the Territories to manage their own public 
               <br />
               affairs in their own public interests. That 
               <br />
               is not the reason, but the reason is that the 
               <br />
               Ottawa administration realizes that as long 
               <br />
               as it can retain the immense army of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂ‘icials</span> 
               <br />
               which it has up there now, it will have

               under its control a great machinery for 
               <br />

               <br />
               what party may be in power, there will 
               <br />
               always be the danger of its making an
