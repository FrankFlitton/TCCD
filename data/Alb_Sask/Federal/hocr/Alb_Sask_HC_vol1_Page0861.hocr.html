               sailed, as I say, on more occasions than one. 
               <br />
               And it was to the late Sir Oliver Mowat,

               that great advocate of provincial rights, 
               <br />

               <br />
               of that enemy were not successful. The

               Conservative party supporting Sir John 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Macdonald</span> on these occasions had very 
               <br />
               little respect for provincial rights. Now, 
               <br />
               the doctrine of provincial rights is a good 
               <br />
               doctrine, an excellent doctrine. But it is not 
               <br />
               a doctrine, to be invoked in defence of the 
               <br />
               penpetration of a great national wrong.

               These estimable people in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario who are so much concerned at the 
               <br />
               so—called invasion of provincial rights seem 
               <br />
               to conﬁne their attention in that respect 
               <br />
               altogether to the educational clauses of this 
               <br />
               Bill. They have nothing to say, in their 
               <br />
               petitions and resolutions sent here to parlia- 
               <br />

               to say about the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               exemption. If the government proposals in 
               <br />
               regard to education be an infraction of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights, how much more so are their 
               <br />
               proposals in regard to the lands ? And yet, 
               <br />
               do we ﬁnd these very excellent people com- 
               <br />
               plaining or memorializing the government 
               <br />
               about the land clause of the Bill ? Nor do 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd them complaining as to the Cana— 
               <br />
               dian Paciﬁc Railway exemption. I am of 
               <br />
               opinion that in future years the matter of 
               <br />
               that exemption will bear very heavily and 
               <br />
               very harshly upon the people of the

               Northwest Territories. But do we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               any sympathy expressed by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pI'O'</span>

               vince of Ontario with these new pro-

               vinces either on the ground that they will 
               <br />
               not have their lands, or on the ground of 
               <br />

               this commotion and concern is manifested 
               <br />
               largely because clause 16 of the Bill relates 
               <br />
               in a measure to the religious convictions of 
               <br />
               a minority of our people. I am forced to

               that conclusion and any reasonable man

               <br />
               and entirely silent. It is said that the Lib-

               <br />
               that; I heard the hon. member for East Grey

               quite correct in making that statement and 
               <br />
               1 may say that the Liberal party were de-

               fending provincial rights from 1878 to 1890 
               <br />
               Whenmy hon. friend was supporting the

               not was not on the side of the provinces in 
               <br />
               these struggles. It is charged that the Lib—

               era] party has changed its front with regard 
               <br />
               to provincial rights, and the leader of that 
               <br />
               party is also charged with a departure from 
               <br />
               his record, and it is vehemently charged that 
               <br />
               the Liberal party is false to its position 
               <br />
               and to the principles enunciated in connec-

               <br />
               1896. ‘I take issue directly with those who 
               <br />
               charged the Liberal party with inconsistency,

               ercise of her undoubted powers, altered a 
               <br />
               school system which she herself had brought 
               <br />
               into being. I am not saying whether that 
               <br />
               system was good or bad, I have no expres- 
               <br />
               sion of opinion to make in that regard, but 
               <br />
               that system, at least according to the judg- 
               <br />
               ment of a great majority of Mani-tobans, had 
               <br />
               outlived its usefulness. The la—te Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive government sought in the dying hours _ 
               <br />
               of a parliament to coerce an unwilling pro- 
               <br />
               vince to return to that abandoned system 
               <br />
               and we all know the result that followed 
               <br />
               that attempt. In the present case the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritorles adopted their own system of schools 
               <br />
               and brought it to a state satisfactory to the 
               <br />
               people of the Territories. The man who 
               <br />
