               Minister, not satisﬁed with these inﬂamma- 
               <br />
               tory cries in the province of Quebec, com- 
               <br />

               to inﬂame the public of that province along 
               <br />

               <br />

               yet he stands up here to-day preaching unity

               last thirty years been thrown before the

               East Grey (Mr. Sproule) has been charged 
               <br />
               with being intolerant. Why, Sir, I have

               been surprised at the tolerance displayed 
               <br />

               It is not my intention, Sir, to discuss the 
               <br />
               constitutional aspect of the question. The 
               <br />

               <br />

               his argument. Minister after minister arose 
               <br />
               and they practically had to admit that the

               in his interpretation of the law was abso— 
               <br />
               lutely correct. Our good friend the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister claimed that he stood on the rock 
               <br />

               <br />
               the opposition got throughwith him it turn- 
               <br />
               ed out that the right hon. gentleman had 
               <br />
               landed on a mud bank. It is the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition who stands on the rock of 
               <br />
               the constitution and who in doing so pro- 
               <br />
               claims his adhesion to the principles of 
               <br />
               equity and justice and fair play for all. The 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition gives to every free

               fore the House. Before recess I was point-

               ing out that the leader of the opposition 
               <br />

               equal laws for all, and special privileges for 
               <br />

               <br />
               this parliament to coerce the new provinces

               to establish in those provinces a union of

               in a few weeks all this discussion will be 
               <br />
               forgotten. Let me tell the First Minister

               that down deep in the hearts of his country- 
               <br />
               men, those who support him as well as those 
               <br />
               who oppose him, is the conviction that he 
               <br />
               has made the mistake of his lifetime—that 
               <br />
               he has destroyed the high opinion in which 
               <br />
               he was held by a great many of the people 
               <br />
               of this country, who had absolute faith in 
               <br />
               his struggles for liberty in 1896 and on other 
               <br />
               occasions in the history of this country.

               The Minister of Justice in replying to the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, abandoned the 
               <br />
               ground of the constitution and the ground 
               <br />
               of vested rights, and stood simply on the
