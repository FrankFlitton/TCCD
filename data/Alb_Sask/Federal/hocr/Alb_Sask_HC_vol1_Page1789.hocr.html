               Mr. BOURA—SSA. After what ‘has been 
               <br />
               said on both sides in this House, I doubt 
               <br />
               whether 1 per cent of the electors of this 
               <br />
               country really know where they are. Now, 
               <br />
               Sir, I think this disposes of the argument 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'cmi-nority</span> are satisﬁed, as it also dis- 
               <br />
               poses of the argument that the English- 
               <br />
               speaking majority in this parliament and in 
               <br />
               this country are not prepared to do justice. 
               <br />
               Now we are told that the second <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clause</span> is 
               <br />
               clearer than the ﬁrst. It is clearer on one 
               <br />
               point, that it leaves so little advantage to 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholics that it is not worth 
               <br />
               mentioning. Is that a ground on which this 
               <br />
               government should stand as the defenders 
               <br />
               of the minority ? It is stated that some sac- 
               <br />
               riﬁce has been made to the opinions of the 
               <br />
               majority. I do not know why. Is it because 
               <br />
               the English Protestant people have demand- 
               <br />
               ed it? No. Sir. The division between the 
               <br />
               Protestant people of this country has been 
               <br />
               as to whether there should be any separate 
               <br />
               schools in the Northwest at all. The ma- 
               <br />
               jority of Canadians do not split hairs, the 
               <br />
               people of this country have already pro- 
               <br />
               nounced upon the question as to whether we 
               <br />
               will give separate schools to the Northwest. 
               <br />
               If I asked to-day for the establishment of 
               <br />
               such separate schools in. the Northwest as 
               <br />
               the Protestants enjoy in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec. at ﬁrst sight perhaps they would 
               <br />
               not be willing to grant them. But I say that 
               <br />
               when we reduce our demands to the mere 
               <br />
               right of separation, the Protestant people 
               <br />
               of this country, the people of London. the 
               <br />
               people of Oxford—I will go further and say 
               <br />
               the people of Toronto, would answer, yes, 
               <br />
               we are ready to give separate schools to the 
               <br />
               Catholics of the Northwest, we are ready to 
               <br />
               give them not only to the minority in any

               <br />
               not to be Yankees enough to deprive people

               <br />

               one upon which conciliation can be obtained.

               You cannot make the people in Quebec be—

               lieve that the vast majority of the English-

               ence to the hon. minister, it seems to me

               that is one of the most extraordinary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argu«</span> 
               <br />
               ments I have heard. Is it paying more re—

               spect to the rights of the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest who will live in 1930 to tell them: 
               <br />
               You are bound by the law of 1901——than to 
               <br />
               tell them, you are bound by the law of 1875 ? 
               <br />
               Do you say it is respectful of provincial 
               <br />
               rights to. say to the people of the Northwest, 
               <br />
               here is one of your ordinances passed in 
               <br />
               such a year by such an assembly and you 
               <br />
               will never get free from it, so far as separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools are concerned ? If you need 
               <br />
               take a northwest ordinance as the basis ot‘ 
               <br />
               your education clause, Why don't you take 
               <br />
               the ordinance of 1885, which emanates from 
               <br />
               the same authority as that of 1901? The 
               <br />
               difference between the law of 1885 and that 
               <br />
               of 1901 is that the former was in conformity 
               <br />
               with our own law, and therefore by adopting 
               <br />
               the law of 1885 we would respect the princi-

               vantage that we would be respecting our—

               selves and our past. But in adopting the 
               <br />
               law of 1901 we are breaking our pledges, 
               <br />
               and at the same time we are not respecting 
               <br />
               provincial rights.
