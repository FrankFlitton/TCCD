               That was a pretty hard thing for Mr. Tarte

               was eight years at the job, and if common

               of the commission of one, consisting of Mr. 
               <br />
               Tarte, which was appointed to deal with 
               <br />
               these three men. Mr. Tarte then cam'e 
               <br />
               back to Mr. Greenway and Mr. Greenway 
               <br />
               said to him: My” treasury is pretty well 
               <br />
               depleted. You have a large school fund 
               <br />
               down there that belongs to the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba and the Northwest Territories, 
               <br />
               because when the lands were set apart for 
               <br />
               school purposes the law provided that ac- 
               <br />
               cording as these lands were sold, the money 
               <br />
               should be funded and the interest thereon 
               <br />
               used for school purposes. Mr. Green- 
               <br />
               way said : You have a treasury fund, 
               <br />
               vote me $300,000 out of that fund. 
               <br />
               Mr. Tarte said : I will do it ; and 
               <br />
               legislation was passed, this House misappro- 
               <br />
               priating these $300,000 out of this trust 
               <br />
               fund and handing it over to the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. Mr. Greenway then made some 
               <br />
               modiﬁcations in the law. a bargain was 
               <br />
               drawn up, signed by Mr. Sifton, Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier and Mr. Greenwuy. and the Prime

               Minister then claimed credit for having

               the country in the way I have just des- 
               <br />
               cribed. Then we came on to last .fall when 
               <br />
               a general election had to be held. The gov- 
               <br />
               ernment felt that the country was going 
               <br />
               against them, partially on account of their 
               <br />
               not having carried out their promise on the 
               <br />
               Manitoba school question and partly because 
               <br />
               of the Grand Trunk Paciﬁc scheme and

               many other unfulﬁlled promises regarding

               protection to native industries. Something 
               <br />
               therefore had to be done. The Northwest 
               <br />
               were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clavmouring</span> for autonomy, and the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment up to that time had refused it, 
               <br />
               knowing that the school question would be 
               <br />
               raised. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,Prime</span> Minister knew he had 
               <br />
               not carried out his agreement with the hier—

               The ex—Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               in his addreses on this Bill stated that he

               had read the speech of the First Minister

               <br />
               the leader of the opposition, but he put aside 
               <br />
               both these opinions and appealed to the man 
               <br />
               on the street. He cast aside the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion and everything else. It was simply a 
               <br />
               matter of half an hour’s religious instruc- 
               <br />
               tion in the school after school hours, and he 
               <br />
               asked the opinion of the man in the street, 
               <br />
               the common elector. But what will the 
               <br />
               man on the street say, in view of what has 
               <br />
               transpired. He will say that the whole thing 
               <br />
               is a job from beginning to end, simply a play 
               <br />
               on the stage with a farce attached. He will 
               <br />
               say that the Prime Minister and the ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior put their heads 
               <br />
               together and said, we will go to the country 
               <br />
               but we will be defeated unless we grant 
               <br />
               autonomy to the Northwest. But, said the 
               <br />
               First Minister, if we grant autonomy to the 
               <br />
               Northwest, we shall have to grant separate 
               <br />
               schools, because I have not carried out my 
               <br />
               promise to my clergy with reference to the 
               <br />
               Manitoba school question, and I cannot 
               <br />
               count on their support unless, in granting 
               <br />
               autonomy to the new provinces, we also 
               <br />
               grant separate schools. It was agreed that 
               <br />
               the school question should be included, but 
               <br />
               this was to be kept private until after the 
               <br />
               election. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exc—minister</span> of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) hurried off to take charge of the 
               <br />
               elections in Manitoba, the Northwest and 
               <br />
               British Columbia; and he promised the 
               <br />
               people in the west that autonomy should be 
               <br />
               granted, and said : You have my past record 
               <br />
               on the school question as an indication of 
               <br />
               what will be done in that matter. And the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister hied himself down to the 
               <br />
               meeting of the bishops at Three Rivers and 
               <br />
               said : We are going to grant autonomy to 
               <br />
               the Northwest, and we will make provision 
               <br />
               for separate schools, but the matter must be 
               <br />
               kept quiet in the meantime.
