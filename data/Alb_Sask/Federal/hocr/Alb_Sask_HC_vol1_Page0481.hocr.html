               <br />

               <br />
               sixteenth session I have had the honour of 
               <br />
               occupying a seat in it. Just fancy the man 
               <br />
               who made the welkin ring from one end of 
               <br />
               the Dominion to the other in 1896 against 
               <br />
               any interference with the province of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba, who has been quoted often in this 
               <br />
               House as against any coercion of any pro- 
               <br />
               vince—just fancy this man, when brought 
               <br />
               face to face with the issue of his own crea- 
               <br />
               tion, renouncing every shred of principle he 
               <br />
               then stood for. Shall I quote his language ? 
               <br />
               I really do not think it necessary, and I do 
               <br />
               not like to see it any oftener than I can help 
               <br />
               in the pages of ‘Hansard.‘ But what was 
               <br />
               the pitiable plea he made ? 0h, he said, if 
               <br />
               we don’t accept this clause the First Min- 
               <br />
               ister will have to resign and we will be all 
               <br />
               out in the cold. That was the sum and sub— 
               <br />
               stance of his remarks. Why, the whale and 
               <br />
               Jonah were not in it compared with the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman and his principles. The whale 
               <br />
               merely swallowed Jonah, but the Finance 
               <br />
               Minister swallowed both himself and what- 
               <br />
               ever principles he ever had. He pointed out 
               <br />
               that in Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:Scotia</span> the Roman Catholics were 
               <br />
               handsomely used by the Protestant majority, 
               <br />
               but in the next breath he turned around and 
               <br />
               said we cannot trust the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west to do the Roman Catholic minority in 
               <br />
               those new provinces what is being done to 
               <br />
               that same minority in the province of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia. That was the result of the hon. gen-

               tleman’s logic. I might remind him of an

               House. How a minister who has sworn to

               removed. I stood up in that ﬁght and we 
               <br />
               won and prevented these improper amend- 
               <br />
               ments being perpetuated and put into 
               <br />
               practice in our province. I remember well 
               <br />
               pointing out that if every adviser of Sir 
               <br />
               Oliver Mowat were a member of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic church, it did not matter so long 
               <br />
               as he was chosen on the ground of ﬁtness 
               <br />
               and ability, but that no .one should be chosen 
               <br />
               for a cabinet position simply because he hap- 
               <br />
               pened to be an Irishman or a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Scotchman</span> or 
               <br />
               a Frenchman or an Englishman and a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of a certain church. Let ability be the 
               <br />
               test, I contended, and there would be no 
               <br />
               trouble. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*But</span> on all these matters, there 
               <br />
               are demagogues who take advantage of 
               <br />
               national and religious prejudices, men who 
               <br />
               have no qualiﬁcations or ﬁtness for public 
               <br />
               oﬂice other than that they handle the 
               <br />
               Irish vote in this locality, or the French 
               <br />
               vote in another locality, or some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other,</span> votes 
               <br />
               somewhere else ; and these are the men who 
               <br />
               have gained ascendency in the Liberal party 
               <br />
