               <br />
               is done by this government. Now, is it well

               to proceed to the formation of a new province 
               <br />

               <br />
               a powerful government to afford ground for 
               <br />
               suspicion of such a thing? Commence with 
               <br />
               a gerrymander, and with what measure ye

               <br />
               are men of trained legal minds, men who 
               <br />
               have been elevated to the bench and so live 
               <br />
               outside the atmosphere of partisanship, in 
               <br />
               a place, where, as it is popularly supposed,

               these old scales fall from their eyes and they 
               <br />
               can see the facts as they are and act judi-

               <br />
               they have their reputations at stake. More 
               <br />
               than that, they live in all the constituencies ; 
               <br />
               they travel through them all. The principle
