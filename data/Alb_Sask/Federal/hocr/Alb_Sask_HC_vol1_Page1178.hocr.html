               place—and this chamber is not an easy one 
               <br />
               to hear in—I thought that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the!</span> decision was

               that the main motion was carried on divi- 
               <br />
               sion. It is well known in that House that I 
               <br />
               expressed myself in opposition to the main 
               <br />
               motion. There was no call for the yeas and 
               <br />
               nays, nor did I feel especially called on, or 
               <br />
               desirous indeed of opposing the government 
               <br />
               though I did call ‘lost’ when the second 
               <br />
               reading was put. But, if as a matter of 
               <br />
               fact, the form in which the question was 
               <br />
               decided was that the main motion was 
               <br />
               agreed to on the same division reversed, it 
               <br />
               unfortunately places me in the position of 
               <br />
               apparently speaking one way and voting 
               <br />
               the other, which was not my intention nor 
               <br />
               did 1 do so in fact. It may be that, some 
               <br />
               time before I get through with my political 
               <br />
               life, I will be guilty of doing that. If I have 
               <br />
               apparently done so at this time, it was‘in-

               Mr. A. B. INGRAM. In the case of the 
               <br />
               vote taken last night, when the main motion 
               <br />
               was put to the House, according to the ‘ Han- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing whether it was carried unanimously. It 
               <br />
               leaves it to be understood that it was carried 
               <br />
               unanimously. Every one knows that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               division <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">took‘place</span> on the amendment, and 
               <br />
               .the main motion was carried on the same 
               <br />
               division reversed exactly. Now the Votes 
               <br />
               and Proceedings show the names of the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               division, and according to the practice 
               <br />
               usually adopted in this House the names 
               <br />
               should have been recorded on the second 
               <br />
               division, because every hon. gentleman in 
               <br />
               this House should be placed on record ex- 
               <br />
               actly as he has voted. It is a well known 
               <br />
               fact that according to the custom of this 
               <br />
               House the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«South</span> Perth 
               <br />
               voted for the Bill, as every hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               did who voted against the amendment. 
               <br />
               Therefore I say that the Votes and Proceed- 
               <br />
               ings ought to be amended so as to show the 
               <br />
               names twice instead of only once, as they 
               <br />

               ed it in this House on many occasions, par- 
               <br />
               ticularly in the numerous divisions which 
               <br />
               took place in connection with the govern—

               <br />
               Railway. It was declared ‘Carried by di-

               vision reversed’ or ‘Carried 011 the same 
               <br />
               division.’ However, the system has been 
               <br />
               adopted purely for convenience. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">As</span> last 
               <br />
               night we were here until about a quarter to 
               <br />
               two o’clock in the morning, I suggested that 
               <br />
               the main motion should be carried on the 
               <br />
               same division reversed, purely as a matter 
               <br />
               of convenience, not having in mind my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from South Perth, and that was done. 
               <br />
               It did not need ﬁve gentlemen to rise and 
               <br />
               call for the yeas and nays, all that was 
               <br />
               necessary for my hon. friend from South 
               <br />
               Perth to have done was to stand up and call 
               <br />
               for the yeas and hays, because the division 
               <br />
               had already been granted by the Speaker. 
               <br />
               Therefore it was a matter for himself to 
               <br />
               determine whether we should have another 
               <br />
               division or not. There may be some excuse 
               <br />
               for him as a new member, but he could, 
               <br />
               simply by raising his voice, have had a vote 
               <br />
               taken in the way in which he says now he 
               <br />
               would like to have had it taken.

               Mr. INGRAM. What I would like to know 
               <br />
               particularly is if the Votes and Proceedings 
               <br />
               of yesterday can be amended in order that 
               <br />
               the names of hon. gentlemen may be record- 
               <br />
               ed as having voted on two diﬁîerent occa- 
               <br />
               sions, because it is a subject that will be 
               <br />
               referred :to very frequently in the future, it 
               <br />
               was one of the most important votes ever 
               <br />
               cast in this House, and every member of this 
               <br />
               House should be placed on record so that 
               <br />
               there will be no dispute as to how he voted? 
               <br />
               I think the Votes and Proceedings need to. 
               <br />
               be amended.
