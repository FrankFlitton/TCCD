               <br />
               make no comparison, because that province, 
               <br />
               1 think every one admits, is not under fair 
               <br />
               terms. In 1899, with an approximate popu- 
               <br />
               lation of 250,000, Manitoba drew only 
               <br />
               $524,281 from lands and subsidies, as against 
               <br />
               a little over $1,000,000 for Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               with the same population. For the last two 
               <br />
               years Manitoba has been selling railway 
               <br />
               lands and increasing her annual revenue. 
               <br />
               But that cannot long continue. In 1903, 
               <br />
               even with these sales of nearly $300,000, 
               <br />
               Manitoba’s total lands and subsidy revenue 
               <br />
               was $826,175 with a population of 255,000.

               I think, that as a whole, these comparisons

               tion whether the lands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be transferred 
               <br />
               to local management as to the question 
               <br />
               whether these local governments should be 
               <br />
               given an equitable ﬁnancial status in com—

               parison with the local governments in the 
               <br />
               other provinces. And that object is achieved 
               <br />
               in these propositions presented by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, not precisely, as I then urged, by 
               <br />
               actual transfer of the lands, but by a 
               <br />
               method, which, I am convinced, is ﬁnanci- 
               <br />
               ally even better for the local governments. 
               <br />
               I was a strong believer in the principle of 
               <br />
               the ownership of the lands by the province, 
               <br />
               or at all events, that the province 
               <br />
               should have the right of the beneﬁcial 
               <br />
               interest in them. I am a strong believer in 
               <br />
               that principle still, and it is that principle 
               <br />
               that is practically assented to in this 
               <br />
               measure. But I may say, that in 1901, when 
               <br />
               I made that statement, and even later, the 
               <br />
               principle found no general acceptance in this 
               <br />
               House or amongst any of the people east of 
               <br />
               the great lakes; and my main purpose in 
               <br />
               uttering these words here was to try and im- 
               <br />
               press upon the people of eastern Canada the 
               <br />
               necessity of recognizing the right of posses— 
               <br />
               sion 01', at least, of the beneﬁcial interest in 
               <br />
               the lands of the Northwest Territories by 
               <br />
               the people of these Territories. Now, this 
               <br />
               House has already heard the very clear and 
               <br />
               ample statements made on this subject by 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cit-Minister</span> of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               and by my hon. friend from Edmonton (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver). They have made arguments which 
               <br />
               in my opinion are unanswerable. There has 
               <br />
               been no genuine attempt on the part of hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite to answer them. At all 
               <br />
               events those arguments were sufﬁcient to 
               <br />
               convert me to the proposition that it is abso— 
               <br />
               lutely better for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> of those 
               <br />
               new provinces to have the lands adminis- 
               <br />
               tered here, so long as the provinces obtain 
               <br />
               a sufﬁcient sum in lieu of lands to place 
               <br />
               them in an equitable position to carry on 
               <br />
               their educational system, their public works, 
               <br />
               and, generally, their local affairs. And I am 
               <br />
               the more conﬁrmed in that view by the ex— 
               <br />
               pressions which have fallen from hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gen-v</span> 
               <br />
               tlemen on the other side of the House. The

               hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster).

               who, we assume, is the chief ﬁnancial spokes—

               man for the Conservative party in this 
               <br />
               House, gave expression on the 15th of 
               <br />
               March, to the following with regard to the
