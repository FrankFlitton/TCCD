               glad of it and they are entitled to great credit

               for it ? How many families are there to the 
               <br />
               mile square in the Northwest Territories ? 
               <br />
               Taking the ordinary farm that is owned up 
               <br />
               there you would have but four families. 
               <br />
               How many miles square of that territory 
               <br />
               will it require to provide children enough to 
               <br />
               ﬁll a school ? Do you not see if you divide 
               <br />
               the people up according to religious belief 
               <br />
               in one locality, part Protestant and part 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic, you reduce the number 
               <br />
               of available people to support a school 
               <br />
               there, and therefore it may be quite 
               <br />
               impossible to carry on such an educat- 
               <br />
               ional system as would be quite suit- 
               <br />
               able and easily carried on in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec. What do we ﬁnd in regard 
               <br />
               to the same inquiry in Manitoba and some- 
               <br />
               what similar conditions exist up there ? 
               <br />
               How many children have they in their 
               <br />
               schools in the province of Manitoba ? I 
               <br />
               have the list for 1894: Woodlands nine, 
               <br />
               Ossowo ﬁve, Oakland eight, White Haven 
               <br />
               six, Silver Creek nine, West Oakland seven, 
               <br />
               and I ﬁnd that the average attendance is 
               <br />
               about four. There is not one school in ﬁfty 
               <br />
               that has an average attendance of ten. 
               <br />
               What is that caused by ? By the sparseness 
               <br />
               of the population. The people have their 
               <br />
               farms in the west larger than they have their 
               <br />
               farms in Quebec and larger than they have 
               <br />
               their farms in Ontario, and therefore there 
               <br />
               are fewer settlers in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerent</span> school 
               <br />
               sections. Why is it that separate schools 
               <br />
               can never be worked out successfully in 
               <br />
               Manitoba and the Northwest Territories un- 
               <br />
               less it be in the villages and towns '? It is 
               <br />
               due to the fact that you have only four 
               <br />
               families to the mile and when you divide 
               <br />
               them, there are only two Catholic and two 
               <br />
               Protestant families. They are thus separ- 
               <br />
               ated and there is no support for the schools. 
               <br />
               The burden becomes too great. It is too 
               <br />
               onerous. If they get up schools at all they 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mast</span> hire inferior teachers because the 
               <br />
               salaries they pay must be very low and the 
               <br />
               result of this is a poor school and injustice 
               <br />
               to the children who get the only education 
               <br />
               they will ever get in such schools. I draw 
               <br />
               attention to this to show the conditions that 
               <br />
               exist in the Northwest Territories and I ask 
               <br />
               what justiﬁcation there is for the people and 
               <br />
               the clergy of the province of Quebec, where 
               <br />
               the conditions are entirely different, where 
               <br />
               the conditions are such as would enable them . 
               <br />
               to keep up separate schools, to insist that 
               <br />
               separate schools shall be enforced upon these 
               <br />
               people in the Northwest Territories ? In 
               <br />
               my judgment there is none. Are the people 
               <br />
               of Quebec capable of being the best judges ? 
               <br />
               They are far removed from the country. 
               <br />
               they know little about the conditions or 
               <br />
               otherwise I am sure very many‘ of them 
               <br />
               would take a different view of the matter.
