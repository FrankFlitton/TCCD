               door. It is near his own town where 
               <br />
               he lives. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:80,</span> you will see that the school sys- 
               <br />
               tem we have in the northwest Territories is 
               <br />
               absolutely satisfactory to the people there. I 
               <br />
               know the argument is made: Why not 
               <br />
               trust the people of the Northwest ? Well, 
               <br />
               I would be very glad to do that, because I 
               <br />
               think that they would not change the system 
               <br />
               we have. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Haultaiu</span> has stated that if 
               <br />
               he were a dictator to-morrow he would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> 
               <br />
               change the system. When Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               prepared his draft Bill what did he do ? 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain proposed in that draft Bill 
               <br />
               to give the Roman Catholic minority separ— 
               <br />
               ate schools as they existed under the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 and prior to 1892. He put that down- 
               <br />
               in plain black and white in his draft Bill, 
               <br />
               and no gentleman on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House can contradict the assertion. After 
               <br />
               preparing that Bill, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">H‘aultain</span> appealed 
               <br />
               to the country, and he was returned be- 
               <br />
               cause the people of. the Territories were 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with the school system. When Mr.. 
               <br />
               Haultaîn passed his ordinance in 1892, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> 
               <br />
               was not at all certain, (and other members 
               <br />
               of the legislature shared his uncertainty) 
               <br />
               that the passage of the ordinance did not ex— 
               <br />
               ceed his powers. However, the fact that 
               <br />
               the law of 1892 has since remained in force
