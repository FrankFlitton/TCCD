               <br />
               even in the 17th century, the explorers of 
               <br />

               Now, before I refer to the legislation of 
               <br />
               1871 and 1875, let me examine this section 
               <br />
               93 of the British North America Act. First 
               <br />
               of all, I would like to say that the right hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the government has been taunted 
               <br />
               by many hon. gentlemen opposite and by the 
               <br />
               Conservative press throughout the country, 
               <br />
               because, forsooth, he had given us a page 
               <br />
               of history in explaining to the House, as 
               <br />
               he did on the 21st February last, when he 
               <br />
               introduced this measure, how that clause 
               <br />
               came to be inserted in the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. Now, it is usual, when we 
               <br />
               have legislation of a somewhat complicated 
               <br />
               character, as this is, to go to the root of that 
               <br />
               legislation and to inquire under what cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances it was enacted. There is, there- 
               <br />
               fore, nothing extraordinary in the fact that 
               <br />
               the right hon. leader of the government 
               <br />
               should have explained the peculiar circum- 
               <br />
               stances under which that clause 93 was en-
