               it is to frame one. .We have had, as I have 
               <br />
               already said, from the Conservative mem- 
               <br />
               bers, the most vehement denunciation of 
               <br />
               these proposals. The leader of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition declared that the distribution of Al-

               anything to equal it in the United States.

               <br />

               other advantage; we approached the work 
               <br />
               with the simple desire to make a fair 
               <br />
               and equitable distribution on the basis of 
               <br />

               <br />
               crease of population to take place within 
               <br />
               the next few years. If hon. gentlemen will 
               <br />
               look at the map of this federal distribution, 
               <br />
               they will ﬁnd that there were ﬁve southern 
               <br />
               seats, as they may be called, south of the 
               <br />
               north line of township <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">34</span> between the 
               <br />
               Rocky Mountains and the elbow of the 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, being about north of Swift 
               <br />
               Current, and the line north of township 24 
               <br />
               from the elbow of the Saskatchewan to the 
               <br />
               Manitoba boundary line. And as there 
               <br />
               were ﬁve constituencies south of that line, 
               <br />
               so there were ﬁve to the north. I think 
               <br />
               every one will admit that that redistribu- 
               <br />
               tion was perfectly fair in a party sense. 
               <br />
               That being admitted, let us consider how it 
               <br />
               was as between the north and the south. 
               <br />
               We ﬁnd that in tWo western ridings of the 
               <br />
               north district there was a total of 11,000 
               <br />
               votes in November, as against 9,000 in the 
               <br />
               two ridings in the south district. So, there 
               <br />
               was no unfairness to the southern part of 
               <br />
               the country in that.

               Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY. I pointed out, when

               discussing this matter before. that the 
               <br />

               Mr. SCOTT. There were two constitu- 
               <br />
               encies in the western part Of the north dis- 
               <br />
               trict and two in the western part of the 
               <br />
               south district. And the division of 11,000 votes 
               <br />
               to the north and 9,000 to the south was 
               <br />
               certainly not unfair to the south. I think 
               <br />
               that it must be admitted that that redis- 
               <br />
               tribution as adjusted to the circumstances 
               <br />
               then known, was a fair and equitable dis- 
               <br />
               tribution. Now, as between the three 
               <br />
               north districts in the proposed province of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan and the three south districts 
               <br />
               in the same, there was a great disparity of 
               <br />
               votes on the 3rd of November last. Nobody 
               <br />
               expected anything else. Those who pre- 
               <br />
               pared this redistribution expected that there 
               <br />
               would be a larger vote in the three ridings 
               <br />
               of the south than in the three ridings of the 
               <br />
               north; and that expectation was realized. It 
               <br />
               was also expected that the population in the 
               <br />
               northern part would thenceforth increase 
               <br />
               very much more rapidly than that in the 
               <br />
               southern part. And if that expectation was 
               <br />
               reasonable two years ago, it is more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reason—</span> 
               <br />
               able now, because two lines of railway are 
               <br />
               now being constructed across the northern 
               <br />
