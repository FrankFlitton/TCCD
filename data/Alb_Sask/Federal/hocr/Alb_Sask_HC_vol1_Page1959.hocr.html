               Mr. LAMONT. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Qu’Appelle (Mr. Lake) has submitted to 
               <br />
               this House a mass of statistics which, per- 
               <br />
               haps, have satisﬁed his mind that he has a 
               <br />
               grievance against this redistribution. He 
               <br />
               has made a number of comparisons in order 
               <br />
               to show that the schedule submitted by the 
               <br />
               government works an injustice to the 
               <br />
               south as against the north. He does 
               <br />
               not complain that the government has 
               <br />
               made a gerrymander in the ordinary 
               <br />
               sense of the word—that is, that it 
               <br />
               has hived the Conservatives in the north in 
               <br />
               order to enable the surrounding districts 
               <br />
               to return Liberals. His whole complaint 
               <br />
               is against the representation given to the 
               <br />
               north as against that given to the south. 
               <br />
               And he has, as has already been stated, 
               <br />
               submitted a schedule of his own under

               Now, let us see where we stand in this 
               <br />
               matter and what are the conditions fronting 
               <br />
               us as a committee in distributing the dis- 
               <br />
               tricts of the province of Saskatchewan. We 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the Northwest Territories are divid- 
               <br />
               ed into two provinces, the dividing line be- 
               <br />
               ing the 4th meridian. In the province of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, there were, according to the 
               <br />
               territorial redistribution, twenty seats out of 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               . thirty-ﬁve in the territorial legislature. And 
               <br />
               we also ﬁnd that, according to this Bill, 
               <br />
               we are to give twenty-ﬁve seats to the new 
               <br />
               province of Saskatchewan. So, the task 
               <br />
               before us is to divide the province of Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan in such a way that it will have 
               <br />
               twenty-ﬁve seats distributed as fairly as pos- 
               <br />
               sible. My hon. friend (Mr. Lake) has made 
               <br />
               his comparisons as between the north and 
               <br />
               the south, and he has taken as his divid- 
               <br />
               ing line the line between the old districts 
               <br />
               of Saskatchewan and Alberta. Now, I pro- 
               <br />
               pose to make several comparisons between 
               <br />
               the north and the south, but I do not pro- 
               <br />
               pose to follow the line heretofore followed 
               <br />
               and take the district of Saskatchewan as 
               <br />
               the north and the district of Assiniboia as 
               <br />
               the south. It seems to me that that is a 
               <br />
               most unfair way to divide the two dis- 
               <br />
               tricts into north and south. I am going 
               <br />
               on another basis. I ﬁnd that in the Haul- 
               <br />
               tain redistribution of 1902 there were 
               <br />
               twenty seats in the new province of Sas— 
               <br />
               katchewan. My hon. friend from Qu’- 
               <br />
               Appelle (Mr. Lake) and the hon. member 
               <br />
               from Calgary (Mr. M. S. McCarthy) have

               the ten southern seats according to that 
               <br />
               redistribution and the ten northern seats, 
               <br />
               and then I will endeavour to ascertain into 
               <br />
               which of these districts—the ten northern 
               <br />
               seats or the ten southern seats— we ought 
               <br />
               to put a majority of the new seats which 
               <br />
               are to be given to the province of Saskat- 
               <br />
               chewan. We have ﬁve new seats to be 
               <br />
               added to the twenty under the Haultain 
               <br />
               redistribution, and the question, to my mind, 
               <br />
               is where should these seats be put in order 
               <br />
               to make a fair distribution. Now, if the 
               <br />
               ten northern seats show a vastly greater 
               <br />
               increase in population than do the ten south- 
               <br />
               ern seats, it is reasonable that the majority 
               <br />
               of the ﬁve should go to the north. If the 
               <br />
               ten southern seat-s show the greater 
               <br />
               increase of population, the bulk of the 
               <br />
               five seats should go to the south. 
               <br />
               ’i‘he ten southern seats areas follows: 
               <br />
               Souris, Caunington, Moosomin, Whitewood, 
               <br />
               Grenfell, Wolseley, South Qu’Appelle. South 
               <br />
               Regina, Moosejaw, and Maple Creek, 
               <br />
               I call these the ten southern seats 
               <br />
               for the following reason: They are the 
               <br />
               ten seats which touch the southern bound- 
               <br />
               ary line of the new province or are the 
               <br />
               nearest to it according to the Haultain dis- 
               <br />
               tribution. They correspond practically to 
               <br />
               the three southern seats of the federal redis- 
               <br />
               tribution of two years ago. Maple Greek, 
               <br />
               Moosejaw and South Regina are in the dis- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trict</span> represented by my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Western Assiniboia (Mr. Scott). The other 
               <br />
               districts correspond very closely to the dis- 
               <br />
               trict represented by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Qu’Appelle (Mr. Lake) and the hon. member 
               <br />
               for East Assiniboia (Mr. Turriff). The ten 
               <br />
               northern seats correspond very closely to 
               <br />
               the northern seats as laid down by the 
               <br />
               federal redistribution. Whatever difference 
               <br />
               there may be is in favour of the south. I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd the actual difference to be that there 
               <br />
               are 124 townships which should belong to 
               <br />
               the north that are included in the south in 
               <br />
               the eastern part of the territory, and 264 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">townships</span> that should belong to the south 
               <br />
               are included in the north in the western 
               <br />
               part of the territory. So that there are 
               <br />
               140 townships, according to that calculation 
               <br />
               in favour of the south. Now then the 
               <br />
               question is, do these ten southern districts 
               <br />
               show a larger increase of population since 
               <br />
               the Haultain redistribution than the ten 
               <br />
               northern seats. I have based my calcu- 
               <br />
               lation upon the census population of 1901 
               <br />
               and upon the homestead entries since, for 
               <br />
               notwithstanding what my hon. friend for 
               <br />
               Qu’Appelle (Mr. Lake) may say, it does seem 
               <br />
               to me that the homestead entries form one of 
               <br />
               the soundest bases on which to calculate po- 
               <br />
               pulation. Have there been more homestead 
               <br />
               entries since 1901 in the ten northern than 
               <br />
               in the 10 southern districts ? I ﬁnd the fol- 
               <br />
               lowing :
