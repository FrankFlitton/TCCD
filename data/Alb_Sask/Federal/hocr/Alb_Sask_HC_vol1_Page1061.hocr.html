               Now, while one has been waiting for

               antly evident that the methods by which 
               <br />
               these gentlemen reach their decision is just 
               <br />
               ' the ordinary mental process by which any 
               <br />
               one would reach a decision on such points. 
               <br />
               I say there is nothing mysterious, there is 
               <br />
               nothing that, when properly explained, a

               business man or a literary man who is ac- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               reach a decision upon although he could 
               <br />
               not put the argument with the skill of 
               <br />
               the lawyer. I ﬁnd, however, nothing un- 
               <br />
               usual in the manner in which they reach 
               <br />
               these decisions, and we have not found 
               <br />
               cases cited, or judgments or precedents 
               <br />
               cited. Acting in that way, and after listen- 
               <br />
               ing carefully to the debate, one naturally 
               <br />
               reaches conclusions of his own. Acting so 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Liar</span> as possible as a juror and not as an 
               <br />
               advocate, I must say that I cannot follow 
               <br />
               those who ﬁnd in section 2 of the Act of 
               <br />
               1871 plenary power to do any thing in 
               <br />
               making a constitution without having re- 
               <br />
               gard to the circumstances in that country. 
               <br />
               I cannot conceive that it is the intent and 
               <br />
               purpose, the spirit of the Act, that this 
               <br />
               parliament should be allowed entirely to 
               <br />
               abrogate the law of 1867, as they would 
               <br />
               be capable of doing, or that they should 
               <br />
               make any kind of a constitution different 
               <br />
               from that proposed by the Act of 1867. 
               <br />
               They might if possessed of plenary power 
               <br />
               establish an autocracy, they might make 
               <br />
               a government up there under one man. 
               <br />
               It has been said that there is some in- 
               <br />
               deﬁnite kind of an obligation, that the 
               <br />
               'constitution must be in some way ana— 
               <br />
               logous to that of other provinces. As you 
               <br />
               have plenary power, then you may do as 
               <br />
               you like, and if plenary power had been 
               <br />
               intended, I think it would have been put 
               <br />
               in very much more explicit language than 
               <br />
               it is put in this section. If it had been in— 
               <br />
               tended, it could have been put in such a 
               <br />
               way that we would not have required all 
               <br />
               this argument to prove it. For myself I 
               <br />
               have been unable to accept the reasoning 
               <br />
               of those who claim that section 2 of. the 
               <br />
               Act, 1871, gives this plenary power. If I 
               <br />
               could, I would not be at a loss as to my 
               <br />
               position on this question. If I felt that plen- 
               <br />
               ary power existed in section 2 of 
               <br />
               1871, I would heartily support the present 
               <br />
               Bill. But after looking at section 2 of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1871.</span>

               listening to all these arguments, considering

               <br />

               nection with 146 and 93, I feel it is utterly 
               <br />
               impossible for me to support that contention. 
               <br />
               It may be said that 146 does not give the 
               <br />
               power. It may be a question as towhether 
               <br />
               power that exists in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">146</span> has already 
               <br />
               been used. These also are questions that I 
               <br />
               would like very much if they had been re- 
               <br />
               ferred to the courts, andt hat a necessity 
               <br />
               did not exist for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">laymen</span> to endeavour to 
               <br />
               judge of them. We are asked also to con- 
               <br />
               sider whether 93 acts automatically. We 
               <br />
               ﬁnd the member for- Jacques Cartier <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Monk) declaring that it does; we ﬁnd others 
               <br />
               declaring to the contrary. I believe that 93, 
               <br />
               like any other class of machinery, works 
               <br />
               when you supply the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proper</span> material.“ You 
               <br />
               may invent a machine that Will put cloth-

               cases that you bring both the clothing and 
               <br />
               the man to the machine; 93 might act auto- 
               <br />
               matically in a special case. If 93 acts au- 
               <br />
               tomatically, why should we put it in the 
               <br />
               Bill? If it does not, I think the spirit of 
               <br />
               93 should control. It might be that a ref- 
               <br />
               erence to the courts would not satisfy all; 
               <br />
               but it would have the value that its deci- 
               <br />
               sion would be respected. If by such a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refer»</span> 
               <br />
               ence we found that greater privileges were 
               <br />
               due the minorities, then I am Willing for one 
               <br />
               leges should be given. I am willing for one 
               <br />
               to give all the privileges that the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion provides for. In considering this 
               <br />
               section there are certain principles that ap- 
               <br />
               pear to be stated rather strongly. and the 
               <br />
               decision on the main point will be guided 
               <br />
               by the degree of importance which you at- 
               <br />
               tach to one or other of these principles. 
               <br />
               Now, in looking at 93 I ﬁnd it provides for 
               <br />
               the exclusive right of legislating on educa- 
               <br />
               tion to the provinces, and also provides for 
               <br />
               the rights of minorities, with certain ex-

               I noticed that when the Minister of Agri-

               culture was speaking on that question he 
               <br />
               said that the preservation of the privileges

               will look at in different ways. To my mind 
               <br />
               the chief principle underlying section 93 is 
               <br />
               the exclusive right over education granted 
               <br />
               to the provinces, and that exclusive right is 
               <br />
               I think the real point at issue when pro- 
               <br />
               vinces enter the confederation. At all events 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that no other body has concurrent 
               <br />
               right with the provinces. It has been said 
               <br />
               that this is an exclusive right. It is possi- 
               <br />
               bly an exclusive right within a circuit, but 
               <br />
               no other power has a concurrent right to 
               <br />
