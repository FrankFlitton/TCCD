               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I will tell the hon. 
               <br />
               minister what my views are. I have taken 
               <br />
               the position, but there is no legislative com- 
               <br />
               pact or compact of any kind and I have 
               <br />
               stood by that. I have never argued when 
               <br />
               convenient that there is a compact and 
               <br />
               where it is otherwise that there is no 
               <br />
               compact, and I do not propose to do that. 
               <br />
               I say that if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Bill</span> of Rights constitutes 
               <br />
               a compact, then the Act of 1877 based upon 
               <br />
               it is as binding upon this parliament as the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 is binding upon it. That is my 
               <br />
               position and I would like the hon. minister 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> deﬁne his position now. He does not 
               <br />
               seem to be very anxious to do so.
