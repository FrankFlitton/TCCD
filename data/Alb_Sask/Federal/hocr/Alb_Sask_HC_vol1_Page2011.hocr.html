               by the hon. Minister of Justice, beside and‘

               above the written law, there is a consti-

               tutional doctrine, which it is difﬁcult to 
               <br />
               deﬁne, growing out of the gradual and 
               <br />
               reasoned carrying out of the very princi- 
               <br />
               ples embodied in the constitution. The Act 
               <br />
               of 1867 provided at the outset solely for 
               <br />
               the organization of the provinces then con- 
               <br />
               stitutional. Even before entering confeder— 
               <br />
               ation, these provinCes enjoyed self-govern- 
               <br />
               ment: they had their parliament. their 
               <br />
               oliicial tongue, their rules of parliamentary 
               <br />
               procedure. The idea did not occur to the 
               <br />
               fathers of confederation to alter that con— 
               <br />
               dition of things; but in establishing the 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament. they did so on a 
               <br />
               basis in harmony with the rights and 
               <br />
               traditions of the two elements which make 
               <br />
               up the Canadian nation; and that is why 
               <br />
               they provided that the French and English 
               <br />
               tongues would be, on equal terms, the 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial language of Canada. Later on, the 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament acquired those im- 
               <br />
               mense western territories out of which were 
               <br />
               carved the province of Manitoba and those 
               <br />
               of Alberta and Saskatchewan. These ter- 
               <br />
               ritories were acquired in the name and 
               <br />

               <br />
               they did not forget the rights of the French 
               <br />
               Canadian, people, they deemed it fair and 
               <br />
               reasonable that the two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> languages

               l'rime Minister has explained, the French

               Canadians were numerous enough at the

               the French language in Manitoba ; that rea-

               not at all the contention set forth by the

               Prime Minister. The right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               acknowledges the existence of the moral 
               <br />
               agreement entered into in 1870. But he 
               <br />
               suggests that its scope is limited to the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba and that it would not 
               <br />
               be possible to make it applicable to the 
               <br />
               other western provinces. I contend that
