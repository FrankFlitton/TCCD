               <br />
               The Minister of Finance in 1896, made a 
               <br />
               speech on this question that has been read

               He has swallowed that down. He has

               said: the King’s government must go on, 
               <br />

               <br />
               I think he will ﬁnd that he has gone back

               <br />
               in western Ontario today. I have the honour 
               <br />
               of belonging to a district in which there are 
               <br />
               two by-elections in sight, and I trust the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance will come there and 
               <br />
               deliver the speech which he delivered in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1h96</span> 
               <br />
               and the speech which he delivered just now, 
               <br />
               and let the people compare them and judge 
               <br />
               how he has stood by the rights of the ma- 
               <br />
               Jority of the people of this country. We 
               <br />
               hear a great deal about the rights of the 
               <br />
               minority. Have the majority no rights ? 
               <br />
               Have those rights been maintained or have 
               <br />
               they been bartered? I maintain that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance and the others who have 
               <br />
               made speeches of that character have de— 
               <br />
               liberately gone back on the rights of the 
               <br />
               majority in this country. It is due to them 
               <br />
               and to this House that the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice should give us a fair interpretation of 
               <br />
               the language contained in these two clauses. 
               <br />
               We are entitled to it. He said to the hon.

               member for Lincoln and Niagara (Mr. Lan-

               vote against a thing he does not under-

               had been down here within two or three

               <br />
               not do it too soon. He has counted the votes 
               <br />
               of members of this House on resolutions 
               <br />
               which they do not comprehend, and which 
               <br />
               he fails to explain. I say, and I believe it 
               <br />
               to be true, that when this government ap- 
               <br />
               peals to western Ontario, they will get an 
               <br />
               eye-opener; I believe they Will ﬁnd that

               though we are not great in numbers on this 
               <br />
               side of the House, we have a good many of 
               <br />
               the people of this country at our back. rI'he 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance lays great auction to his 
               <br />
               soul that the united following of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment is at his back. That is just where the 
               <br />
               weakness of his case lies. I have a better 
               <br />
               opinion of this side of the House than of the 
               <br />
               other; but I do not believe that all the con- 
               <br />
               science belongs to this side. If the members 
               <br />
               on the other side had voted with the same 
               <br />
               conscientious desire to do their duty as the 
               <br />
               members on this side of the House have 
               <br />
               done, not thirteen, but three times thirteen 
               <br />
               of them, would have voted against the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment on this question. Though they join 
               <br />
               hand in hand—you know the rest, Mr. lChair- 
               <br />
               man; and I tell you that hon. gentlemen op- 
               <br />
               posite willnot go unpunished. Their unity 
               <br />
               on this question will not save them. It has 
               <br />
               simply aggravated the situation. It informs 
               <br />
               the people of this country that there are a 
               <br />
               large number of men in the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons who are prepared to swallow their 
               <br />
               convictions for the sake of party. The Min-

               <br />
               with the government on this occasion. 
               <br />
               Where were the consciences of a large ma- 
               <br />
