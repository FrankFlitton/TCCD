               dare to say that we are coercing the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories ‘? I would say, 
               <br />
               Sir, that any argument which is designed to 
               <br />
               prove that we are dealing in this matter in 
               <br />
               the way ot‘ coercion is entirely unjustiﬁable. 
               <br />
               What is this law which we are going to 
               <br />
               conﬁrm and to continue in the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan ? We 
               <br />
               are told that this provides for a system 
               <br />
               of separate schools. Well, a system of 
               <br />
               separate schools may mean one thing in 
               <br />
               one quarter and another thing in another 
               <br />
               quarter. It is, in a measure, a system of 
               <br />
               separate schools. That expression in the 
               <br />
               minds of many people means a great deal. 
               <br />
               I do not think I am mistaken when I say 
               <br />
               that in the minds of a great many Protes- 
               <br />
               tant people in the country when you talk 
               <br />
               about separate schools they immediately un- 
               <br />
               derstand that youare talking about schools 
               <br />
               thatcome under the control of some religious

               body. and particularly schools which come 
               <br />
               under the control of the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               church. That is the common idea of sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools in many quarters. Whatever 
               <br />
               may be said as respects other countries, or 
               <br />
               other provinces, it would be utterly mis— 
               <br />
               taken to say that we are giving to the North— 
               <br />
               west Provinces separate schools in that 
               <br />
               sense of the words. I submit to this

               it has all the elements of a national school 
               <br />
               system then I say there is no principle in-

               volved in this discussion which would 
               <br />
               justify us in having a quarrel over it. What 
               <br />
               is this system ? One would suppose from 
               <br />
               the frequent references that are made to it 
               <br />
               that it is some iniquitous system, something 
               <br />
               which if continued would prejudice the inter— 
               <br />
               ests of the people in these Territories for all

               So far as the principle of separate schools

               is concerned, of course, that principle was to
