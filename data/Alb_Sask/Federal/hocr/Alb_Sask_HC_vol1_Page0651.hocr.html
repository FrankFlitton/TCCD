               <br />
               to the hon. member for Pictou (Mr. Mac-

               <br />
               it would be meaningless, absurd, and an in-

               conceivable thing that they should pass this

               absolutely as the property of the govern-

               cocl. Mr. Speaker, when you left the chair 
               <br />
               at six o‘clock I was directing the attention of 
               <br />
               the House to an important statement made 
               <br />
               by the Hon. Colin Campbell, the attorney 
               <br />
               general of the province of Manitoba, and 
               <br />
               I was pointing out that an unfortunate 
               <br />
               state of things had arisen, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">namely,</span> that the 
               <br />
               memory of the right hon. leader of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment conﬂicted with the memory of the 
               <br />
               two members of the cabinet of the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba on several important matters. 
               <br />
               I was intending to pursue the matter a 
               <br />
               little further and to point out some other 
               <br />
               circumstances in the same line. But I have 
               <br />
               probably said enough to direct the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">atten—</span> 
               <br />
               tion of the House to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact</span> that it 
               <br />
               is not after all so much a question 
               <br />
               of defective memory, as of the fact 
               <br />
               that the government has so conducted 
               <br />
               this business, both in the House and 
               <br />

               of a serious conﬂict, not only between the
