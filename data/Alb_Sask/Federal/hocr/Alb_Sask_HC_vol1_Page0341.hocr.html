               would bring into operation section 93 of

               <br />
               it could have any application to the Ter-

               necessity or justiﬁcation for section 16. That

               section 2 of the proposed Bill brings into

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BELCOURT.</span> It is rather immaterial 
               <br />
               to me whether the provisions of section 93 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act apply 
               <br />
               automatically or mechanically, or Whether 
               <br />
               the enactment of a clause like clause 2 is 
               <br />
               necessary to make them applicable. It is 
               <br />
               rather unimportant to me whether that is 
               <br />
               done by virtue of the Act itself, or whether 
               <br />
               the duty is imposed upon this parliament 
               <br />
               when creating provinces to say that those 
               <br />
               provisions shall apply. But I am not pre- 
               <br />
               pared to say that my hon. friend is not 
               <br />
               right. It may be that the provisions of 
               <br />
               section 93 apply, as he says, automatically 
               <br />
               or mechanically; and I must say that I 
               <br />
               am inclined to believe they do. or course, 
               <br />
               he and I disagree altogether as to the time 
               <br />
               when in this case the application is to be 
               <br />
               made. He goes back to the time of the 
               <br />
               entrance of these Territories into confeder— 
               <br />
               ation, in 1870, and in order to do that he 
               <br />
               has to read into section 93 the word ‘Ter- 
               <br />
               ritory,’ which I do not ﬁnd there. I say that 
               <br />
               the provisions of section 93 apply at the 
               <br />
               time of the entrance of the province as a 
               <br />
               province.

               <br />
               be seriously argued that section 93 was 
               <br />
               framed for the purposes of Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec only, and that its provisions are 
               <br />
               to be applied only to Quebec and Ontario. 
               <br />
               It is true that subsection 2 of section 93 
               <br />
               covers the case of Quebec and Ontario, 
               <br />
               that it was framed for that purpose, and 
               <br />
               that it protects the rights of the minorities 
               <br />
               in Quebec and Ontario only. But then I 
               <br />
               would like to ask, if it was intended by the 
               <br />
               general provisions of section 93 to protect 
               <br />

               or Protestant, only in Ontario and Quebec, 
               <br />
