               courtesy of the 11011. the ex-Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance (Mr. Foster) to be favoured with a seat 
               <br />
               in the gallery in this House on the 13th of 
               <br />
               March, 1896. That was about the closing 
               <br />
               hours of the dark days of Tory misrule and 
               <br />
               it was my great pleasure to listen to the 
               <br />
               speech delivered by that hon. gentleman on 
               <br />
               the school question on that occasion, prob- 
               <br />
               ably one of the best speeches ever known 
               <br />
               to be delivered by that hon. gentleman in 
               <br />
               this House or out of it. As I sat there and 
               <br />
               listened to the burning words of eloquence 
               <br />
               that fell from the lips of that distinguished 
               <br />
               statesman, to his beautifully rounded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eng—</span> 
               <br />
               lish phrases with an occasional dash of sar- 
               <br />
               casm thrown in, I felt that he had made the 
               <br />
               speech of that evening, and I would like with 
               <br />
               his permission to quote very brieﬂy from 
               <br />
               it. Reading that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speeches</span> I have done 
               <br />
               on several occasions since this debate com- 
               <br />
               menced and comparing it with the one 
               <br />
               which the hon. gentleman delivered a few
