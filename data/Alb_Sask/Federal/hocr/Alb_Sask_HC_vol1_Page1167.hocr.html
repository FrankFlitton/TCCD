               people in Ontario who are denounced here

               ciples of Britain’s greatness, namely, reli-

               gious freedom, civil equality, no church and 
               <br />
               state, a national system of education—I 
               <br />
               say, is such a man, such a Canadian to be 
               <br />
               stigmatized in a Canadian House of Com— 
               <br />
               mons as we in the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               have been stigmatized here? Is it a sin. 
               <br />
               is it a crime, to hold views of this kind? 
               <br />
               As far as I can gather from the speeches 
               <br />
               which have been made and the criticisms 
               <br />
               which have been passed upon the news- 
               <br />
               papers which try to voice the opinion of 
               <br />
               Toronto and Ontario, it is a crime in the 
               <br />
               opinion of those who thus stigmatize us. 
               <br />
               Consider these newspapers of Toronto that 
               <br />
               have been criticised as so illiberal. There 
               <br />
               are ﬁve newspapers in Toronto that are 
               <br />
               trying to voice the sentiments of the people 
               <br />
               of Ontario, and I think that they are doing 
               <br />
               it. There is just one newspaper there that 
               <br />
               is supporting the government and that de-

               Any little reﬁnement, any little education

               they had, they got from France, they often

               went to that country. They were J <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acobites.</span> 
               <br />
               they had been all through the wars of Scot-

               land in connection with the Jacobite inter-

               <br />
               broken up, and our people drifted south. For

               ﬁfty years or so they were located around

               Glasgow, and early in the last century both 
               <br />
               sides of my house came to this country and 
               <br />
               took up land. If there is anything I am 
               <br />
               proud of it is to be able to say that that land 
               <br />
               they took up nearly 75 years ago is still in 
               <br />
               the hands of some of them. Five genera-

               <br />
               I happened to be Celtic and highland Scotch, 
               <br />
               and that my ancestors spoke Gaelic and 
               <br />
               could speak nothing else, I am to—day a 
               <br />
               Canadian and nothing but a Canadian. 
               <br />
               These recollections of the past are only a 
               <br />
               romaulic reverie, a reminiscence to me, 
               <br />
               for to-day <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> am a Canadian and no- 
               <br />
               thing but a Canadian. There is only 
               <br />
               one thing that I concede to the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Labelle as having an advantage 
               <br />
               over me, and that is that his people were 
               <br />
               here a little longer than mine. I do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> 
               <br />
               the French Canadian people credit for this. 
               <br />
               that they are sons of the soil, they are 
               <br />
               autochthonous, as the Greeks used the term. 
               <br />
               they are sprung from the soil, and they are 
               <br />
               proud of it. So am I. I have no other 
               <br />
               loyalty, in the highest sense of the term. 
               <br />
               to any other country than Canada. I agree 
               <br />
               with all my hon. friend from Labelle has 
               <br />
               said in that respect—he is a son of the soil, 
               <br />
               the French Canadians are sons of the soil. 
               <br />
               But, Sir, so are three—quarters, if not a mil- 
               <br />
               lion of the descendants of the old highland 
               <br />
               Scotch people who came to this country. 
               <br />
               they to-day are sons of the soil. Now if we 
               <br />
               are sons of the soil, whether we are of 
               <br />
               Scotch origin or of French origin, we are al— 
               <br />
               so brothers of the soil. and if we are brothers 
               <br />
