               Now, subsection 3 of the original clause 
               <br />
               speciﬁcally mentions the Dominion Lands 
               <br />
               Act, and there was a great outcry through- 
               <br />
               out the country with reference to that. Sub- 
               <br />
               section 2 of the substituted clause, although 
               <br />
               it does not mention that speciﬁcally, cer- 
               <br />
               tainly includes it, and the separate schools 
               <br />
               will be entitled under it to their share of 
               <br />
               any moneys which are appropriated or dis- 
               <br />
               tributed by this government. If, therefore, 
               <br />
               there were objections to the original clause 
               <br />
               16, the same objections certainly exist to 
               <br />
               the substituted clause, because there is no 
               <br />
               difference between them. If there is any 
               <br />
               difference, I would say that it is in the direc— 
               <br />
               tion of extending the rights and privileges 
               <br />
               guaranteed to the minority in the Northwest, 
               <br />
               because, although i do not intend at this 
               <br />
               late hour to refer to the different provisions 
               <br />
               of those ordinances, there are other provis- 
               <br />
               ions giving the minorities in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories certain rights. For instance, there 
               <br />
               is a provision with reference to the educa- 
               <br />
               tional council, that that council. which is 
               <br />
               composed of ﬁve members, must always 
               <br />
               contain two members of the Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lic religion. There is no provision that the 
               <br />
               other three members <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must</span> be men of the 
               <br />
               Protestant faith. All ﬁve may be Catholic, 
               <br />
               and two of them must be, but there is no 
               <br />
               provision that the other three must be Pro- 
               <br />
               testants. So that there is a right in that 
               <br />
               ordinance which will be included in the sub- 
               <br />

               duty as the emissary of His Holiness in this

               reference to the matter, is not of him or of 
               <br />
               the church he represents, but of the Prime

               —Roman Catholic and Protestant alike—and

               capacity, to know no creed, has violated his

               <br />
               wholly foreign to our system of government.

               The people of this country have a right to

               seems himself to have forgotten his lofty, 
               <br />
               high-sounding professions of 1896 when, as
