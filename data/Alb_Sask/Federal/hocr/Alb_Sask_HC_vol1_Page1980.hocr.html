               It is 25 years ago that these words were

               uttered <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> this House with rare prophetic 
               <br />
               insight. I have quoted them here to estab-

               lish my proposition that section 23 invol- 
               <br />
               ves a limitation upon provincial autonomy 
               <br />
               of no trivia] character. I trust that I have 
               <br />
               said enough now to show the House clearly 
               <br />
               my own position in the matter in its re- 
               <br />
               lation to the Autonomy Bills and as well 
               <br />
               the intrinsic importance of the subject. I 
               <br />
               propose next to show particularly why I 
               <br />
               think my' amendment should be adopted. 
               <br />
               Probably it is not necessary for me at this 
               <br />
               stage to say that I am not proposing re- 
               <br />
               pudiation. I am not proposing to take away 
               <br />
               from the company any of its contract rights. 
               <br />
               I stand in that regard just as my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Qu’Aippelle (Mr. Lake) who 
               <br />
               when referring to this subject some weeks 
               <br />
               ago said that no right thinking person would 
               <br />
               propose to deprive this company of any 
               <br />
               rights which the parliament and people of 
               <br />
               Canada 25 years ago with their eyes open 
               <br />
               gave to them. I admit, as any right- 
               <br />
               thinking person must admit, that the 
               <br />
               contract must be respected. But I ask, 
               <br />
               whose was the contract ? Was it not a con- 
               <br />
               tract made between the Dominion of Can- 
               <br />
               ada and the company ? The Canadian Paci- 
               <br />
               ﬁc Railway was and is a federal under- 
               <br />
               taking. These exemptions were and are a 
               <br />
               part of the cost of the undertaking. Then, 
               <br />
               why shift part of such cost price upon these 
               <br />
               new provinces more than upon the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Nova Scotia or any of the other 
               <br />
               provinces of the Dominion ? The new pro— 
               <br />
               vinces are, without these exemptions, bear- 
               <br />
               ing their fair share of the undertaking with 
               <br />
               the other provinces of Canada. Then, why 
               <br />
               place them under a double burden? Let 
               <br />
               me quote a little further from the debates 
               <br />
               of 1881, when the contract was ﬁrst before 
               <br />
               parliament. I will quote from a gentleman 
               <br />
