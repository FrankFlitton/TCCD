               der provincial Acts of Ontario. They prac- 
               <br />
               tically did the work very largely for the 
               <br />

               <br />
               and in the province of Quebec, and I think

               the Northwest Territories. There was, how- 
               <br />
               ever, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'a</span> very strong movement on the part 
               <br />
               of the people of Manitoba and the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories for the formation of more 
               <br />
               associations of this kind, and it is largely 
               <br />
               due to this movement that the request came 
               <br />
               for the nationalization of the records. The 
               <br />
               object of this nationalization is to simplify 
               <br />
               the records. If we were to have in Canada 
               <br />
               a registration for, we will say, pure bred 
               <br />
               Ayrshire cattle in Toronto, another in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia or New Brunswick, and another 
               <br />
               in Manitoba or British Columbia, it would 
               <br />
               be obvious that there would be a great deal 
               <br />
               of confusion, and it would work to the detri— 
               <br />
               ment of the breed. Anybody purchasing a 
               <br />
               thoroughbred animal would hardly know in 
               <br />
               what record to look for its pedigree, and he 
               <br />
               would hardly know whether the certiﬁcates 
               <br />
               ’ given by each and every one of these asso- 
               <br />
               ciation-s had the same and equal value. 
               <br />
               Therefore, it was found by the live stock 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.men</span> that the point had been reached when 
               <br />
               it would be extremely important that these 
               <br />
               records should be made national in their 
               <br />
               character and should be under the same 
               <br />
               supervision and control.

               When this matter was presented to me I 
               <br />
               felt that there were two points to be very 
               <br />
               carefully considered. The ﬁrst was that the 
               <br />
               live stock men themselves who had been 
               <br />
               managing this work, in the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario especially, extremely well, should con- 
               <br />
               tinue to manage the work, that there should 
               <br />
               be no interference with the business of the 
               <br />
               association on the part <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> any government 
               <br />
               ofﬁcials or on the part of the department, but 
               <br />
               that the work must be carried on by the 
               <br />
               men who were interested in it and who had 
               <br />
               succeeded in the past in doing it very well. 
               <br />
               The only question was as to the representa- 
               <br />
               tion of people all over the country in that 
               <br />
               work, instead of it being local in its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">char.</span> 
               <br />
               acter. Then came the question of aﬂixing 
               <br />
               an oﬂicial stamp to the certiﬁcate, and I 
               <br />
               felt it was rather a delicate point to take 
               <br />
               up. 'If there were an ofﬁcial stamp <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afﬁxed</span> 
               <br />
               to the certiﬁcate of pedigree, it could only 
               <br />
               be of any value when it was afﬁxed after 
               <br />
               consideration and investigation to see that 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lääîgree</span> was correct.

               <br />
               hon. friend (Mr. .Sproule) was speaking to

               the leader of the opposition and was not 
               <br />
               listening to what I said. I did not say 
               <br />
               that the record must be of value, but that 
               <br />
               the afﬁxing of the stamp to be valuable 
               <br />
               must be done after supervision and inspec- 
               <br />
               tion to see that it was correct. I said 
               <br />
               therefore, that for this purpose it would be 
               <br />
               necessary that the proper ofﬁcials of the 
               <br />
               department must have a certain supervi- 
               <br />
               sion and right of inspection of the records 
               <br />
               or otherwise the aﬂixing of the stamp would 
               <br />
               be purely perfunctory and would carry with 
               <br />
               it no value. I ﬁnd that under the present 
               <br />
               law, chapter 33 statutes of 1900, there is no 
               <br />

               <br />

               culture will aﬂix this seal. This safeguards 
               <br />
               the association; safeguards the interests of 
               <br />
               the live stock men and secures that there 
               <br />
               should be no interference on the part of 
               <br />
               the department except at the request of the 
               <br />
               association concerned. The work of na- 
               <br />
               tionalizing the records has been carried on. 
               <br />
               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diderent</span> record associations at present 
               <br />
               existing and incorporated under this Act 
               <br />
               have passed resolutions requesting that 
               <br />
               they should be given house room in the 
               <br />
               department here; that their records should 
               <br />
               be transferred to Ottawa and maintained 
               <br />
               here, and that the department should aﬂix 
               <br />
               this seal to their records. For this purpose 
               <br />
               there must be a certain amount of co-oper- 
               <br />
               ation and combined work on the part of 
               <br />
               the different associations. Each association 
               <br />
               will still absolutely controlits own particu- 
               <br />
               lar business, but when there are some ten or 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen or twenty different associations all 
               <br />
               working under one organization there will 
               <br />
               be some work which is common to all, and 
               <br />
               which they can better do as a united or- 
               <br />
               ganization than by each working separately 
               <br />
               and disjointedly. In the present Act there 
               <br />
               does not seem to be any authority for these 
               <br />
               associations to work in conjunction with 
               <br />
               other associations for a common object. I 
               <br />
               therefore desire, for the purpose of the new 
               <br />
