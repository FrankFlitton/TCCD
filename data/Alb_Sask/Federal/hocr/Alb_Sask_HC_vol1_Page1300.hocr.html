               has occurred to the Minister of Justice that 
               <br />

               <br />

               already forming part of the Dominion from 
               <br />

               such as that contained in the Act of 
               <br />
               1871. In respect of all these matters I 
               <br />
               think we ought to have a little discussion. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend the Minister of Justice will 
               <br />
               have observed that a great many theories 
               <br />
               have been put forward by hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               on that side who are learned in the profes- 
               <br />
               sion of the law, as to the meaning and 
               <br />
               effect of section 2. I have understood 
               <br />
               several very eminent gentlemen on that 
               <br />
               side to argue that section 2, standing 
               <br />
               alone, would bring into force in the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories the clerical schools which my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               opposed so vigorously with the assistance of 
               <br />
               the First Minister and I think of the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice as well in 1896. These gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen, both in construing that section and 
               <br />
               also in construing the amendment which I 
               <br />
               had the honour of offering to the House, 
               <br />
               have taken that position; and I think that 
               <br />
               the arguments made in that regard, and to 
               <br />
               which I propose to give a little attention 
               <br />
               before we get through with clause 2, are 
               <br />
               worthy of consideration by the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice. I can give him reference to them 
               <br />
               if he proposes to speak to-morrow as I 
               <br />
               took a little note of them as we went along. 
               <br />
               We could hardly get through section 2thls 
               <br />
               evening and the Minister of Justice will 
               <br />
               possibly to-morrow afternoon he prepared 
               <br />
               to give his views on this matter.

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">FlITZPATRICK.</span> I do not think I 
               <br />
               could do so this evening, but I would like 
               <br />
               to say immediately that I do not concur 
               <br />
               in the opinion of Mr. Clements that the 
               <br />
               British North America Act applies automa- 
               <br />
               tically to these new provinces. My object 
               <br />
               in quoting Mr. Clements’ Opinion was merely 
               <br />
               to show that he agreed entirely in What 
               <br />
               was said by the Hon. George Brown and 
               <br />
               Mr. Dalton McCarthy to the effect that if 
               <br />
               the separate schools were continued in any 
               <br />
               province until such time as it came into 
               <br />
               confederation, that system would be per- 
               <br />
               petuated. I gave that as one of the many 
               <br />
               opinions expressed on the matter, some of 
               <br />
               which may be worth a great deal and others 
               <br />
               very little. I think myself perhaps the better 
               <br />
               plan would be to allow this section to re- 
               <br />
               main over to be discussed with clause 16, 
               <br />
               as it may be moved in committee. I am 
               <br />
               quite prepared to deal with it now, but per- 
               <br />
               haps it may be as well to hold it over until 
               <br />
               then. A great deal may be said in support 
               <br />
               of the View that this clause will bring into 
               <br />
               operation section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. My diﬂiculty was in respect 
               <br />
               of the words used in that section and the 
               <br />
               doubts that might arise about these words 
               <br />
               ‘provinces’ and ‘ at the time of the union.’ 
               <br />
               It is for that reason I thought it would be 
               <br />
               well to make a standing enactment in re- 
               <br />
               gard to the separate school clause, but I am 
               <br />
               penfectly willing to allow the matter to 
               <br />
