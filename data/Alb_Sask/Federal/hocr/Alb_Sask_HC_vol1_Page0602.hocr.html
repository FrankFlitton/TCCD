               are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disunited'</span> on this Bill. And, Sir,

               to be discussed before the people, as it will

               to-day where they have ever stood. They 
               <br />
               stood on the principle ot“ ruling this country

               <br />

               <br />
               been no departure. There was an attempt 
               <br />
               made by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conservative</span> party in 1890 to 
               <br />
               have this parliament enact a law which 
               <br />
               would override a law passed by a province 
               <br />
               which had the power to pass that law. 
               <br />
               They say that the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               who leads the government threw himself 
               <br />
               across the path and prevented it. Yes, 
               <br />
               because he said that the only way to accom- 
               <br />
               plish that was to accomplish it through the 
               <br />
               action of the local government which had 
               <br />
               the power under the constitution. as had 
               <br />
               been declared by the highest count in. _the 
               <br />
               empire. But, Sir, is that the case of the 
               <br />
               Territories ? Is that the case of this Bill ? 
               <br />
               Are we seeking to override the law of the 
               <br />
               Territories, making them take something 
               <br />
               they do not want? We are simply continu- 
               <br />
               ing what the government and the legislature 
               <br />
               of the Territories enacted as their school 
               <br />
               law, and which their premier says, if he 
               <br />
               were a dictator to-morrow, he would not 
               <br />
               rescind or abrogate. Sir, where is the prin—

               ciple of provincial rights in this? Yes, the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attempt</span> was made to have the country

               conﬁdence in him. They speak about what

               he did in 1896. They unearthed the docu-

               <br />

               times, a French Prime Minister? What

               of the House who have come in here that 
               <br />
               I was here when the Liberal party lost the 
               <br />
               services of Edward Blake. It became a 
               <br />
               question who was to lead us. We were 
               <br />
               in opposition and a small minority too. 
               <br />
               There was one man amongst us who stood 
               <br />
               preeminent above all others, known and 
               <br />
               admitted, and of course the choice fell on 
               <br />
               him. He was asked to accept. He hesi- 
               <br />
               tated; no, he refused at ﬁrst. Pressure was 
               <br />
               brought to bear upon him. I remember his 
               <br />
               reply: No, I am one of the minority in race 
               <br />
               and one of the minority in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">faith;</span> I think
