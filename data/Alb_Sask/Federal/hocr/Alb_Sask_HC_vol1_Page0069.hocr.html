               <br />
               parliament as the measure of a united 
               <br />
               government when he knew that his two 
               <br />
               most important ministers were diametri- 
               <br />
               cally opposed to one of the principal 
               <br />
               clauses in that Bill, and had placed them-

               selves on record as irrevocably pledged 
               <br />
               against it time and again ? Was not that 
               <br />
               somewhat peculiar? One by one the pre— 
               <br />
               tenses of the right hon. gentleman have 
               <br />
               been struck from him, and by this time he 
               <br />
               stands before this House and country 
               <br />
               pretty bare. He is no longer the some- 
               <br />
               what picturesque object he was a few 
               <br />
               months ago. Shorn of his feathers and 
               <br />
               his beautiful colours, he is coming to be 
               <br />
               known more and more for what he is and 
               <br />
               what he has proved himself. If in 1896, 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend secured any popu- 
               <br />
               larity among the staunch stalwart Lib- 
               <br />
               erals of this country, he secured it solely 
               <br />
               because he then made himself the cham- 
               <br />
               pion of provincial rights. And if to-day 
               <br />
               he has forfeited the respect, esteem and 
               <br />
               conﬁdence of thousands and tens of thou- 
               <br />
               sands in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country;</span> as he has, it is be- 
               <br />
               cause he has at last come out in his true 
               <br />
               colours as being the opponent and not the 
               <br />
               champion of provincial rights. It is be- 
               <br />
               cause he has reversed his position. The 
               <br />
               position of 1896' was apparently a brave 
               <br />
               one. That of 1905 is an entirely dif- 
               <br />
               ferent one, and to it is due the loss 
               <br />
               of respect and conﬁdence of which the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman and his colleagues 
               <br />
               are only too well aware. The speech 
               <br />
               which he delivered in this House not 
               <br />
               two weeks ago abounded in pretense 
               <br />
               and assumption, but when the facts come 
               <br />
               to be known these are stripped from it 
               <br />
               one after the other. He declared that he 
               <br />
               was about to put the crown of complete 
               <br />
               and absolute autonomy on these western 
               <br />
               territories, and all his people behind him 
               <br />
               cried out amen, and rent the air with their 
               <br />
               plaudits. But ﬁve minutes after any one

               the plea of the right hon. gentleman ? It 
               <br />
               was that he wanted to consult the people

               The records show it. The whole course 
               <br />
               of the administration shows it. It was 
               <br />
               so in our time; the people from the 
               <br />
               outside get to the inside of the cabinet 
               <br />
               through an accredited member of it. It is 
               <br />
               more so now, because, at the instigation of 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend himself, the govern- 
               <br />
               ment have enlarged and strengthened the 
               <br />
               functions of the cabinet minister. Not only 
               <br />
               have they made each a cabinet minister as 
               <br />
