               more about it than I do. But here is the 
               <br />
               question that appeals to my mind. If for 
               <br />
               centuries past the education of the French 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> has been under the wing of the 
               <br />
               church and the church has directed it and 
               <br />
               worked into it its religious tenets and dog- 
               <br />
               ma, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lit</span> has resulted in giving them an 
               <br />
               uneducated people. I was told by a 
               <br />
               Frenchman a short time ago that France 
               <br />
               is a nation of atheists to-day. I was 
               <br />
               told that by a Frenchman who ought 
               <br />
               to know. And, if that is What has been 
               <br />
               accomplished with full control of edu- 
               <br />
               cation in the hands of the church—if it 
               <br />
               means the turning out of a nation of illiter- 
               <br />
               ates and atheists, then surely, it is not amiss 
               <br />
               to place education wholly beyond the con- 
               <br />
               trol of the church. Is not that one of the 
               <br />
               strongest arguments that could be found in 
               <br />
               favour of that course ? And that is the 
               <br />
               very reason that France is following that 
               <br />
               course to-day. President Loubet declares 
               <br />
               that it is proper and right, and that France 
               <br />
               must do it. And if we try to keep education 
               <br />
               flee from the control of the same church, 
               <br />
               is it to be said that we are fanatics? I can-

               subjects. I admire their zeal, their piety 
               <br />
               and their attachment to their church. No 
               <br />
               one admires these things more than I do. 
               <br />
               No one is less disposed to deprive them of 
               <br />
               their rights than I am. But, because I 
               <br />
               believe that, forty years ago we discarded 
               <br />
               a bad system of education and adopted a 
               <br />
               better one; and because I believe that we 
               <br />
               ought to carry out in the interests of the 
               <br />
               rising generation, keeping the system free 
               <br />
               from the control of any church, am I to be 
               <br />
               accused of fanaticism ? I have just said 
               <br />
               if you grant church schools at all, to be 
               <br />
               logical you cannot conﬁne that privilege to 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholic church; you must 
               <br />
               grant them to every other denomination as 
               <br />
               well.
