               Sir Wilfrid Laurier spoke of making this city 
               <br />
               the ‘Washington of the north.’ Now, this is 
               <br />
               what they had to do in the 'Washiugton of the 
               <br />
               south,’ and which shows the regard they have 
               <br />
               for bitulithic pavements. Of the 960,000 square 
               <br />
               yards laid, the record showed but 269,000 re- 
               <br />
               maining on July 1, 1900, and that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">631,000</span> square 
               <br />
               yards had been re-surfaced with asphalt, and 
               <br />
               in 1901, $26,000 were spent for re-surfacing 
               <br />
               about 12,000 yards. A few years ago the War- 
               <br />
               rens were laying asphalt pavements, and this 
               <br />
               is what they had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> say at the time of their 
               <br />
               new patented monopoly: When coal-tar is ex— 
               <br />
               posed to the varying conditions of the weather, 
               <br />
               as it is in pavements, the volatile oils slowly 
               <br />
               evaporate, leaving a coke which is friable and 
               <br />
               which rapidly crumbling, less oil is distilled 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the tar in its preparation, the pavement 
               <br />
               when laid is too sot-t in summer and lacks the 
               <br />
               essential quality of ﬁrmness. A <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long-(lived</span> coal- 
               <br />
               tar pavement has three phases of condition: (a) 
               <br />
               When ﬁrst laid it is soft in hot weather; it then 
               <br />
               (b) gradually loses the softening o_il by exposure 
               <br />
               to the weather, and for a short period is quite 
               <br />
               acceptable; but it soon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'(c)</span> loses all the oils 
               <br />
               and becomes friable, as already explained. 
               <br />
               Coal-tar is sensitive to changes of temperature, 
               <br />
               and as a pavement, gets hot enough to become 
               <br />
               soft under our summer sun. It is impracticable 
               <br />
               to combine in a tar pavement the qualities ot 
               <br />
               ﬁrmness in summer and plasticity in winter.
