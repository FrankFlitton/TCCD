               <br />
               we paid our own taxes, we paid not one

               cent of taxes to any other school, and the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic majority left us absolutely

               free to do just as we liked. I don’t forget

               member for west Assiniboia has pointed out

               that when the Act of 1875 was passed in this 
               <br />
               parliament its intention was as much to pro- 
               <br />
               tect Protestants as to protect Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lics,</span> because at that date nobody knew 
               <br />
               Whether the majority in the Northwest was 
               <br />
               going to be Protestant or going to be Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic. And, because the Protestants now 
               <br />
               happen to be in the majority, are we going 
               <br />
               to deprive the Roman Catholic minority of 
               <br />
               the protection which the federal parliament 
               <br />
               in its wisdom gave to the minority? A1- 
               <br />
               though the Act of 1875 was passed by a 
               <br />
               Liberal government it was assented to un-

               <br />
               is this that cannot be denied: that from 
               <br />
               1875 to the present day the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               minority have had the right to have separate 
               <br />
               schools in the Territories. I believe that their

               people of the Northwest Territories though 
               <br />
               I claim that we do, I make this proposition 
               <br />
               to them. The Hon. Mr. Haultain is working

               in unison with them, is trying to help them 
               <br />
               out in every way, is doing his utmost to 
               <br />
               make this a party question in the Northwest.
