               <br />
               wide discussion and agitation which are tak- 
               <br />
               ing place to-day, that when this Act of 1875 
               <br />
               was passed, there was practically no dis- 
               <br />
               cussion of it in this House. There was 
               <br />
               certainly no adverse discussion. It is re— 
               <br />
               markable that the parliament of Canada 
               <br />
               passed that clause and put it upon the 
               <br />
               statute—book by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unanimouswote</span> of the 
               <br />
               House of Commons. Again I say I do not 
               <br />
               for a moment contend, and I do not under- 
               <br />
               stand that my right hon. friend contended, 
               <br />
               that, as a matter of constitutional right 
               <br />
               ﬁxed by the words of the statute, we are 
               <br />
               obliged to re-enact that clause. 1 go further. 
               <br />
               I do not hesitate to say that in my View, at 
               <br />
               any time since 1875, it'was within the power 
               <br />
               —I do not say the moral right—but un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly within the power of this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment to repeal the Act of 1875. Therefore, 
               <br />
               I am not claiming that there is any binding 
               <br />
               legal obligation, but I do say that we are 
               <br />
               obliged to look carefully into the circum- 
               <br />
               stances under which that Act was passed; 
               <br />
               and if we ﬁnd that at the time it was regard- 
               <br />
               ed by its friends and supporters, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parlia&lt;</span>

               ment generally, as an Act which was pass- 
               <br />
               ed, not only for the present but the future, 
               <br />
               that creates a moral obligation which this 
               <br />
               House may well take into consideration. 
               <br />
               The Bill was introduced in 1875 and carried 
               <br />
               with practically no opposition. It is worth 
               <br />
               while remembering that the government 
               <br />
               of the late Mr. Mackenzie was then 
               <br />
               in power. The Bill, as ﬁrst introduced, did 
               <br />
               not contain any provision respecting educa— 
               <br />
               tion. Attention was drawn to that omission, 
               <br />
               and a provision was made a little later. 
               <br />
               The chief speaker on that occasion was the 
               <br />
               Hon. Edward Blake—a very eminent mem- 
               <br />

               Protestantism. I believe, is beyond ques—

               <br />
               said :

               as now Secretary of State, who was in 
               <br />
               charge of the Bill. Whatever he said might 
               <br />
               fairly be assumed to express the view of

               the government of the day, the View of Hon. 
               <br />
               Alexander Mackenzie and his colleagues.

               Mr. Scott in the course of the discussion 
               <br />
               said :—

               Any gentleman would have to admit that it 
               <br />
               was the greatest possible relief to the people 
               <br />
               of Ontario that this question was settled for 
               <br />
               them, and was not, as in some of the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, a source of constant discord. He was 
               <br />
               one of those who maintained that parents had 
               <br />
               a right to educate their children as they 
               <br />
               pleased, and that they ought not to be taxed to 
               <br />
               maintain schools to which they could not con- 
               <br />
               scientiously send their children. Our whole sys- 
               <br />
               tem of government was based upon that sound 
               <br />
               principle, and how long could we have happi- 
               <br />
               ness and peace in this country if we were to 
               <br />
               abolish that safeguard, which was now recog- 
               <br />
               nized in both the large provinces ? Would not 
               <br />
               every gentleman in this chamber gladly see the 
               <br />
               New Brunswick trouble removed ? Now was 
               <br />
               the proper time to establish in the new terri- 
               <br />
               tory a principle that ought years ago to have 
               <br />
               been established in this Dominion.
