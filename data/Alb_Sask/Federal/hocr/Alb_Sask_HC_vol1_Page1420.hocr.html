               tO-night were no doubt made for a purpose. 
               <br />
               They were clearly campaign Speeches; and

               in order to make them good, sol-id Orange 
               <br />
               campaign speeches, they had to contain 
               <br />
               something discreditable said by some one in 
               <br />
               authority. Therefore, they introduced into 
               <br />
               those speeches something which they alleged 
               <br />
               had been said by the Minister of Justice.

               But before I proceed further, I wish to

               <br />
               tion yesterday, that the discussion on this

               day. So that if the hon. gentlemen who 
               <br />
               follow the leader of the opposition had any 
               <br />
               regard for agreements made by him, this 
               <br />
               whole evening would not have been wasted 
               <br />
               in this useless discussion, the whole of which 
               <br />
               must come up again, when these hon. gen-

               <br />
               or say nothing. What was the agreement 
               <br />
               entered into yesterday between the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition and the Minister of Justice? 
               <br />
               It was as follows:

               <br />
               The hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
               <br />
               has told us that the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               made the statement that this Bill we are 
               <br />
               discussing would bring into force the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875, and that section 93 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act would also bring that 
               <br />
               Act into force. But if we are to do justice 
               <br />
               to that hon. minister, if we are to correctly 
               <br />
               represent the constitutional view which he 
               <br />
               holds on this matter, we must read all he 
               <br />
               said. Had I been trained in any other school 
               <br />
               than that of the legal profession, perhaps I 
               <br />
               would not consider it so serious an offence to 
               <br />
               misquote any man’s statement or make a 
               <br />
               misstatement before a court or a parliament, 
               <br />
               but there is nothing that is considered so 
               <br />
               contemptible on the part of any one belong- 
               <br />
               ing to the noble profession of the law as to 
               <br />
               make a mis-quotation before the court or 
               <br />
               anywhere else. Therefore, I ﬁnd it diﬂicult 
               <br />
               to tolerate any mis-quotation on the part of 
               <br />
               any gentleman, and that is the reason why 
               <br />
               I could not very well stand the mis-quota- 
               <br />
               tlons made to—night. What the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice said was that if section 93 is going 
               <br />
               to apply to the west, what would happen ? 
               <br />
               Then we must read in that connection the 
               <br />
               statement made by him at that same mo- 
               <br />
