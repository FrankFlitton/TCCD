               vestigation, this is one. I notice in this 
               <br />
               correspondence, Mr. Speaker, that your 
               <br />
               name appears as the representative of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> constituency. and probably it would 
               <br />
               be well if the Speaker would give some 
               <br />
               explanation with respect to the contract, 
               <br />
               or with respect to the correspondence 
               <br />
               that has taken place betWeen the department 
               <br />
               and the fence wire company. There is 
               <br />
               something very extraordinary about it, and 
               <br />
               I presume that to-morrow when the papers 
               <br />
               are brought down, when the advertisement 
               <br />
               is exponed to the members of this House, 
               <br />
               and the tenders that have been called for, 
               <br />
               a copy of that document will be laid before 
               <br />
               the House so that hon. gentlemen on both 
               <br />
               sides will be in a position to judge of the 
               <br />
               merits of this case. 
               <br />

               agreeing in the criticism that has been made 
               <br />
               on this affair, I desire to draw attention to 
               <br />
               another phase of the question, namely, that 
               <br />
               where fencing is to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[be</span> done between neigh- 
               <br />
               bours the ordinary common law of 
               <br />
               the land is that the neighbours who 
               <br />
               are interested are jointly responsible 
               <br />
               for the construction of the fence. This 
               <br />
               being an international fence, has any ap-

               wards the United IShates government ask-

               ing them to pay their fair share of this 
               <br />
               fencing? It appears to me that is a 
               <br />
               proposition that ought to be entertained by 
               <br />
               the American government. They are in-

               <br />
               marked the same as we are. Has this gov-
