               <br />
               any one who has listened to the remarks 
               <br />

               to any other conclusion than that he has 
               <br />
               treated this question as what it really is, 
               <br />
               one of the most serious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> has ever come

               before this House. But if a charge of

               <br />
               I fail to discover a single argument. In-

               stead of arguing seriously the points raised

               <br />
               sought lightly to brush them aside as if 
               <br />
               the question were not to be considered or 
               <br />

               that the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule) was the chief source of those pe-

               against the clause in this Bill relating to 
               <br />

               <br />
               my knowledge goes, that my hon. friend is 
               <br />
               not the chief source of those petitions. In

               the body which the hon. member for East

               oughly self contained throughout this mat-

               ter. I do not believe that the First Minister 
               <br />
               realizes for amoment the feeling which this 
               <br />
               Bill has created. Already by this measure 
               <br />
               he has set creed against creed in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario. Already he has done 
               <br />
               evil which ten years will not wipe out; and 
               <br />
               I appeal to him to lose not another day 
               <br />
               in submitting this Bill to the House and 
               <br />
               the people because every day’s delay is 
               <br />
               widening the breach and intensifying the 
               <br />
               feeling against it. It is intensifying that 
               <br />
               feeling to such an extent that no matter 
               <br />
               whether the Bill be altered to meet the 
               <br />
               views of those who are opposing it or not 
               <br />
               the bitterness now created will last longer 
               <br />
               than the lifetime of many in this House. 
               <br />
               I have been astonished at the strength 
               <br />
               of the feeling which has been aroused

               objection has been made, we must con- 
               <br />
               clude that great consideration has been 
               <br />
               given to it. But, Mr. Speaker, the fact 
               <br />
               rather is that this educational clause so 
               <br />
               overshadows all the others that the other 
               <br />
               clauses have not received the criticism 
               <br />
               which they ought to get. It is stated in 
               <br />
               the newspapers without contradiction that

               this measure was left to four members of 
               <br />
               the cabinet—the First Minister, the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick), the Sec- 
               <br />
               retary of State (Mr. Scott) and the Post-
