               member for Bothwell, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provisions</span> of the

               country. That is clearly seen when we come 
               <br />
               to the British statute of 1871, which, for the 
               <br />

               <br />
               and. as the hon. Minister of the Interior has

               said, enables this parliament to decide what 
               <br />
