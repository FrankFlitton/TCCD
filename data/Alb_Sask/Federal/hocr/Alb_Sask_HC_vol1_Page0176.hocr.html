               indulgence of the House, to proceed to the 
               <br />
               discussion of the sections we have before

               the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. 
               <br />

               ments of my right hon. friend the leader of 
               <br />
               the government who is my party leader and 
               <br />
               who was my leader in the government for 
               <br />
               so many years. Nevertheless, the conclus- 
               <br />
               ion at which I arrived will probably not be 
               <br />
               the same as that of the hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition. In the ﬁrst place let me say 
               <br />
               that I think he was wrong in his view—— 
               <br />
               and -I agree with my hon. friend the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) in this— 
               <br />
               that when we are about to consider legis- 
               <br />
               lation which will bring a certain state of 
               <br />
               affairs into existence in the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />

               <br />
               educational effect of the proposal before us. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that almost everybody will 
               <br />
               agree with my hon. friend the Minister of
