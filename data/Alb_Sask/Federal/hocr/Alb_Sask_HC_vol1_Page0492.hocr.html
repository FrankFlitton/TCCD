               direct. Nor had Papineau the excuse of youth 
               <br />
               to plead in extenuation of his folly. In 1837 
               <br />

               <br />
               the intellect stands at its meridian. In height

               <br />
               of quick and penetrating glance. He appeared

               to be formed by nature for the eloquent agita- 
               <br />
               tor, but not for the wise or prudent legislator ;

               ignorant or unreﬂecting countrymen, not to

               make them happier, wiser or better. Familiar

               with French literature and all the old lore of 
               <br />
               La Nouvelle France, he appealed to the feelings

               ignorant of the feeling of loyalty to the Queen

               gentlemen. The hon. member for Labelle 
               <br />
               has inﬂamed the minds of the people in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec, and has attempted to 
               <br />
               justify himself by preaching the same stuff 
               <br />
               in other provinces. He recently spoke in 
               <br />
               the city of Toronto, and I was asked by a 
               <br />

               <br />
               Labelle; he real-ly believed the statements 
               <br />
               that the member for Labelle had been mak-

               Now, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir,</span> I have disposed pretty well of

               the various points which it was my inten-

               <br />
               I have shown that the government practi-
