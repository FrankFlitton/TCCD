               ments of the minority of that province. Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, in the province of New Brunswick we 
               <br />
               have a. law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">similar</span> to that of Nova Scotia.- I 
               <br />
               was here during part or the time in 1872-73—74 
               <br />
               when the question of the New Brunswick school 
               <br />
               was brought up by the present Minister of 
               <br />
               Marine and Fisheries, who invited us to inter— 
               <br />
               fere. Wisely, Sir, we abstained from interfer- 
               <br />
               ence, and what. is the result to-day ? The re— 
               <br />
               sullt is that in New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick</span> the law is being 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administered</span> in IB, way that is satisfactory to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> classes of the community. Suppose we had 
               <br />
               listened to the hon. gentleman who now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁlls</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> position of Minister of Marine and Fisher- 
               <br />
               ies, who so eloquently urged upon us the neces- 
               <br />
               sity of interfering with the legislation of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, and had undertaken to interfere 
               <br />
               with the laws of that province. Suppose we 
               <br />
               had interfered, what would have been the posi- 
               <br />
               tion in that province to—day ? Think you that 
               <br />
               you would have had the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amicablle</span> and 
               <br />
               friendly relations between that province and 
               <br />
               this Dominion that exists <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-dsay</span> ? No, Sir. If 
               <br />
               the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> had prevailed he would have 
               <br />

               If we substitute ‘the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories ’ for ‘ Manitoba ’ we will have a pretty 
               <br />
               good description of the Bill which is now 
               <br />
               proposed in this House, and which. no doubt 
               <br />
               this House will be asked to sanction. We 
               <br />
               have here just what the Minister of Militia 
               <br />
               thinks about this question, and if he thinks 
               <br />
               that, how is it possible that he could have 
               <br />
               approved of the present Bill which is ”con- 
               <br />
               trary to the views which he expressed be- 
               <br />
               fore. Now, let us sum up brieﬂy the opi- 
               <br />
               nions which he expressed. First he objects 
               <br />
               to coercion. None of us like that word. 
               <br />
               Then he takes the stand that what is past 
               <br />
               cannot be changed even down to the third 
               <br />
               or fourth generation. I am afraid that be- 
               <br />
               fore that time we will all be chloroformed. 
               <br />
               He also takes the stand for provincial 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights</span> he thinks the minority should be 
               <br />
               considered, he thinks that before any great 
               <br />
               change in the policy of the country is made 
               <br />
               there should be an investigation. He thinks 
               <br />
               that if Manitoba is left to administer its 
               <br />
               own laws it will administer them in its own 
               <br />
               interest and in the interests of all parts of 
               <br />
               the Dominion. I have taken some pains 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«to</span> ﬁnd what the minister said on this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and I want the House to take it into 
               <br />
               consideration that it is difﬁcult to under- 
               <br />
               stand how this gentleman ever supported 
               <br />
               the introduction of a Bill of this spirit. As
