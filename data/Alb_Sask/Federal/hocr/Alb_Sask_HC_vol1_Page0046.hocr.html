               ago—a speech delivered at Regina about the 
               <br />
               19th or 20th of March last—told us that 
               <br />
               this Bill must be in the nature of a contract 
               <br />
               between the Northwest Territories and the 
               <br />
               rest of this country—a contract made, as 
               <br />
               the premier of the Northwest Territories has 
               <br />
               pointed out, between the great majority of 
               <br />
               the people of this country and the minority 
               <br />
               who live in the Territories; an agreement 
               <br />
               to be made between ﬁve and one half mil- 
               <br />
               lions of the people of Canada residing in 
               <br />
               the seven existing provinces and the half 
               <br />
               million people who reside in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. These 500,000 people have a 
               <br />
               government. That government was sum- 
               <br />
               moned here to Ottawa for the purpose of 
               <br />
               conferring with a special committee of the 
               <br />
               Privy Council in regard to the terms of this 
               <br />
               measure. It was to be a matter of contract, 
               <br />
               so the ex—Minister of the Interior told us. 
               <br />
               Well, one, would suppose that, under these 
               <br />
               conditions, at least the representatives of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories would have been con- 
               <br />
               sulted about all the important provisions of 
               <br />
               this Bill. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"Does</span> my right hon. friend remem-

               ber how he swelled with indignation in 1896 
               <br />
               when he charged Sir Charles Tupper across 
               <br />
               the ﬂoor of this House with having trampled 
               <br />

               <br />
               tia in passing through a moribund legislature 
               <br />
               the resolutions relating to confederation ? 
               <br />
               Does he remember how he advocated the 
               <br />
               rights of the people at that time ? Does he 
               <br />
               forget how he accused Sir Charles Tupper 
               <br />
               of having trampled upon the dignity of a 
               <br />
               proud people who would never forget that 
               <br />
               treatment ? But at least this can be said in 
               <br />
               favour of the measure which Sir Charles 
               <br />
               Tupper caused to be passed at that time, 
               <br />
               that it went before the representatives of 
               <br />
               the people and was considered by them in 
               <br />
               parliament. even if it were a moribund par- 
               <br />
               liament. But, the Prime Minister, if we are 
               <br />
               to believe the statements contained in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               down to the parliament of Canada certain 
               <br />
               provisions in this measure without even 
               <br />
               deigning for one moment to consult the 
               <br />
               representatives of the people in those terri-

               <br />

               <br />
               of to-day '? What are the words of Mr.

               I must take strong exception to the way in

               Well, I do not know what my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend will make of all this. He did not 
               <br />
               consult the hon. ex-Minister of Interior 
               <br />
               who specially represents the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories; he did not consult 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance who is especially 
               <br />
               concerned with the ﬁnancial features of 
               <br />
               this Bill; he did not consult, in so far as 
               <br />
               this part of the measure is concerned, the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories and his colleagues. The question 
               <br />
               naturally arises: Whom did he consult? 
               <br />
               I can only answer that question in one 
               <br />
               way. It seems to me that he must have 
               <br />
               consulted the seven gentlemen from the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories who are elected as 
               <br />
               Liberals and these provisions are the result 
               <br />
               of their collective and united wisdom. He 
               <br />
               postponed this measure in order that he 
               <br />
               might have the beneﬁt ot‘ the wisdom of 
               <br />
               ten gentlemen from the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. He did not get as many as he 
               <br />
               thought he would get; he got seven and 
               <br />
               I presume that the educational provisions 
               <br />
               of the measare which has been brought 
               <br />
               down are the result of the advice and ass- 
               <br />
               istance of the seven gentlemen who sit on 
               <br />
               that side of the House for the moment. 
               <br />
               Assuming that to be the case—and we must 
               <br />
               assume that it is the case in the silence of 
               <br />
               these gentlemen—is it good constitutional 
               <br />
               practice after all, to put to one side the Min— 
               <br />
