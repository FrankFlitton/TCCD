               interest of this country. is 
               <br />
               legislation in the wrong direction. Why, 
               <br />
               our agricultural interest is the great- 
               <br />
               est interest we have, it is the foundation of 
               <br />
               our prosperity; and legislation that bears 
               <br />
               against that interest is an injury to our 
               <br />
               country. We are proud of the millions of 
               <br />
               acres of fertile land belonging to the Do- 
               <br />
               minion of Canada where millions of settlers 
               <br />
               may make their homes. As each settler 
               <br />
               tills his farm, the soil yields its return to 
               <br />
               his labour. His children grow up about 
               <br />
               him, and as they grow their little hands do 
               <br />
               what they can to help their parents. And 
               <br />
               as they grow to manhood and womanhood 
               <br />
               they branch out and more settlers’ homes 
               <br />
               are established. And the wealth that is 
               <br />
               produced, being greater than the people can 
               <br />
               consume, it is exported, and brings back to 
               <br />
               the Dominion gold for our exchequer. And, 
               <br />
               better than gold, better than diamonds and 
               <br />
               rubies, it brings to our shores the man of 
               <br />
               intellect and energy and ambition to settle 
               <br />
               upon our lands and till them, to build up 
               <br />
               our country until it becomes the strong 
               <br />
               right arm of the British empire. Now, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, through you I desire to appeal to

               every honourable gentleman in this House, 
               <br />

               desires that the produce of his lands shall

               you, I appeal to these hon. gentlemen not 
               <br />
               to support the third reading of this Bill, 
               <br />
               through you I appeal also to the profes-

               <br />
               are a ﬁne lot of them here. No men are 
               <br />
               more anxious than they that our farmers 
               <br />
               shall prosper, knowing, as they do, that, if 
               <br />
               the farmers prosper, they have a better op- 
               <br />
               portunity to obtain all that is right and

               <br />
               I am sure the wisdom would be pouring in

               <br />
               Bill let the government offer a prize of 
               <br />
               $1,000 or $2.000 to any person who will in- 
               <br />
               vent a tanning mill that will entirely eli-

               minate the noxious weed-seeds from the

               good seeds and that can be sold <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[at</span> from 
               <br />
               $30 to $50. Such a machine would be

               within the reach of every farmer, and its 
               <br />

               no noxious weed-seed would be taken to the
