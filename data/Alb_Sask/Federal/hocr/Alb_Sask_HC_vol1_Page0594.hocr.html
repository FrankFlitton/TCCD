               First Minister could take advantage of it. 
               <br />
               Was it not likely ? It seems the most like- 
               <br />
               ly thing in the world. That conference was 
               <br />
               held, the Manitoba delegates did not accept 
               <br />
               the invitation and respond to it as desired, 
               <br />
               by agreeing to grant separate schools, 
               <br />
               and What was the result? The next day 
               <br />
               when the announcement was made they 
               <br />
               were told through the Prime Minister's 
               <br />
               speech in the House that their boundaries 
               <br />
               could not be extended. No reason 'as as— 
               <br />
               signed except that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other</span> provinces might be 
               <br />
               interested. Practically no reason whatever 
               <br />
               was assigned for it, but they have that sim- 
               <br />
               ple information. Robert Rogers says they 
               <br />
               were to get information in a few days. 
               <br />
               Afterwards Mr. Rogers writes a letter ask- 
               <br />
               invg whether the information was not forth- 
               <br />
               coming. The Prime Minister says he never 
               <br />
               received the letter but we have had evidence 
               <br />
               in this House that that letter was sent 
               <br />
               direct to the Prime Minister’s own house. 
               <br />
               That was established by indisputable evi- 
               <br />
               dence. There Was no doubt about that. 
               <br />

               any other letter ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ls</span> he aware of any other 
               <br />
               letter which he got ? The messenger says 
               <br />
               he delivered it. The letter was handed to 
               <br />
               him by a member of parliament who says 
               <br />
               that this letter was the one written by 
               <br />
               Robert Rogers. Is that direct enough? 
               <br />
               i might very properly ask whether the 
               <br />
               minister got a letter at all that day; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«I</span> 
               <br />
               might ask a dozen questions from some

               messenger, I am taking the evidence that 
               <br />
               has been submitted to this House, but 
               <br />
               that I think, is reliable and should be ac- 
               <br />
               cepted. Part of it is the evidence of an 
               <br />
               hon. minister of the Crown, part of it is that 
               <br />
               of an hon. member of parliament and the 
               <br />
               other portion of it is furnished by a mes- 
               <br />
               senger whom we believe to be telling the 
               <br />
               truth and by the record of the book which 
               <br />
               shows that the message was taken. What 
               <br />
               was the subject discussed? The extension 
               <br />
               of the boundaries of Manitoba; the school 
               <br />
               question. The Papal delegate admits that 
               <br />
               the suggestion was made that it will facili- 
               <br />
               tate business if you will make these two 
               <br />
               amendments to the school law. That is what 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers says; that is what the Papal 
               <br />
               ablegate admits. And then the ablega’te 
               <br />
               admits that the proposed clauses of the 
               <br />
               Act read substantially as he gave them. 
               <br />
               Put the story all together and what is 
               <br />
               it ? It exactly conﬁrms the statement made 
               <br />
               in the main by the Hon. Mr. Rogers. Now, 
               <br />
               the Papal ablegate has a connection with 
               <br />
               the Autonomy Bill, he has a conference and 
               <br />
               his success in fastening separate schools

               not extend that system to Manitoba. That 
               <br />
               is the most reasonable thing in the world.

               -Why would he not do it ? He ventured to 
               <br />
               do it. What does this mean if it does not

               mean that there is interference with the
