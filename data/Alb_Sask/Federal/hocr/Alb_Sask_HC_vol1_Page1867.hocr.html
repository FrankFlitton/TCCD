               sometimes they disagree; then the law pro-

               federal authority, it comes exactly within 
               <br />
               the purview of section 93 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. Now I say this is a 
               <br />
               small concession. and it seems to be very 
               <br />
               reasOnable. Everybody has heard on the 
               <br />
               ﬂoor of this House. and everybody must 
               <br />
               have been struck with the fact that all the 
               <br />
               members of the Northwest Territories, whe- 
               <br />
               ther on one side of the House or the other, 
               <br />
               have expressed a pride in their school sys- 
               <br />
               tem, because it provides both for national 
               <br />
               schools so far as secular instruction is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, and it acknowledges the rights of 
               <br />
               conscience for those who think that there 
               <br />
               should be religious instruction in schools. 
               <br />
               Now I know there are gentlemen perhaps on 
               <br />
               both sides of this House, and there are peo-

               ligious instruction being given at all in 
               <br />

               <br />
               from them. I would follow in this matter 
               <br />
               the example of old Scotland. of England, 
               <br />
               and also of that land from which we have 
               <br />
               many traditions. I think it is a proper

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span> that. pari passu with secular educa-

               <br />
               vided for in this amendment. My hon.

               friend from Qu’Appelle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lake)</span> stated

               <br />
               amendment because it infringed provincial 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights.</span> He is consistent in his objection. as 
               <br />
               he objects to other provisions of this Bill 
               <br />
               on the same ground. The“ hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               says he is in favour of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">religious</span> instruction. 
               <br />
               but he. is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> this amendment. because 
               <br />
               he would leave that matter altogether to 
               <br />
               the province to ,deal with as it pleases. Well. 
               <br />
               Sir. we have discussed this point and the 
               <br />
               House has pronounced upon it. I appeal 
               <br />
               to the fair and calm judgment of the House 
               <br />
               if this is not a reasonable amendment. which 
               <br />
               does not interfere with the conscience of 
               <br />
               any man. It is merely carrying out the in- 
               <br />
               tention that has been afﬁrmed by this House 
               <br />
               of putting into force by federal sanction the 
               <br />

               Labelle has made this matter very plain

               and after my hon. friend from Beauharnois

               <br />
               Minister of Justice does not suppose for one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span>

               moment that we are so absolutely blind as

               to be misled by a little by-play of that kind. 
               <br />
               It is not paying us any compliment at all

               to suppose that we are misled by anything

               so transparent. because every one under-

               stands it perfectly. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> I understand

               solutely clear last night that I need not say 
               <br />
               very much. The point reduced to a few 
               <br />

               in the district has certain rights in respect 
               <br />
               to religious instruction. but the minority 
               <br />
               where it is the majority in a school dis- 
               <br />
               trict, has not the constitutional guarantee 
               <br />
               of its rights. If I understand the point 
               <br />
               made by my hon. friend from Beauharnois 
               <br />
               and my hon. friend from Labelle that is 
               <br />
               what they brought to the attention of the 
               <br />
               committee. This amendment is intended to 
               <br />
               cover that. It not only seems to cover that, 
               <br />
               but a great deal more. I will point that 
               <br />
               out to my right hon. friend the leader of the 
               <br />
               government and my hon. friend the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice and we will see if they do not 
               <br />
               agree with me. Will my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice do me the kindness, be- 
               <br />
               cause we cannot always have these matters 
               <br />
               immediately in our minds. to look for one
