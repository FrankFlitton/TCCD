               have set forth, in ﬁne language, the reasons

               which compel us morally to give religious

               It is suggested that in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, the schools are inferior to those of 
               <br />
               other provinces in Canada. It has been es-

               have shown in this House that our schools 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec are equal, if not 
               <br />
               superior, to those of any other province, and 
               <br />

               the province of Quebec. I protest energeti-

               cally against these mischievous attacks. I 
               <br />
               protest also against a newspaper article 
               <br />
               which I have read a few days ago, in which 
               <br />

               Canadian bishops, and who, Mr. Speaker. 
               <br />
               may soon be elevated to the dignity of 
               <br />
               Cardinal in the Catholic Church. I deplore 
               <br />
               these malignant attacks, more especially 
               <br />
               coming from the Toronto papers. This 
               <br />
               afternoon, when I heard one of my friends,

               cultured, I could not help wondering whether 
               <br />
               the papers to which I refer really voiced the 
               <br />
