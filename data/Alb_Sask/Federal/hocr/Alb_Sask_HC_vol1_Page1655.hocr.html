               clear explanation of how that comes about.-

               lt cannot have been accidental, there 
               <br />
               must have been discussions between some 
               <br />
               of those gentlemen, who are so active in re-

               presenting the Northwest, and the govern-

               ment. We ought to know who suggested 
               <br />
               that, and why it was suggested. If you at- 
               <br />
               tempt to make such a distribution on the 
               <br />
               ground of an early increase of population, 
               <br />
               I would point out that it would be neces-

               sary, within the next two, or three, or four

               cent to get up to the present position of the 
               <br />
               remainder of the province; it would have 
               <br />
               to increase 500 per cent while the remainder 
               <br />
               of the province was stationary. I think we

               <br />
               assuming it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:to</span> be reasonable that 500 voters 
               <br />
               have two representatives in Athabaska, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> should be the total number of seats for 
               <br />
               the province, the result would be that you 
               <br />
               would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[to</span> have 120 members in that

               province instead of 25. It is impossible that 
               <br />
               such a thing could have been proposed as 
               <br />
               appears upon this schedule without some 
               <br />
               discussion, and without some particular ob-

               ject of a selﬁsh mature being at the bottom 
               <br />
               of it, and I say deliberately that there 
               <br />
               must have been a motive, an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intention</span> to

               accomplish some purpose. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span>

               <br />
               present Minister of the Interior. We all 
               <br />
               know the section he represents, and his per- 
               <br />
               sonal interest—his political interest, rather 
               <br />
               —in creating such an anomaly, because it 
               <br />
               throws the balance of power of the whole 
               <br />
               province into the end of the province he 
               <br />
               represents. I think, therefore, for the very 
               <br />
               reason that this hon. gentleman has so re- 
               <br />
               cently been taken into the government, we 
               <br />
               should have a very explicit explanation 
               <br />
               upon that point. I did understand the hon. 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior to say: Oh, 
               <br />
               there is such an immense territory up there, 
               <br />
               and that territory requires representation 
               <br />
               apart from the very few people there. Well. 
               <br />
               it strikes me that is a very odd way of 
               <br />
               putting it. I could understand it if there 
               <br />
               were fractions to be provided for, if you 
               <br />
               were going to create one and a—half into
