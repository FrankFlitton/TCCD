               First let me say that the provisions of the 
               <br />
               Autonomy Bill were better than I expected from 
               <br />
               a ﬁnancial standpoint. I must express my 
               <br />
               satisfaction with the terms secured by. the 
               <br />
               Northwest. The result is all that could have 
               <br />
               been expected. As regards the educational 
               <br />
               clauses, I am prepared to accept the old law. 
               <br />
               I am not competent to judge of how far the pro— 
               <br />
               posed clauses exceed the clauses in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories Act, but where they do I be— 
               <br />
               lieve Sifton and others are justiﬁed in opposing 
               <br />
               them. But I prefer that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,question</span> as an

               issue be removed from the provincial ﬁeld. So 
               <br />
               long as the assembly retains control and en— 
               <br />
               forces uniformity of teachers‘ qualiﬁcations, 
               <br />
               books, curricula and inspection, we have nothing 
               <br />
               to dread from the ‘ narrow and illiterate ’ 
               <br />
               separate school products. In fact I feel that 
               <br />
               we lose sight of our main privilege that we may 
               <br />
               always, when we so desire, act in unity and 
               <br />
               harmony with our Catholic neighbours, and my 
               <br />
               experience with the Catholic laity is that they 
               <br />
               will meet us half way.

               Mr. SCOTT. I venture to state again 
               <br />
               that most of the people who signed these

               the Bills is not a compromise to me at all. 
               <br />
               It is purely and exactly what I myself, and
