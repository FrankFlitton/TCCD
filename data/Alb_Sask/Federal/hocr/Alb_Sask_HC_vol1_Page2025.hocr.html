               ernment or this country, by virtue of an 
               <br />
               Act of parliament passed in 1881, can make 
               <br />
               a contract which shall have effect in the

               Territories after they are created into pro-

               vinces. I suppose that is what the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman means. I have already expressed 
               <br />
               my opinion with regard to that, but the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) does 
               <br />
               not seem to be able to understand it. I have 
               <br />
               expressed in committee the view which I 
               <br />
               entertain with regard to it. I say the con- 
               <br />
               tract is binding upon the Crown because it 
               <br />
               was ratiﬁed by parliament. The question of i 
               <br />
               legislative jurisdiction respecting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dominion?</span> 
               <br />
               taxation remains in the parliament of Gan-

               <br />

               <br />
               cases there is a contract to be observed,‘ 
               <br />
               and neither in the one case or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other;</span> 
               <br />
               could the parliament or legislature properly: 
               <br />
               interfere without compensation. That is 
               <br />
               the situation as I regard it.’ But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">how-l</span>

               ever that may be, the motion of the bon..

               itself to my judgment because it does <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not.</span> 
               <br />
               accomplish what. after all. I presume, he 
               <br />
               wishes to accomplish. He referred to a pro- 
               <br />
               vision for expropriation which we proposed 
               <br />
               to introduce into the National Transcontin- 
               <br />
               ental contract. We were not doing what 
               <br />
               he is doing now, or what he did this after- 
               <br />
               noon. We prepared a clause providing for 
               <br />
               and authorizing expropriation and stating 
               <br />
               the terms of it. The hon. gentleman has 
               <br />
               done nothing of the kind. If he had made 
               <br />
               any such motion as that with regard to sec-

               Bill. I could understand it; but his motion

               this afternoon was obviously meaningless for 
               <br />
