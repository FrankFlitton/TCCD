               would have had greater respect for our

               Canadian parliament of which he was at 
               <br />
               one time a member, than to have indulged

               in any such accusations or statements or 
               <br />
               insinuations unless he had undoubted proof 
               <br />
               of their accuracy. et what does he say ‘? 
               <br />
               He says in fact that when the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) delivered the 
               <br />
               speech he did on the question now before 
               <br />
               the House, he spoke not his own mind, not 
               <br />
               as directed by his own judgment, but as a 
               <br />
               tool in the hands of a party caucus and as 
               <br />
               merely carrying out the Tory plan of cam- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ertson says, too, that the hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) did not ex- 
               <br />
               press his own mind, did not speak from prin- 
               <br />
               ciple, but was driven to the stand he did 
               <br />
               take by his constituents in Carleton, and 
               <br />
               that he, too, was but a tool in the hands of 
               <br />
               a party caucus, forging his little link in the 
               <br />
               chain which has been designed by those who 
               <br />
               planned the Tory campaign. If we are to

               Cartier (Mr. Monk) has not told us whether 
               <br />
               his speech was made for him or by him, but 
               <br />
               I do not think that those who had the pleas- 
               <br />
               ure of listening to him in this House require 
               <br />

               <br />
               made by himself or dictated by the party 
               <br />
               caucus. And those who listened to him will 
               <br />
               do him the justice to say that he was never 
               <br />
               at any part of his speech either frantic or 
               <br />
               angry or even bitter. But the point I would 
               <br />
               make is this. If Mr. Robertson, the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive editor of a Conservative newspaper, will 
               <br />
               allow his feelings and passions to so run 
               <br />
               away with him that he will descend to in— 
               <br />
               sinuations and accusations so unsupportable 
               <br />
               by fact against the leader of his own party 
               <br />
               and one of that leader’s lieutenants, what 
               <br />
               can we expect of such a man when he cri- 
               <br />
               ticises and censures the leader of the Re- 
               <br />
               form government which he is so anxious to 
               <br />
               defeat, overthrow and destroy. I do not know 
               <br />
               whether it is safe to quote in this House 
               <br />
               words from Conservative newspapers. We 
               <br />
               had a little while ago the leader of the op- 
               <br />
               position telling us that an hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               had made an exhibition of himself because 
               <br />
               he dared to quote from the Hamilton ‘ Spec- 
               <br />
               tator.’ Let me again refer to that article 
               <br />
               in the ‘ Spectator’ in which the writer de— 
               <br />

               <br />
               again be premier of this Dominion. That, 
               <br />
               Sir, was a most atrocious statement. No 
               <br />

               <br />

               we have, who are developing our manufac- 
               <br />
               turing industries, and, by their energy, thrift 
               <br />
               and untiring business <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enterprise,</span> are doing 
               <br />
               much to build up our Ontario cities and cul- 
               <br />
               tivate and improve our Canadian farms. 
               <br />
               I say it is a shame and disgrace for any 
               <br />
               man to say, in the columns of a newspaper 
               <br />
               or elsewhere, that a man whose forbears, 
               <br />
               perhaps, have spoken naturally the German 
               <br />
               or the French language, shall never occupy 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst position in this country. But. Sir, 
               <br />
               bad as it was for the editor of the Hamil- 
               <br />
               ton ‘ Spectator,’ to say these words, I think 
               <br />
               it was almost inﬁnitely worse that- Mr. 
               <br />
               John Ross Robertson, as we ﬁnd in the ‘Tele- 
               <br />
               gram ’ of last Saturday, should have rebuk- 
               <br />
               ed the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. 
               <br />
               Borden) and the hon. member for West 
               <br />
               Toronto (Mr. Osler) by saying that they 
               <br />
               would have enough to do in apologizing for 
               <br />
               their own errors and mistakes, and ought to
