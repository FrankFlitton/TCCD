               If I understand him, Mr. Christopher Robin-

               <br />

               Then, if parliament can supplement that

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">PATERSON.</span> Well, it is plain from 
               <br />
               what we have heard that lawyers differ. 
               <br />
               However, I still maintain my opinion, but 
               <br />
               I do so with deference, because neither am 
               <br />
               I able to make a legal argument myself, 
               <br />
               nor have I a sufﬁciently sharp mind to un- 
               <br />
               derstand the contradictory legal arguments 
               <br />
               of others. Now I want to know what Sir 
               <br />
               Christopher Robinson means. If section 93 
               <br />
               does give certain powers, should parliament 
               <br />
               exercise the power it possesses ? Now then 
               <br />
               what power does parliament possess ? The 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition says we have no 
               <br />
               power. Sir Christopher Robinson, as I un- 
               <br />
               derstand, believes that under the amend- 
               <br />
               ment to the British North America Act of 
               <br />
               1875. the right to make the constitution of
