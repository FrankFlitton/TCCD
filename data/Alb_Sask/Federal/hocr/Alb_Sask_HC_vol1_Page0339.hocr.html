               <br />
               or in another Act to be read together with it. 
               <br />
               All the provisions of the Act of 1871 are 
               <br />
               susceptible of application and are suscep-

               tible of interpretation apart altogether from 
               <br />
               the provisions of the Act of 1867. What bet- 
               <br />
               ter proof of that do we require than the 
               <br />
               course we have pursued for the last thirty- 
               <br />
               ﬁve years during which we have administer- 
               <br />
               ed these Territories altogether by virtue of 
               <br />
               the provisions of the Act of‘1871. Since 1870 
               <br />
               when these Territories came under our con- 
               <br />
               trol, we have not governed them by virtue 
               <br />
               of the Act of 1867 but by virtue of the Act 
               <br />
               of 1871. Therefore, the Act of 1871 has 
               <br />
               not in any way modiﬁed or altered the speci— 
               <br />
               ﬁc provisions of the Act of 1867, and so 
               <br />
               long as these Territories remain Territories. 
               <br />
               this parliament of course continues to hold 
               <br />
               absolute jurisdiction over them. The legis- 
               <br />
               l'â’t‘ion in these Territories shall be just 
               <br />
               exactly what this parliament chooses to 
               <br />
               make it; from time to time this parliament 
               <br />
               may repeal provisions previously enacted 
               <br />
               or substitute for them provisions entirely 
               <br />
               different. But when the status of the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories is changed and they are made pro- 
               <br />
               vinces ; when they are elevated to the dig- 
               <br />
               nity of provinces, then come in and are 
               <br />
               immediately applicable the provisions 
               <br />
               of the Act of 1867. The new provinces 
               <br />
               are entitled to all the beneﬁts and all the 
               <br />
               provisions of the Act of 1867; they are en— 
               <br />
               titled to all the provisions which were ap- 
               <br />
               plicable to and which could be claimed by 
               <br />
               the original provinces of confederation. 
               <br />
               Therefore it is that I say, that when these 
               <br />
               Territories are being admitted as full- 
               <br />
               ﬂedged partners in the original partnership 
               <br />
               of agreement, when they are admitted as 
               <br />
               full—ﬂedged provinces of the union they are 
               <br />
               entitled to the full beneﬁts of section 93 
               <br />
               of the Act of 1867 and the rights or privi— 
               <br />
               leges referred to in subsection 1 of said sec- 
               <br />
               tion are preserved to the new provinces. 
               <br />
               Every one admits that we could have re— 
               <br />
               pealed the Act of 1875, that we could have 
               <br />
               modiﬁed it, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> we could have replaced

               of 1875, then there immediately arises the 
               <br />
               necessity for the enactment of this very 
               <br />
               section. It has been said that this section 
               <br />
               16 of the Bill we are discussing is the re- 
               <br />
               sult of a compromise, and that may be or 
               <br />
               it may not be the case. I admit that it is 
               <br />
               in some sense and in some respects a modi— 
               <br />
               ﬁcation of the law of 1875, not a modiﬁca- 
               <br />
               tion of the principle of religious instruction 
               <br />
               in the schools, which in section 16 is again 
               <br />
               upheld, but a modiﬁcation probably in the 
               <br />
               manner in which the principle is to be ap- 
               <br />
               plied, but the leader of the opposition has 
               <br />
               told us that because it constitutes a modi- 
               <br />
               ﬁcation of the provisions of the Act of 1875 
               <br />
               we are, in enacting section 16, amending 
               <br />
               section 93 of the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               I do not think that is correct and I would

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BErL‘COUR‘T.</span> I think not. We have

               what is the difference between enacting sec-

               Mr. R. L. BURDEN. The difference is so 
               <br />
               extremely obvious that I would suppose it 
               <br />
               could hardly escape the attention of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend. In one case we are dealing with 
               <br />
               territories, which, as my hon. friend has 
               <br />
               just explained, are under the absolute legis- 
               <br />
               lative jurisdiction of this parliament until 
               <br />
               they are created into provinces. In the 
               <br />
               other case we are creating them into pro- 
               <br />
               vinces subject to the provisions of the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish North America Act as to the distribu- 
               <br />
               tion of legislative power between the Do- 
               <br />
               minion on the one hand and the provinces 
               <br />
               on the other. I would think that is a 
               <br />
               pretty obvious distinction, but it may not 
               <br />
               commend itself to my hon. friend.
