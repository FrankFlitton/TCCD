               The hon. member for North Toronto (Mr.

               has not been forced upon the minority; 
               <br />

               With a view to ﬁnd out what rights we

               enjoy, is it not necessary that we should 
               <br />
               consult history ? ‘History,’ says Laurent, 
               <br />
               'shows us the meaning and the scope of 
               <br />
               statutory enactments.’ The problem which 
               <br />
               we have to solve has already been solved, 
               <br />
               and solved by Sir John Macdonald himself 
               <br />
               in 1870. But, even before his time, the prob— 
               <br />
               lem had been solved by the great neighbour— 
               <br />
               ing republic and that as early as 1820. Of 
               <br />
               course, in order to draw correct inferences 
               <br />
               from the history of the United States, we 
               <br />
               should take into account the similarity of' 
               <br />
               circumstances, as also the difference between 
               <br />
               the constitutions of both countries. The 
               <br />
               United States. in the same way as Canada, 
               <br />
               have territories, and these territories will 
               <br />
               have, some day or other. to be admitted into 
               <br />
               the union. But the difference between our 
               <br />
               constitution and that of our neighbours on 
               <br />
               that point is quite marked. Not only has 
               <br />
               the federal constitution been worked out by 
               <br />
               the people of the United States, but the con— 
               <br />
               stitution of each separate state is also the 
               <br />
               creation of the peoples of these various 
               <br />
               states. Here, on the contrary. not only is 
               <br />
               the federal constitution a gift of the imperial 
               <br />
               parliament, but even the constitutions of 
               <br />
               the provinces of Quebec and Ontario have 
               <br />
               been granted by that same authority. In 
               <br />
               the same way, the constitution of these new 
               <br />
               provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan will 
               <br />
               have been granted to them by us. Now.

               Mr. Speaker, although. under these circum— 
               <br />
               stances. the position of the various states 
               <br />
               is much stronger than that of the federal 
               <br />
               power; although the people of each state 
               <br />
               have the right to adopt their own constitu-

               <br />
               with a constitution providing that slavery 
               <br />
               might be maintained for ever within its 
               <br />
               territory. Congress refused to admit that 
               <br />
               state into its union unless a contrary pro— 
               <br />
               vision was inserted. The advocates of Mis- 
               <br />
               souri objected : You are interfering with the 
               <br />
               principle in state sovereignty : you are inter- 
               <br />
               fering with the principle in virtue of which 
               <br />
               the people of each state are entitled to frame 
               <br />
               their own constitution. The wise men of 
               <br />
               the Republic answered : Above the principle 
               <br />
               of state sovereignty there stands the still 
               <br />
               more sacred principle of individual freedom.
