               advice to the people of these new provinces 
               <br />
               ——and perhaps I may venture to do so with 
               <br />
               the experience we have had in the prOvince 
               <br />
               ot' Quebec—it is this, that if they wish to 
               <br />
               promote the best interests of those great 
               <br />
               provinces, if they wish to have a happy,

               feel that they are safe in the enjoyment

               <br />
               of equal rights for all time. If the people

               Now, Sir, some things have been said,

               in the press perhaps more than in this

               made tending to create the impression that

               in this instance he has been inﬂuenced 
               <br />
               by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact</span> that he is a Roman Catholic

               this country, not only by his executive and

               administrative ability, but from the fact 
               <br />
               that no public man in this country—every 
               <br />
               one knows it, it is recognized everywhere 
               <br />
               -—no public man in this country has ever

               done so much as he has done to make the
