               ' Now, I have occupied more of the time 
               <br />
               of the House than I had intended to. As I 
               <br />
               started at the outset, I feel that this is a 
               <br />
               very troublesome question, it is a question 
               <br />
               that we should approach without feeling, a 
               <br />
               question that We should approach as Cana- 
               <br />
               dians and deal with in the way we consider 
               <br />
               most likely to promote the interest of our 
               <br />
               common country. We have debated this 
               <br />
               question a long time and, from all accounts, 
               <br />
               we are likely to debate it for some time 
               <br />
               longer. I would like to have seen some 
               <br />
               way to have the question settled. The way 
               <br />
               I have suggested, I think, is one that would 
               <br />
               meet with the approval of the country. I do 
               <br />
               not believe that Canadians want an issue of 
               <br />
               this kind. We do not want to be compelled 
               <br />
               to discuss again the issues raised years ago 
               <br />
               in this Dominion. We want to settle these 
               <br />
               matter fairly and squarely. Surely we are 
               <br />
               able to meet in a fair spirit of compromise. 
               <br />
               For my part, I believe that the minority, if 
               <br />
               they are constitutionally right, have made a 
               <br />
               fair compromise from their standpoint. They 
               <br />
               have accepted amendments of this Bill 
               <br />
               which do away, as I believe, with all possi- 
               <br />
               bility of having clerical schools, of having 
               <br />
               what they consider separate schools, and 
               <br />
               which simply gives to them the same right 
               <br />
               that every other citizen in the Northwest 
               <br />
               has of participating in a national system 
               <br />
               of schools and in the right of teaching reli- 
               <br />
               gion—and they conscientiously consider that 
               <br />
               to be a right which they should have, and 
               <br />
               one which should be carried out in the edu— 
               <br />
               cation of the youth. ‘I repeat, we should be 
               <br />
               able to deal with this question in a fair 
               <br />
               spirit of compromise. I should be very 
               <br />
               sorry to see in this Dominion an election on 
               <br />
               these issues. We had these issues years ago, 
               <br />
               and I had fondly hoped that the day had 
               <br />
               passed when they would arise in Canada 
               <br />
               again. We had them in the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario but today we have harmony and peace 
               <br />
               and it is by harmony and peace that this 
               <br />
               great confederation can be welded into a 
               <br />
               union one and inseparable. And I wish to 
               <br />
               say this: That the Protestants of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario, I believe, are just as gen- 
               <br />
               erous, just as liberal as any other class in 
               <br />
               the Dominion of Canada. And I want to 
               <br />
               say just one word to my French Canadian 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intends,</span> some of whom, no doubt, feel that 
               <br />
               the Conservative party were not as liberal, 
               <br />
               not as ready to squarely concede their rights 
               <br />
               as the Liberal party were. I want simply 
               <br />
               to say that it remained for the Conservative 
               <br />
               party of the province of Ontario to place 
               <br />
               Dr. Rheaume as one of the ministers of the 
               <br />
               Crown for that province. A great deal has 
               <br />
               been said in this debate which, I think, 
               <br />
               might better have been left unsaid. It is

               <br />
               French Canadian people. Every Canadian 
               <br />
               who has read the history of his country 
               <br />
               knows that we owe a great deal to the 
               <br />
               French Canadians. Every such Canadian 
               <br />
               knows that we owe a great deal to the hier— 
               <br />
               archy, that have been—I will not say abus- 
               <br />
               ed—but of which many things have been 
               <br />
               said in this House. When we go back in 
               <br />
               history to the beginning of confederation, 
               <br />
               where then was :the hierarchy to be found ? 
               <br />
               They were united in the effort to consoli- 
               <br />
               date and build up the Dominion of Canada. 
               <br />
               If they issued any pastoral at that time, it 
               <br />
               was issued to their own people and in sup- 
               <br />
               port of the men who were standing out to 
               <br />
               have a united Canada. But it is unneces- 
               <br />
               sary for me to say any of these things. 
               <br />
               Every Canadian knows that we owe a great

               <br />
               are generous, and I believe that when this 
               <br />

               of the House as a new member in discussing 
               <br />
               this Bill, a measure of so great importance,

               an interest so extraordinary, so unusual and

               sability of this parliament retaining in its 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tionî</span> clauses in the Bill. Regarding the 
               <br />
               question of the lands, 1 have not given the

               a series that I have received from the same 
               <br />
               gentleman in the course of a business cor— 
               <br />
               respondence. It is dated on the 2nd of

               January, before any one in this country
