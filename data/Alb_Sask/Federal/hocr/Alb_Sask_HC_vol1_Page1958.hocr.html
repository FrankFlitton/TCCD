               <br />
               given to the 16 and the 9 constituencies. 
               <br />
               There are 31,000 homestead entries in the 
               <br />
               16 constituencies in the south as compared

               to one portion of the province and 9 
               <br />

               tion has increased in the same ratio as the 
               <br />

               <br />
               is 1,550, and in the 9 constituencies in the 
               <br />
               northern part of the province, 1,425. There 
               <br />
               is not, it is true, absolute equality of popu- 
               <br />
               lation. It would be difﬁcult, if not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impos—</span> 
               <br />
               sible to work that out. But when you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con—'</span> 
               <br />
               sider 1,200 on the voters’ list in the lowest 
               <br />
               division and 1,825 in the highest division, 
               <br />
               and compare that with what is proposed by 
               <br />
               the government with respect to Humboldt 
               <br />
               and Redberry on the one hand and Souris 
               <br />
               and South Qu’Appelle on the other hand, it 
               <br />
               seems to me absolutely obvious that it is 
               <br />
               possible without any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty,</span> to make 
               <br />
               a fairer and more equitable distribution of 
               <br />
               seats in this province than is proposed by 
               <br />
               this Bill. I regret that the efforts made to 
               <br />
               bring about some compromise with regard to 
               <br />
               this vexed matter have not been successful. 
               <br />
               1 am bound to say that I think that my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Qu’Appeile is not in fault 
               <br />
               in that regard, because while he has strong 
               <br />
               opinions on this question, I have always 
               <br />
               found him moderate in his views and wil- 
               <br />
               ling to accept any reasonable compromise. 
               <br />
               I do not think that the distribution proposed 
               <br />
               by the government in Saskatchewan is any 
               <br />
               tetter than that in Alberta. I say that for 
               <br />
               the information of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott). I think that 
               <br />
               they are_very much alike, except that, if 
               <br />
               possible, there is even a greater discrepancy 
               <br />
               between Humboldt and Souris in Saskatche— 
               <br />
               wan than any that is to be found in the 
               <br />
               province of Alberta, if we accept the evid- 
               <br />
               ence of the Minister of the Interior as to 
               <br />
               the northern ridings of the province. It is 
               <br />
               perfectly obvious that no principle was
