               few moments ago I referred to the sugges-

               tion of the hon. member for Hamilton. 1

               much that this whole matter had been 
               <br />
               brought into the House cut and dried, decid- 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and.</span> that the door was practically closed

               tion than that which is set forth in these 
               <br />
               Bills. I confess that I am rather in fav- 
               <br />
               our of two provinces than one, but one 
               <br />
               province might have been created now and 
               <br />
               another some years hence. We need not 
               <br />
               talk about provincial autonomy, because 
               <br />
               we are not giving autonomy to these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. We ought to forget that term; 
               <br />
               we are only giving them partial autonomy ; 
               <br />
               we should call it provincial autonomy limit- 
               <br />
               ed, because at the best we are limiting the 
               <br />
               powers of these provinces. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">With»</span> regard to

               the amendment proposed by the hon. mem-

               apprehend it fully. I understand that he

               proposes to make two provinces out, of the 
               <br />
               southern portion of the territory allotted for 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan and Alberta. I may say

               that I do not approve of that. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Although</span> 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has, I dare say, made

               the motion in perfect good faith, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> say

               here and now that I am not able to support 
               <br />
               it, because I think the provinces would be 
               <br />
               entirely too small. We are over-governed at 
               <br />
               the present time. Complaint has been made 
               <br />
               of the small size of the province of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba, and we do not want to create any 
               <br />
               more small provinces. I would much rather 
               <br />
               see both of these provinces extended to the 
               <br />
               northern boundary of Athabaska than to 
               <br />
               have them cut off at the 55th parallel of 
               <br />
               latitude. I say this in order to put my- 
               <br />
               self right in case there should be a vote 
               <br />

               Mr. CARVELL. I have listened to this 
               <br />
               discussion with considerable interest. It 
               <br />
               seems rather to grate upon the nerves of 
               <br />
               our hon. friends on the Conservative side 
               <br />
               of the House when an intimation ismade 
               <br />
               from the Minister of the Interior that a pro- 
               <br />
               cess of obstruction has been proposed and 
               <br />
               is taking place. I am a new member, and 
               <br />
               do not know what obstruction means ; but 
               <br />
               if the exhibition which We have seen dur— 
               <br />
               ing the last two days is not obstruction, 
               <br />
               I would like to know what is obstruction. 
               <br />
               We have been discussing section 1 of this 
               <br />
               Bill, which simply deﬁnes the boundaries of 
               <br />
               the province of Alberta, and the only valid 
               <br />
               objection which I have heard is that the 
               <br />
               eastern boundary of that province should 
               <br />
               be placed about sixty miles farther east, so 
               <br />
               that the province of Alberta would take 
               <br />
               in all the ranching country and leave the 
               <br />
               agricultural country to the province of Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan. But it has been shown that that 
               <br />
               would not make any difference. The only 
               <br />
               ’valid reason I have heard advanced in sup— 
               <br />
               port of that objection has been that there

               has been given in support of that objec-

               <br />
               take away the rights of the-opposition; 
               <br />
               we will not allow them to talk. Then we are 
               <br />
               told that the people in that part of the 
               <br />
               country ought not to have representation 
               <br />
               in a provincial legislature, and in the next 
               <br />
               breath we are told that they have repre- 
               <br />
               sentation now in the territorial legislature 
               <br />
               and are entitled to representation in this 
               <br />
               House. Now, I would like to know what 
               <br />
               is the trouble with the opposition ? I am 
               <br />
               asking this honestly; I want information 
               <br />
               on this subject. There must be something 
               <br />
               rankliug in the breasts of the hon. gen- 
               <br />

               House which they are not giving to the 
               <br />

               mated that there was some political reason.
