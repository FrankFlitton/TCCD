               <br />
               that speech, as he intended no doubt, he 
               <br />
               aroused the enthusiasm of the gentlemen 
               <br />
               behind him. After the manner of an ortho— 
               <br />
               dox sermon, he divided his speech into 
               <br />
               three parts : ﬁrst, that all could read, and 
               <br />
               therefore the inference was that all should 
               <br />
               understand thoroughly the meaning and the 
               <br />
               purport of this Bill, when only a few mo- 
               <br />
               ments before that the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               had said that he did not wish to give an ex- 
               <br />
               planation to this House because he had not 
               <br />
               his papers with him, and that he wanted an 
               <br />
               opportunity to get his papers and to collect 
               <br />
               his thoughts so that he might give us the 
               <br />
               meaning of the Bill. Now, that remark of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance, it appeared to me, 
               <br />
               came with a charming grace from that gen— 
               <br />
               tleman, when he stated no longer ago than 
               <br />
               yesterday that upon this question he had 
               <br />
               given his political conscience into the keep- 
               <br />
               ing of the Minister of Justice. His second 
               <br />
               head was that the hon. member for Toronto 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster) had lost his exactness. Let me 
               <br />
               tell the Minister of Finance that in this 
               <br />
               legislation he has met with a more serious 
               <br />
               loss than the hon. member for North Toron- 
               <br />
               to; he has lost his political consistency. 
               <br />
               Then my hon. friend the Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance said : look at the election of the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Edmonton, the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior (Mr. Oliver). Will the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior rise in his place and say that he 
               <br />
               was elected as a cabinet minister because of 
               <br />
               the legislation that is proposed by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment with respect to the new provinces? 
               <br />
               No, Sir ; I have yet to learn that the Minis— 
               <br />
               ter of. the Interior has made any such state- 
               <br />
               ment as that. But the most extraordinary 
               <br />
               part of the discussion was a point made 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice that the proposed 
               <br />
               amendment tabled by the First Minister 
               <br />
               was not, under the rules of the House, 
               <br />
               before the committee, and would not be 
               <br />
               before the committee until it had been 
               <br />
               moved by the First Minister. What did we 
               <br />
               vote on? Was it'upon clause 16 as origin- 
               <br />
               ally introduced, or upon clause 16 as pro- 
               <br />
               posed to be amended by the First Minister ? 
               <br />
               What made it possible for the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance to stand with his leader? Was it 
               <br />
               clause 16 as originally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introduced.</span> or clause 
               <br />
               16 as proposed to be amended by the First 
               <br />
               Minister ? Evidently there is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misappl‘e‘</span>

               <br />
               told by the Minister of Justice yesterday 
               <br />
               so as to harmonize himself with the Min-

               clause 16 as proposed to be amended by the

               kind? Did they vote on the original Bill ?

               Did the members from the west vote on the

               original Bill as introduced by the First Min-

               brought back to the fold the hon. member 
               <br />

               <br />
               language, but to myway of thinking it is 
               <br />
               imposing on the credulity of the members 
               <br />

               <br />
               Justice was discussing clause 16 as originally 
               <br />
               introduced, which we never intended to dis- 
               <br />
               cuss or vote upon. I rather concur in the 
               <br />
               view of my hon. friend from North Toronto 
               <br />
               that we should not be hard on the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice, that we should give him time to 
               <br />
               collect his thoughts and his papers, and to 
               <br />
               give to this House a full and accurate state- 
               <br />
               ment as to the meaning of clause 16 as pro- 
               <br />
               posed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> be amended by the First Minister— 
               <br />
               the difference between the Bill as ﬁrst intro-

               duced and the Bill as it is now proposed to 
               <br />
               amend it. If the Minister of Justice gives 
               <br />
               his attention to that as a lawyer, and gives 
               <br />
               his best judgment and opinion to the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House, it will at all events

               follow the constitutional opinion of the Min-

               ister of Justice—and he is capable of giving 
               <br />
               lt—I think they will feel that there is some- 
               <br />
               thing more in this legislation than is sug-
