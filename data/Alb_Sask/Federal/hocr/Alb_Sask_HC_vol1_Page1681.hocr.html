               to the hon. minister a map which will show 
               <br />
               him exactly what we propose. A little 
               <br />
               while ago there was a return brought down 
               <br />
               to this House stating that there was only 
               <br />
               one monthly post office service ill that coun- 
               <br />
               try, and giving all the points at which it 
               <br />
               touched. If you follow that route, you will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that it leaves Athabaska Landing, goes 
               <br />
               to the Lesser Slave lake settlement, then to 
               <br />
               Peace River Landing. Spirit river alld Dun- 
               <br />
               vegan, and that the entire route falls with- 
               <br />
               in the area I have described. Moreover. it 
               <br />
               is the only section of the country where 
               <br />
               there are any mail routes and any transport- 
               <br />
               ation. The Peace River valley will lie en— 
               <br />
               tirely Within that constituency. Further 
               <br />
               than that, the line ot the Grand Trunk Paci- 
               <br />
               ﬁc will lie entirely within it. There is pract- 
               <br />
               ically nothing outside of that area. Con- 
               <br />
               sequently, my contention is simply this, that 
               <br />
               if you'create north of the old Alberta line a 
               <br />
               constituency of the same size as St. Albert, 
               <br />
               you can include therein everything worth 
               <br />
               including in the southwestern part of the 
               <br />
               present territory of Athabaska. What would 
               <br />
               be left if you did that? There would be 
               <br />
               nothing left except a few scattered people. 
               <br />
               not sufﬁciently numerous- to be organized. 
               <br />

               day, when I referred as a precedent to the 
               <br />
               addition of Ashllanipi to the county of 
               <br />
               Saguenay, stated that there were no people 
               <br />
               there. According to the last census. Ash- 
               <br />
               nanipi ill 1901 had 161 whites. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">According</span> 
               <br />
               to the same census all Athabaska had only 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">243</span> whites. alld yet we are only dealing with 
               <br />
               the half of Athabaska. The probability is 
               <br />
               that it contains no more whites than Ash- 
               <br />
               nanipi. Yet there has never been a question 
               <br />
               of organizing Ashnanipi. and nobody has 
               <br />
               felt that there was any grievance ill conse-

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I think the

               House is familiar with the ﬁgures and the 
               <br />

               treal (Mr. Allies) has just repeated, though

               I do not blame him. for repeating thelll

               more people in the 11 constituencies south 
               <br />

               according to the votes registered at the
