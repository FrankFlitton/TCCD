               the rules of the House. In 1875 the prin-

               <br />
               and so far as it could be settled under the

               provisional legislation of that time. Under 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875 a system of schools was 
               <br />
               created by an ordinance of the Territories ; 
               <br />
               and to that system of schools so created, 
               <br />
               certain pecuniary allowances were made. 
               <br />
               This Bill is intended for no other purpose, 
               <br />
               in so far as I am concerned, than to give 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂect</span> to that provision of the Act of 1875 
               <br />
               and the conditions of the ordinances now in 
               <br />

               I am quite sure that I have trespassed on 
               <br />
               the attention of the Honse far beyond the 
               <br />
               limits I originally assigned to myself, but I 
               <br />
               would like to say a word in conclusion. My 
               <br />
               11011. friend the member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster) has spoken of the 500,000 peo- 
               <br />
               ple in the Northwest who ought to be con- 
               <br />
               sulted. I have no desire to introduce un-

               necessarily controversial matter, but I ask 
               <br />
               him in all earnestness—and when I do so 
               <br />
               I ask him to remember the speeches he made 
               <br />
               in this House in 1896 which I read then 
               <br />
               and have read only quite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recently—VI</span> ask 
               <br />
               him in all earnestness; have we no regard 
               <br />
               to pay in the settlement of that delicate 
               <br />
               question, to the opinion, the honest Con-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">victions</span> of over forty per cent of the popu— 
               <br />
               lation of this Dominion ? I say that there 
               <br />
               are deep seated prejudices being aroused. 
               <br />
               passions being inﬂamed, and the desire, I 
               <br />
               am quite convinced, of every man in this

               House is that peace should reign supreme 
               <br />
               throughout this land. All I say now, and 
               <br />
               I speak for myself, is that there can be no 
               <br />
               peace except that peace which is based on 
               <br />
               justice; there can be no peace expect that 
               <br />
               peace which is based on equal rights and

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respect</span> for the honest convictions of every

               Mr. Speaker, the government are at least 
               <br />
               to be congratulated on the fact that at 
               <br />

               <br />
               ready to stand behind them and perhaps it 
               <br />
               may be that there is some truth in the 
               <br />
               rumour that the hon. Minister of Justice 
               <br />
