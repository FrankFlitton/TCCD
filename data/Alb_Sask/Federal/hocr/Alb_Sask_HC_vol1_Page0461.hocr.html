               Well, Sir, why does not the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Toronto still believe in the con- 
               <br />
               stitution? I have always understood that a 
               <br />
               man who had principles and who believed in 
               <br />
               his principles stuck to them and tried to 
               <br />
               convince the people that they were wrong 
               <br />
               and not be convinced by the people that he 
               <br />
               was wrong. I think the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Toronto has been long enough in poli- 
               <br />
               tics and has been long enough in this par-lia- 
               <br />
               ment not to allow himself, when he believed 
               <br />
               that he had the right view of the question, 
               <br />
               and when he believed in the right of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>

               minority, to be convinced that he was wrong 
               <br />
               even by a thrice expressed opinion on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               part of the people, especially so, when dur- 
               <br />
               ing the elections of 1900 and 1904, that ques- 
               <br />
               tion was not in the least talked of. My hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend</span> from Ottawa (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Belrcourt)</span> was 
               <br />
               quite right the other day when he said that 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               changed his mind because he found 
               <br />
               that his former view was not to his 
               <br />
               political advantage and it did not pay. 
               <br />
               These are the principles of hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen on the other side of the House. They 
               <br />
               have principles but they cannot stick to 
               <br />
               them. They do n0t believe in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> thing that 
               <br />
               does not pay and is not to their political ad- 
               <br />
               vantage. It is not the statesmen who try 
               <br />
               to enlighten the mob, but it is the mob that 
               <br />
               tries to enlighten the political statesmen of

               Mr. Speaker, when the Northwest Terri-

               tories entered the union they came under 
               <br />
               the principle of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act which is the basis of confederation and 
               <br />
               which is the principle upon which all the 
               <br />
               sovereign states have met to form this con- 
               <br />
               federation. This was the principle and it 
               <br />
               was so well understood that when a law 
               <br />
               was passed relating to separate schools in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories it met, in the 
               <br />
               House of Commons, with little if any oppo- 
               <br />
               sition. The men of that time, the Blakes, 
               <br />
               the Mackenzies, and Sir John Macdonald un— 
               <br />
               derstood perhaps better than our hon. friends 
               <br />
               to-day what was the spirit of the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion because they were closer to it. Were 
               <br />
               there any doubt left in the minds of hon.

               gentlemen about the right of the Catholics of 
               <br />

               <br />
               schools the law of 1875 should remove it 
               <br />
               immediately. That law, which I need not 
               <br />
               read to the House, as has been said by my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Beauharnois (Mr. Berge- 
               <br />
               ron), is the law of to-day. That law was 
               <br />
               passed under the provisions of section 93 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act. it is the 
               <br />
               law of to-day and the meaning of the Brit- 
               <br />
               ish North America Act is that when separate 
               <br />
               schools have been established they have been 
               <br />
               established for good. Why was it that the 
               <br />
               law of. 1875 was passed ‘? Was it not passed 
               <br />
               at the request of the Protestant minority in 
               <br />

               rity of the west ? When that law was pass- 
               <br />
               ed by parliament, the Protestant minority as 
               <br />
               it then existed believed that the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories would be a second province of 
               <br />
               Quebec and that the French Catholics would 
               <br />
               have a majority there. That is so clear that 
               <br />
               you cannot ﬁnd any speech against it, not 
               <br />
               even a speech by George Brown himself, and 
               <br />
               I defy hon. gentlemen opposite to show me 
               <br />
               one single article in the Protestant papers 
               <br />
               of that time against the law of 1875. What 
               <br />
               was the attitude of the ‘ Globe ’ then ? Can 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd a single word in the ‘ Globe ’ of 1875 
               <br />
               against the law which gave separate schools 
               <br />
               to the minority of the Northwest Territories? 
               <br />
               Nor, can we ﬁnd a single word of protest in 
               <br />
               the ‘Mnil.’ which, I believe. is the organ of 
               <br />
               the Conservative party to-day. Well Sir,
