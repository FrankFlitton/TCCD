               of the minor points. The government has 
               <br />
               been criticised in some quarters for pro— 
               <br />
               posing that there should be two provinces 
               <br />
               instead of only one. As a resident of these 
               <br />
               Territories I admit that it would be very 
               <br />
               pleasant for us to feel that we had the ban- 
               <br />
               ner province of the Dominion, .that we over- 
               <br />
               shadowed our lesser neighbours, and that 
               <br />
               the time would come When we would Wield 
               <br />
               a tremendous inﬂuence in the affairs of the 
               <br />
               nation. But in the business things of life 
               <br />
               there is more to be considered than senti- 
               <br />
               ment. I maintain that that immense terri- 
               <br />
               tory would be too much for any single pro- 
               <br />
               vincial government to handle. We know that 
               <br />
               when the premier of a province is forming 
               <br />
               his cabinet he takes his ministers from dif- 
               <br />
               ferent, parts of the province, but in the case 
               <br />
               of such an immense area as that of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories this would be utterly 
               <br />
               impossible. It is quite true that for some 
               <br />
               years past we have had an honest and a 
               <br />
               fairly capable government in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories but settlement is increasing, the 
               <br />
               population is getting larger, and I venture 
               <br />
               to assert that there are portions of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories that for the last two 
               <br />
               or three years have not been quite satisﬁed. 
               <br />

               <br />
               a representative in the cabinet. Then, again, 
               <br />
               some objection has been taken to the divid- 
               <br />
               ing line placing the fourth initial meridian 
               <br />
               as the boundary between the two provinces, 
               <br />
               but I believe that very good reasons can be 
               <br />
               given for the selection of that line. In the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place, it divides the Territories almost 
               <br />
               exactly in two, making the areas of the two 
               <br />
               provinces practically the same, and in the 
               <br />
               second place that line will be much more con- 
               <br />
               venient in describing property, &amp;c., as it is 
               <br />
               the beginning of a ner range. To my mind 
               <br />
               the only objection that can be offered at all 
               <br />
               to selecting that line, is, that it divides the 
               <br />
               ranching country, but I maintain that no 
               <br />
               matter where the line is drawn between 
               <br />
               these two provinces it would interfere with 
               <br />
               some particular interest. Even if the di— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">riding</span> line were placed 60 miles further 
               <br />
               east it would still divide the ranching coun- 
               <br />
               try. I anticipate very little trouble from 
               <br />
               the clashing of herd laws or the branding 
               <br />
               regulations. The stockmen of southern Al-

               berta and of western Assiniboia will still 
               <br />
               have common interests, and even with the 
               <br />
               two provinces their associations will still 
               <br />
               continue to do the work they have been 
               <br />
               doing.

               most important features of this Bill, the one 
               <br />
               relating to the ownership of the lands. These

               residents of the proposed provinces who

               the immigrants that are going to the west 
               <br />

               <br />
               resident of the proposed province of Alberta 
               <br />
               and I have unbounded faith in the future 
               <br />
               of that province, but at the same time I 
               <br />
               think it is best for Canada as a whole and 
               <br />
               best for Alberta, that the immigration liter— 
               <br />
               ature should go out from the government 
               <br />
               of Canada, that our immigration agents in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerent</span> parts of the world should be 
               <br />
               Canadian agents, and that the immigrants 
               <br />
               who come to this country should be guided 
               <br />
               by Canadian ofﬁcials. I would dislike very 
               <br />
               much to see any great change made in the 
               <br />
               immigration policy of the government. 
               <br />
               Those of us who lived in the west before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               that policy was inaugurated know only too 
               <br />
               well the condition of affairs at that time.
