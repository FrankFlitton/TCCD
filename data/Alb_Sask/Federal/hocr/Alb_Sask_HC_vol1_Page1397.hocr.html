               the French polls. The German polls gave a

               <br />
               tions worked out approximately in this way: 
               <br />
               At the English—speaking polls, the vote was 
               <br />
               2 to 1 ; the half-breeds 2 to 1; the Galicians 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2;</span> to 1; the French polls, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir</span> to 1 and the 
               <br />
               German polls, 6 to 1. And I may mention 
               <br />
               that the Germans at these polls are all 
               <br />
               Protestants. Regarding religious divisions, 
               <br />
               these. of course, can only be given approxi- 
               <br />
               mately. .But, as I have lived in that country 
               <br />
               the greater part of my life, I may claim to 
               <br />
               be somewhat familiar with the conditions. 
               <br />
               I ﬁgure that there are about 2,535 of the 
               <br />
               English-speaking votes, Protestants, and 
               <br />
               about 300 Catholics. Of the French 565 are 
               <br />
               Catholic. or the Germans 365 are Protes- 
               <br />
               tants; of the half-breeds about one-quarter 
               <br />
               are Protestants—that is 125 Protestants to 
               <br />
               about 400 Catholics ; the Galicians, 780, about 
               <br />
               half or a little less, belong to the united 
               <br />
               Greek Church. which is, to a certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extent,</span> 
               <br />
               afﬁliated with the Church of Rome, but they 
               <br />
               are not Roman Catholics, and the remaining 
               <br />
               half are of the Orthodox Greek Church. 
               <br />
               which has no more connection with the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic church than has the English 
               <br />
               church or any other Protestant denomina- 
               <br />
               tion. So, as I judge the total might be 
               <br />
               counted as being made up of 3,116 Protes- 
               <br />
               tant-s and 1,265 Catholics. Crediting half 
               <br />
               the Galicians to the Roman Catholic church 
               <br />
               and half to the non-Roman churches. which. 
               <br />
               in this case may be classed together, there 
               <br />
               are 1,655. Roman Catholics, and 3.406 others, 
               <br />
               whom, to include them all under one name, 
               <br />
               we may speak of in this case as Protestants, 
               <br />
               or a Protestant majority of 2 to 1. These 
               <br />
               are the facts as I read them, and I put them 
               <br />

               back up their challenges and threats by

               action when they were given the opportunity,

               Now, in. regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> character of 
               <br />
               the people. The city of Edmonton cast 
               <br />
               a total of 1,343 'votes. The city of 
               <br />
               Edmonton is admitted to be if not the 
               <br />
               most rapidll‘ly progressing place in this 
               <br />
               Dominion, at least one of the most progres- 
               <br />
               sive. It is as thoroughly up-to—date as is 
               <br />
               the city of Ottawa or any other city in Can- 
               <br />
               ada so far as the appliances of civilization 
               <br />
               are concerned. It is second to no place of its 
               <br />
               size in the matter of trade and everything 
               <br />
               that goes to make a successful civilized com- 
               <br />
               munity. When hon. members of this House 
               <br />
               take pleasure—in belittling and discrediting 
               <br />
               the standing and enterprise of the people of 
               <br />
               that city and surrounding country, they are 
               <br />
               simply striking a blow at the most progres- 
               <br />
               sive part of their own country and are doing 
               <br />
               themselves very little credit by their action. 
               <br />
               And I think the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> Will give them very
