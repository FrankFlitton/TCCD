               when I say that it has been proposed with

               not only in its spirit but in its letter. So 
               <br />
               far as we are concerned there is no desire 
               <br />
               to antagonize any element of the commu-

               Single out any class in the community for 
               <br />
               special favours. We have. however, to bear 
               <br />
               in mind that there are obligations on this 
               <br />
               government which'the government cannot 
               <br />
               refuse to accept the responsibility of. It 
               <br />
               would be very poor statesmanship, it would 
               <br />
               be a very paltry thing. if, by simply shut—

               <br />
               would attempt to get rid of it. I shall not

               detain the House at any length; I shall 
               <br />
               merely deal with the question of the land 
               <br />
               and clause 16. and leave the question of the 
               <br />
               distribution of seats to the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior and other hon. gentlemen. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) has said that 
               <br />
               with respect to the land we are departing 
               <br />
               from the principle laid down by the British 
               <br />

               <br />
               with my hon. friend on that, and I submit 
               <br />
               to the House that there is absolutely no

               perties, they to become the property of 
               <br />
               the Dominion; and can any man to-day 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dispute</span> our title to those properties? Now, 
               <br />
               where is the analogy between the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case</span> of 
               <br />
               a province which has its property vested 
               <br />
               in the province, coming into confederation 
               <br />
               and retaining control of that property except 
               <br />
               the part which it gives up to the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada, and the property of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories, which to-day is the pro- 
               <br />
               p‘erty of the people of the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada ? How can you compare the two ? 
               <br />
               How can you draw any argument from 
               <br />
               the British North America Act to make 
               <br />
               it applicable to the case in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hand?</span> That 
               <br />
               is not all. Mr. Speaker. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               says we ought to observe the constitution. 
               <br />
               The constitution of this country is not only, 
               <br />
               strictly speaking, the terms of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, but is, as I conceive it, 
               <br />
               the written constitution together with that 
               <br />
