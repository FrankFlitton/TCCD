               same school system as the system that was 
               <br />
               abolished by the ordinance of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories in 1892. The two were 
               <br />
               abolished almost at the same time; but 
               <br />
               I am bound to say that our friends in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories succeeded in getting 
               <br />
               their reform with a good deal less difﬁculty 
               <br />
               and a good deal less turmoil that did the 
               <br />
               little province of Manitoba. If hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men will look at the documents relating to 
               <br />
               the suit that took place between the pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba and the Dominion, or if 
               <br />
               they will look at the speeches that were 
               <br />
               made by men speaking on behalf of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince and who know the circumstances of 
               <br />
               the case, they will ﬁnd that, although I 
               <br />
               myself and others took strong ground against 
               <br />
               the principle of separation in education—and 
               <br />
               my opinions upon that subject are just as 
               <br />
               strong to-day as they were then——although 
               <br />
               we took strong ground upon that principle, 
               <br />
               yet the attacks we made were not so much 
               <br />
               on that account as they were on account 
               <br />
               of the fact that the separate school sys- 
               <br />
               tem of the province was admittedly inefﬁ- 
               <br />
               cient, and that children were being allowed 
               <br />
               by thousands to grow up in absolute ignor- 
               <br />
               ance and illiteracy. That was the ground 
               <br />
               upon which we attacked that system. We 
               <br />
               said then: Your system is inefﬁcient; you 
               <br />
               have taken the public money and you have 
               <br />
               not applied it for the purpose of giving the 
               <br />
               children the education they ought to have; 
               <br />
               and we pointed to the fact that in districts 
               <br />
               where this clerically controlled system had 
               <br />
               been in force, the children had grown up 
               <br />
               in ignorance and the population was illiter- 
               <br />
               ate, and that fact could not be disputed. 
               <br />
               Sir, my hon. friend the Minister of Ous- 
               <br />
               toms, speaking last night, referred to the 
               <br />
               fact <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it was said that the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba had been harsh in abolishing that 
               <br />
               system. Well, Sir, I am here to say that 
               <br />
               you cannot abolish abuses of that kind 
               <br />
               by handling people with k'id gloves. 1 am 
               <br />
               here to say that if there is any act in my 
               <br />
               public life I am proud of, it is the fact that 
               <br />
               I was one of those who helped to abolish that 
               <br />
               system of education in Manitoba in the 
               <br />
               year 1890. I know perfectly well that I am 
               <br />
               speaking upon a subject upon which there 
               <br />
               may not be very much unanimity of op- 
               <br />
               inion; but I claim the right to have my 
               <br />
               own opinion on this subject, and I do not 
               <br />
               think that any man in this House, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Roman</span> 
               <br />
               Catholic or Protestant, will think any the 
               <br />
               less of me because I have the courage to 
               <br />
               state what I think. Although that was the 
               <br />
               fact, and although my hon. friend who sits 
               <br />
               opposite, the member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster), was one of those who tried to 
               <br />
               restore that ineﬂicient system and compel 
               <br />
               us again to bring about a condition of affairs 
               <br />
               in which the public money would be wasted 
               <br />
               and a proper system of education would not 
               <br />
               be given to the children, they failed in that 
               <br />
               attempt. And" why did they fail ? They fail-

               <br />
               unfortunately I do not often agree, and

               many others, left their party upon that ques- 
               <br />
               tion and stood for what I believe to be 
               <br />
               the proper principle, and I venture to think 
               <br />
               that the gentlemen who did so will always 
               <br />
               be remembered as having on that important 
               <br />
               occasion done what they believed to be 
               <br />
               right, though contrary to the interests of" 
               <br />
               their party. But my right hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister did not take the stand he did 
               <br />
               because he necessarily agreed with the views 
               <br />
               that I entertained, and that we in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba entertained upon that 
               <br />
               subject. As I understand the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, he has always been an advocate 
               <br />
               in principle of separate schools, he does 
               <br />
               not dispute that. But he did dispute the 
               <br />
               moral right of the gentlemen who then cou- 
               <br />
               trolled the administration of Canada to

               override the deliberate judgment of the

               people of Manitoba upon a matter which 
               <br />
               was vital to them, and which we in the pro-

               vince of Manitoba knew very much more 
               <br />

               Now, notwithstanding the fact that our 
               <br />
               opinions upon that subject were so strong,

               through a violent contest, a contest in which 
               <br />
               the feelings of men were deeply aroused,

               nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend

               from Selkirk (Mr. Greenway) then the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of Manitoba and my leader, 
               <br />
               and myself, at that time, prior to the year 
               <br />
               1896, recognized the fact that it was neces- 
               <br />
               sary in some of these cases to compromise, 
               <br />
               that we could not expect to have, alto- 
               <br />
               gether and at all times, our own opinions 
               <br />
               carried out to the fullest possible extent. 
               <br />
               When the government of Sir Charles Tupper 
               <br />
               sent commissioners to the province of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba for the purpose of discusssing this ques- 
               <br />
               tion with us, the commissioners consisting of 
               <br />
               Lord Strathcona, then Sir ‘Donald A. Smith, 
               <br />
               the late Mr. Dickey and Senator Desjar- 
               <br />
               dins—when they were sent up for the 'pur- 
               <br />
               pose of discussing this question, I had the 
               <br />
               honour of being appointed with one of 
               <br />
               my colleagues, Mr. Cameron, to discuss 
               <br />
               the question with them. We then recognized 
               <br />
               the fact that a compromise of some kind 
               <br />
               would probably have to be adopted in the 
               <br />
               end, and we made certain proposals to these 
               <br />
               gentlemen looking to a compromise with 
               <br />
               the view of meeting the wishes of our Ro-

               whatever our private disposition might be, 
               <br />
               yet by reason of the pledges we had made 
               <br />
               to the people of the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               in the election we had just gone through, 
               <br />
               we could not possibly compromise upon the
