               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NOW,</span> Sir, what authority had the Minister 
               <br />
               of Agriculture to make such a statement in 
               <br />
               this House, a statement that will be sent 
               <br />
               broadcast throughout the country ? What 
               <br />
               he has said is utterly without foundation. 
               <br />
               There has been no attempt in this House, 
               <br />
               nor have I heard of any movement in this 
               <br />
               country which would justify any one in 
               <br />
               coming to the conclusion that we desire to 
               <br />
               do away with separate schools in Canada. I 
               <br />
               would like to have the minister furnish even 
               <br />
               one particle of truth to substantiate this 
               <br />
               statement. Are the members of the Con- 
               <br />
               servative party trying to do away With 
               <br />
               separate schools in Ontario or in Quebec 
               <br />
               where the separate schools are guaranteed 
               <br />
               under the constitution ? Or are they trying 
               <br />
               to do away with separate schools in any 
               <br />
               other province ? Not a bit of it, and I regret 
               <br />
               that a minister of the Crown charged with 
               <br />
               the great responsibilities that the hon. Min- 
               <br />
               of Agriculture is charged with should have 
               <br />
               made such a statement and that it should

               have been spread broadcast in the way it 
               <br />
               has been over this country.

               In discussing this question, as I have 
               <br />
               said, the situation in the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec has been brought into the debates on 
               <br />
               many occasions. The situation in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec is unique. It is entirely 
               <br />
               different from the situation in any other 
               <br />
               province in this country. We have, in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec, an almost solid French 
               <br />
               Canadian population which is Catholic and 
               <br />
               there is no mixture of Protestants and 
               <br />
               Catholics in the greater portion of that 
               <br />
               province. There is a mixture of Protes- 
               <br />
               tants and Catholics in the Eastern town- 
               <br />
               ships, but, so far as the great majority of 
               <br />
               the people are concerned, there is a solid 
               <br />
               Catholic and French population, and it is 
               <br />
               very easy in that province to regulate these 
               <br />
               matters. In making comparisons and in 
               <br />
               illustrating the situation I do not see how 
               <br />
               we can compare the situation in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec with the situation which 
               <br />
               will exist and which does exist in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories or in any other pro- 
               <br />
               vince in this country.

               I regret that this question has been 
               <br />
               brought into the arena of federal politics 
               <br />

               <br />
               been taken of overcoming the difﬁculty in 
               <br />
               some other manner. We have before us 
               <br />
               the example of Manitoba. We know What 
               <br />

               <br />
               ago and did not that illustration show us 
               <br />
               how impossible it was for this parliament 
               <br />
               to legislate with respect to this question with-

               agitation that we are experiencing in this 
               <br />

               <br />
               cause the government of Quebec knows 
               <br />
               better how to deal with that question than 
               <br />
               this federal parliament. But, what would 
               <br />
               be the position supposing the minority in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec were interfered 
               <br />
               with? How would the children of the 
               <br />
               minority be educated? How could they 
               <br />
               be educated? I will take this question up 
               <br />
               for a moment in order to reason it out with 
               <br />
               my fellow-countrymen in the province of

               <br />
               mine, yet whose views I respect, and to 
               <br />
               point out the different position that exists 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec from that which 
               <br />
               exists in other portions of Canada. In

               the province of Quebec the schools which 
               <br />
               are Catholic and which are suitable to the 
               <br />
               conditions which exist there are religious

               citing them for the purpose of criticising 
               <br />
               them, but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aim</span> citing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them,</span> because, in the 
               <br />
               discussion that has taken place, the posi- 
               <br />
               tion of the minority has been referred to so 
               <br />
               frequently and the question which I ask 
               <br />
               is: What would the minority do if the 
               <br />
               privileges which they now enjoy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">qwere</span> 
               <br />
               taken away from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them?</span> How could their 
               <br />
               privileges be taken away from them? If 
               <br />
               their privileges were taken away from them 
               <br />
