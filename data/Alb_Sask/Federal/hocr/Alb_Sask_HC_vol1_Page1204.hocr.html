               Mr. HAGGAR‘T. The cost of management

               the Minister of the Interior when the Grand

               Mr. TURRIFF. Over a year ago, I made 
               <br />
               an estimate of the amount of section lands 
               <br />

               <br />
               grants which railways had earned or would 
               <br />
               earn had been applied for, and I estimated 
               <br />
               that there would be probably 50,000,000 
               <br />
               acres of odd sections available. It would 
               <br />
               however be impossible, I think. for any one 
               <br />
               to put a value on that land, simply be-

               we do not know of what character it is.
