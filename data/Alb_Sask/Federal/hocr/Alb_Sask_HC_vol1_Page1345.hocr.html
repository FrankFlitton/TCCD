               Mr. FI‘TZPATRICK.- I would like to do 
               <br />
               that. If they are not entitled to ten 
               <br />
               members they ought not to have them and 
               <br />
               if they are entitled to more they ought 
               <br />
               to get them. Once they get the provincial 
               <br />
               status they should come in absolutely as- 
               <br />
               the other provinces. 
               <br />

               Mr. SPROULE. The principle We have

               <br />
