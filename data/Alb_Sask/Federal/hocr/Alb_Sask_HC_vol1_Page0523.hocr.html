               <br />
               Speaker, I did not intend to say anything 
               <br />
               on this subject just now, but for the 
               <br />
               frequent references to myself by the

               <br />
               They were very pointed. Whether he 
               <br />
               considered them offensive or not, to

               <br />
               they were uncalled for and nothing on 
               <br />
               my part, as far as my judgment en— 
               <br />
               ables me to determine, would justify the 
               <br />
               references which the hon. gentleman made 
               <br />
               to me. He started out by asking a very 
               <br />
               signiﬁcent question: Are we like the serfs 
               <br />
               of Russia that we have not freedom of 
               <br />
               speech in this House ? Are we ? The ex- 
               <br />
               hibition we had for the following twenty 
               <br />
               minutes is the best answer I can give to 
               <br />
               that question, because, if there ever was 
               <br />
               in any civilized country in the world, a de- 
               <br />
               sire to restrict freedom of speech the tirades 
               <br />
               to which he has treated this House, ought 
               <br />
               to have induced this House not to have lis- 
               <br />
               tened to him. Now, the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               went on to say that my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
               <br />
               and his party are opposing the Pope. What 
               <br />
               justiﬁcation had he for that statement? 
               <br />
               What word was ever said from this side 
               <br />
               of the House that would justify that state- 
               <br />
               ment ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Not</span> a single word that I have heard 
               <br />
               and none that I am aware of. But, he says 
               <br />
               that we are opposing his church. Was 
               <br />
               there anything said in the shape of abuse 
               <br />
               of his church ? There is no desire or in- 
               <br />
               tention to abuse his church, but our desire 
               <br />
               is to give that church its rights the same 
               <br />
               as every other church in the country and 
               <br />
               to respect its rights as much as we respect 
               <br />
               the rights of every other church. Then, 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman said: Has not every 
               <br />
               civilized government in the world its Papal 
               <br />
               representative, its ambassador ? He asks 
               <br />
               the question which I can answer by telling 
               <br />
               him that there is not one in France <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to‘day.</span> 
               <br />
               Diplomatie relations have been broken off. 
               <br />
               Then, why should the hon. member for La- 
               <br />
               bell stand up and say that we are worse 
               <br />
               than France, that we are worse than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eng-</span> 
               <br />
               land and that we are worse than other 
               <br />
               countries? I could point to many coun- 
               <br />
               tries. even Italy itself, in which diplomatic 
               <br />
               relations do not exist between the Pope and 
               <br />
               the government. Do they exist in the 
               <br />
               United States ? Not at all. There is, it 
               <br />

               is true, a Papal representative, but to deal

               <br />
               state, and he has no relationship with the 
               <br />
               government of the United States and does 
               <br />
               not pretend to exercise any authority over,

               <br />
               matters of state. So that, in no civilized 
               <br />
               country that he has mentioned is there a

               gentleman claims is all right in this coun— 
               <br />
               try. There are a few questions which I 
               <br />
               think you might reasonably ask. We know 
               <br />
               that there is a Papal delegate here. That 
               <br />
               is a self evident fact, but we might ask 
               <br />
               the question: Who brought him here? 
               <br />
               Some one has stated that it was the pre- 
               <br />
               sent government. Well, I think that was 
               <br />
               too wide; I would say that the Reform 
               <br />
               party brought him here. The right hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the government (Sir Wilfrid Lau- 
               <br />
               rier) does not deny that he was one of the 
               <br />
               forty who sent an application to the Pope 
               <br />
               to send a delegate here. We are not object- 
               <br />
               ing to it and do not object to it it’ be con- 
               <br />
               ﬁnes his duties to the work that the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman told us was the work for 
               <br />
               which he was brought here. What was he 
               <br />
               brought here for? What did he come for ? 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman has told us what 
               <br />
               he came for. There was a difference be- 
               <br />
               tween us and the bishops of our church and 
               <br />
               it was to settle disputes between the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic people and their clergy. If he 
               <br />
               conﬁnes his operations to that I say we 
               <br />
               have no reasonable ground for complaint 
               <br />
               He has a right to be here and remain in this 
               <br />
               country just as long as he likes and so far 
               <br />
               as he can succeed in readjusting the differ- 
               <br />
               ences between the Roman Catholic people 
               <br />
               and their bishops it is nothing that concerns 
               <br />
               us and we do not desire to interfere with 
               <br />
               him in any way. Has he conﬁned his oper-

               seigneur Mery Del Val, the hon. member for

               Labelle stated that we have had several 
               <br />
               of them before. I believe there was one 
               <br />
               away back in the eighties but it was 
               <br />
               scarcely found out he was in the country 
               <br />
               until he was out of the country. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Labelle does not wait to hear 
               <br />
               any criticism that may be made of his re-

               marks or to answer any questions that may 
               <br />
               be asked of him. We know that he is a re- 
               <br />
               markably valiant man and that he displays 
               <br />
               a great deal of that peculiar grace which is 
               <br />
