               tened to a great many arguments, some of 
               <br />
               which, in spite of my good will, I have

               scarcely been able to consider as offered in

               to make out from all that has been said in

               opposition to the educational clauses of the 
               <br />
               Bill. The ﬁrst is on the ground of economy. 
               <br />
               It is cheaper to build and maintain one 
               <br />
               school than two; the second is based on a 
               <br />
               desire to bring about the disappearance of 
               <br />
               religious and racial differences.

               Well, I have just stated that whenever 
               <br />
               money is at stake, people are apt to be 
               <br />
               fairly broad, fairly generous, fairly liberal. 
               <br />
               Why should they not be broad, generotis 
               <br />
               and liberal as well when they have an addi-

               <br />
               would be involved in a refusal to grant to

               French Canadians, Englishmen, Irishmen or

               is to say, beings with a heart and a soul,

               <br />
               kindness, benevolence and fair treatment.
