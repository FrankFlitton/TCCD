               <br />
               Blake’s speech. As the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice has just said, Mr. Blake referred to 
               <br />
               the case of Prince Edward Island where 
               <br />
               the discussion was as between sectarian 
               <br />
               schools and non-sectarian schools. The 
               <br />
               right to have sectarian schools is claimed 
               <br />
               by Catholics, and as the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               well stated in his first speech on this sub- 
               <br />
               ject, the right to have sectarian schools has 
               <br />
               never been claimed by the Protestants of 
               <br />
               this country as a whole. It has been 
               <br />
               claimed as a preferable system by some 
               <br />
               Protestants, but it has never been claimed 
               <br />
               as a conscientious right by any unit of Pro— 
               <br />
               testants in this country nor by the Pro- 
               <br />
               testant majority of any part of the coun- 
               <br />
               try; it has only been claimed by the Pro- 
               <br />
               testant minority of Quebec. The object of 
               <br />
               the clause. as I have stated was to pro- 
               <br />
               vide for the rights of the total minority of 
               <br />
               the Territories, and therefore when it 
               <br />
               speaks of the majority and the minority of 
               <br />
               any particular district it must mean that 
               <br />
               the majority or the minority of that dis- 
               <br />
               trict belong either to the majority or the 
               <br />
               minority of the total population of the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. I therefore hold that the refer- 
               <br />
               ence to the establishment of schools as the 
               <br />
               majority may think lit, must be interpreted 
               <br />
               in the same way as the separate schools 
               <br />
               mentioned in the second paragraph, just as 
               <br />
               the word majority must be interpreted in 
               <br />
               the same way as the word minority in the 
               <br />
               second part of the section; that is: that 
               <br />
               the majority may choose to have a sectarian 
               <br />
               school whether Protestant or Roman Cath- 
               <br />
               olic, or a non—sectarian school; and that the 
               <br />
               minority whether Protestant or Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic, may secede from them and have 
               <br />
               a Protestant school if the minority is 
               <br />
               Protestant, and a Catholic school <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minority</span> is Catholic. The Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice has referred to the ordinance of 
               <br />
               1884, but if the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion refers to the ordinance of 1885—— 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»is</span> in fact the ﬁrst ordinance 
               <br />
               adopted in the Northwest Territories be- 
               <br />
               cause the ordinance of 1884 has never been 
               <br />
               put in force——he will ﬁnd that the idea was 
               <br />
               there indicated in the clearest way pos- 
               <br />
               s1ble. There was to be established public 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
