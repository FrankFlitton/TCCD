               <br />

               <br />
               trade of Canada that the Bill should be so 
               <br />
               worded. The hon. minister has told the

               House in discussing the resolution on which 
               <br />
               this Bill is founded that the fruit associa- 
               <br />
               tions of this country have described the 
               <br />
               size of box in which apples should be pack- 
               <br />
               ed for export. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[think</span> the minister should

               more strange to me that the hon. minister 
               <br />
               should have given us that information, in- 
               <br />
               asmuch as the gentlemen from whom I

               obtained information are members of fruit 
               <br />
               associations, and no doubt were present at. 
               <br />
               some of those meetings when the matter of 
               <br />
               the size of the apple box was discussed. 
               <br />
               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between the minister and 
               <br />
               myself is this: 1 have proposed that a box 
               <br />
               should be designated in the Act, the size of 
               <br />
               which would be some well known quantity. 
               <br />
               For example, I suggested that the box should 
               <br />
               contain one-quarter of a barrel. The stan— 
               <br />
               dard barrel of apples is a well known mea- 
               <br />
               sure. In the old country apples are sold by 
               <br />
               the barrel, and people there understand what 
               <br />
               'a barrel of apples is. We have ﬁxed by law 
               <br />
               the size of a barrel of apples and the quan- 
               <br />
               tity is known amongst us—and, I believe, 
               <br />
               correctly—as three bushels. If we are going 
               <br />
               to authorize the shipment of apples in boxes 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contaiping</span> less than a barrel, I contend that 
               <br />
               these boxes should contain some well de- 
               <br />
               ﬁned, speciﬁc quantity that would be well 
               <br />
               understood by the purchaser in the old 
               <br />
               country. The box deﬁned by the Minister 
               <br />
               of Agriculture is a nondescript box which 
               <br />
               represents practically nothing speciﬁc. It is 
               <br />
               not one-fourth of a barrel; it is not one- 
               <br />
               third <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> a barrel; it is no deﬁnite fraction 
               <br />
               of a barrel that the people will understand. 
               <br />
               It is less than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one-third</span> of a barrel and it is 
               <br />
               larger than one-quarter of a barrel. To my 
               <br />
               mind, the box that would hold one-quarter 
               <br />
               of a barrel would be a very much better 
               <br />
               package than one that contains no deﬁnite 
               <br />
               fraction of a barrel. When this matter was 
               <br />
               last discussed, the Minister of Agriculture 
               <br />
               almost insinuated that my object in advocat- 
               <br />
               ing a smaller box was that the shippers in this 
               <br />
               country might take advantage of the buyers 
               <br />
               in the old country and sell them a smaller 
               <br />
               quantity with a view of enhancing the 
               <br />
               price. I had no such intention or thought, 
               <br />
               but I do tell the minister that the use of the 
               <br />
               box which he has described will have the 
               <br />
               effect of defrauding the people of the old 
               <br />
               country. The purchaser will naturally ask 
               <br />
               how much there is in the box, and he will 
               <br />
               be told it is a bushel, or one—third of a bar- 
               <br />
               rel, when, as a matter of fact, it is not.

               Mr. HENDERSON. It is very consider-

               <br />
               but I can tell him that he is all wrong ; he 
               <br />
               has taken his information from young men, 
               <br />
               who have not the experience of practical men 
               <br />
               in the business, who have investigated the 
               <br />
               matter. Three boxes of the size prescribed 
               <br />
               in this Bill will not ﬁll a barrel; a fact 
               <br />
               which has been demonstrated by practical 
               <br />
               test. The box which the minister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposa;</span> 
               <br />
               will contain the contents in cubic inches of 
               <br />
               one-third of a barrel, but he forgets that 
               <br />
               there is much waste of space when you 
               <br />
               pack three or four packages instead of 
               <br />
               one barrel, there being a large amount
