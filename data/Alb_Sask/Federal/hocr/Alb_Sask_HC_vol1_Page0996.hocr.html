               When the right hon. the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               introduced this Bill into the House he told

               probably the greatest constitutional lawyer 
               <br />
               in Canada—got through with his argument 
               <br />
               on this Bill. I think the right hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               man found himself in deep water. and from 
               <br />
               that time until now he has been trying to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd Where the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rock</span> of the constitution is. 
               <br />
               The leader of the opposition completely 
               <br />
               shattered the arguments of the Prime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Min</span> 
               <br />
               ister, and we have had proof of the fact 
               <br />
               that the government themselves thought 
               <br />
               that their arguments from a constitutional 
               <br />
               standpoint were wrong, because when the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance addressed the House 
               <br />
               he told us that he did not advocate the mea- 
               <br />
               sure from the constitutional standpoint but 
               <br />
               because it was a measure of equity and 
               <br />
               justice. He completely deserted the con- 
               <br />
               stitutional standpoint taken by his leader. 
               <br />
               We are told by the new Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior (Mr. Oliver) and by others of his 
               <br />
               supporters here, that the people of the west 
               <br />
               do not want their lands. but that they 
               <br />
               would rather the federal government would 
               <br />
               keep these lands and give the provinces an 
               <br />

               father, I do not want you to give me that

               splendid estate that naturally comes to me 
               <br />

               <br />
               son who would say that would be either a 
               <br />
               most proﬂigate son, or he must believe that 
               <br />
               he would wantonly waste the lands and the 
               <br />
               minerals and the timber if they were given 
               <br />
               to him. I would ask hon. gentlemen oppo— 
               <br />
               site from the province of Ontario, and from 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec as well, if they would 
               <br />
               stand up in this House and advocate that 
               <br />
               the Dominion government take away the 
               <br />
               lands and the minerals and the timber from 
               <br />
               those provinces and give them an annuity 
               <br />
               in return? Neither the province of On— 
               <br />
               tario nor the province of Quebec would 
               <br />
               tolerate such a thing. because they think 
               <br />
               they can handle their own lands and mine- 
               <br />
               rals and timber, as they have done in the 
               <br />
               past, and as they are doing to-day. The 
               <br />
               position of those two provinces in the North- 
               <br />
               west is the same as that of Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec in this respect, and the members 
               <br />
               who stand up in this House and advocate 
               <br />
               that measure are not consistent, and are

               advocating What I do not think they believe- 
               <br />
               themselves; but for some ulterior motive 
               <br />
               they are willing to keep from those vast 
               <br />
               provinces the territory which naturally be- 
               <br />
               longs to them.

               Hon. gentlemen opposite tell us that there

               in my hand an account of a meeting held

               <br />
               one of the most active gentlemen there was 
               <br />
               the Liberal member for the district in the 
               <br />
               provincial House. The meeting passed re-

               solutions most condemnatory of this govern- 
               <br />
               ment and this Bill. especially for the school 
               <br />
               clauses and the part relating to the lands. 
               <br />
               I will not weary the House by reading these 
               <br />
               resolutions, but if any of the hon. members 
               <br />
               opposite would like to hear them, I would 
               <br />
               be only too glad to do so.

               We are told that the fact that the present 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior, the member for 
               <br />
               Edmonton (Mr. Oliver), has been elected by 
               <br />
               acclamation is evidence that there is no 
               <br />
               opposition in the west to this Bill, but that 
               <br />
               the people there are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perfectly</span> satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               it. But I think that of all the acts of 
               <br />
               cowardice on the part of this government, 
               <br />
               there is none so great as their appointment
