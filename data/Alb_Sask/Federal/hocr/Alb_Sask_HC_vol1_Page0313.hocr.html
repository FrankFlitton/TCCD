               State of Missouri into the union, an attempt

               a condition of the admission. On that occasion 
               <br />
               the question was largely discussed. whether 
               <br />
               Congress possessed a constitutional authority 
               <br />
               to impose such a restriction, upon the ground 
               <br />
               that the prescribing of such condition is in-

               States. The ﬁnal result of the vote which 
               <br />
               authorized the erection of that State, seems to 
               <br />
               establish the rightful authority of Congress 
               <br />
               .to impose such a restriction, although it was

               not them applied. In the act passed for this

               <br />
               north of 36° 30’ N. latitude, not included within 
               <br />
               the limits of the State of Missouri, slavery

               similar character was taken to the compact

               such was not the case with the Territories. 
               <br />
               It was therefore necessary that the Domin-

               Sir John Macdonald, perceiving this inad-

               <br />
               might well apply to an agreement, but not

               <br />
               Such is Sir John Macdonald’s contention.
