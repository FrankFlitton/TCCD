               merely in a few words illustrate the point 
               <br />
               by saying that at the time the Hudson’s 
               <br />
               Bay Company obtained its grant from 
               <br />
               Charles II the grant did not profess to give 
               <br />
               the lands in the Northwest Territories. In 
               <br />
               the next place if the Crown did profess to 
               <br />
               cede to the Hudson Bay Company the lands 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories, Great Britain 
               <br />
               did not own these lands at that time and 
               <br />
               did not acquire them from France for many 
               <br />
               years afterwards. It is certain that if Great 
               <br />
               Britain did not own them Great Britain 
               <br />
               could not give them and did not give them 
               <br />
               to the Hudson Bay Company. All that 
               <br />
               Great Britain did was to grant certain rights 
               <br />
               to the Hudson Bay Company in regard to 
               <br />
               ﬁshing, trade and commerce. The Hudson 
               <br />
               Bay Company never owned these lands in 
               <br />

               T he Attorney General of British Columbia 
               <br />
               brought action against the Attorney General 
               <br />
               of the Dominion. We all remember that 
               <br />
               when the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway was 
               <br />
               built a grant was made of an area 20 miles 
               <br />
               on each side of the road out of the British 
               <br />
               Columbia lands. The province of British 
               <br />
               Columbia received $100,000 a year from the 
               <br />
               Dominion in consideration of the grant, but 
               <br />
               after this land was granted gold was dis- 
               <br />
               covered and the question arose: To whom 
               <br />
               does this gold belong? The Dominion 
               <br />
               said: We have the grant of land; it is 
               <br />
               our gold. The province gave us the land 
               <br />
               and now we have the land and the minerals 
               <br />
               on it. But, the Privy Council said no, that 
               <br />
               the province represented the Crown and 
               <br />
               that the Crown could not part with its 
               <br />
               minerals unless it expressly said that it 
               <br />
               parted with its minerals; the minerals re-

               main in the Crown, the Crown is represented

               by the province and the province is entitled 
               <br />
               to them. In the same way we are asked to
