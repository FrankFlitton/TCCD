               When you look at the subject of education 
               <br />
               prior to the union you will ﬁnd not that any

               system was expressly imposed upon the pro-

               time provinces and the provinces of Ontario 
               <br />
               and Quebec. So far as the Territories were 
               <br />
               concerned—I do not at all admit that the in- 
               <br />
               troduction of separate schools there stands upon 
               <br />
               the same footing as the introduction of separate

               constitution; they cannot be interfered with

               by the local legislature. But in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> 
               <br />
               Territories, as the hon. minister has said. it
