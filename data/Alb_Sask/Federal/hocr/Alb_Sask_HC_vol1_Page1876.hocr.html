               Mr. BARR. This is an amendment of too 
               <br />
               great importance to be voted ‘upon at one 
               <br />
               o’clock in the morning, especially since it' 
               <br />
               was sprung .upon the House only an hour 
               <br />
               ago. The member for Saskatchewan must 
               <br />
               have very little conﬁdence in the legislatures 
               <br />
               of these new provinces when he seeks to im— 
               <br />
               pose upon them legislation of this kind 
               <br />
               which they cannot change, although it 
               <br />
               should prove to be for the worst interests of 
               <br />
               the community. The argument he used in 
               <br />
               favour of his amendment was the very 
               <br />
               strongest argument why it should not be- 
               <br />
               come law. Suppose the Morman majority 
               <br />
               in a locality would elect in a locality Mor- 
               <br />
               mon trustees and these trustees provided 
               <br />
               religious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">teachingwhich</span> was most objection- 
               <br />
               able to the minority, it Would be impossible 
               <br />
               for the legislature to change the government 
               <br />
               of these schools for all time to come, if this 
               <br />
               law should pass. Reference has been made 
               <br />
               to the fact that in Ontario they have had at 
               <br />
               different tin‘ies religious teaching in the 
               <br />
               schools. That is quite true, but instead .of 
               <br />
               its being a blessing it was a curse, and the 
               <br />
               people of Ontario changed it, and although 
               <br />
               the law is there to-day it is a dead letter. 
               <br />
               In these new provinces into which immi- 
               <br />
               grants are coming from various foreign 
               <br />
               countries, it can be easily seen that if they 
               <br />
               are allowed to have control of the teaching 
               <br />
               in the schools it might be most injurious to 
               <br />
               the whole community. .
