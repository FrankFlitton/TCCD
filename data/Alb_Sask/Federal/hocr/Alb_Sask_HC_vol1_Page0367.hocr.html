               Usually we have only about three ministers 
               <br />
               present, and we must therefore, according

               <br />
               other ten are on the eve of resignation. 
               <br />
               However that may be, let me say that I do

               good friend of mine personally, though we 
               <br />
               differ somewhat politically; and I stand 
               <br />
               here to urge the claims of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Edmonton to this position. He is a 
               <br />
               gentleman of ripe experience and great 
               <br />
               ability, and, as we all know a gentleman 
               <br />
               of absolute and perfect independence on 
               <br />
               all questions. But, if we cannot have my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Edmonton, Why should 
               <br />
               we not have the hon. member from West 
               <br />
               Assiniboia (Mr. Scott). Is not he capable? 
               <br />
               Is there any apprehension on the part of the 
               <br />
               right hon. Prime Minister that there will 
               <br />
               be any difﬁculty about securing the election 
               <br />
               of either of these gentlemen? Does he 
               <br />
               propose to let this matter stand until after 
               <br />
               the close of the present session, in deﬁance 
               <br />
               of all the high constitutional principles 
               <br />
               which he professed ten years ago ? If there 
               <br />
               is a lack of material among the members 
               <br />
               for the Northwest Territories, why not ap- 
               <br />
               point some broad minded man like my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Ottawa <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Belcourt), who

               Labelle (Mr. Bourassa)? Could not one of

               these gentlemen be induced to go up and 
               <br />

               Now, just one more observation on this

               subject. The right hon. gentleman (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) was rather facetious ten 
               <br />
               years ago. He told us of those two min- 
               <br />
               isters coming back and likened them to 
               <br />
               kittens coming back to their cream. Well, 
               <br />
               we have had a couple of kittens who were 
               <br />
               a little skittish on this occasion. One, it is 
               <br />
               true, did not leave the cream. It arched 
               <br />
               its back and curved its tail, but remained 
               <br />
               within a reasonable distance of the cream, 
               <br />
               and is still lapping. The other did leave 
               <br />
               the cream.

               <br />
               fault to ﬁnd with my hon. friend (Mr. R. L.

               <br />
