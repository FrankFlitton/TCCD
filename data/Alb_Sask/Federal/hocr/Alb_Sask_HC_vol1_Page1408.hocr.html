               this particular question, a better test would

               have been made than by opening the district 
               <br />
               of Edmonton. I still hold to that opinion. 
               <br />
               Now so far as the Galicians or Doukhobors 
               <br />
               are concerned. 1 have not uttered one word 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> these gentlemen. I have simply 
               <br />
               quoted the language used byythe hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man himself some few years ago; that is 
               <br />
               what 1 am guilty of in that respect. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs talked about this elec- 
               <br />
               tion in Edmonton as being a test on the 
               <br />
               question. We have, I think and I think I 
               <br />
               can produce it at a later period, evidence 
               <br />
               that the Minister of the Interior while pass- 
               <br />
               ing from Edmonrton to the capital admitted 
               <br />
               that this was not a test question in his elec- 
               <br />
               tion. His election he claimed was not testing 
               <br />
               this question in Edmonton. He rather 
               <br />
               complimented both parties ln Edmonton and 
               <br />
               in his district on no candidate being put up 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> him. He recognized the very friendly 
               <br />
               way in which he was treated by both political 
               <br />
               parties and disclaimed any credit for his elec- 
               <br />
               tion as a matter connected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with‘this</span> particu- 
               <br />
               lar legislation. Then. I say that being true. 
               <br />
               how does it come that the all-wise Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of Customs wants to know so much 
               <br />
               about why a condidate is not put in the 
               <br />
               ﬁeld, why ﬁve men could not be produced 
               <br />
               and why $200 could not be raised in order 
               <br />
               that this question might be tested? The 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of the Interior would not 
               <br />
               make such a ridiculous assertion as that 
               <br />
               in the face of the circumstances concern- 
               <br />
               ing the election in Edmonton. On Satur- 
               <br />
               day, the 15th April, the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior was selected and sworn in 
               <br />
               and on the 25th of the very saine month. 
               <br />
               ten days afterwards, the nomination papers 
               <br />
               had to be prepared, these four men that 
               <br />
               the hon. minister talks about had to be 
               <br />
               produced. the $200 the hon. minister talks 
               <br />
               of had to be provided and {! candidate had 
               <br />
               to be selected. It was necessary to do all 
               <br />
               these things in order to have a contest in a
