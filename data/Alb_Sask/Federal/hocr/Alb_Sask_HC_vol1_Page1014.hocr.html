               <br />
               time I shall advance a few ideas of my own. 
               <br />
               Being as I am, a native born Canadian, 
               <br />
               there is no portion of the face of the earth in 
               <br />
               which I feel so much interest as in that 
               <br />
               portion which is bounded by the outward 
               <br />
               boundaries of the Dominion of Canada. 
               <br />
               There are no people who live and move and 
               <br />
               have their being upon the face of the globe, 
               <br />
               in whom I feel so much interest as in those 
               <br />
               persons who are Canadians and who at 
               <br />
               least live on Canadian soil. We have in our 
               <br />
               country a very great variety of most valu- 
               <br />
               able natural resources, which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">h'ave</span> been 
               <br />
               given 11s by the bountiful hand of a bounti- 
               <br />
               ful Giver; and upon these resources and 
               <br />
               with these resources, it is altogether likely 
               <br />
               a great nation will be built up in the Do— 
               <br />
               minion oi’ Canada. Now, Sir, it is the duty 
               <br />
               of the government of the day, in connection 
               <br />
               with the people of the country. to develop 
               <br />
               these resources as quickly and as reasonably 
               <br />
               as we can. Most certainly, Sir, do I feel it 
               <br />
               to be the duty of the government to so 
               <br />
               govern the people that contentment will 
               <br />
               rest on their minds. To so govern the
