               <br />
               in this House in 1896. Sir Charles Tupper 
               <br />
               was one of the fathers of confederation 
               <br />
               who took part in the negotiations which re- 
               <br />
               sulted in confederation, and he speaks as 
               <br />
               a man having knowledge. He said:

               I say with knowledge that but for the consent

               posal of Mr. Galt, that in the Confederation 
               <br />

               position with that which Canada occupied

               <br />

               <br />
               case, by the condition of their country, to seek 
               <br />
               some change in its constitution which would 
               <br />

               <br />
               and race that had been maintained in old Can-

               <br />
               but for the clause protecting minorities, the 
               <br />

               And he went on to say that the change 
               <br />
               which took place in the clause was this, 
               <br />
               that instead of its being conﬁned to both 
               <br />
               the Canadas, it was broadened to include 
               <br />
               all the provinces that might enter confeder- 
               <br />
               ation. Of the fact, therefore, that this pro— 
               <br />
               vision was inserted for Protestant interests, 
               <br />
               and not for Roman Catholic interests, there 
               <br />
               cannot be any successful dispute. It was 
               <br />
               not inserted for the Protestants of Quebec 
               <br />
               alone, but it was inserted for what was 
               <br />
               expected to be the Protestant minority in the 
               <br />
               territory lying west of the great lakes. Par-

               Manitoba, provided for minority rights in 
               <br />
               separate schools, not for Catholic interests 
               <br />
               in Manitoba, but for what were believed to 
               <br />
               be Protestant interests. There was just as 
               <br />
               much expectation that the minority in Mani- 
               <br />
               toba would be a Protestant minority as 
               <br />

               Let any gentleman read the 1875 debates, 
               <br />
               read the debate that took place when the

               Northwest Territories’ Act was passed, and 
               <br />
               it must be plain to him, if he has an open,
