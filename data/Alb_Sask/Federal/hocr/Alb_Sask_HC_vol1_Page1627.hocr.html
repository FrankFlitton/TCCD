               <br />
               on to say he had no objection to a certain 
               <br />
               change which was made in his constitu- 
               <br />
               ency. And I think there was only one 
               <br />
               division taken on the‘ whole of that ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and that was as to whether there 
               <br />
               should be 35 or 36 members. I am not; 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sure</span> on this point. If there was a 
               <br />
               division at all, it was lost. I only ﬁnd 
               <br />
               the record of one amendment being pro- 
               <br />
               posed, and I do not see whether it was 
               <br />
               pressed to a division or not. Therefore, it 
               <br />
               cannot possibly be said that there was any 
               <br />
               unfair <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">redistribution</span> «by the legislative as- 
               <br />
               sembly in 1902. Not one of these members 
               <br />
               who, the hon. member for Strathcona (Mr. 
               <br />
               P. Talbot) says, were so badly treated in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">northern</span> part of Alberta, raised any 
               <br />
               protest against the redistribution. We, 
               <br />
               therefore, can take it as absolutely the 
               <br />
               fact <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it was a fair one, and I think it 
               <br />
               will be found to compare very favourably 
               <br />
               indeed with the redistribution we are now 
               <br />
               discussing, in which, instead of a margin 
               <br />
               of only something like 4 per cent between 
               <br />
               one district and another, we ﬁnd a margin 
               <br />
               of from 10 to 100 per cent. I am very glad 
               <br />
               that the principle has been laid down that 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures of last election are the basis 
               <br />
               for the distribution of seats. These lists, 
               <br />
               upon which that' election took place, were 
               <br />
               drawn up last fall, and the election took 
               <br />
               place in November. There may be consid- 
               <br />
               erable difference of opinion as to whether 
               <br />
               we should take the votes actually cast or 
               <br />
               those which appear on the lists. For my 
               <br />
               part, I would take the ones placed on the 
               <br />
               lists, which lists were drawn up by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men,</span> 
               <br />
               employed by the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government".</span> who 
               <br />
               certainly would not be unfair towards the 
               <br />
               members of their own party. I think 
               <br />
               most strongly that the votes on the lists 
               <br />
               should be the, basis upon which this dis- 
               <br />
               tribution should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be’</span> made. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               However, if the government wishes. let 
               <br />
               us take the basis of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Notes</span> cast just for 
               <br />
               the purpose of argument. As far as the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Saskatchewan is concerned. I am 
               <br />
               perfectly willing to accept that basis. Pro— 
               <br />
               bably my hon. friends on this side would 
               <br />
               be willing to accept even that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">basis</span> also 
               <br />
               so long as it is strictly adhered to. But 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd that in the case of the province of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatchewan,</span> the votes cast at last elec—

               tion are not followed to any degree what- 
               <br />
               ever. Let me point to this as an illustration 
               <br />
               The new province of Saskatchewan can 
               <br />
               easily be divided up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">between</span> north and 
               <br />
               south. There are three Dominion consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies in the north and three in the south. 
               <br />
               We have the absolute number ot‘ votes poll~ 
               <br />
               ed in all these constituencies so that we 
               <br />
               can get down to an absolute basis of fact. 
               <br />
               In the three northern constituencies, there 
               <br />
               were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">7,824</span> votes polled. Add the number 
               <br />
               from the districts of Strathcona and Edmon- 
               <br />
               ton, and you would possibly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> 150 
               <br />
               votes more. In the three southern Dominion 
               <br />
               constituencies there were 17,771 votes polled. 
               <br />

               Now, we ﬁnd that the actual distribution we 
               <br />
               are discussing gives to the north eight mem— 
               <br />
               bers and the south ten members, and that 
               <br />
               there are seven local constituencies which 
               <br />
               are divided up, and I think that hon. gen-

               tlemen opposite will be perfectly' willing to 
               <br />
               admit that those constituencies can be di-. 
               <br />
               vided equally between <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the—north</span> and the 
               <br />
               south. We ﬁnd that to the 7,824 votes cast. 
               <br />
               in the north they give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11%</span> seats, whilst to 
               <br />
               the 17,741 votes cast in the south they only

               give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">13‘}</span> seats. It will also be found, taking
