               That is consistent with what Mr. Chrys- 
               <br />
               ler said in the committee, that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter</span> 
               <br />
               was entirely in the hands of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment. The suggestion of the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man (Mr. Barker) is that there ought to be 
               <br />
               some words in the contract leaving it in 
               <br />
               the hands of the government, but in the 
               <br />
               contract are these very words: That these 
               <br />
               contracts are to proceed according to speciﬁ— 
               <br />
               cations to be agreed upon between the com- 
               <br />
               pany and the government, and the money 
               <br />
               is not paid out upon the progress estimates 
               <br />
               upon the certiﬁcate of a junior engineer, 
               <br />
               but ‘on certiﬁcate of the chief engineer or 
               <br />
               some other ofﬁcer specially appointed 
               <br />
               by the government for that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purpose?</span> 
               <br />
               The matter is therefore entirely in the 
               <br />
               hands of the government to make the 
               <br />
               speciﬁcations in the form which they 
               <br />
               see ﬁt. The chief engineer has it then 
               <br />
               absolutely in his own hands to see that too 
               <br />
               much money is not paid out. He is respon— 
               <br />
               sible. to the government and the govern- 
               <br />
               ment to the people, that more money than 
               <br />
               is earned is not paid out. I believe that 
               <br />
               this is even more safe than the retaining 
               <br />
               of 15 or 20 per cent, as is usual when in— 
               <br />
               terim bonds are issued. Therefore. I would 
               <br />
               ask the hon. gentleman (Mr. Barker) to al- 
               <br />
               low the Bill to go, if that is the only ob- 
               <br />
               jection he has.
