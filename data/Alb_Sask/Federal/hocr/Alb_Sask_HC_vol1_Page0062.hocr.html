               <br />
               jection that the city takes to the Bill is that 
               <br />
               if the powers that are asked for by the 
               <br />
               Ottawa Electric Company are granted. then 
               <br />
               it follows that they will purchase the stock

               moter of the Bill has to say ; but if that is

               <br />
