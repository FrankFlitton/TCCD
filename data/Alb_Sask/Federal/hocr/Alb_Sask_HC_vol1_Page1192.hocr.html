               Mr. FITZPATRICK. The ﬁgures I had at

               the time, given me by the representatives 
               <br />
               of the Territories, were as follows: The 
               <br />
               total revenue for the eleven months of 
               <br />

               <br />
               uary, from January to November, was $1,- 
               <br />
               104,842.07. Of that amount they had re- 
               <br />
               ceived from the Dominion $961,936.42. There- 
               <br />
               fore the amount collected from local sources 
               <br />
               was $142,905.65. I have since ascertained 
               <br />
               that the total amount received during the ' 
               <br />
               whole year, both from Dominion and local 
               <br />
               revenues, was $1,121,000 and their expen-

               Mr. FITZPA-TRICK. There are certain 
               <br />
               expenditures now made by the territorial 
               <br />
               government, the money being largely sup- 
               <br />
               plied to them for that expenditure by the 
               <br />
               Dominion. Then there are certain other 
               <br />
               expenditures now made by the Dominion ' 
               <br />
               government on account of services that will 
               <br />
               be under the control of the provincial gov- 
               <br />
               ernments. Take, for instance, civil gov— 
               <br />
               ernment. It is estimated that the 
               <br />
               total amount required to be paid in this 
               <br />
               cennection will be $101,540, which 1s 
               <br />
               based on the actual expenditure by the ter-

               ritorial government. Then they give an esti-

               mate of the amount required. for legislation. 
               <br />
               These two amounts are expended directly 
               <br />
               by the territorial government. To that must
