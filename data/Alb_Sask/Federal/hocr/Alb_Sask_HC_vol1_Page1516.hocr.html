               do not ﬁnd that in the law. It is

               I am not quite sure about that. I would

               Mr. STOCKTON. I understood that my 
               <br />
               hon. friend said that the ordinances of 
               <br />
               1881 or 1884 cut down <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">certain</span> rights that 
               <br />
               were given under the Act of 1875. That is 
               <br />
               what I understood the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               to say and that section 11 of the Act of 
               <br />
               1875 had been cut in two and the part re- 
               <br />
               lating to pu'blic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">school's</span> had been omitted

               been a certain l'imitation or restriction put 
               <br />
               upon ‘that. If you read section 11 of the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875, with all due deference I do 
               <br />
               not think that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> bear the construction- 
               <br />
               that has been put upon it by the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice. As I said it means that the 
               <br />
               majority of lthe ratepayers of any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">district</span> 
               <br />
               or portion of the Northwest or any lesser 
               <br />
               portion or subdivision thereof, by whatever 
               <br />
               name the same may be called, may estab- 
               <br />
               lish such schools therein as they may think 
               <br />
               ﬁt, and make the necessary assessment and 
               <br />
               collection of rates therefor. Thait is a pow— 
               <br />
               er given under the law to establish the 
               <br />
               schools and that power continues <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> 
               <br />
               There has been no cutting down of that 
               <br />
               power on the part of this legislature or any 
               <br />

               <br />
               lature in the enactment of any ordinances; 
               <br />
               it was only granting a power to the author- 
               <br />
               ity of the Northwest Territories under cer- 
               <br />
               tain conditions to legislate and make .pro- 
               <br />
               vision for the establishment, of the schools ; 
               <br />
               but with this limitation, that if there was 
               <br />
               a minority in that district who wanted a 
               <br />
               separate school they could have that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sepa»</span> 
               <br />
               rate school provided they complied with 
               <br />
               the law, and that when they did that their 
               <br />
               assessments shouild go towards the main- 
               <br />
               tenance of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> school and that 
               <br />
               therefore it would not be necessary to put
