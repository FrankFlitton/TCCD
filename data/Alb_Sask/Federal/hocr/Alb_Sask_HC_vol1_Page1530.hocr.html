               <br />
               My hon. friend-sees there is a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁer-</span>

               great difference. When it comes'to the

               matter of religious instruction, however, 
               <br />
               here is what the law says :

               not follow education beyond that point. The

               state concerns itself only with secular edu-

               has made a difference in the law of 1875. 
               <br />
               And here again I say that my fellow co-

               <br />
               may not perhaps be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sacriﬁce</span> of 
               <br />
               power. In his opinion they may not have 
               <br />
               made such a sacriﬁce. but in their own in- 
               <br />
               terpretation of the law, they made a sacri- 
               <br />
               Iﬁce, and therefore it is that we are asking 
               <br />
               for this safeguard to our co-religionists.

               ority claim that under the Act of 1875 they 
               <br />
               had the right to select their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">text—books.</span>

               They claim also, as the correspondence of 
               <br />
               record will show. that they have a right

               <br />
               away very conveniently to another. The

               the section ? I asked him a very distinct

               question as to the meaning of the words

               When I ask him about that, he leaves that
