               lar. If there is any objection taken to a vote 
               <br />
               which is offered the returning oﬂicer may 
               <br />
               put the ballot into an envelope, and later on 
               <br />
               a court is held to prove whether the man 
               <br />
               who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> that ballot is a qualiﬁed elector 
               <br />
               or not. The ballot is still sealed up in the 
               <br />
               envelope, and if it is proved that he was a 
               <br />
               qualiﬁed elector, it goes into the ballot box, 
               <br />
               and not otherwise. There are provisions of 
               <br />
               that kind which constitute a safeguard. But 
               <br />
               after all I do not see that what has been 
               <br />
               done in the legislative assembly is neces- 
               <br />

               <br />
               though I think we have some very good

               I want to point out that the objection taken 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Calgary (Mr. M. S. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) is not met by the suggestion to 
               <br />
               restrict the number of certiﬁcates. A man 
               <br />
               can come from any polling division he likes 
               <br />
               and go into another polling division and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">swear</span> himself in. I wish to point out further 
               <br />
               that the interpretation of that clause varies 
               <br />
               according to the sympathy of the man who 
               <br />
               is conducting the election. I remember in

               mention that the election clerk did not Sign

               it out as secretary of the central Liberal 
               <br />
               committee. He was acting in both capaci-

               ties. I also found another thing in

               I met a man and entered into conversation 
               <br />
               with him, and he told me that the enumer-

               know other cases of a somewhat similar

               ask the Minister of Justice whether an

               amendment to clause 6, something in this 
               <br />
               form, would not meet the case, instead of 
               <br />
               saying ‘until the parliament of Canada

               <br />
               I realize what the Minister of Justice has 
               <br />
               said. that there is nothing compelling the

               <br />

               Mr. SAM. HUGHES. The Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories Representation Act works out badly 
               <br />
               in many cases. I will run over a few 
               <br />
               clauses. Section 4 describes who shall be 
               <br />
               qualified to vote. Now I do not know what 
               <br />
               the definition of an Indian is, I presume it 
               <br />
               is a treaty 'Indian; but there are many 
               <br />
               Indians resident in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories who are not treaty Indians. I do not 
               <br />
               know whether the law would allow them to 
               <br />
               vote or not, but I think they would be en— 
               <br />
               titled. Section 16 provides that another day 
               <br />
               for nomination may be ﬁxed in certain cases 
               <br />
               if, owing to accident or some cause, the 
               <br />
               elections are not held on the regular day. I 
               <br />
               may point out in this connection that the 
               <br />
               election in the riding of Mackenzie furnished 
               <br />
               an instance. It was postponed, I do not
