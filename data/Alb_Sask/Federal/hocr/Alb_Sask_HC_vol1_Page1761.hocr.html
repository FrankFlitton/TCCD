               Let me observe with regard to this legis— 
               <br />
               lation that, so far as religious instruction is 
               <br />
               concerned, in my humble judgment there is 
               <br />
               no departure whatever from the principle 
               <br />
               laid down in the law of 1875, and therefore 
               <br />
               the majority or the minority in any district 
               <br />
               in the Territories can have such religious 
               <br />
               instruction as they think ﬁt. They can have 
               <br />
               it or not have it, as they think tit; it is 
               <br />
               for them to say; there is no interference 
               <br />
               from anybody. But with regard to secular 
               <br />
               education, it is not the same. The whole 
               <br />
               subject of secular education, including the 
               <br />
               certiﬁcationot' teachers, the inspection of 
               <br />
               schools and the selection of books, is under 
               <br />
               the control of the board of education. In this 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholic minority of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories have seen a serious de- 
               <br />
               parture from the privilege which was guar— 
               <br />
               anteed to them by the law of Mr. Mackenzie 
               <br />
               of 1875; and it is not to be supposed that 
               <br />
               this departure would have taken place with— 
               <br />
               out serious protests and remonstrances and 
               <br />
               even some commotion. I may say that Sir 
               <br />
               John Thompson. the Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
               When he came to review the legislation of 
               <br />
               1887 and 1888. expressed the opinion that 
               <br />
               the law which had been passed by the logis- 
               <br />
               lature in those two years was a departure 
               <br />
               from the principle which had been laid down 
               <br />
               in the Act of Mr. Mackenzie. in so far as the 
               <br />
               organization of school districts was con- 
               <br />
