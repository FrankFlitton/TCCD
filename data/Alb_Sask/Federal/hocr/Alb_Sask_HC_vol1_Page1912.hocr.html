               <br />
               given this afternoon some ﬁgures that throw 
               <br />
               a great deal of light on this question. It is 
               <br />
               true that we are only four per cent-of the 
               <br />
               population in those two pr0vinces. At 
               <br />
               one time there were, besides Indians, no 
               <br />
               other representatives of civilized nations but 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> French and the English. But if it is true 
               <br />
               that in 1901 only four per cent of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">popu=</span>

               only 47 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eper</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">centhas</span> English speaking, in-

               <br />
               is now thirty-three years of age. I say it 
               <br />
               is the duty of the founders of these pro-

               especially to the better sentiments of the

               of confederation, let us recognize it more 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the speech delivered in 1890 in this par- 
               <br />
               liament by the late Hon. David Mills, who 
               <br />
               proved conclusively that there was no such 
               <br />
               thing as an ofﬁcial language under the 
               <br />
               British constitution, that what gave an 
               <br />
               official language to a country was the lan- 
               <br />
               guage of the majority of its inhabitants, 
               <br />
               and that when Canada was taken over by 
               <br />
               the English it was not necessary to put 
               <br />
               into the Treaty of Paris that French was 
               <br />
               acknowledged as an ofﬁcial language, be- 
               <br />
               cause the French language was the birth- 
               <br />
               right of the country. You‘ have become 
               <br />
               the majority; is that a reason why you 
               <br />
               should deprive the people of the right to 
               <br />
               the oﬂicial use of that language in these 
               <br />
               new Territories which had no constitution 
               <br />
               of their own when they joined confederatlon 
               <br />
               and therefore were not in the position of 
               <br />
               the older provinces ? They were carved and 
               <br />
               created by the people of Canada out of 
               <br />
               virgin <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">land,</span> purchased by all the people of

               ada, and I ask: Why do you not join hands 
               <br />
               with us and put into the constitution of 
               <br />
               these Territories the same principle which 
               <br />
               was put into the constitution as far as this 
               <br />
               parliament is concerned and as far as the 
               <br />
               legislature of the province of Quebec is con- 
               <br />
               cerned. and declare that the dual language 
               <br />
               shall be ofﬁcial in the Northwest Territor- 
               <br />
               ies ? Really, I cannot see, if my English- 
               <br />
               speaking friends are true to the traditions 
               <br />
               ot their nation, why they should object to 
               <br />
               this. Do you think that the French Gana— 
               <br />
               dian people will be less loyal if their lan- 
               <br />
               guage is put there as the ofﬁcial language? 
               <br />
               If there is a black page in the history of 
               <br />
               England it is the attempt to impose the 
               <br />
               English language and English ways of edu- 
               <br />
               cation upon the old land of Ireland. For 
               <br />
               400 years the attempt has been made by 
               <br />
               force of bayonets to impose the English lan- 
               <br />
               guage upon an unwilling people. Think 
               <br />
               you that the Irish people have been thereby 
               <br />
               made more loyal, or that they will be made 
               <br />
               English by law ‘? No, Sir. .To come back 
               <br />
               to our own land of Canada, which was the 
               <br />

               ing with your ancestors for years, do you 
               <br />
               think that the descendants of that nation 
               <br />
               would have become loyal if the British gov- 
               <br />
