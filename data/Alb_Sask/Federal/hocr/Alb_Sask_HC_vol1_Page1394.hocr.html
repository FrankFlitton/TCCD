               and when I ﬁnd that the legal minds in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> do not know What these 
               <br />
               sections mean is it any wonder that I as a 
               <br />
               layman entertain grave doubts what 
               <br />
               these sections mean. Am I not justiﬁed in 
               <br />
               demanding an explanation from the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of Justice after sitting here for weeks 
               <br />
               and weeks hearing this‘Bill discussed ? We 
               <br />
               are not to suppose that the Department of 
               <br />
               Justice is so careless and so indifferent, that 
               <br />
               after it has framed this legislation it does 
               <br />
               not know what‘ the meaning of ft is. I say 
               <br />
               that the member who writes to his consti— 
               <br />
               tuents telling them in glib fashion what 
               <br />
               this legislation means, (when the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice is not able or ready to tell), is 
               <br />
               not capable of representing an intelligent 
               <br />
               constituency. So far as I- am personally 
               <br />
               concerned I want to say that whatever 
               <br />
               powers we have in creating new provinces 
               <br />
               are set out in the British North America 
               <br />
               Act, and as a member of this House repre- 
               <br />
               senting a most intelligent constituency I 
               <br />
               am ready to say that I shall support any 
               <br />
               legislation creating these new provinces 
               <br />
               which gives them whatever rights they are 
               <br />
               entitled to under the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. I will support such a proposition as 
               <br />
               that, but I will not support a proposition 
               <br />
               the meaning of which the government and 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice will not explain, 
               <br />
               and which they will not say does not go 
               <br />
               beyond the powers which the British North 
               <br />
               America Act gives us. I am prepared to 
               <br />
               defend this stand of mine in this House or 
               <br />
               before my constituents or anywhere else. 
               <br />
               When the division on the second reading 
               <br />
               of this Bill was being taken, it brought 
               <br />
               back to my mind that in 1896 I sat here 
               <br />
               with many of my friends supporting a gov- 
               <br />
               ernment and supporting remedial legisla- 
               <br />
               tion in favour of the minority in Manitoba, 
               <br />
               whose rights I believed had been taken 
               <br />
               away from them. And after the election 
               <br />
               was over and the smoke of the battle had 
               <br />
               cleared, I found myself not on the govern- 
               <br />
               ment side of the House but on the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition side, and where were my comrades 
               <br />
               of the previous session. They had gone 
               <br />
               down in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">battle‘x‘defendinguthe</span> rights of the

               <br />
               ernment came into power. And today I

               satisﬁed with my own conduct on this ques-

               <br />
               the minority, and I want to say that I re- 
               <br />
               present a strong Protestant constituency 
               <br />
               now, as I did before, and I could have made 
               <br />
               much political capital if I chose to do it. I 
               <br />
               could have been elected practically by ac- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cla‘mation</span> in 1896 if I had pursued a differ-

               ent course <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> what I did ; but I believed 
               <br />
               it was my duty to pursue that course, and 
               <br />
               if the same question came up again I would 
               <br />
               take the same course that I took then. But 
               <br />
               this question stands in a different light. 
               <br />
               We are creating a territory into new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, and I for one will support the Brit- 
               <br />
               ish North America Act in whatever rights 
               <br />
               those provinces should have. I will wait

               for the opinion of the Department of Jus—

               Mr. INGRAM. Last evening I asked if 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice said that the Fran- 
               <br />
               chise Act did not provide for any lists in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, and I understood 
               <br />
               him to say that it did not, and on the 
               <br />
               strength of that I made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.my</span> statement. If 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman will say that the state- 
               <br />
               ment 1 made is wrong, I am ready to with- 
               <br />
               draw it and apologize to my hon. friend if 
               <br />
               1 made a mistake. 
               <br />

               Mr. FITZPATRIGK. It is not a question 
               <br />
               between the hon. gentleman’s word and 
               <br />
               mine. I want to know what he said to- 
               <br />
               night, and what he said he was prepared to 
               <br />
               prove. I understood him to say that I had 
               <br />
               stated last night that there were no lists for 
               <br />
