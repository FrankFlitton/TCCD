               Among the settlers are many from the United

               Another case, which may by analogy 
               <br />
               turn out in the Northwest is the fact that the 
               <br />
               Dominion government—I am not now refer- 
               <br />
               ring to either political party—neglected to 
               <br />
               place an export duty on logs, resulting in the 
               <br />
               closing of the saw-mills on the Georgian 
               <br />
               bay and Lake Huron. Millions and millions 
               <br />
               of Canadian logs kept the Michigan mills 
               <br />
               busy at the expense of Canadian mills, and 
               <br />
               mill owners after failing to impress their 
               <br />
               ideas on the Dominion government, appealed 
               <br />
               to the government of Ontario. The govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Ontario bowed to public opinion in 
               <br />
               the matter and did what the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment failed to do, to the great advantage 
               <br />
               of the province and to the great advantage 
               <br />
               of the Dominion at large. Indeed so success- 
               <br />
               ful has been the result of this policy that 
               <br />
               no political party would dare to interfere 
               <br />
               with it to-day. I believe that the admin- 
               <br />
               istration of the lands in the Northwest could 
               <br />
               be much better conducted by the local min- 
               <br />
               isters of the Crown who are on the spot, 
               <br />
               than by the mere agents of the Dominion 
               <br />
               ministers who are of necessity twenty-ﬁve 
               <br />
               hundred miles away from the scene of 
               <br />
               operations. For all these reasons I believe 
               <br />
               that the administration of the lands should 
               <br />
               be handed to the provinces, and I believe 
               <br />
               further that if the provinces are to be tied 
               <br />
               down to a ﬁxed annual payment, some day. 
               <br />
               perhaps in the not distant future, these 
               <br />
               provinces will be coming back to us asking 
               <br />
               for better terms. I believe that if the Min—

               he has advanced in this House to-night he 
               <br />
               would not touch a very responsive chord in 
               <br />
               the hearts of the settlers in the Northwest, 
               <br />
               who, I believe, are of the opinion that the 
               <br />
               provinces should have control of their 
               <br />
               lands, and not the Dominion government 
               <br />
               as this Bill proposes.

               Mr. LAKE. The hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Toronto (Mr. Foster) has proposed one 
               <br />
               method at any rate under which it might be 
               <br />
               possible for the new provinces to realize 
               <br />
               to some degree the actual value of their 
               <br />
               public resources. I consider that the ﬁg— 
               <br />
               ures quoted by the hon. gentleman were 
               <br />
               not in any way too roseate. The member 
               <br />
               for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) made a 
               <br />
               very hopeful estimate of what the popula- 
               <br />
               tion of these new provinces might be in the 
               <br />
               near future, and if that estimate be correct 
               <br />
               it is not only possible but probable that 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures given by the hon. member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.—</span>
