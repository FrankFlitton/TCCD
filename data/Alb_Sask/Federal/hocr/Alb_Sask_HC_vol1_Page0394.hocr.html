               last evening, there are no two provinces of 
               <br />
               Canada with the same constitution. I ven- 
               <br />
               ture to say that the average citizen of the 
               <br />
               Territory, if he had been asked if he would 
               <br />
               accept the autonomy that British Columbia 
               <br />
               has would have said: No, the limit of popu— 
               <br />
               lation would not suit either of these new 
               <br />
               provinces. If asked if he would accept the 
               <br />
               autonomy that Manitoba has, he would say 
               <br />
               certainly not, notwithstanding that Mani- 
               <br />
               toba is absolutely free in regard to the 
               <br />
               school matter, because the ﬁnancial terms 
               <br />
               given to Manitoba would be entirely unsatis- 
               <br />
               factory to the new provinces. For the same 
               <br />
               reason as in the case of British Columbia 
               <br />
               he would not be prepared to accept the au- 
               <br />
               tonomy which the maritime provinces pos- 
               <br />
               sess. Make the suggestion to him that he 
               <br />
               accept the autonomy which Quebec has, and 
               <br />
               what would he say? Quebec is limited in 
               <br />
               the matter of language; it is obliged to re— 
               <br />
               cognize ofﬁcially two languages, and it is 
               <br />
               limited in other respects. He would not ac-
