               night—which I did not know before—by 
               <br />
               the Solicitor General, that the hon. member 
               <br />

               member for Montmagny (Mr. A. Lavergne)

               Sproule) though working from different 
               <br />
               standpoints were working for the same end, 
               <br />
               and that therefore we were naturally allies. 
               <br />
               That idea dawned on me then for the first 
               <br />
               time and I thought it was due to myself 
               <br />
               that I should cross the ﬂoor and fraternize 
               <br />
               with the other members of the party. I 
               <br />
               congratulate the leader of that party on the 
               <br />
               vigour ‘his party has shown to night not— 
               <br />
               withstanding its youth, and it seems to me 
               <br />
               there is a more hopeful outlook for it in the 
               <br />
               future. As there seems .to be a desire to 
               <br />
               get proper legal interpretations of certain 
               <br />
               clauses, I wish to put a question. In view 
               <br />
               of the emphatic statement made by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Centre York (Mr. Campbell) 
               <br />
               when we were in North Oxford with regard 
               <br />
               to the meaning of clause 16, No. 2, I wish 
               <br />
               to get an interpretation from the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice. The hon. member for Centre 
               <br />
               York (Mr. Campbell) stated emphatically 
               <br />
               that clause 16, No. 2, left the new province 
               <br />
               free to amend this educational system and 
               <br />

               drew my attention to this portion of the

               Mr. MONK. I return to what I mention- 
               <br />
               ed a moment ago. Subsection _1, of section 
               <br />
               16, No. 2, makes provision for the protection 
               <br />
               of the existing rights of the Catholic mino- 
               <br />
               rity When they are in a minority in a school 
               <br />
               district, but it makes no provision for the 
               <br />
               protection of the majority where the ma- 
               <br />
               jority happens to be Catholics, in case the 
               <br />
               legislature should wish to interfere With 
               <br />
               their rights. Has my hon. friend given that
