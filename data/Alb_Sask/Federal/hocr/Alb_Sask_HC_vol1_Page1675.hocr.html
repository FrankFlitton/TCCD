               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. LAKE. The strongest reason given 
               <br />
               for the distribution in Saskatchewan was the 
               <br />
               number of votes cast in the election of 
               <br />
               November, 1903, that number having pre- 
               <br />
               ference over the number of voters on the list. 
               <br />
               That was the main principle applied in Al- 
               <br />
               berta, and I presume exactly the same prin- 
               <br />
               ciple has been applied in Saskatchewan. I

               his mind for giving two seats to that district

               was the great distances between the settle-

               Mr. OLIVER. Between the settlement 
               <br />
               at Lesser Slave lake and the settlement at 
               <br />
               Peace River, which is the nearest point at 
               <br />
               which they approach until they ﬁnally join, 
               <br />
               the distance is between 90 and 100 miles, 
               <br />
               and from that they diverge to a distance 
               <br />
               of about 200 miles apart, and ﬁnally they 
               <br />
               come together after a considerable distance.

               |Mr. LAKE. I ask this question to call 
               <br />
               attention to the fact among the electoral dis- 
               <br />
               tricts of the legislative assembly we have 
               <br />
               had one district electing a single member 
               <br />
               which I think would comprise a greater 
               <br />
               area than the settlements in the district of 
               <br />
               Athabaska, to which it is proposed now to 
               <br />
               give two members. I speak of the district 
               <br />
               of Kinistino, which, roughly speaking, is 
               <br />
               over 300 miles from east to west and about 
               <br />
               210 miles from north to south. But there 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> been no difﬁculty in holding an election 
               <br />
               for that district. It had 682 votes cast at 
               <br />
               the last election, a larger number than I 
               <br />
               think will be cast in these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">two</span> constituen- 
               <br />
               cies in Athabaska at the ﬁrst election for 
               <br />
               the new legislature, probably twice as many. 
               <br />
               1 do not know what map the Prime Minis- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span> 
               <br />
               ter has before him, but I notice that in 
               <br />
               most of the maps which have been supplied 
               <br />
               by this government the old distribution of 
               <br />
               seats was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given,</span> which does not contain the 
               <br />
               district of Kinistino as it exists at present. 
               <br />
               The old maps give the old distribution 
               <br />
               which was in force before 1902, when a 
               <br />
               redistribution was made by the legislative 
               <br />
               assembly. I have one of the new maps, 
               <br />
               and I can assure him that the ﬁgures I 
               <br />
               have given as to the distance are practically 
               <br />
               correct. There has been no practical dini- 
               <br />
               culty in that large district. The polls were 
               <br />
               held at very extreme distances, and the 
               <br />
               proclamation, I think, had to be delayed 
               <br />
               for a fortnight before all the returns could 
               <br />
               be obtained.
