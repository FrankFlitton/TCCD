               Mr. BRODEUR. I was discussing the

               <br />
               day in Montreal by my hon. friend from

               <br />
               has existed since 1892. there is no reason

               why in this parliament we should go farther

               <br />
               to interrupt him so often, but as he has 
               <br />
               paid special attention to me, I suppose he 
               <br />
               will allow me an opportunity of expressing 
               <br />
               my opinion. As far as the right of inter— 
               <br />
               ference by this parliament is concerned in 
               <br />
               respect‘ to the Northwest Territories I was 
               <br />
               under the impression, as was expressed. I 
               <br />
               think, by Sir John Thompson himself, that so 
               <br />
               far as the Northwest Territories were con- 
               <br />
               cerned, this government had no power of 
               <br />
               remedial legislation, but simply the power of 
               <br />
               disallowance. The minority came here and 
               <br />
               asked for disallowance in 1892, and it was re— 
               <br />
               fused by the then government. It is only be— 
               <br />
               cause they were refused this justice to which 
               <br />
               they were entitled that they accepted the 
               <br />
               I repeat in a nutshell that all I stated in 
               <br />
               Montreal was that the minority of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories are expecting from 
               <br />
               condition of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alfairs</span> that then existed. But 
               <br />
               this parliament a full guarantee under the 
               <br />
               law of all they possess now and not simply 
               <br />
               the guarantee that this government may 
               <br />
               pass remedial legislatiOn in respect to nine-

               Mr. BRODE'UR. For my part I rely on

               what the minority have been doing since 
               <br />
               1892, and I say that they get some protection 
               <br />
               under the legislation which we are now 
               <br />

               We are now engaged in the consideration of 
               <br />
               a most serious question. Confederation, is 
               <br />
               now being submitted to a severe test. 01d 
               <br />
               appeals on racial and religious grounds have 
               <br />
               been revived. We all remember how, a few 
               <br />
               years before confederation, these appeals 
               <br />
               contributed to render the government of 
               <br />
               Her Majesty absolutely impossible in this 
               <br />
               country. Governments lasting a few years, 
               <br />
               a few months, a few days, were succeeding 
               <br />
               themselves and none was strong enough to 
               <br />
               carry on the affairs of the country. In 
               <br />
               spite of the most prosperous times the 
               <br />
               development of the country was at a stand- 
               <br />
               still. Some of these engaged most actively 
               <br />
               in that sectional warfare found one day 
               <br />
               that their unhappy policy was the cause of 
               <br />
               that unfortunate situation. They reﬂected 
               <br />
               and came to the conclusion that they had 
               <br />
               to lay down their arms and adopt a more 
               <br />
               sensible policy. Then, the confederation 
               <br />
               scheme was brought before the country. 
               <br />
               They thought that a confederation of all 
               <br />
               the British provinces would remedy the 
               <br />
               existing evil and they were right. Since 
               <br />
               confederation a spirit of toleration has ani- 
               <br />
               mated the great men that have been at the 
               <br />
               head of both political parties. Macdonald. 
               <br />
               Campbell, Tapper, Tilley, Mackenzie and 
               <br />
               Blake always respected the creed and the 
               <br />
               views of the minority. Confederation de- 
               <br />
               veloped in a most extraordinary way. New 
               <br />
               provinces were brought into the union, a 
               <br />
               vast territory was acquired, a great trans- 
               <br />
               continental railway was built, our canals 
               <br />
               and waterways were deepened, railways 
               <br />
               were subsidized throughout the country and 
               <br />
               millions have been spent to bring immi- 
               <br />
               grants from all parts of the world. We are 
               <br />
               all glad to know that during the last few 
               <br />
               years Canada has developed in to one of the 
               <br />
               most prosperous nations of the world. It 
               <br />
               was expected that those sacred traditions 
               <br />
               of the Conservative party would be kept 
               <br />
               up and that we would continue to enjoy 
               <br />
               peace and harmony. But. unfortunately, 
               <br />
               a section of the Conservative party <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day'</span> 
               <br />
               is forgetting the lessons of history and re- 
               <br />
               fuses to give to the minority the rights to 
               <br />
               which they are entitled under the constitu-
