               They are ﬁrmly convinced that it will be

               a great injury to that country to saddle it

               with a dual system of schools. It may be

               that the ideals which a section of the peo-

               Before this Bill was introduced, I had re-

               ceived a great many letters, chieﬂy from my

               constituents, with reference to this question,

               and also I received a large number after 
               <br />
               this Bill was brought down. I have selected 
               <br />
               two letters from the bunch in my desk. and 
               <br />

               that the greater—number of the letters I
