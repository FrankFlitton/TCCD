               stand it is that they should be subsidies

               Mr. FIELDING. That is the contention 
               <br />
               I know that my hon. friend has always 
               <br />
               made in relation to the case in Ontario, and 
               <br />
               it has always been arguable. There is how- 
               <br />
               ever a difference between the Ontario case 
               <br />
               and this case. In the case of Ontario the 
               <br />
               Act under which these increased sums are 
               <br />
               granted treated them as capital. I am 
               <br />
               speaking from memory but I think that is 
               <br />
               correct. The government of the day carried 
               <br />
               those sums to the credit of the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario, and they remained as a debt due 
               <br />
               by the Dominion to the province of Onta- 
               <br />
               rio and were so placed in the public ac- 
               <br />
               counts. This parliament passed an Act a 
               <br />
               good many years ago which declared—I am 
               <br />
               speaking from memory but I think I am cor- 
               <br />
               rect—that where there is a sum available in 
               <br />
               the debt account of any province that sum 
               <br />
               may, on the application of the government 
               <br />
               of the province, be withdrawn for the pur- 
               <br />
               poses of public works. Under that Act 
               <br />
               various provinces of the Dominion did with- 
               <br />
               draw from their debt accounts sums of 
               <br />
               money, thereby reducing their capital sum 
               <br />
               and thereby reducing their annual revenue. 
               <br />
               When the question was raised in regard to 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario, my view was that, 
               <br />
               under the Act, Ontario could under certain 
               <br />
               conditions, which I shall state later, apply 
               <br />
               to the Dominion for that money, and that 
               <br />
               under those conditions the province might 
               <br />
               receive that money as a payment out of its 
               <br />
               own invested capital. Of course, I went on 
               <br />
               to say that it was not a practical question 
               <br />
               inasmuch as it was not conceivable that 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario would withdraw 
               <br />
               money earning 5 per cent when it could go 
               <br />
               out on the public market and borrow at 4 
               <br />
               per cent or less. Therefore it always seem- 
               <br />
               ed to me to be rather more of. an aca— 
               <br />
               demic subject which we were discussing, a 
               <br />
               matter not likely ever to take practical 
               <br />
               shape. But under an Act passed away back 
               <br />
               in, I think, 1874, provision was made that 
               <br />
               a provincial government might under cer— 
               <br />
               tain conditions withdraw from its capital 
               <br />
               accounts at Ottawa sums of money for pub— 
               <br />
               lic works. I think that in the beginning of 
               <br />
               the matter when that Act was passed it was 
               <br />
               entirely a matter for executive action be-

               the Dominion. That is to say if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">execu-</span> 
               <br />
               tive of the province made application for the 
               <br />
               money and if the executive of the Dominion 
               <br />
               should see ﬁt to grant it, the money might 
               <br />
               thereupon be paid out for the purposes de- 
               <br />
               signated, always limiting it to public works. 
               <br />
               Later on, about the year 1885, the Act was 
               <br />
               amended to provide that a province could 
               <br />
               only make applications for money out of 
               <br />
               such funds when so authorized by the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial legislature; and, speaking from 
               <br />
               memory, I think that is the state of the law 
               <br />
               to—day. In order to draw money out of that 
               <br />
               capital fund, there must ﬁrst be the 
               <br />
               authority of the provincial legislature 
               <br />
               supporting the demand of the provin- 
               <br />
               cial government, and then it becomes 
               <br />
               a matter of discretion with the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor General in Council whether or not he 
               <br />
               will advance the money for the purposes 
               <br />
               stated. That was the substance of the ans- 
               <br />
               wer which I gave to the government of the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario. As I said a moment ago 
               <br />
               I treated it rather as an academic question, 
               <br />
               for I did not quite see how it could practi- 
               <br />
               cally rise. The money was earning 5 per 
               <br />
               cent in the treasury of the Dominion, and as 
               <br />
               I said it was hardly to be supposed that the 
               <br />
               government of any province would with- 
               <br />
               draw that money when they could go out 
               <br />
               on the public market and borrow money at 
               <br />
               «l per cent or less. So much on the general 
               <br />
               subject of the law. In the case of Ontario 
               <br />
               that sum was carried into the public ac- 
               <br />
               counts as a debt due by the Dominion to 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario. I admit that under 
               <br />
               the language used in this resolution it is 
               <br />
               not declared to be capital, and perhaps there 
               <br />
               is some room to doubt whether under this 
               <br />
               we could capitalize it. I am rather dis- 
               <br />
               posed to take the view that it ought to be 
               <br />
               regarded as an annuity and not as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cap—</span> 
               <br />
               ital, sum. I understand that is the view 
               <br />
               suggested by my hon. friend (Mr. Hender- 
               <br />
               son), that he thinks it ought to be an an- 
               <br />
               nuity and not a capital sum. There <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is.</span> 
               <br />
               a good deal to be said in favour of 
               <br />
               that view and before the matter is ﬁnally 
               <br />
               disposed of—I shall not regard it as ﬁnal 
               <br />
               now,—I am inclined to think much might 
               <br />
               be said in favour of inserting words 
               <br />
               which would make that clear. I quite 
               <br />
               realize that these amounts which do not 
               <br />
               represent an actual debt, represent allow- 
               <br />
               ances made to one province or another in 
               <br />
               accordance with the various conditions of 
               <br />
               the public debt; that these are all methods 
               <br />
               of bookkeeping. They were not actual 
               <br />
               debts ; but, by virtue of the terms on which 
               <br />
               these grants were made, in some if not all 
               <br />
               instances. they were carried into the public 
               <br />
               debt account of theDominion. In that ac- 
               <br />
               count they stand as debts due to the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion by the province, and I am inclined to
