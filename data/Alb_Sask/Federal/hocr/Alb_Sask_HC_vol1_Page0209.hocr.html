               <br />
               ever to whether a province was organ— 
               <br />
               ized before or not. It‘ there was a

               class of persons who had rights at the 
               <br />
               union, when they came into the union 
               <br />
               they should continue to have those rights— 
               <br />
               .that is the whole intent and meaning of the 
               <br />
               section ; there is no other explanation. 
               <br />
               That is as Mr. Haultain understood it ; that 
               <br />
               is as any man, I think, must understand it 
               <br />
               if he reads it with due care. That being the 
               <br />
               case, the British North America Act being 
               <br />
               the constitution of this country, I say that, 
               <br />
               although I am no lover of separate schools, 
               <br />
               although I do not believe in separate schools 
               <br />
               as so many of our people do. this govern- 
               <br />
               ment would certainly be doing very much 
               <br />
               less than its duty if it undertook, under all 
               <br />
               the circumstances of the case especially. to 
               <br />
               deviate from the terms of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act or took any other course than 
               <br />
               loyally to carry out its provisions. In regard 
               <br />
               to the terms of the ﬁrst clause 16 and the 
               <br />
               second clause 16. I will take the liberty of 
               <br />
               saying that for my own part, I would rather 
               <br />
               not have seen any clause 16 at all. I believe 
               <br />
               that according to the British North America 
               <br />
               Act, the separate schools of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories would have exactly the same pro- 
               <br />
               tection that they have under the provisions 
               <br />
               I know that all my friends do 
               <br />
               not agree with me in that view. I take it 
               <br />
               that clause 16 is merely a declaration on the 
               <br />
               part of parliament of meaning and intent; 
               <br />
               the provisions of clause 16 are declaratory 
               <br />
               and not mandatory. I say that I would 
               <br />
               prefer that there would not be any clause 
               <br />
               16, that there should not be any declaration 
               <br />
               of the meaning and intent of these pro- 
               <br />
               visions of the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               I say that as a Protestant living in a coun— 
               <br />
               try where the large majority are Protes— 
               <br />
               tants, and as one who does not believe in 
               <br />
               separate schools ; living Where the majority 
               <br />
               do not believe in separate schools. I take 
               <br />
               the view that, situated as we are we are in 
               <br />
               a sufﬁciently strong position to maintain our 
               <br />

               <br />
               are other gentlemen who do not take that 
               <br />
               view ; and I am bou‘nd to say also that they 
               <br />
               have some fairly good reasons for the view
