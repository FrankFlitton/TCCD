               ment on the 3rd of November last. Here is 
               <br />
               another comparison I would like to make 
               <br />
               before sitting down. Ten southern consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies cast upwards of 1,100 votes each— 
               <br />
               one of them as high as 2,500. There are 
               <br />
               three northern constituencies which, group- 
               <br />
               ed together, did not cast 1,000 votes among 
               <br />
               them. That appears to me an extraordinary 
               <br />
               condition of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs.</span> The three northern 
               <br />
               constituencies are Redberry, Humboldt and 
               <br />
               Prince Albert. Prince Albert city and Prince 
               <br />
               Albert rural district get a very ample re- 
               <br />
               presentation—far more than they are en- 
               <br />
               titled to on an even distribution. I might 
               <br />
               refer to that question of Prince Albert 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«I</span> mentioned just now. Prince Al- 
               <br />
               bert, city and country together, cast 1,026 
               <br />
               votes. There is another constituency in the 
               <br />
               northern part of the district, the district 
               <br />
               of Kinistino, which the government proposes 
               <br />
               to form. That district has an area, outside 
               <br />
               of Athabaska altogether, of 25,000 square 
               <br />
               miles odd. The two districts of Prince Al- 
               <br />
               bert have between them only an area of 
               <br />
               6,555 square miles. The vote cast in the 
               <br />
               district of Kinistino was 1,029. That is 
               <br />
               to say, even with that enormous area the 
               <br />
               vote cast in the district of Kinistino was 
               <br />
               in excess of that cast in the two 
               <br />
               constituencies alongside, to which the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment proposes to give two representa- 
               <br />
               tives. I may have something more to say 
               <br />
               on this matter later on. For the present I 
               <br />

               Mr. SCOTT. My hon. friend asked the 
               <br />
               committee to look at the area of Maple 
               <br />
               Creek in comparison with the district of 
               <br />
               Rosthern. I ﬁnd upon his own map that 
               <br />
               he has actually added to the area of Maple 
               <br />
               Creek by something over 6,000 square miles. 
               <br />
               And in the district of Rosthern he has cut 
               <br />
               off a township or two and actually makes 
               <br />
               it smaller than it is in the Schedule pre- 
               <br />
               sented by the government. I ﬁnd also that 
               <br />
               one of his pet districts, the district of Wol- 
               <br />
               seley, which is certainly not a very large 
               <br />
               district even upon the government map, he 
               <br />
               has reduced by some three townships. Wol— 
               <br />
               seley did not cast a very large vote either 
               <br />
               last fall. They didn’t have a large regis- 
               <br />
               tered vote last fall. And, consulting other 
               <br />
               statistics, we are led to believe that the 
               <br />
               population of Wolseley has not been in- 
               <br />
               creasing as fast as that of other places.

               Mr. SCOTT. If my hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               Lake) found a district that was not ex- 
               <br />
               ceptionally large, that was, in fact, rather 
               <br />
               on the small side, which did not cast a

               vote last fall equal to the average, what

               was his purpose in reducing the size? I am
