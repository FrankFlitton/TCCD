               at the closing of the school portions of that 
               <br />
               Book taught and read to the children? 
               <br />
               Will it be worse for them if they know 
               <br />
               the Ten Commandments ? Will it be worse 
               <br />
               for them if they know the sermon on the 
               <br />
               mount in which is contained the golden rule? 
               <br />
               Or the ﬁfteenth psalm that describes what 
               <br />
               a citizen ought to be. If it be desirable—as 
               <br />
               it is—that during the Sabbath afternoon, 
               <br />
               the children should be brought together in 
               <br />
               order to teach them these things, can it be 
               <br />
               wrong—if it can be agreed upon—that dur-

               <br />
               other days of the week they should have 
               <br />
               the same instruction? I do not seek to 
               <br />
               obtrude my own personal views, I speak for 
               <br />
               myself alone. But I trust that that spirit 
               <br />
               will take possession of the men in the west- 
               <br />
               ern country, and that, instead of repining

               <br />
               low-citizens, in obedience to their conscience, 
               <br />
               give religious instruction to their youth, 
               <br />
               they also will devise means whereby relig— 
               <br />
               ious instruction may be given in the schools. 
               <br />
               As I have said, I am aware of the difﬁ- 
               <br />
               culties that in the past, have prevented this 
               <br />
               being accomplished. But I do think that, 
               <br />
               with the spirit of charity that is abroad, 
               <br />
               and with many Protestants seeking means 
               <br />
               for a concerted movement in this direction, 
               <br />
               it would be well worth their while at any 
               <br />
               rate to give the matter some consideration. 
               <br />
               There have been noble men, Canadians of 
               <br />
               French extraction, who have labouredin 
               <br />
               the Northwest as missionaries in days gone 
               <br />
               by ; and there have been grand Protestant 
               <br />
               clergymen who have engaged in the same 
               <br />
               work, believing that it is the duty of Can- 
               <br />
               adians to establish the Christian religion in 
               <br />
               that country as the foundation of its insti- 
               <br />
               tutions. Many a time have I heard such 
               <br />
               a view expressed publicly and at least once 
               <br />
               in my own home by one who has passed 
               <br />
               away, but whose memory is revered, one 
               <br />
               who was a noble patriot it‘ ever there was 
               <br />
               one—that the great object to be sought in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories was to follow 
               <br />
               with religious ordinances the population 
               <br />
               pouring in there, so that they might become 
               <br />
               a great people and enduring power in the 
               <br />
               state. I say that I for one have no

               objections; nay more, I am glad to ﬁnd, 
               <br />

               I was pleased to receive the resolution

               I believe he is also a political friend of the

               party in power. I cannot give the exact 
               <br />
               words, but he said in etÏeet that he was not

               disposed to blame the Prime Minister (Sir

               of this measure, of course—as some were 
               <br />
               disposed to do; but he was disposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to.</span>

               question; were they favourable, or were-

               that Mr. Stapleton Caldecott knew enough
