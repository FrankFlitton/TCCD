               Mr. MONK. My hon. friend the Minister 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofythe</span> Interior seemed to be very much em- 
               <br />
               barrassed as to the interpretation of the 
               <br />
               amendment which I have presented to the 
               <br />
               House that even after a lengthy discussion 
               <br />
               with the leader of the opposition. he seems 
               <br />
               still not to understand the gist of it. I told 
               <br />
               my hon. friend that it might be modiﬁed. 
               <br />
               There‘is no doubt that the sub-amendment 
               <br />
               presented by the hon. member for Labelle 
               <br />
               more clearly expresses the full extent of the 
               <br />
               rights that were granted in 1870 and sub- 
               <br />
               sequently consecrated by legislation. If my 
               <br />
               hon. friend has any doubt as to the meaning 
               <br />
               of my amendment, he had better vote with 
               <br />
               me for the sub-amendment of the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Labelle. I thought my hon. friend 
               <br />
               would take a larger view of this question, 
               <br />
               and deal with it on its merits as the right 
               <br />
               hon. leader of the government did, instead 
               <br />
               of spending most of his argument in trying 
               <br />
               to cast obscurity on the amendment as I 
               <br />
               drafted it. I may say that it is only a re- 
               <br />
               petition of the law as it Was drafted in 
               <br />
               1890 The Minister of Inland Revenue and 
               <br />
               the Solicitor General have said again and 
               <br />
               again—it is their hackneyed defence—that 
               <br />
               those who bring up the question of this kind 
               <br />
               do so for the purpose of creating an agita- 
               <br />
               tion. Is my hon. friend serious in that? 
               <br />
               Is it his opinion that we have such a low 
               <br />

               <br />

               upon it as one of the most culpable acts a 
               <br />

               this important question to the notice of 
               <br />
               this House, as he was in duty bound to

               men of French origin against the rest of

               every occasion has done that miserable 
               <br />
