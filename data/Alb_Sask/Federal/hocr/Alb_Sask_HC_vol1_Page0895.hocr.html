               <br />
               should I listen to the voice of Ontario? I 
               <br />
               heard my hon. friend from Souris (Mr.

               <br />
               quoted with apparent joy, the remarks made

               by my hon. friend from Brandon (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />

               <br />
               Haldimand in 1896, stating that the coat 
               <br />
               was the coat of a Conservative government, 
               <br />
               but the voice was the voice of the church. 
               <br />
               Now, Mr. Speaker, which shall I turn to, 
               <br />
               shall I touch the garment or shall I listen 
               <br />
               to the voice of the church? I will do neither,

               I will accept the conditions just as I ﬁnd

               <br />
               My own position brieﬂy stated is: that in

               view of the conﬂicting opinions expressed 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the House with respect to the application 
               <br />
               of clause 93 and other clauses of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, it is the duty of this

               parliament to interpret these clauses into

               the Bill, in line with the spirit of the con- 
               <br />
               stitution, and give to the new provinces a 
               <br />
               constitutional certainty without which it is 
               <br />
               impossible to expect satisfactory social and 
               <br />
               educational progress. What are the pro- 
               <br />
               positions now before the House ? We have 
               <br />
               in the ﬁrst place the amended clause in-

               <br />
               enjoyed by the people of the Territories. We 
               <br />
               have in the second place, the amendment 
               <br />
               of the leader of the opposition which pro- 
               <br />
               vides that the people of the new provinces 
               <br />

               Carthy) which in effect is that the new prov- 
               <br />
               inces shall have unreservedly the right to 
               <br />
               legislate with respect to matters of educa- 
               <br />
               tion. I shall very brieﬂy state my position 
               <br />
               with respect to these three propositions, 
               <br />
               and I shall give my reasons for approving 
               <br />
               of one and rejecting the others. In the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place, I claim that the amended clause 
               <br />
               as proposed by the leader of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment contains an element of certainty, is in 
               <br />
               line with the spirit of the constitution, and 
               <br />
               is acceptable to the great majority of the 
               <br />
               people of the Territories. On the other 
               <br />
               hand, the proposal of the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition is not certain ; it invites litiga- 
               <br />
               tion and it promises to have imposed upon 
               <br />
               the people of the new provinces by the 
               <br />
               courts a constitution with respect to educa- 
               <br />
               tional matters which might tie the hands 
               <br />
               of the new provinces, thereby defeating the 
               <br />
               aim and purpose of that amendment. The

               North Simcoe (Mr. L. G. McCarthy) is not 
               <br />
               yet crystallized in the shape of a resolution, 
               <br />
               but so far as I can understand it is objec-
