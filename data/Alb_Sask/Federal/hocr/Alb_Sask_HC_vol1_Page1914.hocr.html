               ther reason why French speaking fathers of

               families will, especially in separate schools, 
               <br />
               teach French to their children. In fact, 
               <br />
               one of the reasons that were given in 1893 
               <br />
               against the ordinances of 1892' was, that it 
               <br />
               was against the spirit of the' constitution of 
               <br />
               these Territories to abolish the teaching of 
               <br />
               a language which was acknowledged as an

               moments dealing with this question because 
               <br />
               it seems to me. that in this age of the world

               agree with the hon. member (Mr. Bourassa) 
               <br />
               either in his logic or his conclusions, both 
               <br />
               of which were much at fault. I happen to 
               <br />
               lind myself to-night—it is a very rare thing

               indeed—in agreement, with the leader of 
               <br />
               the government on a question of this kind. 
               <br />
               We were together in 1896 on the great ques- 
               <br />
               tion of provincial rights, and we are to— 
               <br />
               gether to-night on this question of the 
               <br />
               French language. Let me express the hope 
               <br />
               that before this Bill goes through the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman will come back to his posi- 
               <br />
               tion of 1896 in defence of provincial rights, 
               <br />
               and then we will be absolutely in accord; 
               <br />
               but I am afraid he is like the Indian who 
               <br />
               lost his Wigwam. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Monk) who introduced the motion said: 
               <br />
               That in pursuance of a solemn agreement 
               <br />
               entered into when Rupert’s Land was ac-

               with conditions as we ﬁnd them, and that

               although at one time the French people in

               <br />
               There might be something in favour of

               the argument that we should give an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂ‘icial</span>

               language to the Germans or to the Russians 
               <br />
