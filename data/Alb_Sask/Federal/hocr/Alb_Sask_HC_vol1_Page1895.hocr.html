               Would not the federal parliament <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span>

               my hon. friend agitate the country and ask 
               <br />
               that the 200,000 French Canadians in the 
               <br />

               the ofﬁcial use of the French language in

               <br />

               nobody would dare agitate for such a
