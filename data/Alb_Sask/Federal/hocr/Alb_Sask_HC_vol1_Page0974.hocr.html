               claim. Now, almost every hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               who has spoken on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> government side ot 
               <br />
               the House has mentioned the fact that Mr. 
               <br />
               A. T. Gait was instrumental in getting the 
               <br />
               separate school clauses introduced into the 
               <br />
               Confederation Act with regard to Ontario 
               <br />
               and Quebec. That is quite true. But Mr. 
               <br />
               Gait was then seeking to legislate for a dif- 
               <br />
               ferent set of circumstances altogether from 
               <br />
               the circumstances of the Catholic minorities 
               <br />
               in the other provinces. It is a well known 
               <br />
               and admitted fact that in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec the national schools are not such as 
               <br />
               Protestant children can attend. That is not 
               <br />
               the case in the other provinces, because there 
               <br />
               is nothing in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">national~</span> schools of the 
               <br />
               other provinces which prevents any Catholic 
               <br />
               child from obtaining an education in them. 
               <br />
               Of course there is the sentimental objection 
               <br />
               on the part of our Catholic fellow citizens to 
               <br />
               allowing their children to go to such schools. 
               <br />
               But I tell hon. gentlemen in this House that 
               <br />
               in the great majority of the towns and 
               <br />
               villages of Ontario separate schools do not 
               <br />
               exist, and Catholic children go to the public 
               <br />
               schools. As an instance, I can mention my 
               <br />
               own town, containing something over 4,000 
               <br />
               inhabitants, where there has never been a 
               <br />
               separate school. The Catholic boys and girls 
               <br />
               are educated in the public schools side by 
               <br />
               side with Protestant children, and I venture 
               <br />
               to say that they become just as good citizens, 
               <br />
               ‘ just as good Catholics and just as good peo- 
               <br />
               ple in every sense of the word, as children 
               <br />
               who are educated in the separate schools. 
               <br />
               I tell hon. gentlemen opposite that in the 
               <br />
               town where I reside I do not believe there 
               <br />
               is a single illiterate child, either of the Catho- 
               <br />
               lic or of any other persuasion. They all get 
               <br />
               the same education, they are all satisﬁed 
               <br />
               with it. My hon. friend from Leeds (Mr. 
               <br />
               Taylor) said last night that the same state 
               <br />
               of affairs exists in his town, and I am sure 
               <br />
               that it exists in hundreds of towns and 
               <br />
               hundreds of municipalities in the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario. Therefore, I say that there is no 
               <br />
               parallel between the need for the insertion of 
               <br />
               a separate school clause in favour of the 
               <br />
               Protestant minority in the province of Qu— 
               <br />
               bec and the need for the insertion of a separ- 
               <br />
               ate school clause in favour of the Catholic 
               <br />
               minorities in the other provinces. ,

               reason to believe that it was not right that 
               <br />

               matter without interference by the federal

               <br />
               cational clauses of these Bills, and that we 
               <br />
               should allow these new provinces the same 
               <br />
               right to deal wtih their educational institu-

               tlemen on the government side of the House 
               <br />

               result does not follow at all, and is not likely 
               <br />
               to follow. Surely if you can trust to the

               <br />
               in respect to education, you can trust these 
               <br />
               great new provinces in the Northwest to deal 
               <br />
               justly with the minority also. I think we 
               <br />
               may safely assume that the men who are 
               <br />

               <br />
               But it is the principle that we oppose, the 
               <br />
               principle of refusing to those new provinces 
               <br />

               hon. gentleman who has spoken on the other

               <br />
