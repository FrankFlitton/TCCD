               vincial charter, but it has since become a 
               <br />
               matter of greater magnitude than concerns 
               <br />
               merely British Columbia, because this com- 
               <br />
               pany has come to the Dominion parliament 
               <br />
               and the Dominion parliament, not only re- 
               <br />
               cently, but long ago declared this to be 
               <br />
               a work in the general interest of Canada. 
               <br />
               Perhaps on some occasions this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment has been too quick to declare that 
               <br />
               works. are for the general advantage of 
               <br />
               Canada, but as that declaration has been 
               <br />
               solemnly made by parliament in this case, 
               <br />
               we must assume it is true ; and that being 
               <br />
               so, it is the duty of this parliament to see 
               <br />
               that all necessary investigations should be 
               <br />
               made—even if there is a temporary delay— 
               <br />
               into the conditions which would prevent the 
               <br />
               construction of this railway upon all Cana- 
               <br />
               dian territory. Is there a gentleman in this 
               <br />
               House so ignorant of the conditions that 
               <br />
               exist to the south of the international line— 
               <br />
               even the hon. gentleman who ﬁrst inter- 
               <br />
               rupted me—who does not know that when 
               <br />
               we allow the deviation of our smelting 
               <br />
               trade from Canada to the United States, not 
               <br />
               only do we give to the United States the 
               <br />
               proﬁt on the labour which should accrue to 
               <br />
               Canada, but we also afford an inducement 
               <br />
               to our young Canadians to go into the United 
               <br />
               States to seek that labour which they should 
               <br />
               have at home. Having regard to the fact 
               <br />
               that two prominent members of the admin- 
               <br />
               istration are not in sympathy with this mea- 
               <br />
               sure, it behooves us to consider it well. The 
               <br />
               Finance Minister pledged himself to the 
               <br />
               committee that this Bill should be carefully 
               <br />
               considered by the government and their 
               <br />
               policy announced on it; it is a signiﬁcant 
               <br />
               and unfortunate fact that the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance. who is supposed to be best versed 
               <br />
               in ﬁnancial matters, is not here to-night to 
               <br />
               give the House the beneﬁt of his judgment. 
               <br />
               I see. signs which convince me that the 
               <br />
               pledge given by the Minister of Finance has 
               <br />
               not been satisfactorily redeemed; I have 
               <br />
               evidence that the governmenthas given this 
               <br />
               matter only very casual consideration, be- 
               <br />
