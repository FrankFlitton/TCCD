               There is one other point upon which I shall 
               <br />
               dwell for a moment and which is, perhaps 
               <br />
               a little out of its place here. I refer to the 
               <br />
               argument which my right hon. friend made 
               <br />
               not only to-day, but also a month ago with 
               <br />
               regard to the tax exemption of the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway. In triumphant tones on 
               <br />
               both occasions he likened this matter to an 
               <br />
               obligation upon parliament to observe the 
               <br />
               terms of a contract ; he has said : in esta- 
               <br />
               blishing these Territories you cannot rid 
               <br />
               the people of the Northwest from that ex- 
               <br />
               emption which was imposed by'a statute 
               <br />
               passed in 1880. He told us that no one 
               <br />
               would suggest any such thing, and that no 
               <br />
               one had ever attempted to suggest it. Well, 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman’s memory is not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> good. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">il</span> myself had the telnerity to 
               <br />
               suggest that very thing in this parliament. 
               <br />
               I said two years ago that I thought 
               <br />
               the government should seriously take into 
               <br />
               consideration the question of removing that 
               <br />
               exemption—and parliament can do it,—but 
               <br />
               I said that parliament must strictly observe 
               <br />
               the terms of its obligation and _that in such 
               <br />
               case it would be absolutely necessary for 
               <br />
               parliament to institute an inquiry and to 
               <br />
               make good to the‘Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               everything to which they were entitled by 
               <br />
               reason of the removal of the exemption.

               my right hon. friend. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories said that he 
               <br />
               was not consulted with regard to the pro-

               visions of section 16 as originally drafted.

               He has stated in a letter—and I have not

               heard it contradicted—that there was only 
               <br />

               the answer of the right hon. gentleman
