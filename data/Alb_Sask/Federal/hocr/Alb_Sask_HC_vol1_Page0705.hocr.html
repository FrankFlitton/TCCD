               forced to admit that from the constitutional 
               <br />
               standpoint I do not know much more than 
               <br />
               when the debate began. But, Sir, I will 
               <br />
               say, that so far as I can understand the 
               <br />
               matter, the people of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories have from time to time seen ﬁt to 
               <br />
               change their educational policy to meet the 
               <br />
               circumstances and conditions as they arose. 
               <br />
               No doubt there is a great deal in what hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite tell us; that in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories they have a fairly 
               <br />
               good educational policy at the present time. 
               <br />
               but, if it suits existing conditions who is 
               <br />
               going to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> that it will be a satisfactory 
               <br />
               policy in 100 years from now. Therefore 
               <br />
               I will not cast my vote to shackle these 
               <br />
               provinces in their educational policy for 
               <br />
               all time to come. In my opinion it is a 
               <br />
               question which the provinces themselves can 
               <br />
               well deal with, and in the interest of the 
               <br />
               people of the Territories and in the interest 
               <br />
               of the country generally, it would be far 
               <br />
               better to leave the question in the hands of 
               <br />
               the new provinces. If that had been done 
               <br />
               this very delicate question would be re- 
               <br />
               moved from the arena of federal politics 
               <br />
               and the feeling which exists in the country 
               <br />
               at this moment would not have arisen. 
               <br />
               Now, Sir, I have spoken just as I have felt 
               <br />
               on this question ; I may not have been able 
               <br />

               <br />
               the measure now before the House. At the 
               <br />
               outset. Mr. Speaker, as a new member of 
               <br />
               parliament, it is perhaps proper that I 
               <br />
               should ask this House to ext'end to me that 
               <br />
               gracious indulgence which is usually al- 
               <br />
               lowed to one who solicits its attention for 
               <br />
               the :ﬁrst time. Up to the present, Mr. Speak- 
               <br />
               er, I have not occupied the time of this par- 
               <br />
               liament, nor will I do so now, at greater 
               <br />
               length than is necessary to set before the 
               <br />
               House the views which as a western repre- 
               <br />
               sentative I hold on the important measure 
               <br />
               now under consideration. The feeling which 
               <br />
               the introduction of this legislation. granting 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy, produced in the west, 
               <br />
               I think I may say the universal feeling, 
               <br />
               was a feeling of gratiﬁcation that this gov— 
               <br />
               ernment had decided to grant to the people 
               <br />
               of the Territories provincial rights and 
               <br />
               powers. There was of course some objec- 
               <br />
               tion to some of the provisions contained in 
               <br />
               the Bill, and there were some criticisms as 
               <br />
               to certain of its terms and conditions, but 
               <br />
               the general sntiment throughout the entire 
               <br />
               west was one of satisfaction and gratiﬁca— 
               <br />
               tion at being recorded that larger measures 
               <br />
               of self-government provided for in the legis- 
               <br />
               lation now before the House. In bringing 
               <br />
               down this Bill, the government has recog- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               nized the desire of the people of the west 
               <br />
               for provincial autonomy. That desire has 
               <br />
               been evidenced on several occasions by re- 
               <br />
               solutions passed by the legislative assembly 
               <br />
               at Regina; but while these resolutions are 
               <br />
               evidence of the desire of the people of the 
               <br />
               west Itor provincial institutions, they are not 
               <br />
               evidence that the people of the west or the 
               <br />
               members of the territorial legislature ever 
               <br />
               agreed as to the terms and conditions upon 
               <br />
               which they desire that autonomy should 
               <br />
               be granted. I point this out, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               because it has been stated in this House in-

               <br />

               <br />

               which Mr. Haultain submitted to this gov-

               ernment received the endorsation of the
