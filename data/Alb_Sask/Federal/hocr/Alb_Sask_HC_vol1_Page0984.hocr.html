               <br />
               there shall be only one legislative assembly. 
               <br />
               We have also to decide what the laws and 
               <br />
               courts shall be, what rules and regulations 
               <br />
               shall govern in the courts, what their rights

               The government have, I think wisely, in 
               <br />
               this Bill provided that all the laws and 
               <br />
               courts and ofﬁcers shall be continued 
               <br />
               as they are at present, leaving it to 
               <br />
               the provinces to ﬁnally decide or to make 
               <br />
               any other provision that seems to them 
               <br />
               best. We have also to decide what shall 
               <br />
               be done with the Hudson Bay Company’s 
               <br />
               privileges. We did not leave that to the 
               <br />
               provinces. We say in the Bill now before 
               <br />
               the House that nothing in this Bill shall 
               <br />
               in any way prejudice or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁect</span> the rights 
               <br />
               and privileges of the Hudson Bay Company. 
               <br />
               Then too, certain powers were granted to 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway many years 
               <br />
               ago, whereby they were granted perpetual 
               <br />
               exemption from taxation on their road, 
               <br />
               their stations, sidings, workshops, build— 
               <br />
               ings, rolling stock and all. That was em- 
               <br />
               ‘bodied <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in:</span> an Act passed by this parliament 
               <br />
               many years ago. We have accordingly set 
               <br />
               forth in this Bill that these rights and 
               <br />
               privileges shall remain and so, Sir. you will 
               <br />
               see the importance of this Bill so far as the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories are concerned. We 
               <br />
               have then had the important duty placed 
               <br />
               upon this parliament not only to decide and 
               <br />
               ﬁx the boundaries of these Territories but 
               <br />
               their manner and procedure of government, 
               <br />
               their rights, privileges and so forth. In 
               <br />
               many of these respects we have probably 
               <br />
               gone against the wishes of some people, 
               <br />
               certainly in some cases we have gone 
               <br />
               against the wishes and desires of the pre- 
               <br />
               sent premier of the Territories, Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               tain, but the wisdom of this House, will, 
               <br />
               I think, warrant the government in the 
               <br />
               stand they have taken, and I am quite sure 
               <br />
               that they are expressing the will of the 
               <br />
               great majority of the people of this Dom- 
               <br />
               inion in retaining the control of the public 
               <br />
               lands and arranging the constitution as 
               <br />
               they have done. There is also another ques- 
               <br />
               tion which has engaged the attention of 
               <br />
               this House almost exclusively in this de- 
               <br />
               bate; that is the question of education. 
               <br />
               What are we doing about education. We 
               <br />
               are simply legalizing the system of educa- 
               <br />
               tion that they have new in force, the system 
               <br />
               that has been in force for the last ﬁfteen 
               <br />
               years. No member of this House from the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories either Liberal or Con- 
               <br />
               servative who has spoken on this Bill, has 
               <br />
               denied that the school system that they 
               <br />
               now have in force and have had in force 
               <br />
               for the last ﬁfteen years in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories is a most excellent one; no 
               <br />
               complaints have reached the House from 
               <br />
               any parties up there objecting to the school 
               <br />

               Now, to my mind the objections that have 
               <br />
               been taken to these Bills and the arguments 
               <br />
               presented by many hon. gentlemen on the 
               <br />
               other side have been by no means fair. 
               <br />
               They have misrepresented the action of the 
               <br />
               government. It has been charged that by 
               <br />
               this legislation the government proposed to 
               <br />
               perpetuate in the Northwest a system of 
               <br />
               separate schools in the interest of the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic church, a system that, so 
               <br />
               far as the provinces are concerned, will be 
               <br />
               as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">runchangeable</span> as the laws of the Medes 
               <br />
               and Persians. They have said that we are 
               <br />
               strangling the new provinces, that we are 
               <br />
               binding them with bands of iron that they 
               <br />
               will never be able to break or unloose. And 
               <br />
               so the impression has gone forth throughout 
               <br />
               the country that we are doing something 
               <br />
               hideous in the Northwest, something that 
               <br />
               the people do not want, something that will 
               <br />
               inure to their grave disadvantage and will 
               <br />
               breed discontent and strife among them. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that this statement having 
               <br />
               gone forth, it is a right and proper thing 
               <br />
               for us to investigate and learn exactly what 
               <br />
               is being done. The territorial government 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories was ﬁrst es- 
               <br />
               tablished in 1875 by an Act passed by the 
               <br />
               parliament of the Dominion. Under that 
               <br />
               Act the minority, Protestant or Catholic. 
               <br />
               was given the right to establish separate 
               <br />
               schools. They did establish these separate 
               <br />
               schools. For a number of years they had 
               <br />
               a dual system of education, the same as 
               <br />
               we have in the province of Ontario, and 
               <br />
               the same as they have in the province of- 
               <br />
               Quebec. Some of these separate schools 
               <br />
               were Protestant schools but the larger por- 
               <br />
               tion of them were Roman Catholic. The 
               <br />
               public schools were managed by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the Northwest Territories, but 
               <br />
               the separate schools were managed and con- 
               <br />
               trolled as they are in the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec, and as they are in the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario, by the bodies that organized them. 
               <br />
               In the province of Quebec, I understand, 
               <br />
               the separate schools are exclusively Pro- 
               <br />
               testant schools. The Protestants manage 
               <br />
               these schools in their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way—they</span> select 
               <br />
               the teachers, they prescribe the text books, 
               <br />
               they have their own inspectors. The pro- 
               <br />
               vincial government gives these schools their 
               <br />
               regular grants of money, the same as to 
               <br />
               the other schools. In the province of Ou- 
               <br />
               tario <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ethe</span> separate schools are largely 
               <br />
               Catholic schools, though a few of them are 
               <br />
               Protestant. As in Quebec the Protestants 
               <br />
               manage their own schools, so ln Ontario 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholics manage their own 
               <br />
               schools, selecting the teachers, prescribing 
               <br />
               their qualiﬁcation of teachers, selecting the 
               <br />
               text books and making their own rules for 
               <br />
