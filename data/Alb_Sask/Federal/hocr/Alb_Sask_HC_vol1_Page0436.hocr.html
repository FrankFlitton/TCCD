               gerous on the part of the Dominion to grant 
               <br />
               autonomy to the Territories before that 
               <br />
               question had been ﬁnally adjudicated by the 
               <br />
               Privy Council. Now. has that question been 
               <br />
               ﬁnally passed upon? It is true that it has 
               <br />
               passed through the courts of Manitoba, it is 
               <br />
               true that there has been an appeal to the 
               <br />
               Supreme Court, and the decision of the Man- 
               <br />
               itoba courts has been reversed; but it still 
               <br />
               has to run the gauntlet of the Privy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Coun-</span> 
               <br />
               cil, and we know how frequently Supreme 
               <br />
               Court decisions are overthrown by the Privy 
               <br />
               Council. Still this question is not settled, 
               <br />
               it is still open for decision. and the member 
               <br />

               endorsation and support to this Bill in face 
               <br />
               of the pledges he made to his electors on 
               <br />
               this question.
