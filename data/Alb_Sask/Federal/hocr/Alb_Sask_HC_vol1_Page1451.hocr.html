               tention particularly to this fact, because in 
               <br />
               my opinion it is one of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1211:</span> most important 
               <br />
               features connected with this Bill. When 
               <br />
               the American government found out that 
               <br />
               we undertook to draw water from this river 
               <br />
               they said it should not be done. They 
               <br />
               sent delegates down here to the Dominion 
               <br />
               government to protest against our doing 
               <br />
               anything of the kind and said that they 
               <br />
               owned these waters themselves inasmuch 
               <br />
               as the source of this river was in the United 
               <br />
               States. If we had the provinces owning 
               <br />
               the so—called arid lands, and they under- 
               <br />
               took to draw water from these rivers about 
               <br />
               which there is dispute, we would not' be 
               <br />
               able to handle the difﬁculty in the same 
               <br />
               manner as we would if it was owned by 
               <br />
               the Dominion of Canada alone. How does 
               <br />
               the matter stand ‘? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'hen</span> they found that 
               <br />
               we were going to take water from the Milk

               river they protested against it and said 
               <br />
               that they had a prior claim themselves, be- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cause</span> they had undertaken to draw water 
               <br />
               from the sources of these rivers. Then 
               <br />
               they proposed another scheme, that they 
               <br />
               should dam the water of St. Mary lake and 
               <br />
               Milk lake and then by increasing the water 
               <br />
               hold it there, draw it through the Milk river 
               <br />
               through our territory and get a large quan- 
               <br />
               tity of water to supply the valleys of the 
               <br />
               Milk river in Montana with water. When 
               <br />
               they tried to arrange that matter with our 
               <br />
               ofﬁcers the scheme fell through. Then the 
               <br />
               secretary of the interior of the United 
               <br />
               States took the matter up along with the 
               <br />
               present president of the United States, and 
               <br />
               intimated that he would pursue a more 
               <br />
               vigorous policy, and that they would 
               <br />
               guard their own interests. The result is 
               <br />
               that $1,000,000 was set apart by the United 
               <br />
               States government in order that they might 
               <br />
               dam the waters of these two lakes in the 
               <br />
               United States. and then if no arrangements 
               <br />
               could be made with the Canadian govern— 
               <br />
               ment whereby they could take the water 
               <br />
               through the Milk river and into the United 
               <br />
               States in Montana, they would take the 
               <br />
               water and divert it from our rivers entirely, 
               <br />
               bringing it into one of their own streams, the 
               <br />
               Cut Bank creek, and then into another the 
               <br />
               Maria river, and then dig a canal and take lt

               all anxious—I am, and I believe every one is 
               <br />
               —that we should live on friendly terms 
               <br />
               with the United States, but you know, and 
               <br />
               the House knows, that the United States 
               <br />
               has not always treated us in the most 
               <br />
               friendly manner possible. You must bear 
               <br />
               in mind that they purchased the Alaskan 
               <br />
               territory, not because they wanted that ter- 
               <br />
               ritory, not because they had any necessity 
               <br />
               for it themselves, but because they wanted 
               <br />
               to deprive us of as large a portion of the 
               <br />
               seashore on the Paciﬁc as they possibly 
               <br />
               could and prevent us having any harbours 
               <br />
               on that coast if they could avoid it. We 
               <br />
               have not treated the United States in that 
               <br />
               manner I can assure you. When they had 
               <br />
               their civil war we sent at least 30,000 
               <br />

               said: No, we will not allow you to take

               armed troops through our canals. The con- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               to treat us in the same manner in this case 
               <br />
               as they have done on previous occasions. I 
               <br />
               think it is time to look about and to see if

               it is not advisable that the Dominion gov-

               <br />
               if difﬁculties of this kind arise as they are 
               <br />
               almost certain to, we would be in a posi-
