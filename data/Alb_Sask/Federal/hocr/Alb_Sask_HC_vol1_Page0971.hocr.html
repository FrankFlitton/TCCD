               day, it is confirming a law which the people 
               <br />
               _ of those Territories have themselves passed. 
               <br />
               If they are satisﬁed, and they evidently are, 
               <br />
               why should the people in other portions of 
               <br />
               the Dominion complain ? Then, Sir, in 1875 
               <br />
               the Territorial government was created. On 
               <br />
               that occasion, the deﬁnite proposition was 
               <br />
               laid down by the parliament of Canada that 
               <br />
               denominational schools should exist in that 
               <br />
               country. It is not necessary for me to re- 
               <br />
               peat the statements from the Hon. George 
               <br />
               Brown and Mr. Mackenzie and Mr. Blake 
               <br />
               and Sir John Macdonald with regard to that 
               <br />
               matter. Suﬂice to say that one and all of 
               <br />
               them declared that when that legislation ot‘ 
               <br />
               1875 was passed granting denominational 
               <br />
               schools to the Northwest Territories, that 
               <br />

               <br />
               inconsistent on this question, that formerly 
               <br />
               we stood for provincial rights and inscribed

               <br />
               Well, Mr. Speaker, I venture to deny that 
               <br />
               assertion. I say that the Liberal party <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to:</span> 
               <br />
               day is acting consistenly with its past his-. 
               <br />
               tory, and that it is the Conservative party 
               <br />
               which is a sinner in this respect. It was 
               <br />
               the Conservative party who established 
               <br />
               separate schools in this country assisted by 
               <br />
               the people in the province of Quebec. That 
               <br />
               party is now going back on its record. 
               <br />
               What was formerly the position of the 
               <br />
               Liberal party in regard to this matter ? We 
               <br />
               know that the Hon. Geo. Brown, in the old 
               <br />
               legislative assembly of Canada, opposed the 
               <br />
               system of separate schools with all his 
               <br />
               force. That principle, however, was adopted 
               <br />
               by the Canadian legislature and became 
               <br />
               law. When confederation was brought 
               <br />
               about, Mr. Brown joined the coalition gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, which adopted the principle of 
               <br />
               separate schools as a part and parcel of the 
               <br />
               Confederation Act. To that principle Mr. 
               <br />
               Brown gave his adhesion because it had 
               <br />
               been adopted in Canada and he felt it would 
               <br />
               be a wrench to do away with it. The 
               <br />
               Liberal party have lived up to that doctrine 
               <br />
               ever since. In 1896 when the Conservative 
               <br />
               party endeavoured to force separate schools 
               <br />
               on the unwilling province of Manitoba, the 
               <br />
               Liberal party objected. Why did they 
               <br />
               object? Because they stood for provincial 
               <br />
               rights. The Judicial Committee of the Privy 
               <br />
               Council had decided that the Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lic minority in Manitoba did not have the 
               <br />
               right to separate schools, but the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive party endeavoured to force these 
               <br />
               schools upon that province. The Liberal 
               <br />
               party, standing by its record, declared 
               <br />
               against that invasion of provincial rights 
               <br />
               and it went to the country and was success- 
               <br />
               ful.

               Mr. GERMAN. The people in Edmonton 
               <br />
               think so. They say that we are standing 
               <br />
               by the principle of provincial rights. The 
               <br />
               Conservative government endeavoured to 
               <br />
               force separate schools on the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba and we opposed it, because we 
               <br />
               were opposed to having a system forced 
               <br />
               on a province which the people there were 
               <br />
               not bound to accept. A true regard for 
               <br />
               provincial rights consists in safeguarding 
               <br />
               the rights, not only of the majority, 
               <br />
               but likewise of the minority. One indivx- 
               <br />
               dual is equally entitled to have his legal
