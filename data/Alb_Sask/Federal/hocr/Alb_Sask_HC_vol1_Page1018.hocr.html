               strong as to send a representative to the

               <br />
               them, and excluded him from that body. 
               <br />
               But, it behooves us to be careful in Canada 
               <br />
               because already we ﬁnd that one of these 
               <br />
               newspapers has said that the Mormons are 
               <br />
               likely to control two seats in the legisla- 
               <br />
               tive assembly of ‘Alberta, and it may not 
               <br />
               be many years before they might send a 
               <br />
               representative to the Canadian House of 
               <br />
               Commons. I feel that there should be no 
               <br />
               privilege given to the Mormons under the 
               <br />
               school laws which would tend to strengthen 
               <br />
               them in these practises which are so re- 
               <br />
               pulsive to the vast majority of the people 
               <br />
               of this country. I feel that any Canadian 
               <br />
               government, whether Conservative or Re- 
               <br />
               form, would blush to think that they 
               <br />
               would even turn the key that would open 
               <br />
               the door that would permit the Mormons 
               <br />
               to teach their doctrine in separate schools. 
               <br />
               I believe that every hon. gentleman on the 
               <br />
               government side of the House and on the 
               <br />
               opposition side of the House too ; I believe 
               <br />
               that the First Minister and the hon. gen-

               tlemen who sit with him on the treasury 
               <br />
               benches will agree with me when I say: 
               <br />
               It is a glorious thing for any man to have 
               <br />
               one good helpmate through life, and that 
               <br />
               one good helpmate is quite sufﬁcient to take

               <br />

               just what powers we have in granting this 
               <br />
               Autonomy, and I believe myself that would

               I think it was the hon. Postmaster Gene-

               Now, Mr. Speaker, so far as I am con-

               cerned, I stand as ﬁrm as a rock against 
               <br />
               separate schools. I hold that the public 
               <br />
               school, the national school, is the right 
               <br />
               school for this country. Of course, as the 
               <br />
               separate school is established in the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces of Ontario and Quebec, we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must.</span> be 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with it; I am not complaining of 
               <br />
               that. But I feel that it is the duty of both 
               <br />
               )Protestants and Roman Catholics to be 
               <br />
               united as much as possible in friendly inter- 
               <br />
               course, each enjoying his own religious be- 
               <br />
               liefs, and moving on together with the one 
               <br />
               great object of building up a great nation

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In conclusion, I am in favour of giving the 
               <br />
               Northwest autonomy. If the right hon. the 
               <br />
               First Minister will not delay this measure 
               <br />
               until we can obtain the information, which 
               <br />
               I am sure many members on the govern- 
               <br />
               ment side of the House, as well as” many on 
               <br />
               the opposition side, would like to have from 
               <br />
               the highest authority, then we shall have to 
               <br />
               vote on the Bill when the proper time comes. 
               <br />
               In giving autonomy to the people of the 
               <br />
               Territories, I believe in giving them full 
               <br />
               autonomy. Let them have self-government, 
               <br />
               not only in the matter of their municipal 
               <br />
               affairs, but in the management of their pub-
