               ings in connection with that legislation; 
               <br />
               the lines of it were broad enough to suit

               <br />

               We are laying the foundations of a great state,

               perhaps one which at a future day may even 
               <br />
               overshadow this country. But, come what may, 
               <br />
               we shall rejoice that we have shown neither

               But there was a little temerity shown in 
               <br />
               the introduction of this Bill in the House 
               <br />
               of Lords in England. It was looked upon 
               <br />
               rather as an experiment. This experi- 
               <br />
               ment of confederation had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been‘tried</span> only 
               <br />
               four times, and in two of these four cases 
               <br />
               the confederation had subsequently dis- 
               <br />
               solved or those who had been parties to it 
               <br />
               had retired from the agreement which led 
               <br />
               to it. This speech of Lord Carnarvon was 
               <br />
               quoted to considerable extent by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). In it 
               <br />
               some references were made to the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of education, .which is now before the 
               <br />
               House. One of the cardinal principles which 
               <br />
               the noble earl laid down was that the fed- 
               <br />
               eral parliament of the Dominion should be 
               <br />
               strong enough to maintain its own opinions 
               <br />
               and _to resist the sudden gusts of popular 
               <br />
               op1n10n, and secondly, that it should not be 
               <br />
               so strong but that it should be amenable 
               <br />
               to public sentiment. and therefore out of 
               <br />
               harmony with the other branch of the legis- 
               <br />
               lature. There was doubt in the mind of 
               <br />
               the noble Earl, when he introduced this 
               <br />
               Bill, as to the use which might be made 
               <br />

               exercised its powers under this Act, and 
               <br />
               when the time came, as it was hoped it 
               <br />
               would come, when provinces should have 
               <br />
               to be created, that there would be an over-

               crowding of power, an inﬂiction upon the

               <br />

               <br />
               (Mr. Bourassa), in the course of his remarks 
               <br />

               Sir, a clearer deﬁnition was given in the

               British parliament when the Bill was intro- 
               <br />

               must go to the real thought of the enacting

               legislature in order to properly understand it. 
               <br />
               Lord Carnarvon said in the House of Lords on 
               <br />
               the 19th of February, 1867, when moving the

               In this Bill the division of powers has been 
               <br />
               mainly effected by a distinct classiﬁcation.

               That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Classiﬁcation</span> is fourfold: First, those

               <br />

               He enumerates all the powers that belong

               <br />
               the federal parliament, none of which includes

               exceptional provisions to which I refer, your

               lordships will observe some rather complicated 
               <br />
               arrangement in reference to education. I need

               hardly say that that great question gives rise 
               <br />
               to nearly as much earnestness and division of 
               <br />
               opinion on that as on this side of the Atlantic. 
               <br />
               This clause has been framed after long and 
               <br />
               anxious controversy in which all parties have 
               <br />
               been represented and on conditions to which all 
               <br />
               have given their consent.

               Mr. hon. friend from Labelle, who, I re- 
               <br />
               gret to say, is not now in his seat, stopped 
               <br />
               at that point, although he stated that the 
               <br />
               noble earl continued and gave the rest of 
               <br />
