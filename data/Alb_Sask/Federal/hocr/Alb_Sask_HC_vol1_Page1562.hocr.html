               the river is mentioned. If there are islands

               in between there is going to be confusion

               niences that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Will</span> result on account of it.

               The right hon. leader of the government 
               <br />
               has seen ﬁt to doubt the ﬁgures that I have

               given in regard to where the population is 
               <br />
               in that country. No explanation has been 
               <br />
               given why the plan adopted by the legis— 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               practically turned upside down. Any per- 
               <br />
               son can observe that by simply looking at 
               <br />
               the map. That is beyond contradiction. The 
               <br />
               same equally applies to the representation 
               <br />
               which was given in this House three years 
               <br />
               ago when four constituencies were created 
               <br />
               out of the old district of Alberta. No criti- 
               <br />
               cism can be made of the argument. that, 
               <br />
               having regard to the contention which was 
               <br />
               made then, this proposed schedule discrim—

               the business and population are, is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern-</span>

               <br />
               The same applies to the return as to the

               inland revenue receipts which was brought 
               <br />
               down. Does the right hon. leader of the

               government desire to contradict the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               as to railway construction when I say that 
               <br />
               only 150 miles have been built north of 38 
               <br />
               and that 999 miles have been built south of 
               <br />
               38, which is some indication as to where the

               Figures have been handed to me showing 
               <br />
               that the population, less Indians, might be 
               <br />
               assumed to be 165,000. -I do not pretend 
               <br />
               that the following ﬁgures are direct evidence 
               <br />
               of the location of settlement, but I do say 
               <br />
               that they corroborate the ﬁgures that I gave 
               <br />
               to the First Minister showing where the ur-

               ban and rural population of that country 
               <br />
               was. If we assume that the population is 
               <br />
               165,000, and wonk it out on the homestead 
               <br />
               entries for the last three years it would 
               <br />
               give a population of 75,500 north, and 89,000 
               <br />
               south. Based on the customs ~eceipts 
               <br />
               from 1894 to 1904, the population would be 
               <br />
               52,000 north and 113,000 south. Based on 
               <br />

               <br />
               south. Based on the Inland Revenue re- 
               <br />
               ceipts from 1903 to 1904 the population 
               <br />
               would be 40,000 north and 125,000 south. 
               <br />
               Based on the land, timber, and registration 
               <br />
               fees the population would be 53,000 north 
               <br />
               and 112,000 south. It you take the aver-

               age on all these calculations the population 
               <br />
               would be 52,000 north and 113,000 south.

               <br />

               ﬁnd I think that I have been liberal in my

               estimation of the population in the north.

               The object of parliamentary representation 
               <br />
               as I take it is to give each class or interest in

               <br />

               <br />
               this and other countries, I ﬁnd that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> 
               <br />
               aims of representation for electoral divis— 
               <br />
               ions are summarized in the instructions 
               <br />
               given to the commissioners in New South 
               <br />
               Wales a couple of years ago. These com- 
               <br />
               missioners were instructed to divide up 
               <br />
               that country into local constituencies hav-

               <br />
               the community or diversity of interest; 
               <br />
               (3) the lines of communication ; (4) the phy-

               sical features ; (5) the quota to be ascertain—

               ed by dividing the number of seats into the

               number of names upon the list. In the

               Transvaal which is being divided now by
