               in stating, as brieﬂy as possible my viewson 
               <br />
               the phase of the provincial autonomy ques~ 
               <br />
               tiou that is now before us. I was much 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">surprised</span> to hear the Prime Minister (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) state this afternoon that 
               <br />
               he believed that the clauses of his Bill af- 
               <br />
               fecting education were the only clauses not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfactory</span> to the people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. If the Prime Minister believes 
               <br />
               that he expresses the opinions of the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest when he says that, except 
               <br />
               for the educational clauses, they are entirely 
               <br />
               in accord with the Bill, I can only tell him 
               <br />
               that I believe that he is mistaken. What his 
               <br />
               sources of information may be, I do not 
               <br />
               know. But this is one of the reasons, I 
               <br />
               think, why we should have a Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior to represent that country and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">express</span> at the council board the wishes 
               <br />
               of its people. Dealing with the question 
               <br />
               which involves such important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> 
               <br />
               such grave ﬁnancial responsibilities and con- 
               <br />
               trols such vast areas of land, and dealing 
               <br />
               also with the right of half a million people, 
               <br />
               it seems perfectly plain that those peeple 
               <br />
               should be represented in the government. 
               <br />
               I do not consider that we are represented 
               <br />
               at this time. And that is one of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ob«</span> 
               <br />
               jections the people have to the present 
               <br />
               situation. We in the Northwest will not 
               <br />
               be satisﬁed unless we get the handling of 
               <br />
               our own lands and our own minerals. I for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one</span> believe that no compensation could be 
               <br />
               given by this government that would re- 
               <br />
               concile the people of that country to being 
               <br />
               deprived of this control, for this involves 
               <br />
               far more than dollars and cents to the peo- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ple.</span> I wish to put myself on record as say- 
               <br />
               ing that there are several clauses in the Bill 
               <br />
               as objectionable to our people as the clauses 
               <br />
               dealing with education.

               afternoon, I believe, has not been without 
               <br />
               its lessons for this House and the country. 
               <br />
               Any one of an observant turn of mind sit- 
               <br />

               <br />
               this House, would have thought over a great 
               <br />
               many things, while many deductions from 
               <br />
               the circumstances would have forced them- 
               <br />
               selves upon his mind. Why is it, for in- 
               <br />
               stance, that when an important question of 
               <br />
               this kind is being discussed we are not

               afforded even the courtesy of having res-

               ponsible ministers—still ministers, however 
               <br />
               long they may continue in their positions—

               suppose, a responsible part is being reviewed 
               <br />
               by His Majesty’s loyal opposition. I do not 
               <br />

               question. I think these ministers ought t° 
               <br />
               be here. I think they owe it to themselves, 
               <br />
               to those they represent and to the country 
               <br />
               at large to be present in their seats. And 
               <br />
               yet, as this discussion has gone on the ob— 
               <br />
               servant person would have noticed that 
               <br />
               at one time there would be but one minister 
               <br />
               in his seat, at another time two, sometimes 
               <br />
               even three, but the number always very 
               <br />
               small. Now, it may be good policy for hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite to affect a show of 
               <br />
               indifference, and, perhaps, at the same 
               <br />
               time to conceal their true feeling, which is 
               <br />
               not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indifference,</span> but a very genuine discom- 
               <br />
               ﬁture at the mistakes they have made and 
               <br />
               the position in which they ﬁnd themselves. 
               <br />
               Why is it also that when a subject involving 
               <br />
               so greatly, the interests of the Northwest 
               <br />
               is under review, we ﬁnd almost all the 
               <br />
               members on the other side representing con- 
               <br />
               stituencies in the Northwest Territories ab- 
               <br />
               senting themselves from their places ? 
               <br />
               Was it because they have such superior 
               <br />
               knowledge and such superior parts that they 
               <br />
               did not think it consistent with their high 
               <br />
               qualities to listen to animadversions and 
               <br />
               to statements reﬂecting on a policy Of the 
               <br />
               government or a Bill which vitally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁects</span> 
               <br />
               themselves ? I do not think it was. I think 
               <br />
               that their modesty would not allow them 
               <br />
               to come to any such conclusion. Then 
               <br />
               was it because they were supremely care- 
               <br />
               less and did not care a ﬁg how things 
               <br />
               went? I hardly think it was that either. 
               <br />
               01‘ was it because they were schooled to 
               <br />
               silence and told to say nothing and get 
               <br />
               out of the House? Perhaps that would 
               <br />
               come nearer the right answer than either 
               <br />
               of the other suppositions I have made. 
               <br />
               These hon. gentlemen opposite were wont 
               <br />
               to be voluble enough. ln 1896, their ton- 
               <br />
               gues were not tied. When they were on 
               <br />
               this side of the House they had a volume 
               <br />
               of speech and sound which was admirable, 
               <br />
               long continued and vehement it seemed 
               <br />
               to come from inexhaustible sources. Why 
               <br />
               are those gentlemen so silent now ? Why 
               <br />
               is it they have not a single word to say in 
               <br />
               their own defence? Why is it that res- 
               <br />
               ponsible ministers who, I suppose, count 
               <br />
               for something in the cabinet—some min- 
               <br />
               isters do count for something—why is it 
               <br />
               that two of them at any rate who counted 
               <br />
               for something were forestalled deliberately 
               <br />
               before the Bill was brought down. The 
               <br />
               others who remained, and who presum- 
               <br />
               ably did not count for much, were simply 
               <br />
               taken in hand by that autocrat, the First 
               <br />
               Minister. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">His.</span> Bill was rushed in and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he'</span> 
               <br />
               practically said to these gentlemen: there 
               <br />
               it is before you and the country; you can 
               <br />
               support it or not as you please. I make 
               <br />
               bold to say,‘ Mr. Speaker, that never before 
               <br />
