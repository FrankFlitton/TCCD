               <br />
               So we are now creating practically a new 
               <br />
               group of senators applicable to the western 
               <br />
               country. British Columbia has three sena- 
               <br />
               tors and Manitoba four. Now it would be 
               <br />
               quite proper that we should give to that 
               <br />
               western group probably twenty-four sena— 
               <br />
               tors, but it does not seem to me it would 
               <br />
               be proper at the present time to give to 
               <br />
               these new provinces out of the twenty-four 
               <br />
               more than one—half. We are giving them 
               <br />
               at present one-half, at all events. It may 
               <br />
               be that when the group numbers twenty- 
               <br />
               four there will need to be a redistribution, 
               <br />
               and that we shall have to give some further 
               <br />
               representation in the Senate to British 
               <br />
               Columbia and Manitoba. For the present 
               <br />
               I think we are dealing generously with the 
               <br />
               new provinces when we assign to them one-

               3 Quebec group, an Ontario group and a 
               <br />
               western group. Why not go further and

               say that as there are three groups in the 
               <br />
               east there should be three groups in the 
               <br />

               <br />

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Let us not

               <br />
               thing to do at present. The question is, 
               <br />
               how many senators shall we take for these 
               <br />
               two new provinces? We provide for giving 
               <br />
               them each six <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asthe</span> maximum. Manitoba 
               <br />
               has four senators, British Columbia has 
               <br />
               three; we cannot increase the number for 
               <br />
               Manitoba nor can we increase the number 
               <br />
               for British Columbia. Under such cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances when, on the one side of the 
               <br />
               new provinces there are three senators and 
               <br />
               on the other side four. it seems to me that 
               <br />
               in giving to each of the new provinces six 
               <br />
               as a maximum, we go as far as we ought 
               <br />
               to go at present. But this is only a tem- 
               <br />
               porary arrangement. In my estimation we 
               <br />
               will have to have a new group of senators, 
               <br />
               not now, but in the future; and when we 
               <br />
               form this new group we must remember 
               <br />
               that in order to keep within the spirit of 
               <br />
               the constitution we cannot base that group 
               <br />
               upon representation by population, the idea 
               <br />
               of population must be eliminated. The 
               <br />
               Senate, as it exists, is not based upon popu- 
               <br />
               lation but upon purely arbitrary consider- 
               <br />
               ations having in view minorities; and that 
               <br />
               the great provinces should not override the 
               <br />
               smaller ones. That was the idea of con— 
               <br />
               federation and we must adhere to it. If 
               <br />
               we keep to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spirit‘of</span> the constitution, as 
               <br />
               we ought to do, and if we form another 
               <br />
               group, it will be a fair question whether 
               <br />
               there should be twenty-four senators in it 
               <br />
               or not. In my estimation it ought to be 
               <br />
               twenty—four. But the west may become 
               <br />
               so large that tweny-four senators will not 
               <br />
               be sufﬁcient. Still we must adhere to the 
               <br />
               spirit of confederation that the big pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are not to override the smaller ones. 
               <br />
               But for the present I think everybody ad- 
               <br />
               mits that we are doing for these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces as much as we are called upon to 
               <br />
               do, in view of the fact that we cannot in- 
               <br />
               crease the number of senators for Mani- 
               <br />
