               IMr. TAYLOR. Being a layman, I do not 
               <br />
               purpose dealing with the legal aspect of the 
               <br />
               question. Our leader (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
               <br />
               has given an opinion which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> not been 
               <br />
               controverted, and in my opinion the hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition stands head and 
               <br />
               shoulders above any hon. gentleman on this 
               <br />
               or the other side of the House in so far as 
               <br />
               legal attainments are concerned. I think 
               <br />
               it is an opinion which commends itself, not 
               <br />
               only to the House, but to the country gener— 
               <br />
               ally. On constitutional law, I do not think 
               <br />
               he has an equal in this country, and he has 
               <br />
               given an opinion which has met with the 
               <br />
               approval, not only of those Who sit on this 
               <br />
               side of the House, but even of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vex-ministers</span> 
               <br />
               of the government, because, when the hon. 
               <br />
               ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               made his speech in the House, he said that 
               <br />
               he had read the speech made by his leader 
               <br />
               on the constitutional aspect of the case and 
               <br />
               also by the leader of the opposition, and he 
               <br />
               rather agreed with the opinion given by the 
               <br />
               hon. leader of the opposition. The hon. ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior is an able lawyer, 
               <br />
               and he approved of the opinion given by the 
               <br />
               hon. leader of the opposition as to the con- 
               <br />
               stitutional aspect of the question now before 
               <br />
               the House. But I intend to deal with it 
               <br />
               from the layman’s point of view, and per— 
               <br />
               haps will, before I get through, refer to the 
               <br />
               opinion of the man on the street as the hon. 
               <br />
               ex-Minister of the Interior did. I intend to 
               <br />
               stand by what, I think, is the proper consti- 
               <br />
