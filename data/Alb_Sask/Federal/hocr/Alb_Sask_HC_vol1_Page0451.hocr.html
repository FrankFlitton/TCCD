               had tried the institutions for the Northwest

               Territories which he now asked the House

               to frame and for the same reason as he had 
               <br />
               given to-day—that it would be better for the 
               <br />
               Dominion government to keep matters in their 
               <br />
               own hands and decide what was best for the 
               <br />
               future. He (Mr. Blake) believed that it was

               essential to our obtaining a. large immigration 
               <br />

               <br />

               It was interesting to the people to know that 
               <br />
               at the very earliest moment there was a 
               <br />
               suﬂicient aggregate of population within a 
               <br />
               reasonable distance. that aggregation would 
               <br />
               have a voice in the self-government of _the 
               <br />
               Territories, and he believed the Dominion 
               <br />
               government was wise (although the measure 
               <br />
               might be brought down very late this session 
               <br />
               and it might be found impossible to give it 
               <br />
               due consideration) in determining in advance 
               <br />
               of settlement what the character of the in-

               stitutions of the country should be in which we 
               <br />
               invite people. He did not agree with the 
               <br />
               policy of asking people to settle in that western 
               <br />
               country, and tell them that a paternal govern- 
               <br />
               ment would look after them, and would give 
               <br />
               them such institutions as the government 
               <br />
               thought suitable. We had better let the people

               know their fate politically and otherwise be—

               ruler, even though he allowed his subjects no

               degree of political liberty. Mr. Justice Storey 
               <br />
               has well shown that constitutional freedom 
               <br />
               means something more than liberty permitted ;

               Now the great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ‘lculty</span> seems to be why 
               <br />
               we must have separate schools. There are 
               <br />
               some people among us, and their ideas are 
               <br />
               deserving of every respect, who think that 
               <br />
               separate Schools are not necessary and 
               <br />
               that we should not make provision for them.

               case, we have to deal with circumstances
