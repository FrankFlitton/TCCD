               the question now before the committee. 
               <br />
               Why should there be a different tenure. 
               <br />
               why should the Hudson Bay Company be 
               <br />
               in a different position in that province from 
               <br />
               any other man w-ho has a title from the 
               <br />
               Crown, whether from the imperial author- 
               <br />
               ities or the Dominion government? You 
               <br />
               do not know the extent of that tenure. 
               <br />
               Will that pass over to the province 
               <br />
               in the same position as the right of 
               <br />
               every other man to land in that province ‘? 
               <br />
               I do not expect the province will interfere 
               <br />
               or do anything that is wrong, or will make 
               <br />
               a breach of the contract. But why limit 
               <br />
               the power? As I said before, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:every</span> other 
               <br />
               province has exclusive jurisdiction over

               property and civil rights, and why make 
               <br />
               any limitation here? They have a right to 
               <br />
               do wrong if they like, they have a right

               <br />
               if not the right; and if they have the

               was illegal, not because Manitoba had not 
               <br />
               jurisdiction over the matter, but because 
               <br />
               there was a contract entered into between 
               <br />
               the Dominion government and the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Manitoba, when that portion of the 
               <br />
               territory was added to Manitoba. that the 
               <br />
               bargain made between <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment and the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               should have effect in the added territory. 
               <br />
               What the court held was that a contract 
               <br />
               was .made with the Dominion government, 
               <br />
               that Manitoba had accepted it, that Mani- 
               <br />
               toba had not repudiated the contract at all, 
               <br />
               and that until Manitoba repudiated the con- 
               <br />
               tract, the power of taxation did not arise at 
               <br />
               all. That is all that was decided in the 
               <br />
               matter.
