               My reason for objecting to separate schools 
               <br />
               lies in the fact that the differences do not 
               <br />
               stop at separate schools, but that the lines 
               <br />
               drawn by these divisions extend to all walks 
               <br />
               of business and social liufe and strike at the 
               <br />
               root of that great national spirit which it 
               <br />
               should be the true aim of every loyal Cana- 
               <br />
               dian to foster and maintain. It means the 
               <br />
               perpetuation of national societies and bene- 
               <br />
               volent organizations on religious lines; it 
               <br />
               means fete days, street parades of one sect- 
               <br />

               cribed how when in the mother land, some 
               <br />
               years ago he was presented one bright morn- 
               <br />

               <br />
               proved to be young Canada destined to 
               <br />
               be known henceforth among the peoples 
               <br />
               of the world as a nation, whereas the happy 
               <br />
               parent, on the evening preceding this mom-

               entous event, in utter ignorance of his 
               <br />
               condition, (immaculate, I trust) had ‘drawn 
               <br />
               the drapery of his couch about him 
               <br />
               and lain down to pleasant dreams.’ There-

               fore, I say, in working out the destiny of 
               <br />
               this young nation we should endeavour to 
               <br />
               forget our different origins. I know it is 
               <br />
               hard to forget one’s origin, but I believe 
               <br />
               that in so far as it is possible these ties and 
               <br />
               traditions should be «forgotten and relegated 
               <br />
               to oblivion. We should endeavour to forget 
               <br />
               the distinctions which have divided us in 
               <br />
               the past, and should strive to be known only 
               <br />
               as Canadians. For my part I would be 
               <br />
               sorry to see the 17th of March go by With-
