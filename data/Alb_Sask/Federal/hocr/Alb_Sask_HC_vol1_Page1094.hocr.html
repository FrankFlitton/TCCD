               tention that has been aroused in the present

               instance. This is due primarily to the fact 
               <br />
               that the people of the Dominion regarded 
               <br />
               the boundaries of the province of Manitoba 
               <br />

               <br />
               populated, so that, even if there were a

               a comparatively small number of people 
               <br />
               would be affected. But the development of

               <br />
               more rapidly, means that there will be there 
               <br />
               no limited population. but a population of 
               <br />
               millions upon millions. In View of the

               number of people to be affected, the whole
