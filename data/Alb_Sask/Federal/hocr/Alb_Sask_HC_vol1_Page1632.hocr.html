               in future some measures may be taken to

               men to purchase bait supplies on the Mag- 
               <br />
               dalen Islands. I know that under the treaty 
               <br />
               of 1818 the Americans were permitted to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take</span> ﬁsh, but whether that gave them the 
               <br />
               liberty Of going ashore and purchasing bait _ 
               <br />
               supplies from the residents of the islands 
               <br />
               is, I think, an open question. However, I 
               <br />
               am not prepared to express an opinion upon 
               <br />
               it one way or the other; I would simply 
               <br />
               ask the Minister of Marine and Fisheries to 
               <br />
               be good enough to look into this matter and 
               <br />
               ascertain whether the treaty of 1818 does 
               <br />
               give the American ﬁshermen a right to land 
               <br />
               upon the shores of the Magdalen Islands 
               <br />
               and purchase supplies. It is a matter of 
               <br />
               great importance to my own constituency at 
               <br />
               least, and I think to Nova Scotia generally. 
               <br />
               The protection of bait supplies is as import- 
               <br />
               ant as the protection of the ﬁsheries. I de- 
               <br />
               sire that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American</span> ﬁshermen should 
               <br />
               have no further privileges allowed them to 
               <br />
               purchase Ibait supplies than the treaty abso- 
               <br />
               lutely gives them. I move the adjournment

               Up to the 1st of June I think that over 600 
               <br />
               nets have been conﬁscated from Americans 
               <br />
               ﬁshing and poaching in Canadian waters. 
               <br />
               The work is done as effectively as it can 
               <br />
               be done under the circumstances, but if 
               <br />
               there is some neglect I will certainly look 
               <br />
               into it and see that a remedy is provided. 
               <br />
               As regards the Americans getting their sup- 
               <br />
               plies from the Magdalen Islands, this is a 
               <br />
               new question that I am not ready to answer 
               <br />
               at the present moment, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘but</span> I will look into 
               <br />
               it and try to satisfy the hon. gentleman on 
               <br />
               that point.
