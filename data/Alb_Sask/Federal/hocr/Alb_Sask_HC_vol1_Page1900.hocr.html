               I will answer you by-and-by. The Solicitor 
               <br />
               General says that I denounced the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister because he stated that he was 
               <br />
               British to the core. The-Solicitor General 
               <br />
               never heard me make such an accusation in 
               <br />
               my life. When I go on the public platform 
               <br />
               I do not indulge in any such smallness'as 
               <br />
               that. I have heard it said, and it has been 
               <br />
               published in the newspapers, but I have 
               <br />
               not said it. What do I care whether he is 
               <br />
               British to the core or not ? My statement 
               <br />
               here is that I am a British subject and I 
               <br />
               do not want to be classiﬁed as if I were 
               <br />
               a Frenchman from old France. It is not 
               <br />
               that I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respect</span> the French, I am 
               <br />
               proud of my French origin, lbut I do say 
               <br />
               that if you describe the French Canadians 
               <br />
               as French in a census report, then you are 
               <br />
               not giving a correct description of men 
               <br />
               whose ancestors have been living in this 
               <br />
               country for 250 years. I am a British sub- 
               <br />
               ject and a Canadian and should be classed 
               <br />
               as such. I am proud to be a descendant 
               <br />
               of the French race 'but I am Canadian ﬁrst.

               after the legislature ot' the Northwest Ter-

               <br />
               Canada, by adopting the amendment of Sir 
               <br />
               John Thompson, had pledged itself to confer
