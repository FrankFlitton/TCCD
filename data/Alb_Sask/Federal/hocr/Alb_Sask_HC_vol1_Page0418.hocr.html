               Mr. FOSTER. There is the difﬁculty.

               Without justifying the investments allowed 
               <br />
               to an insurance company, you use the law 
               <br />
               on that subject to justify the application of 
               <br />
               the same to the trust companies. But 
               <br />
               nothing should be more carefully guarded 
               <br />
               than trust companies investments. These 
               <br />
               concerns have the estates of widows and 
               <br />
               orphans, and they carry trusts for minors, 
               <br />
               and are always considered concerns whose 
               <br />
               securities should be very strictly guarded. 
               <br />
               The capital of the trust company is what 
               <br />
               it- offers prospective patrons as a guarantee 
               <br />
               that the business conﬁded to it will be pro- 
               <br />
               perly secured. But if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> capital may 
               <br />
               be invested in loan and building societies‘ 
               <br />
               stock, with all the ups and downs to which 
               <br />
               the securities of some of these concerns are 
               <br />
               liable, it seems to _me you take away the 
               <br />
               security which that capital stock would 
               <br />
               otherwise give. You may say: Let the 
               <br />
               widow and the orphan examine the affairs 
               <br />
