               I represent a constituency which in some 
               <br />
               respects is, I think, typical of the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada as a whole. I represent a con— 
               <br />
               stituency in which all races, creeds- and 
               <br />
               nationalities dwell together in perfect har—

               mony. It was intimated by the Minister of 
               <br />
               Agriculture, I think, this afternoon that 
               <br />
               some of the members on this side were about 
               <br />
               to vote for the Bill through a feeling of 
               <br />
               fear, that they were likely to be compelled 
               <br />
               to support it through dread of a certain por- 
               <br />
               tion of their electors. For my part 1 wish 
               <br />
               to repudiate the assertion absolutely. I am 
               <br />
               not voting through fear. I am voting through ’ 
               <br />
               a sense of justice. I have not during this 
               <br />
               entire debate, although I have nearly 2,500 
               <br />
               French Canadian electors and probably 2,000 
               <br />

               my division, received a single letter, a single 
               <br />
               petition, or a single request to vote with 
               <br />
               the government in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respect</span> to this Bill. 
               <br />
               Therefore. I am not in any way voting un— 
               <br />
               der compulsion nor through fear of olïend- 
               <br />
               ing any portion of my electors. If I vote, 
               <br />
               as I will with the government on amended 
               <br />
               clause 16 of the Bill, I will do it because I 
               <br />
               conscientiously believe that they are right 
               <br />
               on that issue. I said a moment ago that I

               represent a mixed electorate, and Mr.

               consider this to be no‘ disadvantage but the 
               <br />
               very reverse. It has been my good fortune 
               <br />
               for many years to enjoy the conﬁdence of 
               <br />
               men of different races, nationalities and 
               <br />
               religions, and to learn that on nearly every 
               <br />
               great question there may be differing points 
               <br />
               of view and to learn also that it is quite pos- 
               <br />
               sible for good men to disagree on questions 
               <br />
               that seem vital to both. We have been
