               outspoken. He never tried to shelter him-

               self behind small texts of law. I well re- 
               <br />
               member a sentence he uttered once during 
               <br />
               the debate on the Manitoba school question. 
               <br />
               Being taunted one day with not being versed 
               <br />
               in the law and being told that he had better 
               <br />
               not mix himself up with those legal texts. 
               <br />
               the old gentleman said: If to be a lawyer 
               <br />
               means that one must conﬁne himself to texts 
               <br />
               of law and forget the difference between 
               <br />
               truth and untruth. I thank Heaven I am not

               <br />
               the leader of the opposition I was forcibly 
               <br />
               reminded of that declaration of his predeces- 
               <br />
               sor. It was when turning to the Orange 
               <br />
               section of his party—I would rather not refer 
               <br />
               to the fact but it was patent to everybody— 
               <br />
               he said : If the government will show me a 
               <br />
               written contract in the case of education 
               <br />

               that in his study of texts and legal quibbles. 
               <br />
               my hon. friend has forgotten one of the 
               <br />
               basic principles of law, and that is that the 
               <br />
               written document is not the contract. What 
               <br />
               is really the contract is the agreement en- 
               <br />
               tered into between the two parties. and the 
               <br />
               written document is only the evidence of 
               <br />
               that agreement. I will go further. Written 
               <br />
               contracts were invented by legislators when 
               <br />
               men became dishonest enough not to be 
               <br />
               true to their pledges and in order to guard 
               <br />
               against dishonesty. But if we are bound 
               <br />
               by our contract with the Canadian Paciﬁc

               <br />
               settled in these Territories. relying on the 
               <br />
               word of honour of the Canadian parliament ?

               a fact which should not be forgotten. With-

               out going again into a deep and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘ﬁne</span> study 
               <br />
               of the question whether those Territories 
               <br />
               became part of the union in 1870 or whether 
               <br />
               those new provinces are entering the union 
               <br />
               now. there is one thing we know, and that 
               <br />
               is that they were purchased and paid for by 
               <br />
               the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Canada as a whole. We know 
               <br />
               that every dollar which has been spent on 
               <br />
               the development of that country, we know 
               <br />
               that the millions of dollars which have been 
               <br />
               expended to bring foreign people into it, 
               <br />
               were contributed by Roman CatholiCS as 
               <br />
               well as Protestants. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,‘Mr.</span> Speaker, if 
               <br />
               there is one principle upon which I think we 
               <br />
               can safely appeal to the spirit of justice of 
               <br />
               any English speaking majority, it is that 
               <br />
               every man is equal before the collector of 
               <br />
               taxes. Therefore I say that when we are 
               <br />
               considering the rights and the law and the 
               <br />
               constitution. this very simple fact should 
               <br />
               not be forgotten. May I not gp a little 
               <br />
               further? May I not make a special appeal, 
               <br />
               not to my compatriots but to the English 
               <br />
               speaking majority of this parliament, to 
               <br />
               pause and consider a little what the French 
               <br />
               Canadians have done for the opening up and 
               <br />
               development of that country. 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               French Canadian traders and settlers had

               opened up that country. I shall go further. 
               <br />
               If there is one thing which ought to make 
               <br />
               a Canadian proud of his country, it is the 
               <br />
               contrast between the relations that have 
               <br />
               existed in Canada between the white and 
               <br />
               the red men and those relations which have 
               <br />
               existed between these two races in the

               neighbouring republic. Admitting "that some 
               <br />
               credit is due to the policy of the government. 
               <br />
               long before governments existed, long before 
               <br />
               any law was introduced into that country, 
               <br />
               Catholic priests had gone there ; and if those 
               <br />
               pioneers of Christian faith had not 200

               years ago gone into that country to preach 
               <br />
               the law of charity and Christian civilization, 
               <br />
               we would have had repeated in Canada the 
               <br />
               same sad lamentable story of wars between 
               <br />

               <br />

               The peace of this western country of ours 
               <br />
               has been due to the good seed of charity, 
               <br />
               civilization and enlightenment which was 
               <br />
               sown there years ago by the members 
               <br />
               of that hierarchy which is now trying to

               <br />
               further, and point out that in 1870 there was

               a rebellion in that country. and a rebellion 
               <br />

               <br />
               the testimony of many public men. On
