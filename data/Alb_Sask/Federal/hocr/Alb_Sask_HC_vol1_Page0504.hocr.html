               taken by myself and by my colleagues upon 
               <br />
               an application made some time ago by the

               government of the province of Manitoba,

               my duty, so far as the action of the govern-

               <br />
               be no misunderstanding, I think it is better

               On February 13, we received a formal invita-

               <br />

               <br />
               February 14 and arrived on the afternoon of 
               <br />
               the 16th, when we received a letter from Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid at the Russell House saying that he 
               <br />
               would be pleased to meet us at his oﬁlce at 
               <br />

               <br />
               as possible. In reply Sir Wilfrid said that if 
               <br />
               we would be good enough to remain 'in Ottawa 
               <br />

               In three days’ time,on February 20,a letter was

               received from Monseigneur Sbarretti, asking for 
               <br />
               a conference. This invitation was accepted and 
               <br />
               His Excellency then presented the following

               place this on the statute-book of our province 
               <br />

               conclusion can he arrived at than that Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid is simply killing time and making 
               <br />
               pretexts in order that the polite invitation

               of Monseigneur Sbarretti could be acted upon 
               <br />

               In this way, of course, Sir Wilfrid thinks 
               <br />
               he can secure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'a</span> political advantage for his 
               <br />
               friends in this province. This is a palpable 
               <br />
               political trick, which he is quite capable of 
               <br />
               undertaking, with the view to force the local 
               <br />
               government to do something which would be 
               <br />
               resented by the people and by this means he 
               <br />
               hopes to reinstate his Liberal friends in power 
               <br />
               here. I, for one, promise to take no chances in 
               <br />
               allowing Sir Wilfrid or any person else to take 
               <br />
               advantage of us by any underhanded scheme 
               <br />
               of this sort. All I ask is that every citizen of 
               <br />
               the province should have an opportunity of 
               <br />
               expressing his opinion by his vote as a protest 
               <br />
               against continued delay. I deny the right of 
               <br />
               Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Monseigneur Sbarretti 
               <br />
