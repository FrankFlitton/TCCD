               <br />
               prosperity. Let me quote the words of Lord

               Carnarvon when he introduced the British 
               <br />
               North America Act in the House of Lords. 
               <br />
               He said :

               In this Bill the division of powers has been 
               <br />
               mainly effected by a distinct classiﬁcation. 
               <br />
               That classiﬁcation is fourfold: First, those 
               <br />
               subjects of legislation which are attributed to 
               <br />
               the central parliament exclusively. Secondly, 
               <br />
               those which belong to the provincial legisla- 
               <br />
               ture exclusively. Third, those which are the 
               <br />
               subject of concurrent legislation, and fourth, a 
               <br />
               particular clause which is dealt with excep-

               Lastly, in the 93rd clause which contains the 
               <br />
               exceptional provisions to which I refer, your 
               <br />
               lordships Will observe some rather complicated 
               <br />
               arrangement in reference to education. I need 
               <br />
               hardly say that that great question gives rise 
               <br />
               to nearly as much earnestness and division of 
               <br />
               opinion on that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">235</span> on this side of the Atlantic.

               This clause has been framed after long and

               anxious controversy in which all parties have 
               <br />
               been represented and on conditions to which all 
               <br />
               have given their consent. The object of the 
               <br />
               clause is to secure to the religious minority 
               <br />
               of one province the same rights, privileges 
               <br />
               and protection which the religious minority of 
               <br />
               another province may enjoy. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> ‘Roman'

               On another occasion Lord Carnarvon in 
               <br />
