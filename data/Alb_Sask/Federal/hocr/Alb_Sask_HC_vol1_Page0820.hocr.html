               There is no doubt that many features of 
               <br />
               this measure deserve our very careful con- 
               <br />
               sideration. In the ﬁrst place, with regard 
               <br />
               to the naming of the two provinces which 
               <br />
               have been set up, no fault can be found. 
               <br />
               As to the division of the territory, there is 
               <br />
               little new that can be said. The object- 
               <br />
               lOll raised by the ex-Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton), as to the dividing line between 
               <br />
               the two provinces, and his suggestion that 
               <br />
               it would have been wise to have placed it 
               <br />
               some sixty miles further east, is worthy of 
               <br />
               notice. I am not sufﬁciently acquainted 
               <br />
               with the territory to say whether or not 
               <br />
               that would be a desirable move. I think 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Calgary (Mr. Mc- 
               <br />
               Carthy) also dwelt upon that point. There- 
               <br />

               <br />
               able that that should be changed, I think 
               <br />
               that even yet it might be wise to reconsider 
               <br />
               that feature of the Bill. ‘

               A further diﬂiculty which has arisen in 
               <br />
               connection with the division of the territory 
               <br />
               is the claim set up by the sister province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba to a share in the vast heritage 
               <br />
               that lies to the west of her. I think Mani- 
               <br />
               toba is worthy of better consideration than 
               <br />
               it has received so far at the hands of hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite. I think the contentions 
               <br />
               which Manitoba has set up for further ter— 
               <br />
               ritory are valid, and that they should by

               <br />
               satisfying the demands of that comparative— 
               <br />
               ly small province. Manitoba should not 
               <br />
               be left to feel that she has a grievance on 
               <br />
               her hands; but, judging by the reports 
               <br />
               which we receive and the utterances of her 
               <br />
               public men, we are forced to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that Manitoba really considers that 
               <br />
               she has not been properly treated in the 
               <br />
               division of territory at present being dealt 
               <br />
               with by this House. If that is the case, 
               <br />
               and I rather think it is, it should not yet 
               <br />
               be too late for hon. gentlemen on the Treas- 
               <br />
               ury benches to see to it that nothing is 
               <br />
               allowed to stand in the way of Manitoba 
               <br />
               receiving that justice which she has a right 
               <br />
               to expect. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Manitoba,</span> it is true, has been 
               <br />
               a province for a good many years. The 
               <br />
               right hon. the First Minister has stated that 
               <br />
               up to the present he has not known that 
               <br />
               Manitoba desired her boundaries extended, 
               <br />
               though on further information from the hon.

               day, the right hon. gentleman admitted that 
               <br />
               a petition had been received a few years 
               <br />
               ago praying for their extension. This peti-

               tion, it appears, was not favourably receiv- 
               <br />
               ed at the time; it was pigeon-holed; and 
               <br />
               the matter was not dealt with. What could 
               <br />
               be more natural, now that the territory is 
               <br />

               tleman had not heard her prayer ? Manitoba 
               <br />
               is surrounded by immense areas With at

               present a comparatively sparse population. 
               <br />
               in the territory to the north of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               between the province and Hudson bay, there 
               <br />
               is probably not more than one person to 
               <br />
               ﬁve square miles. Whatever the population 
               <br />

               with Manitoba, that ought to be consider-

               ed. But in this debate no reason has been 
               <br />
               given why the territory of Manitoba should 
               <br />
               not be extended to the north and also to 
               <br />
               the west. My own view, formed from read- 
               <br />
               ing of the wishes of the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west, has been that there should be only 
               <br />
               one new province formed, and that the 
               <br />
               balance of the territory between it and the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba should be given to 
               <br />
               Manitoba. We know that the matter of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial government is an item of serious cost 
               <br />
               to all the smaller provinces of the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion. There is nothing that can be said 
               <br />
               against the division of our territory into 
               <br />
               larger areas. The cost of our government 
               <br />
               is heavy; this country suffers from an 
               <br />
               excess of provincial governments, and it 
               <br />
               would have been good policy, in dividing 
               <br />
               these vast areas in the west, to have avoided

               ments in the press in that connection are-
