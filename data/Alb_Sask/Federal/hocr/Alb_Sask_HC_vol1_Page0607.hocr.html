               the observations of the Minister of Customs

               article by the hon. member for Pictou (Mr.

               know as a lawyer that hearsay evidence 
               <br />
               is of no value ? I ask him as a member of

               where were his ears ? Does he not know,

               or did not he hear at all ‘? What is the use

               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> talking about hearsay evidence ?
