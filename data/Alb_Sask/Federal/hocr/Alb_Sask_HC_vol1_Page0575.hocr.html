               affairs existing in the adjoining new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, such a settlement must necessarily 
               <br />
               be absolutely satisfactory for ever. We-have 
               <br />
               a totally different condition of affairs in re- 
               <br />
               gard to our school legislation in the new 
               <br />
               provinces. We have a new start to be made. 
               <br />
               We have a condition of affairs existing to- 
               <br />
               day in these Territories which gives certain 
               <br />
               rights to the minorities in the way of se- 
               <br />
               parate schools. To maintain these rights by 
               <br />
               our legislation, we give in the future a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guarantee</span> that these rights shall be main- 
               <br />
               tained. Some people may consider that the 
               <br />
               condition in the Territories is not better, 
               <br />
               nor even so good, as the condition of affairs 
               <br />
               in Manitoba to-day; but, however that 
               <br />
               may be. the proposition in this legislation 
               <br />
               is a settlement of the question. Perhaps, 
               <br />
               as in the case of Manitoba, you may call it 
               <br />
               a compromise, and probably the two ex- 
               <br />
               tremes to the controversy may say that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> we propose is not satisfactory, 
               <br />
               but a compromise has to be reached between 
               <br />
               these extremes. You cannot get a compro— 
               <br />
               mise which will be absolutely acceptable 
               <br />
               to the extreme adherents of one side 
               <br />
               or the other, but you may get a compromise 
               <br />
               which will be acceptable to the common 
               <br />
               sense of the great mass of the people of this 
               <br />
               country. I believe that by this Bill we have 
               <br />
               attained that desirable end.

               The question of the boundaries of Mani-

               <br />
               it is implied—a complaint is made by Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lingers</span> that the boundaries of Manitoba have

               <br />
               any such statement. There are newspaper 
               <br />
               rumours of all kinds. I regret to say that 
               <br />
               our friends opposite in their press are quite 
               <br />
               equal to the manufacture of newspaper 
               <br />
               rumours of all kinds. I regret to say that 
               <br />
               they feed on these rumours. They have 
               <br />
               not much else to feed upon, Mr. Speaker. 
               <br />
               They have been beaten over and over and 
               <br />
               over again, when the people of this country 
               <br />
               have been appealed to and have had an op-

               and their utterances in comparison with our 
               <br />

               such language here session after session be- 
               <br />
               tween 1896 and 1900. We heard that the

               like to refer to a statement which I saw

               in a Conservative newspaper within the

               <br />
               member which paper it was. The state- 
               <br />
               ment was that the people of Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               and the people of Quebec were inferior in 
               <br />

               <br />
               judice to the people of Ontario. It is easy 
               <br />
               enough to see where a sentiment of that 
               <br />
               kind comes from; it comes from the dis- 
               <br />
               appointed ambitions of men who tried to be 
               <br />

               <br />
               the defeat which their party and their

               <br />
               say a few words about; and, coming as I 
               <br />
               do from the province of Quebec, perhaps I 
               <br />
               know a little more about these matters than

               testant members of this House. It may be 
               <br />
               a little delicate for one who does not be- 
               <br />
               long to the Roman Catholic church to speak 
               <br />
               about the action of Catholics in regard to 
               <br />
               their own church, or about the difﬁculties

               which may have arisen in the internal 
               <br />
               economy of that church in this country.

               But. having lived among the Catholics of 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec, it may not be out 
               <br />
               of place for me to say a word or two in 
               <br />
               regard to the coming of the Papal ablegate. 
               <br />
               In 1896 a request was made by certain peo- 
               <br />
               ple belonging to the Catholic church for a 
               <br />
