               One other thing came to my mind. I

               could not help but look alternately from

               enthusiasm that does him inﬁnite credit,

               for Labelle, or of any other good Catholic, 
               <br />
               I quarrel with no man’s belief. It has been

               tice to myself. I have been in public life

               since 1882, I have been on the back benches 
               <br />
               and on the front benches, I have spoken 
               <br />
               considerably often in this House (gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite think quite too often), I have 
               <br />
               spoken a good deal through the country, and 
               <br />
               my speeches have been reported; if any

               <br />
               Catholic fellow-countrymen, I would be 
               <br />
               thankful for him to do it. I don’t think any 
               <br />
               man can. There is one circle which en— 
               <br />
               velops every man that is sacred ground, 
               <br />
               it is the circle in which his God and his 
               <br />
               conscience meet. Against What occurs in 
               <br />
               that inner circle I have absolutely no right 
               <br />
               to intrude, and I claim the same treatment 
               <br />
               for myself. But this is what I mean: If 
               <br />
               these were the opinions of the member 
               <br />

               <br />
               member for Labelle sat the ex-Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, who, the other day, whittled it 
               <br />
               all down to the one half hour of religious 
               <br />
               teaching; whittled it down to only that 
               <br />
               and nothing more. There, near the member 
               <br />
               for Labelle, sat the Prime Minister, who. in 
               <br />
               1896, had the opportunity to prevent what 
               <br />
               the member for Labelle deplored as the 
               <br />
               robbery of the rights of the minority in the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba. Never before in the 
               <br />
               history of confederation had such an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity arrived; it is very probable .it will 
               <br />
               never arrive again. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               told us, with a convenient forgetfulness of 
               <br />
               the whole clause 93: I was opposed to re— 
               <br />
               medial legislation in 1896, because the law 
               <br />
               of the province of Manitoba had been de— 
               <br />
               clared to be a valid law, and 1 was against 
               <br />
               forcing Manitoba to relinquish what Mani— 
               <br />
               toba had the right to enact. Is that the 
               <br />
               worship of the constitution that my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend has; is that the only part of 
               <br />
               the constitution he reads? There were 
               <br />
               two things in the Manitoba case in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1894;.</span> 
               <br />
               They had a right to their law and it was 
               <br />
               valid on one count, and that count was, that 
               <br />
               before Manitoba became a province there 
               <br />
               was no system of sectarian or denomina- 
               <br />
               tional schools by law or practice. But there 
               <br />
               was another point which was covered by 
               <br />
               the British North America Act, and for 
               <br />
               which most especially the British North 
               <br />
               America Act was framed to cover. When 
               <br />
               Manitoba became a province it enacted a 
               <br />
               separate school law, and in 1890 it repealed 
               <br />
               that separate school law, and, under such 
               <br />
               circumstances the British North America 
               <br />
               Act, section 93, came in. and it is the only 
               <br />
               way in which it possibly could come in. 
               <br />
               Does my right hon. friend deny the fact; 
               <br />
               does he deny the constitution? '
