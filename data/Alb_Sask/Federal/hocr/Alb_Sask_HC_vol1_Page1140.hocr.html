               Now a reference has been made to an 
               <br />
               opinion expressed by me long ago about 
               <br />
               the elementary schools in Quebec. T did 
               <br />
               criticise the elementary schools in Quebec, 
               <br />
               because I thought they were bad. I told 
               <br />
               the people who were interested. and upon 
               <br />
               whose votes I depended for my election, 
               <br />
               that I thought their schools were bad and

               they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘ionght</span> ,to improve them. They have

               set about improving them. But let me 
               <br />
               draw the attention of the House to this 
               <br />
               fact, that the elementary schools I criticised 
               <br />
               are not the clerical schools of the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, they are the schools that are 
               <br />
               under control of school trustees, which 
               <br />
               trustees are elected by ratepayers—those 
               <br />
               are the schools that I criticised. The cleri- 
               <br />
               cal schools of the province of Quebec are the 
               <br />
               colleges of that province where the Catholic 
               <br />
               members from that province were in large

               <br />
               some of our French colleagues from that 
               <br />
               province speak in this House, and may I 
               <br />
               not say of the school system that produces 
               <br />
               the men who represent that province. and

               Now, Mr. Speaker, after having apologized

               for trespassing so far on the attention of

               province which was said to be so deﬁcient 
               <br />
               and backward in the cause of education.

               Take the facilities for higher education

               something more than complete one of the
