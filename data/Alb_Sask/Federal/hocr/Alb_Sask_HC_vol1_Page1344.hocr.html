               friend and it has been mentioned more than 
               <br />
               once during this debate that under section 
               <br />
               2 of the Act of 1871 we must stretch our 
               <br />
               powers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> little in constituting new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, but my hon. friend has gone fur- 
               <br />
               ther than that in the drafting of this Bill. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend the Minister of Inland Rev- 
               <br />
               enue (Mr. Brodeur) has stated that under 
               <br />
               this section 2 we could give almost any 
               <br />
               kind of a constitution to the new provinces, 
               <br />
               take away the powers which the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces ought to have under section 92 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act and give 
               <br />
               powers which, under the scheme of confe- 
               <br />
               deration, are reserved only to the Dominion. 
               <br />
               I do not go as far as that. I think in the 
               <br />
               constitution of the new provinces, taking the 
               <br />
               View I take of section 2, we are not stretch- 
               <br />
               ing altogether unduly our powers, but we 
               <br />
               are exercising them merely for a temporary 
               <br />
               object and in order to organize these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces.

               Mr. PRINGLE. I think the point raised 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend from Jacques Cartier (Mr. 
               <br />

               friend the Minister of Justice has referred 
               <br />
               to the statute of 1886. I think if he reads 
               <br />
               the preamble of that statute‘ he will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that it does not apply to provinces but it
