               portunity to answer eertain things which 
               <br />
               were said against me. In 1899, on Octo- 
               <br />
               ber 13, a dinner was given at the city of 
               <br />
               St. John to my hon. friend from Toronto 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster). It was the ﬁrst time there 
               <br />
               was a question of sending a contingent to 
               <br />
               South Africa. I happened to be speaking at 
               <br />
               the time the news came and I said then, 
               <br />
               without consulting anybody—and I did not 
               <br />
               have to consult anybody, it was coming 
               <br />
               from the heart—that after the speech made 
               <br />
               by my right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />
               in England, when he had said openly that 
               <br />
               whenever there would be any danger to the 
               <br />
               British ﬂag, let the bugle be sounded and 
               <br />
               help would come from the colonies, parti~ 
               <br />
               cularly from Canada, I said then, immediate- 
               <br />
               ly, that it was the duty of Canadians to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fol-</span> 
               <br />
               low up what my right hon. friend had said 
               <br />
               and that I hoped Canadians would go to 
               <br />
               the defence of that ﬂag which is our only 
               <br />
               guarantee in this country. In saying that I 
               <br />
               said I had no doubt the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               would do its duty. I was assailed by 
               <br />
               Liberals on all the hustings of Quebec, in 
               <br />
               the many election campaigns I have made 
               <br />
               since, because I had proposed that, saying 
               <br />
               I wanted to send Canadians to South 
               <br />
               Africa, and had oifered 10,000 men of the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec ! I have answered that 
               <br />
               and I am doing it now in a way it can go 
               <br />
               everywhere. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,mention,</span> this because if we

               are to believe the stories circulated in those

               <br />

               In speaking about the ordinances of 1892 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr: Bourassa) 
               <br />
               yesterday said, and said correctly, that the 
               <br />
               government were mistaken if they thought 
               <br />
               they would make the country believe that 
               <br />
               they could not go further than the ordinances 
               <br />
               'of 1892. Of course my hon. friend, in 
               <br />
               a very delicate way, left it to be understood 
               <br />
               that if these ordinances were not disallowed 
               <br />
               that was the fault of the government then in 
               <br />
               power. But my right hon. friend accused 
               <br />
               the Conservative government of not having 
               <br />
               disallowed these ordinances in 1892. In 
               <br />
               making this argument he quoted from a re— 
               <br />
               port of the Privy Council of the 5th Febru- 
               <br />
               ary, 1894, but he read only the conclusion 
               <br />
               of that report, which is as follows: 
               <br />

               lapsus linguae. The disallowance of the
