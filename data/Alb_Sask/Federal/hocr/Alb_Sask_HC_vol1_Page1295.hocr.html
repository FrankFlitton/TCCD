               a costly thing to maintain two governments 
               <br />
               where one will do. After What has been 
               <br />
               said, I will take more time to consider the 
               <br />
               matter and prepare a uniform amendment 
               <br />
               for the third reading of the Bill, keeping in 
               <br />
               mind the ideas that we ought to have one 
               <br />
               province instead of two, that the present 
               <br />
               territory of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Althabaska</span> ought to be left in 
               <br />
               the Territories and the province of Manito— 
               <br />
               ba enlarged. If Manitoba is enlarged, one 
               <br />
               province made out of the country south of 
               <br />
               the present territory of Athabaska, all the 
               <br />
               requirements of the country will be met and 
               <br />
               the people will have representation as well 
               <br />
               as taxation, notwithstanding what the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) has said. - As 
               <br />
               to the suggestion of the Prime Minister that 
               <br />
               we can not discuss the schedule that goes 
               <br />
               with the Bill, I take issue with him. The 
               <br />
               question of the boundary of the provinces 
               <br />
               involves the schedule. There may be a 
               <br />
               reason for making the boundary line as it 
               <br />
               had been made. I think I know what that 
               <br />
               reason is. The hon. member. for Edmonton 
               <br />
               (Mr. Oliver) has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">successful</span> in an elec- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘tion</span> in the district of Edmonton and hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite would like'to have an- 
               <br />
               other eonstituency or two of the “same char- 
               <br />
               acter to the immediate north. There is a 
               <br />
               political object in view. There is no use in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«disguising</span> it and it must be discussed. And 
               <br />
               these boundaries are based upon political 
               <br />
               considerations. The central division that 
               <br />
               is proposed, the northerly boundary, the 
               <br />
               making of two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces,</span> with two govern- 
               <br />
               ments and all the patronage that goes with 
               <br />
               them—there are political reasons for all 
               <br />
               these things which we must be free to dis- 
               <br />
               cuss. The discussion cannot be conﬁned to 
               <br />
               a single point when others are implicated. 
               <br />
               We have the right to discuss these matters 
               <br />
               under the rules of the House. I ask leave 
               <br />
               to withdraw the motion I have made with 
               <br />

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. The Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior suggested that the new province 
               <br />
               should extend to the utmost limit of the 
               <br />
               British possesions to the north, assigning as 
               <br />
               his reason that the Dominion government 
               <br />
               should as soon as possible divest itself of the 
               <br />
               local administration of those territories. I 
               <br />
               think those were his exact words, because 
               <br />
               they impressed me at the time. We are 
               <br />
               adopting a middle course which is perhaps 
               <br />
               not a very logical one. The member for 
               <br />
               Hamilton has made a perfectly logical pro- 
               <br />
               position, and on the other hand there is a 
               <br />
               certain amount of reason for extension to 
               <br />
               the utmost conﬁnes ot‘ a British possession, 
               <br />
               in the north. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘But</span> I have not been able to 
               <br />
               understand why, it you go beyond the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terril</span> 
               <br />
               tories which have local self-government at 
               <br />
               present, you should stop at Athabaska. I 
               <br />
               ask why, if you go beyond the northern 
               <br />
               boundaries of Alberta and Saskatchewan, 
               <br />
               you should not, as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex:—minister</span> suggested, 
               <br />
               go to the northern limit of the British pos- 
               <br />
               sessions. It does not seem to me there is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> very good reason for a middle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">course,</span> 
               <br />
               though, I can see a very plausible argument

               for adopting either one of the other courses

               is chieﬂy an agricultural country and very 
               <br />
               little else. There are minerals at the foot of 
               <br />
               the Rocky mountains, some minerals on the 
               <br />
               prairies, but it is chieﬂy an agricultural 
               <br />
               country. The district of Mackenzie is not 
               <br />

               all of Mackenzie so far as we know; it is

               <br />
               is an agricultural country and can be de-

               veloped as such. In that section of the

               <br />
               to-day two grist mills of some importance.

               one I think erected within the last two or 
               <br />
               three years, and both of them supplied with 
               <br />
               wheat raised in the valley of the Peace river.

               That country is intimately connected with
