               the fact that he sat in this parliament in 
               <br />
               1890 and then voted for a resolution which 
               <br />
               gave the legislative assembly of the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories the right to regulate the manner of

               <br />

               ‘How would you have voted if you had been

               <br />
               question. Let me further call the attention 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend from Jacques Cartier (Mr. 
               <br />
               Monk) to this point: The French. Canadians 
               <br />
               of the Territories knew themselves so well 
               <br />
               that there was no covenant and no treaty 
               <br />
               guaranteeing to them the right to use the 
               <br />
               French language in the legislative assembly, 
               <br />
               that when the question came up before the 
               <br />
               Council, Mr. Rouleau, who was a judge of 
               <br />
               the Supreme Court, and who sat ex—oﬂicio, -I 
               <br />

               <br />
               himself as follows:

               Judge Rouleau spoke at great length on the 
               <br />
               question. He claimed that no action could be 
               <br />
               taken until the people had a chance to ex—

               if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> wished. He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> spoken French Ibefore 
               <br />
               he had spoken English and this memorial pro-

               posed to deprive him and others of their mother 
               <br />

               <br />
               question should be decided by the. electors, and 
               <br />
               hinted that some of the members, who probably 
               <br />
               vote for this now, might suffer at the next 
               <br />
               election.
