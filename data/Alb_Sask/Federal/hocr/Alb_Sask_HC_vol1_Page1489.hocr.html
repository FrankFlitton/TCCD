               Now here is a provision whereby the par-

               liament of Canada can compel the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway to come before it and show 
               <br />
               what it has cost to build that railway, and 
               <br />
               they are entitled only to earn ten per cent 
               <br />
               on the actual cost of that railway. Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment has had that power over the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway ever since the contract was 
               <br />
               entered into, and the time has now arrived, 
               <br />
               indeed it arrived long ago. when the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of this country should demand a 
               <br />
               statement of the cost of the construction of 
               <br />
               that road and should tell the railway : The 
               <br />
               day has come when your rates must be 
               <br />

               <br />
               and we intend to reduce them. If the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Paciﬁc Railway had been brought 
               <br />
               before parliament, supposing an Act were 
               <br />
               passed in which we said to them : You must 
               <br />
               go before the Board of Railway Commis- 
               <br />
               sioners and show the original cost of your

               <br />
               reduction—I say the Canadian Paciﬁc would 
               <br />
               have given up this exemption clause the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">day</span> they got that notice. But instead of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> instead of dealing with the whole ques- 
               <br />
               tion now as the government should deal 
               <br />
               with it, they only deal with a part of it, 
               <br />
               they strengthen the canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way in their exemption, and they refrain 
               <br />
               from taking any action in regard to the 
               <br />
               regulation of their tolls, notwithstanding 
               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman says it is a bad 
               <br />
               exemption. an improvident exemption. He 
               <br />
               agrees with me in saying that it was the 
               <br />
               worst exemption on the statute—book of 
               <br />
               Canada. He still has under this Act power 
               <br />
               to go after the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               and bring them before him, to compel them 
               <br />
               to produce papers in connection with the 
               <br />
               cost of the railway, and to say the time has 
               <br />
               arrived for a reduction of the 01d rates by 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada. Now we have 
               <br />
               that power. and if we exercised it we would 
               <br />
               get a commutation of this exemption. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman thinks not. Well. let him 
               <br />
               try it. He has taken jurisdiction <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">over</span>

               other companies ; combines like the tobacco

               certain stage of their earnings, and this 
               <br />
               government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> can, by enforcing that 
               <br />
               condition, obtain one of two things: They 
               <br />
               can probably make it clear that there ought 
               <br />
               to be a reduction in the tolls ; or they may 
               <br />
               say: We will not enforce that reduction 
               <br />
               of tolls for ﬁve years hence provided you 
               <br />
               commute this exemption. The hon. member 
               <br />
               for Assinibola stated just now the character 
               <br />
               of this exemption. Let me point out, on 
               <br />
               similar lines, that this exemption is what 
               <br />
               is called an unearned increment, that is 
               <br />
               to say, the people of the west are constantly 
               <br />
               increasing the value of the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway by every dollar that they tax 
               <br />
               themselves. They tax themselves for local 
               <br />
               improvements, they build roads, the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Paciﬁc Railway contributes nothing, 
               <br />
               but the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway takes up 
               <br />
               all this unearned increment, and the settler 
               <br />

               <br />
               dian Paciﬁc Railway, and he doubles and 
               <br />
               trebles the value of the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway. Now that is the greatest injus- 
               <br />
               tice that exists in the world, the injustice 
               <br />
               that innres to the beneﬁt of the few against 
               <br />
               the many, the injustice that is called the 
               <br />
               unearned increment. -It is happening all 
               <br />
               the world over, it is happening in this case. 
               <br />
               it is happening in cities. We may not be able 
               <br />
               toreach it in the case of cities, but in some 
               <br />
               way we can reach it. The Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice has confessed to-day in this debate that 
               <br />
               he consulted the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. 
               <br />
               He says he did not consult the Territories, 
               <br />
               I do not know whether he even consulted 
               <br />
               the representatives of the territorial govern- 
               <br />
               ment, although from the statement that has 
               <br />
               been read to-day the territorial government 
               <br />
               has presented an unanswerable case. That 
               <br />
               statement as read by the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               just now and put on record in the ‘Han- 
               <br />
               sard,’ is unan-swerable, because it is the 
               <br />
               statement of a great injustice being done 
               <br />
               to the people of the west, an injustice which 
               <br />
               calls for a remedy. Therefore I say a 
               <br />
               remedy ought to be given. The Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, who is not in the House just 
               <br />
               now, if ever he did make an outcry in this 
               <br />
               House it was about the unfair customs 
               <br />
