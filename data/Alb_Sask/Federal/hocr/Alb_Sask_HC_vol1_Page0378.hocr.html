               friend the leader of the opposition this after- 
               <br />

               the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid

               <br />
               opposition in this House some years ago. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman on that occasion 
               <br />
               drew the attention of this House to certain 
               <br />
               rumours going the rounds of the newspapers 
               <br />
               of this country coupled with the fact that 
               <br />
               His Excellency the Governor General had 
               <br />
               postponed a trip that he anticipated making. 
               <br />
               He thought the circumstances sufﬁcient to 
               <br />
               warrant him in calling the attention of the 
               <br />
               government of the day to the importance 
               <br />
               of these rumours. One of the arguments he 
               <br />
               employed in that case was to the effect that 
               <br />
               the government was not in the position in 
               <br />

               <br />
               seats in the government were vacant. It 
               <br />
               seemed to him a remarkable thing that he 
               <br />
               found some of these seats vacated, vacated

               Why was my hon. friend so much exercised 
               <br />
               on that occasion ? It was not because of

               any particular or important question brought 
               <br />
               up in this House on that occasion. In 1895 
               <br />
               parliament met on April 18. This matter 
               <br />
               was brought up by the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               on July 9, and that session closed on July 
               <br />
               22, thirteen days after he had given the 
               <br />
               government notice of the fact that certain 
               <br />
               ministers had not been in their places the 
               <br />
               day before. Why was he so much exercised

               over the fact of these ministers not being 
               <br />
               properly representative of the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec? Was it bcause parliament was 
               <br />
               liable to vote a penny unwisely in their

               tion of Minister of the Interior is not ﬁlled. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman rises in his place

               again has another little joke. And what is 
               <br />
