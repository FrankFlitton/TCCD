               valued friend Mr. Sutherland has been so 
               <br />
               many years. I had the privilege of know-

               <br />

               member of parliament and I a young and 
               <br />
               inexperienced member. I always met at his 
               <br />
               hands the greatest kindness and cordiality.

               loyalty to our institutions, and so long as 
               <br />
               the spirit of self—sacriﬁce and devotion ot 
               <br />
               duty are held in esteem among us, so long 
               <br />
               will the names of Catholic priests and 
               <br />
               prelates hold foremost places on the 
               <br />
               honour roll of Canada. It is not neces- 
               <br />
               sary to go over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> ground already 
               <br />
               covered by my eloquent friend from Labelle 
               <br />
               (Mr. Bourassa). but let me mention the 
               <br />
               names of Jogues, Lallemant and Brebeur, 
               <br />
               French Canadian Catholic martyrs who, in 
               <br />
               the early days of our history gave to the 
               <br />
               world examples of the noblest courage that 
               <br />
               ever steeled the heart of man, that of giving 
               <br />
               testimony unto death for the convictions of 
               <br />
               the soul.

               As I listened a few days ago to the ad-
