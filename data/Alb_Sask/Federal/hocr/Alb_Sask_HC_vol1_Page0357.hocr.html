               <br />
               or a little previous to that, when it was

               with the sub-committee after three or 
               <br />
               four of the main reasons had been stated, 
               <br />
               that consideration being that it would be

               advisable in the interests of immigration

               <br />
               unsound argument. The Immigration De- 
               <br />
               partment is for the Whole of Canada—for 
               <br />
               all the provinces, and for no one more than 
               <br />
               another. It may happen, and it does hap- 
               <br />
               pen, that the province of Manitoba and the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories are the most attrac- 
               <br />
               tive ﬁeld for immigrants to-day; but to- 
               <br />
               morrow it may be Ontario or Quebec or 
               <br />
               British Columbia; we do not know. As 
               <br />
               a matter of fact, we ﬁnd that the Immi-

               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. Here is an ex-

               peting with each other for immigration. 
               <br />
               More than that, the local government. thor-

               oughly understanding the local conditions. 
               <br />
               would be able to make matters so much 
               <br />
               more comfortable for the incoming settlers 
               <br />
               that they would produce a more contented 
               <br />
               class of settlers; and the old saying still 
               <br />
               holds good, that the contented settler is the 
               <br />
               best immigration agent, and the quotation 
               <br />
               which I have just made from the report of 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior goes to prove 
               <br />
               it. These people coming in are, a great

               many of them, coming to their friends, from 
               <br />
               whom they have heard of their great pros-

               perity and who have encouraged them to 
               <br />
               come to the country. I contend that the

               seriously raised upon this subject. This

               question. as well as the whole question of 
               <br />
               provincial powers, was very clearly stated

               friend sent'me a copy of his speech on that 
               <br />

               <br />
               the position he took, and am very glad to 
               <br />
               put on record the second time some of the

               opinions which he expressed in that speech.

               and which are very similar to those I hold

               as the originally confederated provinces dealt

               with themselves, and be put in exactly the same

               position as that occupied by the originally
