               completing, to my mind. the historical

               sketch given by the Prime Minister this 
               <br />

               <br />
               was the point I insisted upon and still in— 
               <br />
               sist npon—that, so far as the organization 
               <br />
               of school districts is concerned, under all 
               <br />
               these ordinances the majority of any dis- 
               <br />
               trict remained entitled, as they had been 
               <br />
               under the law of 1875, to organize either a 
               <br />
               Catholic or a Protestant school. Most of 
               <br />
               the members of this House will remember 
               <br />
               that it was about these years that Mr. Dal- 
               <br />
               ton McCarthy began his movement for the 
               <br />
               abolition of the separate Schools in Manito- 
               <br />
               ba and the Northwest Territories, which, 
               <br />
               as he stated, was a preliminary step to the 
               <br />
               abolition of religious edncation throughout 
               <br />
               the Dominion and the abolition of French 
               <br />
               as an ofﬁcial language in Canada. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) stated 
               <br />
               some time ago that in the Northwest as- 
               <br />
               sembly, although the ﬁrst opinion had been 
               <br />
               given in favour of abolishing separate 
               <br />
               schools, that opinion was not maintained 
               <br />
               by Mr. Haultain especially. I have follow- 
               <br />
               ed the proceedings of the assembly of the

               all the ordinances. and not only a few of 
               <br />
               them. I have found that ﬁrst in 1889 the 
               <br />
               Northwest assembly petitioned this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment by two addresses, one asking for the 
               <br />
               repeal of clause 14 of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories Act in the revised statutes of Can- 
               <br />
               ada, and the other asking for the repeal of 
               <br />
               clause 110. Clause 14 provides for the main- 
               <br />
               tenance of separate schools and the other 
               <br />
               provides for the maintenance of French as 
               <br />
               an ofﬁcial language in the Northwest. These 
               <br />
               addresses were not complied with in this 
               <br />
               parliament. In 1890, on November 18th, a 
               <br />
               resolution was introduced by Mr. Richard- 
               <br />
               son and seconded by Mr. Brett, reafﬁrming 
               <br />
               the resolution of 1889. Perhaps for party 
               <br />
               reasons, certainly for reaSOns with which 
               <br />
               I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ann</span> not familiar, Mr. Haultain opposed 
               <br />
               this measure, and it was defeated by a 
               <br />
               vote of 15 to 6. But, ten days afterwards, 
               <br />
               a resolution was brought forward by Mr. 
               <br />
               Cayiey, seconded by Mr. Haultain, to the 
               <br />
               very same effect—reiterating the demands 
               <br />
               of the Northwest assembly of the previous 
               <br />
               year, and asking the Dominion parliament 
               <br />
               to repeal sections <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1-1</span> and 110 of the North— 
               <br />
               west Territories Act. So far as Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               tain‘s intentions are concerned; I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think</span> 
               <br />
               there can be no doubt that from 1889 his 
               <br />
               aim, so far as education is concerned, was 
               <br />
               to do away with the dual system establish- 
               <br />
               ed under the law of 1875—and we shall see 
               <br />
               presently how far he has succeeded. Of 
               <br />
               course, as hon. members know, in 1891 Mr. 
               <br />
               Dalton McCarthy introduced a Bill that 
               <br />
               would have had for its effect the carrying 
               <br />
               out of the wish of Mr. Haultain and the 
               <br />
               Northwest assembly. But that Bill was re- 
               <br />
               jected by this parliament. In 1892 the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories adopted the ordin- 
               <br />
               ance that has been so often referred to. As 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister accurately stated this 
               <br />
               afternoon, the effect of that ordinance was 
               <br />
               to do away with the dual administration of 
               <br />
               the schools. The council of public instruc- 
               <br />
               tion, composed partly of Protestants and 
               <br />
               partly of Catholics, which council divided 
               <br />
               itself into two committees for the super- 
               <br />
               vision ot the Catholic and Protestant 
               <br />
               schools, respectively, was abolished, and 
               <br />
               the government of the Northwest Terri-
