               systems receiving public aid and sharing 
               <br />
               in the revenue from the public school lands. 
               <br />
               That is my position. I would rather vote

               for an increased subsidy from this govern- 
               <br />
               ment to western Canada for ﬁve or ten 
               <br />
               years yet to come than I would record my 
               <br />
               vote to take away the rights of the people 
               <br />
               of that western country to deal with their 
               <br />
               education as they see ﬁt. That is my policy 
               <br />
               and I have nothing to add to and nothing 
               <br />
               to detract from what I have said. I am in 
               <br />
               favour of absolute provincial rights for 
               <br />
               western Canada in all matters. The people 
               <br />
               of that country are the sons and daughters

               foreign countries, and I am anxious that 
               <br />
               their children shall have the best education 
               <br />
               that_can be given them. I do not believe 
               <br />
               in. dividing the school money (part of it 
               <br />
               going to the separate school system and 
               <br />
               part of it to the national school system.) 
               <br />
               I do not believe they can perfect these two 
               <br />
               educational systems in that way. If the

               with much pleasure to the able speech de- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               a church meeting and not in a legislative

               <br />
               citing the protests from the Presbyterians, 
               <br />
               the Baptists, the Congregationalists and the 
               <br />
               Methodists, uttered as they were in his own 
               <br />
               sweet voice, I thought we were listening to 
               <br />
               a preacher and not to a parliamentarian. 
               <br />
               The thought crossed my mind, that if we in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec are to be accused of 
               <br />
               being priest-ridden, my hon. friend (Mr.
