               in which he said in substance : ‘ I know that 
               <br />
               the law protects the minority in the prov- 
               <br />

               in which an unwilling majority can evade 
               <br />
               the law—and we have evidence of that in 
               <br />
               several provinces of the Dominion. Sup-

               hands of a federal government?’ Well, that 
               <br />
               was done by the government of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories some years ago. But if- it

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'be</span> infamous to abolish the supervision of 
               <br />
               Protestant schools by Protestants, how 
               <br />
               comes it to be perfectly proper to abolish 
               <br />
               the supervision of Catholic schools by 
               <br />

               ‘News’ which attracted my attention. It 
               <br />
               was written by a gentleman in the town

               Wright. This is what it said, speaking of 
               <br />
               the schools of Quebec:

               The separate school system is one of dis- 
               <br />
               trust, suspicion and antagonism. . . . As it 
               <br />
               is, the priesthood are given control and pro—

               Now, that letter was written in the 
               <br />
               county of Wright opposite Ottawa. That

               county is two-thirds French Canadian 
               <br />
               and four-ﬁfths Catholic. There was a
