               <br />
               bellion of 1885; as I explained this after— 
               <br />
               noon, when the government wanted the few 
               <br />

               <br />
               vey a rebellion broke out. This hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman claims that rebellion was justiﬁed. 
               <br />
               and he regrets that he did not bring on a 
               <br />
               rebellion in Manitoba at the time the Mani—

               toba Act was passed abolishing separate

               <br />
               rebellions are just. I think the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories fully appreciate their 
               <br />

               with this Bill, ﬁrst by a constitutional agita-

               determined to insist upon forcing this

               <br />
               Godless, and we have heard a great deal

               about Grodliness and holiness although we 
               <br />
               do not see such an awful lot of it. I have 
               <br />
               always observed that: Holy life is more 
               <br />
               than rite, and spirit more than letter. You 
               <br />
               can step into a school where the Bible is 
               <br />

               Sir Oliver Mowat’s was, for justice and

               equality. The Protestants of Ontario never

               they ever attempt to do away with separate
