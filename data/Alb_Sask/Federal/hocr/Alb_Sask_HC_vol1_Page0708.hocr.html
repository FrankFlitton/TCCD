               new province of Saskatchewan cannot 
               <br />
               urge with ten times greater force. I

               have stated and I think ' we are all

               practically of the same opinion, that

               it would have been a great deal better

               as the port at the mouth of the Churchill is

               comes before the conference which will be

               paramount to any claim that either Mani-

               Now, Mr. Speaker, as to the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               terms given to the proposed provinces: 
               <br />
               It seems to me to be generally admited on 
               <br />
               both sides of the House, that these terms 
               <br />
               are fair, just and liberal. Some think they 
               <br />
               are even generous. But, so far as I have 
               <br />
               heard, no one has objected to the Bill on the 
               <br />
               ground that the ﬁnancial terms are too 
               <br />
               generous or to liberal, or that they are not 
               <br />
               justiﬁed by the present and prospective 
               <br />
               needs of the provinces. It is quite true that 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster) stated to the House some days ago 
               <br />
               that the terms granted to the new provinces 
               <br />
               were so much more liberal than the terms 
               <br />
               enjoyed by the older provinces that we 
               <br />
               would have the older provinces making an 
               <br />
               immediate demand for better terms. How- 
               <br />
               ever that may be, the ﬁnancial aid with 
               <br />
               which this government proposes to set up 
               <br />
               the new provinces in their provincial house- 
               <br />
               keeping, is to my mind. fair and just; and 
               <br />
               considering the present needs and the pro- 
               <br />
               bable future requirements of the provinces 
               <br />
               it is just such fair and reasonable aid as 
               <br />
               I expected this government and this par- 
               <br />
               liament to grant. We start the provinces 
               <br />
               with a revenue from the Dominion of over 
               <br />
               $1,000,000. This increases with the in- 
               <br />
               crease of the population until the population 
               <br />
               reaches 1,200,000, when the revenue from 
               <br />
               the federal treasury will be over $2,200,000. 
               <br />
               Now, this amount, together with what addi- 
               <br />
               tional revenue the provinces can get from 
               <br />
               local sources, ought, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I‘believe.</span> with economy 
               <br />
               and efﬁcient management, to enable the 
               <br />
               provinces to make reasonable provision 
               <br />
               for the needs of their people without going 
               <br />
               heavily into debt. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott), the other night, 
               <br />
               submitted to this House some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">calculations</span> 
               <br />
               showing that the ﬁnancial position in which 
               <br />
               this Bill places the new provinces estab- 
               <br />

               vinces which derive their revenue partly

               from federal subsidy and partly from the 
               <br />
               Crown domain, we have to bear in mind 
               <br />
               the fact that in these provinces the rev— 
               <br />
               enue from the Crown domain varies. from 
               <br />
               year to year. If the provincial authori— 
               <br />
               ties dispose of any considerable portion of 
               <br />
               the Crown domain in one year, the rev—_ 
               <br />
               euue for that year will be large, while in 
               <br />
               another year it will be considerably small- 
               <br />
               er. Therefore, to make a fair comparison, 
               <br />
               we must not select one particular year. 
               <br />
               but must take the average of a number of 
               <br />
               years. It must also be borne in mind. 
               <br />
               in dealing with the provinces that derive 
               <br />
               their revenue partly from the Crown domain. 
               <br />
               that it is the net revenue from the Crown 
               <br />
               domain that we must deal with, because 
               <br />
               the expenses of the management and admin- 
               <br />
               istration of the Crown domain are properly 
               <br />
               chargeable against the gross revenue. I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that in Ontario, in the thirty-six years 
               <br />
               from confederation up to the end of 1903. 
               <br />
               the average annual revenue which the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario derived from the federal 
               <br />
               treasury and from her Crown domain 
               <br />
               amounted to $2,204,015, while the new pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Saskatchewan, when she reaches 
               <br />
               the population at which Ontario entered 
               <br />
               confederation will have a revenue of $2.- 
               <br />
               207.875. Applying the same principle to 
               <br />
               Quebec, I ﬁnd that for the thirty-six years 
               <br />
               from confederation down to the end of 1903, 
               <br />
               the average annual revenue of the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec from the federal treasury and 
               <br />
               the Crown domain was $1,629,249. This is 
               <br />
               considerably less than the new province of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan will enjoy when she reaches 
               <br />
               the population of Quebec. But in that 
               <br />
               connection, Mr. Speaker. I would draw 
               <br />
               your attention to this fact, that in the 
               <br />
               last report of the Commissioner of Crown 
               <br />
               Lands for Quebec it is stated that during 
               <br />
               the last seven years ending in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1904,</span> the 
               <br />
               revenue from the Crown lands in Quebec has 
               <br />
               increased ﬁfty per cent. The details for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1904,</span> 
               <br />
               I was not able to get, but I made a calcula- 
               <br />
               tion which shows that the average annual 
               <br />
               revenue which the province of Quebec had 
               <br />
               derived from the Crown domain and from 
               <br />
               the federal treasury for the six years from 
               <br />
               1897 to the end of 1903, amounted to $2,207,- 
               <br />
               135, while the revenue for the new provinces 
               <br />
               will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2,207,875—‘almost</span> identically the 
               <br />
               same. So. under these ﬁnancial provisions. 
               <br />
               the new provinces and the older ones are 
               <br />
               placed upon a basis of equality.
