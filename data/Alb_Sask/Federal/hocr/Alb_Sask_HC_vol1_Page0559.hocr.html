               politically expedient for the government of 
               <br />

               had the power to extend those boundaries?

               House. There was one and only one power in 
               <br />
               this country that could deal with that ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and that is the power represented by 
               <br />
               the fourteen or ﬁfteen gentlemen who sit 
               <br />
               around the Council board of Canada; and 
               <br />
               His Excellency declared that ‘from the 
               <br />
               point of view of the Manitoba government 
               <br />
               some action on these lines would be politi- 
               <br />
               cally expedient.’ Now, there is only one pos- 
               <br />
               sible meaning to that, and it is this ; His Ex- 
               <br />
               cellency must have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thoroughly</span> believed that 
               <br />
               he had the authority to suggest to these 
               <br />
               gentlemen that if they acceded to his de- 
               <br />
               mand. to his request with regard to the 
               <br />
               school laws of Manitoba, there would be 
               <br />
               such an extension of the boundaries of 
               <br />
               Manitoba as the government of that 
               <br />
               province desired. I am reluctant to 
               <br />
               believe that His <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Excellency</span> would have 
               <br />
               made any such suggestion unless he 
               <br />
               believed he had authority of some kind.

               <br />

               <br />
               the government justiﬁed their action in 
               <br />

               document of a conﬁdential character came 
               <br />

               <br />
               justiﬁed in denying in this House that any 
               <br />
               such document existed. I do not know what 
               <br />
               denials or what statements we shall receive

               in this regard; but it is interesting to 
               <br />
               observe another thing in this statement of 
               <br />
               His Excellency, and it is this: that there 
               <br />
               is no direct statement in it, so far as I 
               <br />
               have been able to observe, that he did not 
               <br />
               ! have the authority which he assumed on that 
               <br />
               occasion. He has said, and the Prime 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> Minister has said. that that interview was 
               <br />
               not arranged on behalf of the government 
               <br />
               or at the instance of the government; but 
               <br />
               I do not observe any statement of His 
               <br />
               Excellency that he did not consider him— 
               <br />
               self to have authority to make the sug- 
               <br />
               gestion which he did make to the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell on that occasion. If there was a 
               <br />
               supposed authority, or it beyond that there 
               <br />
               was real authority given on behalf of this 
               <br />
               government, or given by any member of this 
               <br />
               government, how does the action of the 
               <br />
               members of this administration contrast 
               <br />
               with their attitude in 1896? Then their 
               <br />
               cry, at least in most of the provinces of 
               <br />
               Canada, was: No coercion; hands oﬂ 
               <br />
               Manitoba. That was their answer to a re- 
               <br />
               medial order and remedial legislation pro- 
               <br />
               posed by a Conservative administration with- 
               <br />
               in the strict terms of the constitution. 
               <br />
               But what has been suggested might 
               <br />
               rightly be regarded, I think, as a remedial 
               <br />
               order of another type—as a remedial order 
               <br />
               of an unconstitutional and unwarranted 
               <br />
               character ; and I for one am surprised that 
               <br />
               upon the statement of His Excellency, which 
               <br />
               I have no doubt is absolutely accurate in 
               <br />
               every respect, there should have been this 
               <br />
               suggestion to the members of the govern— 
               <br />
               ment of the province of Manitoba. 
               <br />

               I am not concerned wth the question as 
               <br />
               to whether or not His Excellency should 
               <br />
               be recalled; as I said yesterday, he is not 
               <br />
               responsible to us in any sense, he is res- 
               <br />
               ponsible only to his superiors. But the gov- 
               <br />
               ernmentof this country are responsible to 
               <br />
               us, and if there has been any suggestion of 
               <br />
               this kind by or on behalf of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of this country, or by or on behalf 
               <br />
               of any member of it, then I say the coun- 
               <br />
               try will demand, and I think the people will 
               <br />
               demand, the dismissal or retirement of any 
               <br />
               member of this government who ventured to 
               <br />
               confer upon His Excellency any authority 
               <br />
