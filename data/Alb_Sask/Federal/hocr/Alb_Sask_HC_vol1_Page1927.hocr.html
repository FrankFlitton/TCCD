               In going over the ‘Hansard’ for 1890, 
               <br />
               when that question was discussed in this 
               <br />
               House, I noticed a speech delivered by the 
               <br />
               late Sir Wm. Edgar. who came to be later 
               <br />
               on Speaker of this House, and who was 
               <br />
               known as one of the great friends of the 
               <br />
               French Canadian. That speech was a vin- 
               <br />
               dication of our rights. It was an eloquent 
               <br />
               appeal in our favour, and wound up with 
               <br />
               the following words, which should be a 
               <br />
               lesson to our hon. friends:
