               table to see what is going on in the country 
               <br />
               today. There is no question but that this

               country to-day stands upon a volcano; a 
               <br />

               <br />
               fault of gentlemen on the other side, but 
               <br />
               there is blame on both sides, if not in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>

               <br />
               unfortunate state of things, and I am sorry 
               <br />
               to have to lay it at the door of my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend. It is all due to the policy which he 
               <br />
               followed in 1896. He let it be spread broad- 
               <br />
               cast throughout the Dominion that he was 
               <br />
               opposed to the hierarchy and to any cleri- 
               <br />
               cal inﬂuence. He said, or he let it be said 
               <br />
               that the Liberal party in Quebec had been 
               <br />
               ﬁghting the clergy ever since that party ex- 
               <br />
               isted, and that at least they had conquered 
               <br />
               the hierarchy. The right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               obtained a great name for himself in the

               <br />

               <br />
               16 was put in the Bill, whether with or

               without consultation with any one, and. I

               ready to accept the amended clause which

               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) accepts it. 
               <br />
               The member for Brandon resigned because 
               <br />
               clause 16 was in the original Bill and now

               that he accepts the substituted clause it is

               have been a great deal better for the coun—

               minority in the Northwest Teritories, if 
               <br />
               there had been nothing at all mentioned 
               <br />
               about schools in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Bill, than that the 
               <br />
               original clause should have been withdrawn 
               <br />
               and this one substituted. My impression is, 
               <br />
               and there are some good lawyers who say 
               <br />
               so, that the Northwest Territories would 
               <br />
               have come in confederation with the schools, 
               <br />
               not the schools they have to-day, but With 
               <br />
               the schools provided for in the Act of 1875' 
               <br />
               and which was never repealed, although 
               <br />
               some ordinances had been placed upon the 
               <br />
               regulations by the Northwest legislature.- 
               <br />
               If my hon friend had omitted the school 
               <br />
               clause and allowed the Act of 1875 to come 
               <br />
               into operation, the country would not have 
               <br />
               been in the condition it is in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> ; a con- 
               <br />
               dition which is very dangerous. For weeks

               and weeks we have been talking what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">':—</span> 
               <br />
               talking nationality, talking religion when

               we have been living together for over 150 
               <br />
               years. I hope in the interest of the country 
               <br />
               this will be the last occasion on which such 
               <br />
               a discussion will take place. I think this 
               <br />
               is the last question of the kind that will 
               <br />
               arise. Surely we are not going to buy

               last occasion on which we will have such
