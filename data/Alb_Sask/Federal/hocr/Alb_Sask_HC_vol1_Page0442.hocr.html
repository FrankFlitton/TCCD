               question, until this Bill was introduced into 
               <br />

               <br />
               it with any one, either Liberal or Conserva— 
               <br />
               tive, because, as he said, he did not think

               it would be proper to enter into a discus-

               simply desired more particularly to criticise

               <br />
               ﬁrst, I think I have convinced the House 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(the</span> reasonable request of the province

               tion of Keewatin, and also that the new 
               <br />
               Quebec premier has expressed his intention 
               <br />
               to make a similar requisition on behalf of 
               <br />
               that province. It is evident that the object

               of the right hon. gentleman is being accom-

               ment the government have no reasonable

               <br />
               matters of purely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provincial</span> concern. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve them to be unconstitutional and im- 
               <br />
               politic. High legal authorities, such as Sir 
               <br />
               Louis Davies, judge of the Supreme Court, 
               <br />
               has declared that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament</span> had not 
               <br />
               the right to interfere in the school policy of 
               <br />
               the Territories; and should this question 
               <br />
               ever come up before him for adjudication, 
               <br />
               he would, if he desired to be consistent, feel 
               <br />
               bound to give an opinion in accord with the 
               <br />
               views he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expressed</span> in parliament. I have 
               <br />
               here the opinion he expressed. It has been 
               <br />
               quoted in this House before, but you cannot 
               <br />
               emphasize a good opinion too frequently. 
               <br />
               This is what Sir Louis Davies said in 1891, 
               <br />
               when the territorial charter was under con-

               My opinion is now. and has been for years, 
               <br />
               that when that time comes (the time to erect 
               <br />
               the Territories into provinces) you cannot 
               <br />
               withhold from the provinces so erected the right 
               <br />
               to determine for themselves the question of 
               <br />
               education in one way or the other. I would 
               <br />
               be the last to favour this parliament impos- 
               <br />

               <br />
               cation, either free or separate. I only claim 
               <br />
               that when a Bill is introduced to erect these 
               <br />
               Territories into provinces that Bill should 
               <br />
               contain a provision enabling the people of the 
               <br />
               different provinces so created to decide what 
               <br />
               system of education they will have.
