               <br />
               they do not dare to storm a cabinet position. 
               <br />
               They did storm it in 1904. In that year 
               <br />
               they had their secret funds all over the. 
               <br />
               country; they had their conspiracies; we 
               <br />
               know what was ha ening in Quebec, how 
               <br />
               that province was go ng to sweep the whole 
               <br />
               Liberal party out of existence—but things 
               <br />
               did not turn out as anticipated. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) was 
               <br />
               carried away then, as he is to-day, by his 
               <br />
               own enthusiasm. In fact I can in no other 
               <br />
               way describe his conduct <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> than by 
               <br />
               saying he has simply been carried away by 
               <br />
               his own rhetoric. When we hear so much 
               <br />
               talk about superiority and inferiority, I, 
               <br />
               cannot help but admit that in certain things 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Toronto is cer- 
               <br />
               tainly unequalled. He has, for instance, the 
               <br />
               greatest command of epithets of any man I 
               <br />
               have ever seen. We might call him indeed 
               <br />
               the king of epithets. He has besides the ex- _ 
               <br />
               elusive monopoly of insinuation and innuen— 
               <br />
               do and unsupported statements; and if you do 
               <br />
               not take him up at once, he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.will</span> come back 
               <br />
               the next day and repeat the statement, and 
               <br />
               say it must be true because you did not con- 
               <br />
               tradict it. Take, for instance, the charge 
               <br />
               he made one day that Mr. Russell was paid 
               <br />
               for going to Rome out of the money of the 
               <br />
               Canadian people. The Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               at once denied the statement, and the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Toronto took it back. But 
               <br />
               why did he make the statement? Simply 
               <br />
               because, if it had not been contradicted, you 
               <br />
               would have seen the Toronto press take hold 
               <br />
               of it and declare in capital letters: The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister sent Mr. Russell to Rome 
               <br />
               and paid him for his services and his ex- 
               <br />
               penses out of the money of the people. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Toronto has a mono- 
               <br />
               ply of insinuation and innuendo, and, as far 
               <br />
               as hair splitting is concerned, I have never 
               <br />
               found his equal from the Atlantic to the

               To my mind, Mr. Speaker, this is not 
               <br />
               simply a question of provincial rights. 
               <br />
               There are other rights involved. It is a 
               <br />
               question of individual rights, which are more 
               <br />
               sacred than provincial rights. The privilege 
               <br />
               of separate schools is now enjoyed by the 
               <br />
               minority in the Territories, they are entitled 
               <br />
               to that privilege, and those schools should 
               <br />
               be perpetuated by the legislation we are new 
               <br />
               enacting. We must not forget those men 
               <br />
               who ﬁrst went into that country, those men 
               <br />
               who discovered it, those men who ﬁrst 
               <br />
               planted the seeds of civilization in it and 
               <br />
               who were inspired to do this, not by motives 
               <br />
               of speculation or greed for gain, but by their 
               <br />
               love of God and great nature and the hope 
               <br />
               that others would follow. I do not care What 
               <br />
               you say about the hierarchy, they have done 
               <br />
               noble work; they have done a lot of good 
               <br />
               in these very Territories which we are now 
               <br />
               about to erect into provinces. We must not 
               <br />
               forget that when the pioneers came in, fol-
