               be right on the boundary, he is going to 
               <br />

               <br />
               from the boundary. I suppose the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               ‘leman is taking the precaution to place 
               <br />
               this fence on the south side of the line, on 
               <br />
               the south side of the Canadian boundary, 
               <br />
               because if he places it on our side, he will 
               <br />
               run the risk of giving 100 feet of land along 
               <br />
               800 miles in length to our neighbours to the 
               <br />
               south for all time to come. Everybody 
               <br />
               knows that when a piece of land is outfenc- 
               <br />
               ed for some years, it becomes the property 
               <br />
               of the man whose land it adjoins outside the 
               <br />
               fence. The very ﬁrst principles of fence 
               <br />
               building are to notify the neighbour that a 
               <br />
               line fence is about to be built, if it is not a 
               <br />

               <br />
               what is the reason of this government 
               <br />
               building a fence 800 miles long for the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of private property ?—Because that 
               <br />
               is practically what it amounts to.

               <br />
               private property. It is supposed to be for the 
               <br />
               protection of the boundary line. If it is only 
               <br />
               to keep off cattle why should these gentlemen

               tories have to build their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fencing“!</span> 
               <br />
               There is no system of reasoning by which it 
               <br />
               can be justiﬁed other than as an inter- 
               <br />
               national boundary line, and I say that al- 
               <br />
               though the danger may appear small to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hem</span> gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposite</span> there is never- 
               <br />
               theless the danger of international trouble. 
               <br />
               We know what boundary lines are. 
               <br />
               We had a question of this kind up 
               <br />
               in Alaska only recently and we know how 
               <br />
               quickly the country is aroused when it is 
               <br />
               asked to part with one foot of territory 
               <br />
               that it thinks belongs to it. The ﬁrst prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of fence building is to establish the 
               <br />
               line correctly between the neighbours whose 
               <br />
               property is being divided, and this being 
               <br />
               upon the international boundary it becomes 
               <br />
               still more important to do this. Therefore, 
               <br />
               I trust that the right hon. First Minister will 
               <br />
               not treat this as a light matter. I think the 
               <br />
               very ﬁrst thing that should be done is to 
               <br />
               notify our neighbours that this line is about 
               <br />
               to be established and let them become parties 
               <br />
               to the erection of this fence, because other- 
               <br />
               wise, you may have the fence torn down and 
               <br />
               be told that it is not on the line. I think 
               <br />
               the matter should be very carefully gone 
               <br />
               into before this imaginary line, as this fence 
               <br />
               will be, is placed between the United States 
               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, I would like to call the atten- _ 
               <br />
               tion of the hon. Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver) to some information which has just 
               <br />
               come into my hands. It never rains but it 
               <br />
               pours and this is one of the little showers 
               <br />
               after the larger one. What I want is to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               out whether the information is correct or 
               <br />
               not. The information is that shortly after 
               <br />
               the government took power a gentleman by 
               <br />
               the name of Nixon, an ardent Liberal, a 
               <br />
               shoemaker, was appointed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">land</span> agent in or 
               <br />
               near Macleod. He performed the duties of 
               <br />
               his ofﬁce for some time and it is stated that 
               <br />
               moneys which ought to have reached their 
               <br />
               proper destination did not. Thereupon a 
               <br />
               celebrated and somewhat notorious gentle- 
               <br />
               man from Manitoba by the name of 
               <br />
               Leech was sent to investigate and it 
               <br />
               turned out that there was a defal- 
               <br />
               cation to the amount of $600. My in- 
               <br />
               formation then goes on to say that Mr. Nixon 
               <br />
               discreetly resigned before the investigation 
               <br />
               was brought to a completion and that the
