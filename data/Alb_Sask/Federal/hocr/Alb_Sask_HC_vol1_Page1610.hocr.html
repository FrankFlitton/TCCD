               Prime Minister has suggested that we ought 
               <br />
               to try to go into this question with what he 
               <br />
               calls an open mind. Now, I have endeavour- 
               <br />
               cd., with the ﬁgures given to us by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, to make up my mind as to whether 
               <br />
               the division proposed by the government is 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂair</span> one or not. This is a very grave and 
               <br />
               important question. We are forming two 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">new</span> provinces in the Northwest, which are 
               <br />
               practically the wards of this Dominion, 
               <br />
               and I am sure‘ that my hon. friend the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, if he had two wards of his own, 
               <br />
               would try to clear up everything before he 
               <br />
               launched them on life on their own account. 
               <br />
               He wOuld not leave them in such a position 
               <br />
               that when they came of age they would be 
               <br />
               sure immediately to have trouble before they 
               <br />
               learned to take care of themselves. Our 
               <br />
               object should be to avoid friction—to avoid 
               <br />
               causing to any portion of the people ot“ these 
               <br />
               provinces a feeling of injustice, which they 
               <br />
               may spend their ﬁrst session, and perhaps 
               <br />
               their ﬁrst years, in trying to rectify. They 
               <br />
               will have their hands full taking care of 
               <br />
               their own family affairs. trying to set their 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house</span> in order and get started on the busi- 
               <br />
               ness of life; and they should not have thrust 
               <br />
               upon them any trouble of this kind. I do 
               <br />
               not see that this is a question of Dominion 
               <br />
               politics at all. It seems to me that all we 
               <br />
               ought'to try to do is to have this ﬁrst elec- 
               <br />
               tion in the province of Alberta conducted in 
               <br />
               as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fair</span> and equitable a way as possible, so 
               <br />
               that every man entitled to vote shall have 
               <br />
               just as much to say about forming the new 
               <br />
               government as any other man in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince. Surely a quesﬁon of this kind is 
               <br />
               above party politics. Surely we can lay 
               <br />
               aside all feelings of partisanship, and try 
               <br />
               to ensure to every man in the new province 
               <br />
               fair—play. I for one do not think the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister of this country would lend himself 
               <br />
               and the strength of the great Liberal party 
               <br />
               behind him in helping any section of people - 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> the new province of Alberta to control 
               <br />
               that province. The question of the location 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the capital of the province will probably 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">br</span> settled by the ﬁrst election: and I do 
               <br />
               not think this government should lend their 
               <br />
               inﬂuence either to help the people of the 
               <br />
               north to establish the capital permanently 
               <br />
