               not very far from Ottawa, for the last twelve

               <br />
               ’in. all that time the Protestant children have

               very creditable. But, I am now dealing 
               <br />
               with this question. We will suppose that 
               <br />
               in the Northwest they have a public school 
               <br />
               that every Protestant child has a right to 
               <br />
               attend without any interference with his 
               <br />
               religion and without any teaching of relig- 
               <br />
               ious dogma. Suppose that this school to 
               <br />
               which I have referred at L’Orignal had been 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories and that these 
               <br />
               trustees who were Roman Catholics had 
               <br />
               declared that nothing but the dogma of the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic church should be taught 
               <br />
               there; what would the rights of the Protes- 
               <br />
               tant child be in the school? The school 
               <br />
               would be converted practically into a sep- 
               <br />
