               throughout the country and my impression

               is that he was sadly deceived and that he 
               <br />
               made a report along that line. He had been 
               <br />

               cing Manitoba. If my hon. friend had been 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec in 1896, he would 
               <br />
               not have heard such language as that used 
               <br />
               by his friends. They never spoke about 
               <br />
               coercion in Quebec. I would ask my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) if it is 
               <br />
               a matter of rendering justice where justice 
               <br />
               is due, he would refrain from what some 
               <br />
               people call coercion, but what my hon. friend 
               <br />
               and myself would call an act of justice. It 
               <br />
               is an operation. It is sometimes painful to 
               <br />
               perform an operation, but you have to do 
               <br />
               it so as to save the body. 
               <br />

               Mr. BOURASSA. I will give him my 
               <br />
               reply. The position I took in 1896 in my 
               <br />
               election was this, and I am just as much a 
               <br />
               friend of the minority in Manitoba as I was 
               <br />
               then. I am just as convinced as my hon. 
               <br />
               friend is that the minority in Manitoba 
               <br />
               does not enjoy that to which it is entitled, 
               <br />
               but what I said in 1896, and what I still say, 
               <br />
               is that the manner in which the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive party had played with the Manitoba 
               <br />
               school question for ten years had made it 
               <br />
               perfectly impossible to expect anything 
               <br />
               from the application of the Remedial Bill 
               <br />
               passed by this parliament, and that, as did 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend the Prime Minister, I 
               <br />
               expected more from the policy of concilia-
