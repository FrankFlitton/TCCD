               Sir, we have taken the ground on more 
               <br />
               than one occasion, we again take this 
               <br />
               ground and it is the ground upon which 
               <br />
               we stand in dealing with the present case, 
               <br />
               that wherever a system of separate schools 
               <br />
               exists that system comes into force and 
               <br />
               is constitutionally entitled to the guaran— 
               <br />
               tees which are embodied in section 93 of

               position we take, and when we introduced 
               <br />
               section 16, as it is in the Bill, we had no 
               <br />
               other intention than to give to the minority 
               <br />
               the rights and privileges to which they are 
               <br />

               But, Sir, it has been objected to us that 
               <br />
               the language used in section 16 was too 
               <br />
               broad, too vague, and that it” it were adopt— 
               <br />
               ed, it would create trouble and confusion 
               <br />
               instead of certainty as to the rights of the 
               <br />
               minority. By the ﬁrst paragraph of sec— 
               <br />
               tion 16 as it stands in the Bill, the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 is reproduced in toto. But Sir, an 
               <br />
               event occurred some 14 or 15 years ago 
               <br />
               which has to some extent limited that Act. 
               <br />
               Some 14 years ago the legislature of the 
               <br />
               Territories passed a law which in the opin— 
               <br />
               ion of the minority abridged the rights con- 
               <br />
               ferred on them by the Act of 1875. They 
               <br />
               complained to the federal government 
               <br />
               at Ottawa. They made representa- 
               <br />
               tions to the government of that day 
               <br />
               and asked the disallowance of that 
               <br />
               law as an infringement upon their 
               <br />
               privileges as secured to them by the law 
               <br />
               of 1875. Sir John Thompson, who was then 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice, examined the question 
               <br />
               and refused to disallow the Act. He ad— 
               <br />
               mitted rather, that the Act was an infringe- 
               <br />
               ment on the privileges conveyed to the min- 
               <br />
               ority, but he stated that as this was a con- 
               <br />
               sequence, only following a similar Act, or 
               <br />
               rather continuing a similar Act passed some 
               <br />
               three or four years before, as to which no 
               <br />
               complaint had been made, and which was 
               <br />
               therefore in force, .he would not advise 
               <br />
               disallowance and he allowed the Act to go 
               <br />
               into force. Under such circumstances the 
               <br />
               law of the Territories has been in force now 
               <br />
               for 13 or 14-years. Section 16 thus re- 
               <br />
               stricted is now the law of the country 
               <br />
               which has been in force for 13 or 14 years 
               <br />
               and which has given general satisfaction. 
               <br />
               Under such circumstances it we were to re- 
               <br />
               enact section 93 of the Act, it was possible 
               <br />
               that we would create confusion and that 
               <br />
               there would be lawsuits to determine the 
               <br />
               exact condition of the law. We there- 
               <br />
               fore thought it was preferable to have 
               <br />
               the law made absolutely certain and 
               <br />
               in order to do that we have incor- 
               <br />
               porated the ordinances under which 
               <br />
               the law as it is to-day has been established. 
               <br />
               It may be disappointing .to some, but we be- 
               <br />
               lieve that on the whole it is preferable to 
               <br />
               have a clear understanding on this subject 
               <br />
               so that the minority shall have the pri-

               tion. That is the reason why we have 
               <br />
               done this. The law of the Territories on 
               <br />
               this question is established in three ordin- 
               <br />
               ances, chapter 29 of 1901, chapter 30 of 1901, 
               <br />
               and chapter 31 of 1901. Chapter 29 organ-

               ized a system of schools and this organiza-

               ter 30 regulates the power of assessments 
               <br />
               over the municipalities for contributions 
               <br />

               <br />
               We have introduced into the amendment 
               <br />
               chapter 29 and chapter 30; we have not in- 
               <br />
               troduced chapter 31 which regulates the 
               <br />
               aid and grants to be given to schools be- 
               <br />
               cause we have thought it preferable simply 
               <br />
               to lay down the principle, putting no burd- 
               <br />
               en upon the Territories, not saying how 
               <br />
               they are to dispose of their money, not tel- 
               <br />
               ling them what they shall do but simply 
               <br />
               stating that when schools conform to the 
               <br />
               law, whether they are separate schools or 
               <br />
               public schools, all shall be treated equally 
               <br />
               and there shall be no discrimination be- 
               <br />

               Let me say one last word. We have done

               pretty well so far in the development of 
               <br />

               <br />
               yet reached the maximum; we have not 
               <br />
               yet reached the end. We may have a great 
               <br />
               deal still to do and I hold that we ought 
               <br />
               always to be ready for the task, and I am 
               <br />
               sure that it will not be too much to say that 
               <br />
               it will not injure any one, that it will not do

               any harm but on the contrary will do much
