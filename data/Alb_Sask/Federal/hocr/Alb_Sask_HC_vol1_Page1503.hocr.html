               I can hardly understand the argument

               of my right hon. friend when he suggests 
               <br />
               that a solemn promise of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> character is 
               <br />
               likely to create confusion. It seems to me

               that the carrying out .of a solemn pro-

               mise, if it is as distinct and explicit as has 
               <br />
               been suggested, could not possibly cause 
               <br />
               any confusion.

               The Prime Minister is easily answered. 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst place the Act of 1875 could not 
               <br />
               be restricted by an ordinance. I take issue 
               <br />
               with him there, and I base my argument 
               <br />
               in that regard upon very good authority, 
               <br />
               namely, the authority in the ﬁrst place of 
               <br />
               'Sir John Thompson himself, and in the 
               <br />
               second place that of the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               ticc of to-day. Sir John Thompson, in 
               <br />
               dealing with this question in his report 
               <br />
               of the 10th January, 1890, said this: 
               <br />

               The ordinance respecting schools does not 
               <br />
               contain the provision that the statute requires 
               <br />
               it to contain, but merely contains the provision 
               <br />
               that the minority may establish a separate 
               <br />
               school in an organized public school district, 
               <br />
               thus placing the minority at the mercy of the 
               <br />
               majority, and only giving the minority the right 
               <br />
               to establish a separate school, if the majority 
               <br />
               think proper to organize a public school. It is 
               <br />
               necessary to point out that the provisions of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories Act, before cited, can- 
               <br />
               not be abridged by the ordinance and must be 
               <br />
               considered as still in force, notwithstanding the 
               <br />
               restrictive terms of the ordinance. In so far
