            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. EMMERSON. This Bill as intro- 
               <br />
               duced contained one clause. The Railway 
               <br />
               Committee added a second clause permitting 
               <br />
               the directors to appoint a managing com- 
               <br />
               mittee of three. The Bill as introduced 
               <br />
               exempted this company from the provisions 
               <br />
               of section 5 of chapter 32 of the statute! 
               <br />
               of 1904. At that time it was the settled 
               <br />
               policy of parliament that all companies re— 
               <br />
               ceiving state aid in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">|Canada</span> should have 
               <br />
               only British subjects as the majority of 
               <br />
               boards of directors; and there was con- 
               <br />
               siderable feeling expressed by members 
               <br />
               on both sides of politics that Canada could 
               <br />
               not permit aliens to have control of any 
               <br />
               of her railways. It was further alleged 
               <br />
               that our neighbours to the south had adopted 
               <br />
               a similar policy, because no 'ailway corpor- 
               <br />
               ation in the United States can have on its 
               <br />
               board of directors any man who is not an 
               <br />
               American citizen. This being the policy of 
               <br />
               this country, it seems to me that it would 
               <br />
               be unwise to make any exception. If we 
               <br />
               establish a precedent by permitting this 
               <br />
               company to depart from the law, there is 
               <br />
               no doubt that parliament will be assailed 
               <br />
               day after day on behalf of other railway 
               <br />
               companies to grant them a special provision 
               <br />
               of a like character. When this ﬁrst clause 
               <br />
               is reached, unless it is withdrawn by those 
               <br />
               who are promoting the Bill, it will be my 
               <br />
               duty to move that it be stricken out. There 
               <br />
               can be no objection, however, to the second 
               <br />
               clause. I need not enter into a discussion 
               <br />
               as to the wisdom of this policy; it is the 
               <br />
               policy of this country, and we must observe 
               <br />
