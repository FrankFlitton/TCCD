               volved neither more nor less than a direct

               <br />
               they have been stated, viz: That, while the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />
               was afraid to take the dictum of the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories .in the election 
               <br />
               of 1904 upon the question, while he con- 
               <br />
               cealed the real issue from them, refusing to 
               <br />
               consult their representative, while he was 
               <br />
               quiet on the question until they had a 
               <br />
               larger representation in this House, while 
               <br />
               he did not consult the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior (Mr. Sifton), though the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior says he knew about all the 
               <br />
               other provisions of the Bill, while he did not 
               <br />
               consult the other representatives in this 
               <br />
               House from that territory and did not con— 
               <br />
               sult the delegation, we ﬁnd—and I regret to 
               <br />
               say it—that the right hon. gentleman con— 
               <br />
               sulted and conferred with, and submitted 
               <br />
               these clauses to the ablegate of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholichierarchy whose power was to be 
               <br />
               affected by the clauses of this Bill. Now 
               <br />
               that fact being proven, it“ being proven 
               <br />
               beyond contradiction, because the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman does not deny it, then I say we 
               <br />
               are face to face with a crisis. We are face to 
               <br />
               face with a state of things which is not 
               <br />
               tolerable, and which the people of Canada 
               <br />
               will not tolerate, and are not tolerating to- 
               <br />
               day. It is all very well. for hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite to rise and cry, peace, and tolera- 
               <br />
               ation, and moderation of speech, when 
               <br />
               their leader has himself thrown down the 
               <br />
               gauntlet which has aroused somuch passion 
               <br />

               question of religious instruction in the 
               <br />

               gentlemen can cry, peace, peace, when there 
               <br />

               Liberals—it is said by that type of renegade

               Liberals who supported the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               in 1896 and who trusted his word, that he 
               <br />
               obtained power then by false pretences; it 
               <br />
               is said by them that he advocated certain

               principles upon Which he obtained power, 
               <br />
               and that now, on the very ﬁrst opportunity 
               <br />
               given him to show that his opinions were 
               <br />
               genuine and his convictions steadfast, he 
               <br />
               has gone back on them all, and has intro- 
               <br />
               duced a measure containing a clause which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lis</span> absolutely opposed to all the principles

               <br />
               has cast to the winds the principles which 
               <br />
               he then clamored for so earnestly in order 
               <br />
               to obtain power. Every day that this clause 
               <br />
               is insisted upon, a clause which will un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly fasten upon the Northwest pro- 
               <br />
               vinces a distasteful system of education 
               <br />
               every day does he depart from and abjure 
               <br />
               the principles which he advocated in the 
               <br />
               House and on the hustings in 1895 and 1896. 
               <br />
               What is the secret of this passion and pre- 
               <br />
               judice that is raised by this question ? It 
               <br />
               comes from the fact that there has been, as 
               <br />
               the people of this country believe, a betrayal 
               <br />
               of trust in regard to this same principle. 
               <br />
               Had the leader of the government been true 
               <br />
               to those professions, he would have left 
               <br />
               the matter of education entirely to the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces themselves, and have allowed them to 
               <br />
               establish such a system as they think best 
               <br />
               suited to their circumstances. But instead 
               <br />
               of that he has chosen rather to bring a 
               <br />
               sword, and with the ﬁrst blow of the sword 
               <br />
               he lops off everything he contended for in' 
               <br />
               1896. If there has been an interference 
               <br />
               with the prerogatives of this parliament by 
               <br />
               the representative of any church, I care not 
               <br />
               which church, even though it were my own 
               <br />
               church—if there has been an interference 
               <br />
               and a combination between the representa-

               tive of the state and the representative of a 
               <br />
               church, then I say it is time for the people 
               <br />
               of Canada to become alive to the situation. 
               <br />
               It ill becomes hon. gentlemen opposite to

               say that we should be calm, that we should

               be tolerant, that we should allay excitement,
