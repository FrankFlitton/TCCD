               mental principles of the common law and we

               have extended to aliens various privileges in

               <br />
               portions of the empire. The other provinces 
               <br />

               <br />
               province of Ontario in this respect, but when 
               <br />

               of a board of directors, the majority of whom 
               <br />
               are British subjects, I say we come to a situ- 
               <br />
               ation in which this House should stand by the 
               <br />
               general principle of the legislation adopted 
               <br />
               a year ago. While I listened to the eloquent 
               <br />
               words of my hon. friend from Norfolk (Mr. 
               <br />
               Tisdale) I am bound to say that his logic 
               <br />
               did not commend itself to me. It is true 
               <br />
               that we have a great country and that we 
               <br />
               are realizing to—day, perhaps, more than ever 
               <br />
               before the possibilities of Canada. This is true 
               <br />
               notwithstanding the fact that we are turning 
               <br />
               aside from the realization of those possibili- 
               <br />
               ties and taking up our time with the con- 
               <br />
               sideration of questions which will not con- 
               <br />
               duce to the prosperity of this country. It is 
               <br />
               true that we occupy more time with such 
               <br />
               questions than we should, but if we realize, 
               <br />
               as I believe We all, on both sides of this 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. SPROULE. We may very reasonably 
               <br />
               ask what object parliament had in view in 
               <br />
               passing the law. It was to get more effec- 
               <br />
               tive control over the railways. We required 
               <br />
               not only more effective control over the rail- 
               <br />
               ways into which the state had not put any 
               <br />
               money, but it was doubly necessary that we 
               <br />
               should have control over railways into whicn 
               <br />
               the state had put money. This is one of the 
               <br />
               roads of which the state paid a share of the 
               <br />
               cost and if there is any road in the country 
               <br />
               that the state ought to have a proper control 
               <br />
               over it is the road which the state helps to 
               <br />
               build. That is the case in this instance. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Stormont (Mr. Pringle) 
               <br />
               says that this is an exceptional case. What 
               <br />
               is exceptional about it? Nothing at all. 
               <br />
               These people came and got a charter, as 
               <br />
               soon as they got the charter they wanted 
               <br />
               government aid and the government gave 
               <br />
               them aid and assisted in building the rail- 
               <br />
               way. There is nothing exceptional in the 
               <br />
               situation from what we can ﬁnd all over the 
               <br />
               country. We have companies that are stand- 
               <br />
               ing on exactly the same footing and in the 
               <br />
               same relationship to Canada and we have 
               <br />
               made this law apply to the whole of them. 
               <br />
               If it applied to other companies under simi- 
               <br />
               lar <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances</span> what justiﬁcation is there 
               <br />
               for saying that it shall not apply to this one ? 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from Jacques Cartier (Mr. 
               <br />
               Monk) rather amused me. He said you 
               <br />
               might as well give it to them because it is so 
               <br />
               easy to get over the law. If it is so easy 
               <br />
               to get over the law why should we give it 
               <br />
               to them ? If they can get over the law with- 
               <br />
               out any trouble there is no object in making 
               <br />
               the exception which they ask. Therefore, I 
               <br />
               say that is an argument in favour or retain- 
               <br />
               ing the law as it is.
