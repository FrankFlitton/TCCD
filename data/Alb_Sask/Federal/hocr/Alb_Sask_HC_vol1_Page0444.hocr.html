               gentleman (Mr. W. J. Roche) tells us that

               they have ﬁled claims with this govern-

               ment to be considered in the division of 
               <br />
               this territory. Therefore, this important 
               <br />
               statute clearly comes into operation here

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, my hon. friend (Mr. W. J. Roche) 
               <br />
               has gone further, to deal with land policy. 
               <br />
               He ﬁnds fault with the government— 
               <br />
               and, consequently with all Conservative gov— 
               <br />
               ernments that have existed in this country 
               <br />
               up to the present time—because they bor- 
               <br />
               rowed their land policy from the United 
               <br />
               States. I do not think it makes much dif- 
               <br />
               ference whence we get a policy, so long 
               <br />
               as it is a good policy. If any rule of life 
               <br />
               that we follow is a good one, it is not wise 
               <br />
               for us to cast <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aside</span> or neglect it because it 
               <br />
               happens to be in use in the United States. 
               <br />
               I do not think that any hon. gentleman in 
               <br />
               this House will say that the land policy of 
               <br />
               the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">states</span> has not been a success so 
               <br />
               far as immigration is concerned, or so far as 
               <br />
               development is concerned so far as attract- 
               <br />
               ing the people is concerned and their suc- 
               <br />
               cess after they have gone to the United 
               <br />
               States. I think we would be only too glad 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> we could get as many people into our 
               <br />

               <br />
               getting through the land policy they have. 
               <br />
               Now, it has been pointed out that the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces would do better in the handling of 
               <br />

               the change should be consulted, that there 
               <br />
               should be legislation upon the subject, and 
               <br />
               it is only by concurrent legislation on the 
               <br />
               part of each government that they can deal 
               <br />
               with it effectively. The question would not 
               <br />
               be settled if we were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst‘to</span> start out to 
               <br />
               deal with it effectively. The question would 
               <br />
               not be settled if we were ﬁrst to start out 
               <br />
               to deal with it without the consent of the 
               <br />
               others, and Without that consent being ob- 
               <br />
               tained according to the statute. Although I 
               <br />
               may not be correct according to the very let- 
               <br />
               ter of the law, I am certainly not so far 
               <br />
               wrong as to justify the member from Mar- 
               <br />
               quette (Mr. W. J. Roche) in saying that we 
               <br />
               are violating the constitution and doing a 
               <br />
               whole lot of wrong things because we did 
               <br />
               not deal with this question the right way. 
               <br />
               Now I think those two points as to Whe- 
               <br />
               ther it is the duty of the government to deal 
               <br />
               with this question as a public policy for the 
               <br />
               whole country, or whether it is better to
