               <br />
               settlement of these mighty areas in the west. 
               <br />
               Surely such large questions as these, the

               conditions under which these new provinces

               shall enter the union, will be well pondered 
               <br />
               and considered. However, one topic alone

               to the exclusion of other topics in my

               be monopolizing the attention both 'of

               conclude and rightly conclude that those

               as unimportant. I do not wish to be taken to

               <br />
               that the premier of these territories has said
