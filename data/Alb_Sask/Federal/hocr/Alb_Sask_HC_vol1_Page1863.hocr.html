               several <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span> members in this debate and in 
               <br />
               calling the attention of the government and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> the committee to it, I recall the language 
               <br />
               of the Prime Minister yesterday when he 
               <br />
               said that if the language of this section now 
               <br />
               under discussion was not sufﬁcient to carry 
               <br />
               out the object which the government had in 
               <br />
               view he Would be prepared to consider any 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasonable</span> amendment to it. The object 
               <br />
               which the government has in View by this 
               <br />
               clause as stated yesterday by the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister and as stated a few moments ago by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Inland Revenue is to carry 
               <br />
               into effect the very excellent school system 
               <br />
               now in force in the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               That school system was established in 1892 
               <br />
               by the ordinance of that year. Since 1892 
               <br />
               when it was established it has worked very 
               <br />
               satisfactorily to the people of the west and 
               <br />
               the object of the government as I under- 
               <br />
               stand is to perpetuate that system and con- 
               <br />
               tinue it in the new province of Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               and Alberta. The principle of the system 
               <br />
               contained in the ordinances is two-fold. In 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place it secures to the local govern- 
               <br />
               ment the absolute control and jurisdiction 
               <br />
               _ over secular education in the Northwest Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories. ‘In the second place it leaves 
               <br />
               the religious instruction absolutely in 
               <br />
               the control of the trustees of the school 
               <br />
               districts. Under that system as estab- 
               <br />
               lished by the ordinances from 9 a.m. 
               <br />
               until 3.30 p.m., the school system is absolu- 
               <br />
               tely under the control and jurisdiction of the 
               <br />
               local government and the instruction given 
               <br />
               in the schools, publicand separate alike is 
               <br />
               purely secular instruction. From 3.30 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pam.</span> 
               <br />
               until 4 o’clock p.m. religious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instruction</span> may 
               <br />
               be given, if desired by the trustees. The rea— 
               <br />
               son for that two fold principle is the system 
               <br />
               established by the ordinance is, that secular 
               <br />
               education being a national affair ought to be

               continued. And that is the point to which 
               <br />
               I wish to call the attention of the com- 
               <br />
               mittee and which I would like to have made 
               <br />
               clearer. I want the clause when it is passed 
               <br />
               to be so plain and clear that there will be 
               <br />

               <br />
               that clear and to place it beyond the realm

               of controversy and to make certain that the
