               regards the extension of the boundaries of 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba, I would like to 
               <br />
               say that I think that is a right principle. The 
               <br />
               people of that province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have.been</span> to a large 
               <br />
               extent pioneers in that western country; 
               <br />
               they have been pioneers in reference to 
               <br />
               the government of that western country. 
               <br />
               In that case are they not deserving of some 
               <br />
               rights now ? When the First Minister 
               <br />
               wanted to make two provinces in the North- 
               <br />
               west he seems to have been determined on 
               <br />
               making them so large that even the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Calgary, who lives in that district. 
               <br />
               thinks they are too large and yet he did 
               <br />
               not even consult the Minister of the Inte- 
               <br />
               rior or the Minister of Finance or I believe 
               <br />
               the Minister of Militia, or several other 
               <br />
               ministers. It is impossible, the First Min- 
               <br />
               ister says, to extend the boundaries of 
               <br />
               Manitoba unless he calls into council with 
               <br />
               him the province of Quebec, Ontario and 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. I claim that 
               <br />
               that is not fair to us in Manitoba. I cannot 
               <br />
               understand how it is that the hon. the First 
               <br />
               Minister could occupy as much time as he 
               <br />
               does in replying to straight away questions 
               <br />
               put from this side of the House, and say so 
               <br />
               little. It seemed to me that he absolutely 
               <br />
               failed to give information. I suppose, per- 
               <br />
               haps, that is part of the game and that I 
               <br />
               have not been here long enough to under- 
               <br />
               stand, but I think on some points at least 
               <br />
               we should have the information we asked. 
               <br />
               He said to—day that although this question 
               <br />
               had been before the people for some three 
               <br />
               weeks the only fault found with it was in 
               <br />
               connection with the school clauses. This 
               <br />
               House must remember that the people who 
               <br />
               are most interested in that clause are scat-

               that I do not want to detract from any east-

               <br />
               loyal to the east. Personally, though I have 
               <br />
               been in the west for twenty-four years, 1 
               <br />
               never hear the word ‘Nova Scotia’ spoken 
               <br />
               but it ﬁlls me with pride. And I believe 
               <br />
               that is true of every easterner. Every 
               <br />
               member of this House, I am sure, believes 
               <br />
               that if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> Canada of ours is to be a great 
               <br />
               country like the country to the south of us, 
               <br />
               great in population, in trade and in wealth, 
               <br />
               the resources upon which its progress must 
               <br />
               be based lie west of Lake Superior. We 
               <br />
               have, perhaps, to take some of our lessons 
               <br />
               from the cast, but it We are to become 
               <br />

               <br />
               millions of inhabitants, it must be because 
               <br />
               of the resources of the west. And yet that 
               <br />
               country is deprived of a .man in the 
               <br />
               council to represent our case as it should 
               <br />
               be represented. That is not a condition of 
               <br />
               affairs that ought to exist to—day. I think 
               <br />
               I need not say more on the subject of the 
               <br />
               extension of the boundaries. If I were to 
               <br />
               talk for an hour I could not make myself 
               <br />
               better understood than by the statement 
               <br />
               that I believe it is the right of Manitoba 
               <br />
               to have her boundaries extended. And we 
               <br />
               should have at once a Minister of the In— 
               <br />
               terior, a man who can do our business for us. 
               <br />
               And I would like to make a suggestion— 
               <br />
               well, no ; II have no right to put it that way; 
               <br />
               I would like to submit a request—to the 
               <br />
               First Minister that when he, in his own 
               <br />
               good time, appoints a Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior, he will appoint a man who is res- 
               <br />
               ponsible to the people. We do not want a 
               <br />
               man, however great his ability may be, that 
               <br />
               belongs to some constituency in which he 
               <br />
               is not directly responsible to the people. I 
               <br />
               would like to see some constituency in the 
               <br />
