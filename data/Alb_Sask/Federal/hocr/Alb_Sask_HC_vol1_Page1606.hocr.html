               should be issued forthwith. Therefore. the 
               <br />
               bonds issued from time to time on these 
               <br />
               progress estimates become an absolute obli-

               gation upon the government of Canada; 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnal adjustment. I asked the counsel for the 
               <br />
               company, Mr. Chrysler—who was very fair 
               <br />
               and, so far as ”I can see, desired to give 
               <br />
               every information to the committee—what 
               <br />
               protection was provided in this contract to 
               <br />
               the public against error which might creep 
               <br />
               in in the progress estimates. I asked him 
               <br />
               also whether, under this contract, there was 
               <br />
               a reservation or drawback of a certain per- 
               <br />
               centage on the estimates.for which bonds 
               <br />
               would not be issued. People who are ac- 
               <br />
               quainted with such contracts know that this 
               <br />
               is a very common provision—that 15 or 20 
               <br />
               per cent of the progress estimate is often 
               <br />
               reserved for ﬁnal adjustment. Mr. Chrys- 
               <br />
               ler answered that there was no such provi- 
               <br />
               sion. But he also said that the government 
               <br />
               had the matter in his own hands, and it 
               <br />
               would only guarantee the amount of bonds 
               <br />
               that it considered would be safe. But 
               <br />
               I asked him if there was anything 
               <br />
               in the contract that would entitle the 
               <br />
               government, if, for instance, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$100,000</span> 
               <br />
               was certiﬁed on the progress estimates, 
               <br />
               to issue only $80,000. His answer was: 
               <br />
               No; I take it that the government will do 
               <br />
               just what it thinks necessary in that case. 
               <br />
               And he went on to say that Mr. Schrciber, 
               <br />
               Chief Engineer of’Government Railways, or 
               <br />
               whoever happened to occupy his position, 
               <br />
               would take care to certify for only such an 
               <br />
               amount as would allow full protection to 
               <br />
               the government. But, as I pointed out, 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:Schreiber,</span> on the face of the contract, 
               <br />
               has no right to do anything of that kind. 
               <br />
               That there was no provision in this contract 
               <br />
               for the reservation .of any percentage until 
               <br />
               the ﬁnal adjustment of the account; and it 
               <br />
               the government did reserve part, they would 
               <br />
               be doing something that no private con- 
               <br />
               tractor would have a right to do. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               They would be breaking the contract, but 
               <br />
               Mr. Chrysler said the government is not like 
               <br />
               an ordinary contractor for they can do as 
               <br />
               they please. But that did not seem to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me~</span> a 
               <br />
               very satisfactory explanation. He went on 
               <br />
               to say that Mr. ISchreiber—he only used Mr. 
               <br />
               Schreiber’s name because he was there be- 
               <br />
               fore us—the chief engineer of the govern-

               ment, in issuing his progress certiﬁcates, 
               <br />
               would take care to be Within the mark. 
               <br />
               To that I pointed out that the chief 
               <br />
               engineer is absolutely at the mercy of 
               <br />
               his subordinates. We need not speak of any 
               <br />
               subordinate as dishonest. All of us know 
               <br />
               the young gentlemen who superintend the 
               <br />
               construction of sections of eight and ten 
               <br />
               miles of railway. These young gentlemen 
               <br />
               are very anxious to do right but they make 
               <br />
               a great many mistakes. Mistakes are fre- 
               <br />
               quently made for many thousands of dollars 
               <br />

               the First Minister that that is not business.

               We had an Act of about two or three pages 
               <br />

               <br />
               endeavoured to give the fullest and clearest 
               <br />
               explanation in his power. I am quite sure

               the Minister of Justice wished to have every

               the committee that he was not fully advised. 
               <br />
               I do not think he could possibly have acted 
               <br />
               personally in the matter. It had been en- 
               <br />
               trusted to Mr. Shepley, of Toronto, a very 
               <br />
               able legal gentleman, who gave a written

               <br />
               think his report dealt with these particular 
               <br />
               questions. He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was.</span> satisﬁed at large with

               the terms of the contract ; but it occurred to

               me, in the short discussion we had in the

               in effect altered its terms by providing that
