               agree with my hon. friend that it would be

               a great hardship to require a member to

               My stamp has not been used without my

               rubber stamp of a member had been afﬁxed 
               <br />

               to have contained some business advertise-

               ments or circulars. Many members on both 
               <br />
               sides received complaints from the public

               that this was an abuse of the franking

               and the opinion pretty generally expressed 
               <br />
               that the use of a rubber stamp was open 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> abuse and should be discontinued. I

               way of getting over the difﬁculty without 
               <br />
               running the risk of any abuse. Of course, 
               <br />
               stamps are used at present. They are used 
               <br />
               in the departments by ministers and deputy 
               <br />
               ministers, and I presume they are employed 
               <br />
               without any abuse. In that case there 
               <br />
               is the routine of the department to prevent 
               <br />
               abuse, but if we insist on a member in-

               itialling every document he sends out—such

               documents, for instance, as his own speeches 
               <br />
               to his constituents—that will entail on him 
               <br />
               considerable labour. I would suggest that 
               <br />
               in cases of that kind, the rubber stamp 
               <br />
               might be used provided the member himself

               have this Bill introduced. I looked into 
               <br />
               the circumstances attending the case, when 
               <br />
               they were ﬁrst brought to my notice at 
               <br />
               the commencement of this parliament, and 
               <br />
               I was rather impressed with the view that 
               <br />
               the case of the hon. gentleman did not 
               <br />
               come within the terms of the statute refer-

               <br />
               question about that, I think this is a very

               proper Bill to pass. It might perhaps be 
               <br />
               worth while to make some little amendment

               in the general law governing triﬂing cases 
               <br />

               any particular connection between the ln-

               hon. friend as to the necessity of amend- 
               <br />
               ing the law so as to avoid any repetition 
               <br />
               of such cases. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">After</span> all, this is a very triﬂ— 
               <br />
               ing technical breach of the law, and it is 
               <br />
               hardly fair that a member of parliament, 
               <br />
               who has committed it, should be obliged to 
               <br />
               go through this formality. It has occurred 
               <br />
               to me that it would be well also to amend 
               <br />
               this Bill so as to provide that the disquali- 
               <br />
               ﬁcation shall cease. That is not made clear 
               <br />
               in the Bill. I move therefore that the fol- 
               <br />
               lowing words be added after the word 
               <br />
