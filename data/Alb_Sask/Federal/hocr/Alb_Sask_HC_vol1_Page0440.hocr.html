               what becomes of his contention that the

               Canada. The hon. gentleman was also inac- 
               <br />
               curate when he said that the draft Bill of 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain contained provisions that would 
               <br />
               have perpetuated ecclesiastical schools. Well, 
               <br />
               the framer of that draft Bill does not agree 
               <br />
               with the hon. member for West Assiniboia. 
               <br />
               The framer of that draft Bill meant that 
               <br />
               the British North America Act should apply 
               <br />
               which gives sole control to the provinces 
               <br />
               over educational affairs. When the hon. 
               <br />
               member (Mr. Scott), in order to suit his own 
               <br />
               party purposes, desires to read into that 
               <br />
               draft Bil-l a meaning that the framers of the 
               <br />
               Bill never intended it should have, he is 
               <br />
               taking a stand which he cannot maintain for 
               <br />
               one moment. Of course he is privileged to 
               <br />
               read into the draft Bill any ignorant mean— 
               <br />
               ing he may desire, but his doing so will not 
               <br />
               change the true intent of those who framed 
               <br />
               that clause. That clause was drafted, as I 
               <br />
               understand, under the guidance and direc- 
               <br />
               tion of the premier of the Territories, and 
               <br />
               of the present Chief Justice Sifton and his 
               <br />
               then deputy, the present Judge Harvey. 
               <br />
               These gentlemen decided that the clause 
               <br />
               should be drafted so that the provinces 
               <br />
               should have absolute control over their edu— 
               <br />
               c-artional affairs, and Mr. Haultain so inter- 
               <br />
               prets the clause to—day, and indeed it is 
               <br />
               the only sane interpretation it will bear. I 
               <br />
               do not wish to discuss this from a legal 
               <br />
               point of view, although my lay opinion might 
               <br />
               be equally as good as that of the member 
               <br />
               for West Assiniboia ; I simply give you the 
               <br />
               opinion of the leader of the Territorial Ex- 
               <br />
               ecutive on the matter, who says that this 
               <br />
               draft Bill was framed in accordance with 
               <br />
               the desire of the people of the Territories 
               <br />
               to control their own educational affairs, and 
               <br />
               that it was sent down to the Ottawa gov- 
               <br />
               ernment with that object in view. And, 
               <br />
               Sir, if that draft Bill had the meaning which 
               <br />
               the member for West Assiniboia attaches to 
               <br />
               it, how is it that the right hon. the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, astute as he is. and now is it that 
               <br />
               the lynx—eyed Postmaster General did not 
               <br />
               discover such a meaning? They are both 
               <br />
               legal gentlemen learned in the law, and yet 
               <br />
               it remained for the layman from West Ass-i— 
               <br />
               niboia to read into the Territorial draft Bill 
               <br />
               a meaning that the Prime Minister of Can- 
               <br />
               ada and the Postmaster General failed to 
               <br />
               see. The member for West Assiniboia has 
               <br />
               stated that it he were one of the minority he 
               <br />
               would never consent to taking out of this 
               <br />
               Bill the guarantee of separate schools. 
               <br />
               In one breath the hon. gentleman states: 
               <br />
               We have practically no separate schools up

               from that taken by the hon. Minister of 
               <br />

               states that if this Bill becomes law the

               separate schools, the few there are, will dis-

               that is the impression made on this House..

               cut out then the only vestige of separate 
               <br />
               schools which they have will disappear and

               that in the not distant future. The hon.

               gentleman has quoted very extensively from 
               <br />
               some comments made in the press in the

               the members of this House that the people

               <br />
               as it is presented to this House. There are

               The west has had a. rude awakening. Until 
               <br />
               a few days ago everybody believed the Act 
               <br />
               creating two provinces here would not interfere 
               <br />
               with the school question, but Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier’s government has added a clause to 
               <br />
               the Bill which, if not promptly withdrawn, will 
               <br />
               raise such a. storm in the Territories that may 
               <br />
               take years to subside. The best the west will 
               <br />
               get out of it will not compensate for the fear- 
               <br />
               ful disturbance it will occasion. . . . New
