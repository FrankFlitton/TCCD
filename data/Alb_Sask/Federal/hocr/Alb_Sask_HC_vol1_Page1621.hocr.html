               <br />
               there was an examination of teachers in 
               <br />
               various parts of the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               In the town of Strathcona 29 teachers were 
               <br />
               examined and got certiﬁcates, and in the 
               <br />
               city of Edmonton 25, making a total of 54. 
               <br />
               In the city of Calgary there were 9 teachers 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">granted</span> certiﬁcates and in the town of Leth- 
               <br />
               bridge 7, making a tobal of 16. At Red Deer, 
               <br />
               which I have not counted as either north or 
               <br />
               south, there were 9 teachers who received 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ctrtiﬁcates.</span> In 1903 we had examinations 
               <br />
               held in some other places. In Strathcona town 
               <br />
               there were 19 teachers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">examined</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grant-</span> 
               <br />
               ed certiﬁcates, in Edmonton 22 and in the 
               <br />
               town of Lacombe 8, making a total of 49. 
               <br />
               In the south we had in Medicine Hat 9, 
               <br />
               Lethbridge 6 and Calgary 30, making a 
               <br />
               total of 45. Then again we had teachers‘ 
               <br />
               conventions held in several towns in the 
               <br />
               Northwest in the year 1902. There was a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">teachers”</span> convention held in Calgary and 30 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">teachers</span> attended. There was a teachers’ 
               <br />
               convention held at Red Deer, which is locat- 
               <br />
               ed about centrally between the two, and 
               <br />
               there were 31 teachers present. There was a 
               <br />
               teachers’ convention at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aStrathcona</span> and there 
               <br />
               were 98 teachers present. Next year the 
               <br />
               teachers held conventions in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ‘ferent</span> ‘places. 
               <br />
               At Lethbridge, in 1903, there were 19 teach- 
               <br />
               ers present, Banff 23, Calgary 49, Innisfañ 
               <br />
               14. making a total of 105 teachers attending 
               <br />
               conventions south of Red Deer. In Red Deer 
               <br />
               alone there were 18. But leaving that out, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> it is a central point, I will say that at 
               <br />
               the town of Lacombe there were 24 and at 
               <br />
               Edmonton 94, making a total of 118 teach- 
               <br />
               ers attending conventions north of Red 
               <br />
               Deer as against 105 attending south of Red 
               <br />
               Deer. There is no doubt we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have,</span> more 
               <br />
               teachers north of Red Deer than to the 
               <br />
               south. Yesterday, last night and again to- 
               <br />
               day, I think on ﬁve or six occasions, speak- 
               <br />
               ers on the other side have held out to us 
               <br />
               as a model division that which was made 
               <br />
               by the local legislature of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories in 1902, and I want to show to 
               <br />
               the hon. members opposite especially what 
               <br />
               kind of a distribution that was, and to ask 
               <br />
               them if they think it was a fair one. In 
               <br />
               1902, just before the election—the election 
               <br />
               was held in ’May, 1902, and it was in April 
               <br />
               that this distribution was made—there were 
               <br />
               (:. constituencies north of the town of Red 
               <br />
               Deer, 8 constituencies in the old district of 
               <br />
               Alberta, and since has been added the Medi- 
               <br />
               cine Hat district, making 9 constituencies 
               <br />
               south—6 constituencies north of Red Deer 
               <br />
               and 9 constituencies south of Red Deer. 
               <br />
               Now, I want to give you the vote that 
               <br />
               was polled at the election Immediately <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a‘fd</span> 
               <br />
               ter that. In the‘ districts north of Red 
               <br />
               Deer, Lacombe had 871 votes; Strathcon—a— 
               <br />
               645 votes; St. Albert 695 votes; Victoria 641 
               <br />
               votes : Edmonton 801 votes. In Wetaskiwin, 
               <br />
               one of the largest and most thickly settled 
               <br />
               districts in the Northwest, the member was 
               <br />
               elected by acclamation and there was no 
               <br />
               vote, but the vote there would certainly be 
               <br />

               the same as Lacombe; each constituency is
