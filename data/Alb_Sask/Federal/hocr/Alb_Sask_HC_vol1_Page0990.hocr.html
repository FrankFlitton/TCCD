               found; and surely that is what every one 
               <br />
               desires. A great number of petitions have 
               <br />
               been presented to this House with regard 
               <br />
               to this measure, and a great many resolu— 
               <br />
               tions and memorials have been passed by 
               <br />
               diﬁferent bodies throughout the country. A 
               <br />
               great many of our clergy throughout On— 
               <br />
               tario have take exception to this Bill. At 
               <br />
               ﬁrst their objections were largely to the 
               <br />
               school system that we were forcing on the 
               <br />
               Northwest; but as they have read'the 
               <br />
               amended clause and the discussions that 
               <br />
               have taken place in the House, they have 
               <br />
               largely abandoned that position, and now 
               <br />
               they say it is not a question of separate 
               <br />
               schools at all, but it is a question of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights. Well, when we are simply 
               <br />
               legalizing a school system that the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest themselves passed, and 
               <br />
               giving them the power to amend or alter 
               <br />
               that school system from time to time, I 
               <br />
               would like to know how we are interfering 
               <br />
               with provincial rights. In this Bill we are 
               <br />
               saying there shall be two provinces instead 
               <br />
               of one; we are interfering with provincial 
               <br />
               rights in that respect; but in my opinion 
               <br />
               it is a wise departure to make. So far as 
               <br />
               the educational clauses are concerned, I 
               <br />
               cannot see how we are interfering with 
               <br />
               provincial rights at all, when we simply 
               <br />
               adopt the school system which the people 
               <br />
               have themselves passed, and give them 
               <br />
               the power to amend or alter it if they desire. 
               <br />
               Now, in reference to these petitions. The 
               <br />

               that meeting ; I was anxious to know what
