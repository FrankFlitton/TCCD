               Mr. BARKER. I am dealing with this 
               <br />
               fact that it has been found necessary even 
               <br />
               in the moral provinces of Quebec and On- 
               <br />
               tar-io—assuming they are more moral than 
               <br />
               the Northwest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories,</span> a point which I 
               <br />
               would not like to argue—it has been found 
               <br />
               necessary to curtail the authority of such 
               <br />
               ofﬁcers so that they can give two certiﬁ- 
               <br />
               cates, whereas in the Territories there is no 
               <br />
               restriction whatever. It is especially im- 
               <br />
               portant to have such restriction in a ter— 
               <br />
               ritory because in an old settled province 
               <br />
               men who act as agents for candidates are 
               <br />
               generally pretty well known, but in a ter- 
               <br />
               ritory in a sparsely settled country, an 
               <br />
               agent may go to a poll 100 miles from his 
               <br />
               home where nobody knows him; he may 
               <br />
               be enabled to vote although he may have 
               <br />
               no right to vote; his name is not on the 
               <br />
               list at the poll where he votes, he has 
               <br />
               simply the certiﬁcate of‘ an enumerator. 
               <br />
               No one knows who he is and no precaution 
               <br />
               is of'any etÏect, provided the accommodat- 
               <br />
               ing agent is willing to take the oath. I 
               <br />
               protest, and I am sure the Minister of Jus— 
               <br />
               tice will agree, that such a practise should 
               <br />
               not be continued for one hour, and that as 
               <br />
               we are dealing with this subject we should 
               <br />
               not allow it even until the provincial autho- 
               <br />
               rities choose to alter it. We should put a 
               <br />
               stop to it, and I ask the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice to consider that question and make an 
               <br />

               suggest the insertion of the limitation that 
               <br />
               exists in our own Dominion Election Acts, 
               <br />
               that there should be not more than two 
               <br />
               certiﬁcates at any one poll granted for each 
               <br />
               candidate. And why should we not go fur- 
               <br />
               ther and make provision so that a candi-

               <br />
               should know where to ﬁnd the enumerator. 
               <br />
               It was proposed that the enumerator should 
               <br />
               post a notice stating where he could be 
               <br />
               found for a certain number of hours daily 
               <br />
               previous to the election so that candidates 
               <br />
               who want him for any purpose may know 
               <br />
               where he is to be found, As the law stands 
               <br />
               1t is said a candidate friendly to the enum- 
               <br />
               erator can get all the certiﬁcates he wants, 
               <br />
               wholesale, even signed in blank, while the 
               <br />
               candidate of the opposing party does not 
               <br />
               know where to ﬁnd an enumerator and is

               not able to get any certiﬁcates.

               Mr. TURRIFF. I think if there had 
               <br />
               been any complaints we would have heard 
               <br />
               them on the platform at some time dur-

               Mr. LAKE. I am afraid that what the 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Assiniboia (Mr. Tur- 
               <br />
               riff) says does not cover the fact which I be- 
               <br />
               lieve took place in the recent election that 
               <br />
               enumerators did issue-certiﬁcates in blank, 
               <br />
               and a large number of certiﬁcates in blank, 
               <br />
               and they were placed in the hands of the 
               <br />
               friends of the party by whom the enumera-- 
               <br />
               tor had been selected. But leaving that 
               <br />
               aside, his argument still does not cover the 
               <br />
               point raised by the hon. member for Cal- 
               <br />
