               going to introduce any personal history. I 
               <br />
               will direct my few remarks to the little 
               <br />
               postal stamp upon the map. I am proud 
               <br />
               to be a representative from the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba, and what I say in reference to 
               <br />
               that province will be quite in touch with the

               government made when he introduced that 
               <br />
               Bill. Unlike that hon. gentleman who has 
               <br />
               just taken his seat, I am not going to talk

               about everything except the Bill which is 
               <br />
               before us. I wonder if the constituents of

               that hon. gentleman sent him down here to 
               <br />
               make the harangue that he has made here

               of the province of Manitoba, but in order to

               for a great number of years until they

               surrendered their rights for a consideration 
               <br />
