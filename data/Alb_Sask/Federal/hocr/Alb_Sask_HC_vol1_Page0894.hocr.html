               Mr. BOLE. I have no doubt that it fol- 
               <br />
               lowed to a certain extent the Remedial Bill, 
               <br />
               extracts of which I have read. That was 
               <br />
               the issue before the people in 1896, and it 
               <br />
               Was upon that issue that the people were 
               <br />
               called upon to vote. I have stated that I 
               <br />
               have been asked by some of my constituents 
               <br />
               to remember the voice of the people in 1896. 
               <br />
               Now, what was the voice of my own prov- 
               <br />
               ince? The province of Manitoba. by a vote 
               <br />
               of 15,459 to 14,592, proclaimed that it was 
               <br />
               desirous that this party of provincial rights 
               <br />
               should impose upon the people of that coun- 
               <br />
               try the Separate School Bill. By a majority 
               <br />
               of 967 the people of my province said that 
               <br />
               the government of that day should impose 
               <br />
               upon them this Bill which they had rejected 
               <br />
               themselves. Should I listen to the voice of 
               <br />
               my own city of Winnipeg? Winnipeg, by a 
               <br />
               majority of 126 decided in favour of this 
               <br />
               Remedial Bill which provided for separate 
               <br />
               schools to the province of Manitoba. Should 
               <br />
               I listen to the voice of Ontario ‘? I am not 
               <br />
               quite sure what the voice of Ontario was, 
               <br />
               because there were divers candidates in the 
               <br />
               ﬁeld, but I will accept the statement made 
               <br />
               by the ‘Mail and Empire’ newspaper of To- 
               <br />
               ronto. Their calculation is as follows: Con- 
               <br />
               servatives majorities, 11,906; Liberal ma- 
               <br />
               jorities, 11,843. In other words, the Protest- 
               <br />
               ant province of Ontario asked that separate 
               <br />
               schools should be imposed upon Manitoba by 
               <br />
               a majority of 63. But there were in that 
               <br />
               election Conservative independent candi- 
               <br />
               dates whose majorities amounted to 6,303, 
               <br />
               and McCarthyite independents whose major- 
               <br />
               ities amounted to 1,554. So the Conservatives 
               <br />
               and Conservative independent majorities 
               <br />
               amounted to 18,209, while the Liberal and 
               <br />
               McCarthyite majorities amounted to 13,397. 
               <br />
               I am not quite sure that I am interpreting 
               <br />
               these figures correctly, I am simply giving 
               <br />
               the statement of the ‘Mail and Empire,’ and 
               <br />
               we know that it is not always right. But I 
               <br />
               understand that the Conservative indepen- 
               <br />
               dents when they came down to Ottawa to 
               <br />
               the parliament of 1896 immediately took 
               <br />
               their places in the Conservative caucus. So 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that the Conservative and Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive independents had a clear majority of 
               <br />
               4.812 over the Liberals and McCarthyites. 
               <br />
               That. Mr. Speaker, was the voice of the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario.
