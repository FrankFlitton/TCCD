               here or not. Well, Sir, I think the ex—Min— 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior told us that he did not 
               <br />
               hold the Minister of Justice responsible for 
               <br />
               drafting the original clause 16. However, 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman comes down now at this 
               <br />
               late date and tells us that he did draft <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> 
               <br />
               The ex—Minister of the Interior told us that it 
               <br />
               was a mistake of the draughtsman. Now 
               <br />
               we remember well the brilliant speech with 
               <br />
               which the right hon. the First Minister in— 
               <br />
               troduced this Bill to the House about six 
               <br />
               weeks ago. We remember that brilliant 
               <br />
               oration, the rounded periods, the high sound- 
               <br />
               ing phrases, how he denounced the national 
               <br />
               school system of the United States, and how 
               <br />
               he praised the system that was in vogue in 
               <br />
               this country—although I think the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman made some mistake, because in 
               <br />
               only two provinces of this Dominion can it 
               <br />
               be said that separate schools prevail. But 
               <br />
               we remember the brilliant oration with 
               <br />
               which this child of the government was 
               <br />
               ushered into existence, and how hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men on that side of the House, including 
               <br />
               ministers of the Crown, thumped their desks, 
               <br />
               blistering their hands, and shouting them- 
               <br />
               selves hoarse at the high sounding words of 
               <br />
               the hon. the First Minister. Little did they 
               <br />
               know—because they did not know it until 
               <br />
               to-day—that they were simply applauding 
               <br />
               the draughtsman, because themanwho drew 
               <br />
               that clause must have drafted the speech of 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman. The two are in- 
               <br />
               separable. No two men could have drafted 
               <br />
               these two documents and produced the same 
               <br />
               harmony. Therefore if the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice drafted every word of that clause, in 
               <br />
               the opinion of this House he drafted every 
               <br />
               word of the right hon. gentleman’s speech in 
               <br />
               introducing it. I think there is no getting 
               <br />
               over that. But it only shows how the gov-

               clauses of the British North America Act

               British North America Act in some of its 
               <br />
