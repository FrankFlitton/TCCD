               I took an active part in two elections in the

               equality. I was living on the borders of the

               It is all very well for Sir Oliver Mowat

               belle, but it is a very undesirable thing 
               <br />
               for one to stand by the provisions of the 
               <br />

               much unfavourable comment from my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Labelle. I would venture to 
               <br />
               think that, although he has classed himself 
               <br />
               in the ﬁrst instance, as a cool and common 
               <br />
               sense outsider, in view of his declaration in 
               <br />
               regard to myself in one part of his speech 
               <br />
               and his declaration in regard to Sir Oliver 
               <br />
               Mowat in another part. he cannot be re- 
               <br />
               garded as a very consistent or sincere out- 
               <br />
