               try which far transcends the Manitoba

               controversy. Why is Monseigneur Shar-

               <br />

               could fairly gather from what he knew of 
               <br />
               the circumstances that led to the coming

               <br />
               they ? Dare I analyze them for a moment? 
               <br />
               I think we may take the risk even though 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Labelle may frown 
               <br />
               against it. I ask this ﬁrst question in order 
               <br />
               to clear matters : “'ere there any spiritual
