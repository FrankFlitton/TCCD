               80, it was evident that these delegates

               Mr. PRINGLE. I will not say that I 
               <br />
               am aware that the fourth Bill of Rights was 
               <br />
               never accepted as authentic. I say that 
               <br />
               there is internal evidence in support of Mr. 
               <br />
               Richot’s statement. Paragraph 1 of this 
               <br />
               Bill of Rights No. 4 demands a Senate for 
               <br />
               the new province, and a Senate was grant- 
               <br />
               ed, though the expense of it was much ob- 
               <br />
               jected to. Bill of Rights No. 3 says nothing 
               <br />
               about the Senate. If Bill of Rights No. 4 
               <br />
               was not authentic, why was the Senate 
               <br />
               granted ? But further this Bill of Rights No. 
               <br />
               4, paragraph 7, demands that the schools 
               <br />
               be separate. And this was inserted in the 
               <br />
               Manitoba Act and the Schools Act was 
               <br />
