               school, it is a secular school from 9 a.m. to 
               <br />
               3.30 p.m. Then it the religious teaching 
               <br />
               which is given is contrary to the faith

               <br />
               there is a conscience clause that the Child

               does not need to remain. So that there 
               <br />

               I hesitate to vote. I ﬁnd great difficulty in 
               <br />
               bringing myself to vote. for subsection 1. 
               <br />
               But it seems to me obvious that subsection

               <br />
               2 as _a very outrageous interference with 
               <br />
