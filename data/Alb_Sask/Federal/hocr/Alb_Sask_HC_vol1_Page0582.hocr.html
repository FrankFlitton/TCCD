               1896: Hands off Manitoba; and they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span>

               <br />
               must withdraw this school clause from that

               that school clause out, and leave the courts

               to interpret what the constitutional rights

               of the minority in the province are, and we

               ter when you have no right to fetter; do 
               <br />
               not claim constitutional interference when

               you have no right to interfere. So far as I

               the maritime provinces and the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, and who, in the exercise of our 
               <br />
               rights as members of parliament venture to
