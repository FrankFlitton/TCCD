               iuette to go back home and tell the Liberals

               of Toronto that the government did not 
               <br />
               want an election in Toronto '? He is one of

               the ministers representing the. province of 
               <br />
               Ontario; did he tell Mr. Robinette that or 
               <br />
               not? Let him be frank in answering the 
               <br />
               question.

               be given an opportunity to announce them- 
               <br />
               selves without being shackled. They will 
               <br />
               not be shackled, but they Will have a voters’ 
               <br />
               list and will have British fair—play, and 
               <br />
               we will see what the result will be, though 
               <br />
               the government candidate will be favour- 
               <br />
               ably handi ~apped as against the other man, 
               <br />
               by having a portfolio, the government at 
               <br />
               his back, and a private car and its equip- 
               <br />
               ment. Then we will know what the public 
               <br />
               feeling of this country on this question is. 
               <br />
               So far as North Oxford is concerned, there 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> bound to be a contest there. Everybody 
               <br />
               knows that that constituency has a majority 
               <br />
               of at least 1,500 Liberals. and should the 
               <br />
               government candidate be elected by a small 
               <br />
               majority, I have no doubt that the govern- 
               <br />
               ment will claim that as an endorsation of its 
               <br />
               policy.

               with reference to the matter spoken of by
