               We do not want any legislation of that 
               <br />
               kind in the Northwest Territories, or for the 
               <br />
               Northwest. Now I want to make myself 
               <br />
               clear, for I believe 1 speak for many people 
               <br />
               in the Northwest on this subject. We ob- 
               <br />
               ject to separate schools, not on religious 
               <br />
               grounds at all, but merely on the grounds 
               <br />
               of efﬁciency and economy. But we can see 
               <br />
               that in the Northwest, under present con- 
               <br />
               ditions, separate schools conducted as they 
               <br />
               are to-day, do not seriously affect either 
               <br />
               efﬁciency or economy. Therefore we do 
               <br />
               not seriously object to these schools as they 
               <br />
               are to-day. But what we do object to, 
               <br />
               what we did object to in 1891, was the fea- 
               <br />
               ture embodied in this Remedial Bill, thor- 
               <br />
               oughly embodied in it, and that was the 
               <br />
               principle of absolute clerical control of 
               <br />
               schools. That is what we do not want. 
               <br />
               that is what we would not submit-to. We 
               <br />
               had that clerical control of schools from 
               <br />
               1884 to 1891, and as the ex-Mlnister of the 
               <br />

               we did not ﬁnd it so. I was a member of

               <br />
               made the schools strictly national. We—

               have separate schools in the Northwest, 
               <br />

               ligious instruction for one-half hour each 
               <br />

               It may be a matter of information to the 
               <br />
               members of this House to say that while the 
               <br />
               returns show only ten or ﬁfteen separate 
               <br />
               schools in the' Territories, there are, I sup- 
               <br />
               pose, upwards of a hundred Catholic schools. 
               <br />
               Wherever the Catholic people are in the ma- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jority,</span> they elect their own trustees, form 
               <br />
               their own school district, hire their own teach- 
               <br />
               ers and direct what form of religion shall be 
               <br />
               taught in the half hour allotted to religion. 
               <br />
               These are public schools; they are not sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools, and yet they are Catholic 
               <br />
               schools. So, I say that in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories we have the Catholics sharing in 
               <br />
               the public school system just the same 
               <br />
               whether they are separated from the origin- 
               <br />
               al districts or whether they form the original 
               <br />
               district; we have a national school System 
               <br />
               and it is not throttling the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories and it is not doing an injustice or an 
               <br />
               injury to the Northwest Territories to pro—
