               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament</span> and the provincial legis- 
               <br />
               latures. This analysis is not exhaus- 
               <br />
               tive, but it covers all that is neces— 
               <br />
               sary for the present purpose. I submit, 
               <br />
               Sir. that the basis established by this dis- 
               <br />
               tribution of legislative and executive power 
               <br />
               cannot be altered either under section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">146</span> 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act or under 
               <br />
               section 2 of the British North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> 
               <br />
               Act, 1871. In establishing a new province 
               <br />
               can this parliament wholly or partially 
               <br />
               alter the basis of confederation; can it 
               <br />
               change the distribution of legislative power? 
               <br />
               That, I submit can only be done by the 
               <br />
               imperial parliament. Surely it cannot be 
               <br />
               contended that in giving to a new province 
               <br />
               the constitutional rights conferred by the 
               <br />
               British North America Act we can reverse 
               <br />
               the scheme framed by the fathers of con— 
               <br />
               federation and embodied in an imperial sta- 
               <br />
               tute. Yet, that is what the right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman seeks to do to-day by the provisions 
               <br />
               contained both in the original and amended” 
               <br />
               section 16 of the Bill. In creating a new 
               <br />
               province under the British North America 
               <br />
               Act <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can“</span> this parliament so amend section 
               <br />
               92 as to transfer to federal jurisdiction nine- 
               <br />
               tenths of the powers which by the express 
               <br />
               terms of that section are to be exercised ex- 
               <br />
               clusively by the provinces ? Can this par— 
               <br />
               liament transfer to such a province any of 
               <br />
               the powers which under the provisions of 
               <br />
               section 91 come within the exclusive juris-
