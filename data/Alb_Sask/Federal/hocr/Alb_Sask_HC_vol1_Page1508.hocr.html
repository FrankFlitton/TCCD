               Therefore according to the statement of

               the hon. member for Brandon, according to

               <br />
               to be preserved, but in the amended sec- 
               <br />
               tion 16, No. 2, the word ‘denominational’ 
               <br />
               which occurs in the British North America 
               <br />
               Act is changed to the word ‘separate.’ 
               <br />
               Under the New Brunswick Act as has al- 
               <br />
               ready been poiuted out, a question arose 
               <br />
               with regard to the character of certain 
               <br />
               schools as to Whether or not they were de— 
               <br />
               nominational and it was held that they 
               <br />
               were not denominational and therefore no 
               <br />
               rights were preserved. The word ‘denom— 
               <br />
               inational’ would not preserve certain rights 
               <br />
               but the word ‘denominational’ is changed 
               <br />
               by section 16. No. 2 to which I have re—
