               We have been told by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon».</span> gentlemen oppo- 
               <br />
               site that the proposition which is now being

               proposed to this House is one that is for the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of all the parties concerned, that it 
               <br />
               is for the peace, order and good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern:</span> 
               <br />
               ment of those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces'that</span> are being con— 
               <br />
               stituted. :So far as I am able to judge, the 
               <br />
               restrictions, light though they may seem, 
               <br />
               and narrow though they may appear to be, 
               <br />
               as .hon. gentlemen view them, I believe that 
               <br />
               they are in the wrong direction with regard 
               <br />
               to these provinces, I belive that we have not 
               <br />
               the power to place these restrictions upon 
               <br />
               those provinces; and even if we have the 
               <br />
               power to impose these restrictions, I doubt 
               <br />
               very much if we have the ability to enforce 
               <br />
               them should these provinces say that they 
               <br />
               are not going to carry them into effect. What 
               <br />
               could the hon. gentlemen opposite do to 
               <br />
               enforce the clauses provided in the Bill if 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories say they are not 
               <br />
               going to enforce them? I know nothing 
               <br />
               short of force of arms that would compel 
               <br />
               these Territories to enforce these clauses, 
               <br />
               provided they did not see their way to do it. 
               <br />
               In viewing the British North America Act 
               <br />
               and its amendments, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I‘cannot</span> for the life 
               <br />
               of me see how hon. gentlemen can contend 
               <br />
               that even it they succeed in putting these 
               <br />
               clauses in the Bill they can enforce them 
               <br />
               upon the provinces. Whether there is some 
               <br />
               light on this subject that has not yet been 
               <br />
               given to us, I am not in a position to judge, 
               <br />
               but I must say that the attitude of the cabi- 
               <br />
               net in this matter is not one that has 
               <br />
               been reassuring to the country. I 
               <br />
               have watched the members of the cabinet 
               <br />
               from day to day, and I think it is not the 
               <br />
               cabinet that should have brought down a 
               <br />
               Bill of so great importance to this people 
               <br />
               and to this House. The cabinet is exceed— 
               <br />
               ingly weak, particularly with regard to the 
               <br />
               representation of Ontario. Last nigh-t I had 
               <br />

               tlemen opposite have insisted that minorities

               <br />
               the scant treatment they have given to the 
               <br />
               minority in this House has not been such 
               <br />
               as might reasonably have been expected 
               <br />
               from a party that is so strong. I contend 
               <br />
               that at least ministers of the Crown should 
               <br />
               most of them be in the House, and listen 
               <br />
               to the various arguments that may be ad- 
               <br />
               vanced with regard to legislation which is 
               <br />
               so important and in which this country is

               episodes that have happened in the history 
               <br />
               of this country. In the ﬁrst place, we had 
               <br />
               the speech of the rig‘h-t hon. gentleman to 
               <br />
               which I have already referred at some 
               <br />
               length. Then we had the retirement of the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior. That in itself was 
               <br />
               a comparatively serious matter, or at least 
               <br />
               I viewed it so on that occasion. But that 
               <br />
               matter, so far as I have been able to sift 
               <br />
               it out and to arrive at a conclusion upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> 
               <br />
               was not quite so serious from the govern- 
               <br />
               ment standpoint as it appeared to be when 
               <br />
               it was acted before this House. It appears 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to’</span> me that it was really part of a great 
               <br />
               tragedy, so to speak, at the time, but it has 
               <br />
               ended almost in a comedy. The right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman and his esteemed ex-Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, whose ability we all admire, 
               <br />
               acted their parts <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remarkably</span> well, and 
               <br />
               I. as a new member of the House, was com- 
               <br />
               pletely taken in. I really thought that the 
               <br />
               exhibition was genuine, and it was not until 
               <br />
               some time after that I was able to ascertain 
               <br />
               that after all it was a play to the gallery 
               <br />
               and to the country. This House sat with 
               <br />
               bated breadth and whispered <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">humblenæs,</span> 
               <br />
               and with ears strained, while the First Min— 
               <br />
               ister made the announcement, the serious 
               <br />
               announcement, that that right hand of his, 
               <br />
               the famous Minister of the Interior, who 
               <br />
               has been called, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">probably</span> rightly so, 
               <br />
               the Napoleon of the west, was to retire from 
               <br />
               his cabinet on account of disagreement over 
               <br />
               the school clauses of the Bill. When the 
               <br />
               First Minister made his announcement in 
               <br />
               the most solemn tones, and when the ex- 
               <br />
               )Iinister of the Interior rose to make his 
               <br />
               explanations and his exhibition, Ithought a 
               <br />
               crisis had arrived in the history of the gov— 
               <br />

               ther east, in this House, and we thought 
               <br />
               that never more would the First Minister 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the lanes in England was represented as 
               <br />
               calling to a boy passing along the road and 
               <br />
               saying: ‘Wher-e be’st going George ?—Be 
               <br />
               going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nowaheres.</span> O-h, thee must be going 
               <br />
               somewhere, lad.’ ‘ No, I haint, I am coming 
               <br />
               back.’ That is like what we have seen in 
               <br />
               this House. We have seen that the ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior is not going any- 
               <br />
               where, he is simply coming back; and he 
               <br />
               has taken the clauses the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man introduced as an amendment to his 
               <br />
               measure, and accepts them as a full, com- 
               <br />
               plete and satisfactory offer to the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. He says, I am ready to accept 
               <br />
               these and to unite with you again, and give 
               <br />
               you my voice and my vote. That is what 
               <br />
               we have seen going on between these two 
               <br />

         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_16" title="bbox 981 2504 1743 2602">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               hon. gentlemen in relation to these parti- 
               <br />
               cular clauses. Now we have not been able 
               <br />
               to discover any great difference between 
               <br />
