               Mr. BRODEUR. I would like to know

               As we are aware two educational systems

               have been in force in the Northwest Ter-

               ritories ; one under the ordinances from 1884 
               <br />
               to 1892 and the other from 1892 to the 
               <br />
               present date. The motion, as the hon. gen- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               system of 1892, or whether we would adopt 
               <br />
               another system altogether?

               that time my dissatisfaction with the policy 
               <br />
               of the Conservative government which re- 
               <br />
               fused to disallow these mdinances, when 
               <br />
               Sir John Thompson then Prime Minister, 
               <br />
               himself declared that these ordinances were 
               <br />
               illegal and ultra viires. ‘I thought the gov-

               they have been working under them since 
               <br />
               1892. I do not see Why the government 
               <br />
               to-day should not embody in the constitu—

               he was in favour of clause 16, No. 1, be— 
               <br />
               cause it was proposed by the government of 
               <br />
               which he is a member and I have not heard 
               <br />
               that he sent in his resignation. He is now 
               <br />
               in favour of clause 16, No. 2. I think it was 
               <br />
               Bismarck who said the language was given 
               <br />
               us to conceal our thoughts.

               <br />
               My hon. friend (Mr. Brodeur) is proving that 
               <br />
               the cynicism of Talleyrand is true. He is 
               <br />
               in favour of clause 16, No. 2 to-night. but 
               <br />
               he does not give his reasons for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being‘in</span> 
               <br />
               favour of it. However, I will give him my 
               <br />
               reasons for the faith that is in me. Since 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada has declared by 
               <br />
               a majority of over eighty votes not to adopt 
               <br />
               section 93 of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               in the sense mentioned by the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition. but to amend it so as to give the 
               <br />
               minority in the Northwest Territories their 
               <br />
               rights and privileges; I am in favour of 
               <br />
               restoring to that minority their full rights 
               <br />
               and not a shadow of their rights. I am for 
               <br />
               the granting of those rights and privileges 
               <br />
               in their entirety to the minority and in my 
               <br />
               opinion clause 16, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No.‘</span> 1, guaranteed that 
               <br />
               because I believe it was putting in force the. 
               <br />
               principle enacted in 1875 of giving separate
