               Next. Sir. we may come brieﬂy to the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of the ﬁnancial arrangements. At the 
               <br />
               time of confederation it was agreed that the 
               <br />
               various provinces which form the union 
               <br />
               should surrender their customs and excise 
               <br />
               duties to the common treasury at Ottawa. 
               <br />
               But they required as a condition of confeder~ 
               <br />
               ation that some portion of these moneys 
               <br />
               should be returned to the provinces to assist 
               <br />
               in the maintenance of the provincial govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and thus there was established the 
               <br />
               system of provincial subsidies. The princi- 
               <br />
               ples governing the distribution of money to 
               <br />
               the provinces are pretty well laid down. As 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst step we give a certain ﬁxed sum, 
               <br />
               having due regard to the responsibilities 
               <br />
               of the various provinces, in the way of 
               <br />
               allowance for government. Then there is a 
               <br />
               sum of 80 cents per head on the population, 
               <br />
               and ﬁnally there is an adjustment of the 
               <br />
               debt account whereby in some cases 
               <br />
               an allowance is made to the province in the 
               <br />
               form of interest on a public debt which that 
               <br />
               province might owe but which in the par- 
               <br />
               ticular case does not happen to exist. 
               <br />
               far the principles under which these sub- 
               <br />
               sidies and aids to provinces may be granted 
               <br />
               are pretty well understood, and they are 
               <br />
               applied in this case to the new provinces to 
               <br />
               be created, taking an estimated population 
               <br />
               which is probably a fair and liberal one 
               <br />
               upon which they shall receive the sums set 
               <br />
               down in the Bill.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               One other ﬁnancial question remains and 
               <br />
               it is one which arises out of the retention 
               <br />
               of the lands by the Dominion government. 
               <br />
               Since we have allowed the other provinces 
               <br />
               to retain the lands, and since they have 
               <br />
               them as a source of revenue, and since in 
               <br />
               the case of the Northwest Provinces we 
               <br />
               withhold the lands from them and they are 
               <br />
               deprived of that source of revenue, it fol- 
               <br />
               lows that we must make some allowance to 
               <br />
               them. and it will be admitted that we should 
               <br />
               make a reasonable and generous allowance. 
               <br />
               1 have seen comparisons made in criticism 
               <br />
               of this measure between the sums which

               will be received by these provinces in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               sums which are received by some of the 
               <br />
               other provinces. I have seen a comparison 
               <br />
               made in the case of my own province par- 
               <br />
               ticularly. Comparisons of that nature are 
               <br />
               very unfair and may easily be misleading. 
               <br />
               If I turn to the latest returns which I have 
               <br />
               at hand 1 ,ﬁnd that in the case of Ontario 
               <br />
               the province receives about $1,500,000 a 
               <br />
               year of revenue from its lands. The 
               <br />
               Northwest Provinces will receive nothing 
               <br />
               to correspond with that and therefore we 
               <br />
               must make a liberal allowance to them. 
               <br />
               Quebec receives about $1,300,000 per annum, 
               <br />
               according to a recent report, in the way of 
               <br />
               revenue from lands, forests and minerals. 
               <br />
               My own province, Nova Scotia, received last 
               <br />
               year over $600,000 from its lands, mines and 
               <br />
               minerals. We deprive the new provinces in 
               <br />
               the west of these sources of revenue, and 
               <br />
               of course we should make up the sum to 
               <br />
               them by liberal allowances. I do not. think 
               <br />
               that. 011 the whole. we can complain much of 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial terms. It may be that when we 
               <br />
               come to deal with the Bill in committee 
               <br />
               some questions may arise that may require 
               <br />
               further consideration, but speaking gener- 
               <br />
               ally I think the most that can be said about 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial terms is that they are liberal—— 
               <br />
               and I am sure that on both sides of the 
               <br />
               House we would desire to be liberal as 
               <br />
               respects these two provinces which will 
               <br />
               have a large territory and will begin with 
               <br />
               a comparatively sparse population. We all 
               <br />
               realize that a population scattered over a 
               <br />
               wide territory requires man for man more 
               <br />
               money for the expenses of government than 
               <br />
               a population which is closely settled to- 
               <br />
               gether. I think therefore on the whole, 
               <br />
               reserving any discussion of details until we 
               <br />
               go into committee on the Bill, that the 
               <br />
               terms are liberal to these tw0 provinces, 
               <br />
               they are generous, but not more generous 
               <br />
               than hon. gentlemen on both sides would 
               <br />
               desire we should make them. _
