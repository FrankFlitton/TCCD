               Mr. FISHER. I know that. They could

               accept registration from the United States 
               <br />
               or England or anywhere else, and they 
               <br />
               called themselves Dominion, but at the 
               <br />
               same time their charter was a purely pro- 
               <br />
               vincial charter, and outside of the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario they had no legal existence. 
               <br />
               But coming under this charter they have

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a'legal</span> existence all over the Dominion. 
               <br />
               But there is another very important point 
               <br />
               in this Act. When one association is formed 
               <br />
               of a Dominion character, no other can be 
               <br />
               formed. There <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must‘be</span> only one national 
               <br />
               Dominion association. There was the Short- 
               <br />
               horn Association under the Ontario Act, and 
               <br />
               there were also shorthorns registered in 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec 
               <br />
               under associations in those provinces—not 
               <br />
               specially conﬁned to shorthorns, but register- 
               <br />
               ing any other class of cattle that it was 
               <br />
               desired to register in their records. Under 
               <br />
               this Act, however, there can be only one 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Dominion</span> association recording pedigrees 
               <br />
               for the Dominion, and that is one of the 
               <br />
               chief reasons why the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂerent</span> breeders’ 
               <br />
               associations have wished to come under this 
               <br />
               Act. The danger was that there would 
               <br />
               be half a dozen associations. There were 
               <br />
               actually already four <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerent</span> sets of re- 
               <br />
               cords in Canada, and there was a danger 
               <br />
               that there would be two or three more 
               <br />
               established, in Manitoba, the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories and British Columbia ; and it was 
               <br />
               to avoid that multiplication of records that 
               <br />
               this Act was passed originally, and that 
               <br />
               this movement for the nationalization of re- 
               <br />
               cords has taken place. It was done in the 
               <br />
               interest of the live stock men. They them- 
               <br />
               selves have asked for it and have brought it 
               <br />
               about, and I am proposing a law which is 
               <br />
               necessary to facilitate and carry out their 
               <br />

               Mr. FISHER. There will be. The Nova 
               <br />
               Scotians have already signed an agreement 
               <br />
               coming under this Act and handing over 
               <br />
               their records to the department here. The 
               <br />
               New Brunswick government have done the 
               <br />
               same. .I fully anticipate that within the 
               <br />
               next few weeks the records for the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec will be dealt with in the same 
               <br />
               way. The leading live stock men of the 
               <br />
               province have expressed their desire to do 
               <br />
               so, and the only question is the settlement 
               <br />
               of the negotiations. The same has been 
               <br />
               done with regard to the Northwest. In 
               <br />
               that way the local records will disappear, 
               <br />
               and there will be but one Dominion record 
               <br />
               for each class of stock. There are two or 
               <br />
               three very important reasons why this is 
               <br />
               necessary in the interest of the live stock 
               <br />
               men. Perhaps the most pressing is that at 
               <br />
               the present time, through the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁorts</span> of

               the live stock commissioner of my depart-

               ment, the railroads have given special facil- 
               <br />
               ities and rates on thoroughbred stock. Such 
               <br />
               stock can be sent all over Canada to-day 
               <br />
               at lower rates than any other stock, where 
               <br />
               it is intended to be used for breeding pur- 
               <br />
               poses. The railroads, in a public-spirited 
               <br />
               way, recognizing the importance of the im- 
               <br />
               provement of the live stock of the country. 
               <br />
               have, given these special rates for the car- 
               <br />
               riage of live stock. They have asked us 
               <br />
               What pedigrees they must recognize, and 
               <br />
               when they were asked to recognize three 
               <br />
               or four different certiﬁcates, they protested. 
               <br />
               They said: we cannot go to the trouble 
               <br />
               of examining three or four different certi- 
               <br />

               coming to. On various occasions the live 
               <br />
               stock men of Canada have discussed with 
               <br />
               the United States authorities and the live 
               <br />
               stock men in the United States the question 
               <br />
               of the entry free of duty of Canadian thor- 
               <br />
               oughbred animals into that country. The 
               <br />
               United States customs laws have a provision 
               <br />
               authorizing thoroughbred animals to be ad- 
               <br />
               mitted free of duty when introduced for 
               <br />
               breeding purposes, but they have certain 
               <br />
               rules and regulations which up to the pre- 
               <br />
               sent, have shut out Canadian thoroughbred 
               <br />
               animals. It is hoped that when we estab- 
               <br />
               lish here a national record for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thorough"</span> 
               <br />
               breds, with the stamp of the Department of 
               <br />
               Agriculture, we may induce the American 
               <br />
               authorities to accept such certiﬁcate. We 
               <br />
               shall certainly make the attempt, but our 
               <br />
               success does not depend on ourselves alone, 
               <br />
               and therefore I can say nothing absolutely.
