               goingupon it and putting in his settlement 
               <br />
               duties. In the last three or four years 
               <br />
               matters have been very dih'erent. In the 
               <br />
               southern portion of the province it has 
               <br />
               been practically impossible to get a home- 
               <br />
               stead within a reasonable distance of the 
               <br />
               railway. People have been going into the 
               <br />
               older and well known districts, where it is 
               <br />
               known that farming can be satisfactorily 
               <br />
               carried on. As they have purchased land. 
               <br />
               we do not of course ﬁnd their names among 
               <br />
               the homestead entries. A great number have 
               <br />
               also come in to work for farmers. These 
               <br />
               have not been able to ﬁnd homesteads near 
               <br />
               at hand, and we do not ﬁnd their names 
               <br />
               among the homestead entries. A great
