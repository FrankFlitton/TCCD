               homestead entries in that country; a man

               can reside in the province of Ontario and

               have his entry made any time after the lst

               speculative homestead entries where it is

               of the trend of settlement. If we follow 
               <br />
               up the inquiry to the land oﬂice, let us 
               <br />
               take the moneys that have been received in 
               <br />

               southern part of the country half of the 
               <br />
               agency of Red Deer. The ﬁgures for the 
               <br />
               year ending the 1st of June, 1904, are : Ed- 
               <br />
               monton oﬁice; $38,711; Red Deer, $16,392; 
               <br />
               Calgary, $56,741; Lethbridge, $86,046. In 
               <br />
               other words, 22 per cent of that was north 
               <br />
               of 38 and 78 per cent south. Is not that 
               <br />
               a fair indication of where settlement is go— 
               <br />
               ing in that country? Let us take another 
               <br />
               example. Look at the receipts for land, 
               <br />
               timber and registry oﬂice fees, and see if 
               <br />
               they do not tell the same story, namely, that 
               <br />
               the inﬂux of population and the develop- 
               <br />
               ment are mostly in the south. The receipts 
               <br />
               from 1891 to 1901 from land, timber and 
               <br />
               registry oﬂice fees, were : North of 38, $253,- 
               <br />
               795, or 34 per cent ; south of 38, $538,516 or 
               <br />
               66 per cent. For 1902-3, the receipts from 
               <br />
               the above sources were: North of 38, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$174,—</span> 
               <br />
               417, or 34 per cent; south, $330,998, or 66 
               <br />
               per cent. The receipts from the beginning 
               <br />
               to 1903, from allthree sources were: North, 
               <br />
               $529,354, or 27 per cent; south, $1,429,182 
               <br />
               or 73 per cent. Yet we are told that the 
               <br />
               division is fair as between the north and 
               <br />
               the south. If we adhered to the principle 
               <br />
               adopted by the legislative assembly, you 
               <br />
               would have ﬁfteen seats south of 38 and ten 
               <br />
               north, or as nine to six—If you adhered to 
               <br />
               that principle, and as I have said, there 
               <br />
               has been no complaint made with regard 
               <br />
               to those constituencies in the local HouSe.

               Now, I have only been dealing with the 
               <br />
               rural population, but if we take the urban 
               <br />
               population from the very best sources of 
               <br />
               information we can get, we will ﬁnd a 
               <br />
               greater inﬂux of population, urban as well 
               <br />
               as rural, has been to the south. I have

               ﬁgured out with respect to the local con-

               <br />
               not give them in detail. If any constitu- 
               <br />
               ency is questioned, I am prepared to give 
               <br />
               the urban population in each one. The re- 
               <br />
               s—ult is that south of the line there is a urban 
               <br />
               population of 42,550; whilst to the north 
               <br />
               there is only 21,300, a difference of 21,150 
               <br />
               or 75 per cent south and 25 per cent north. 
               <br />
               I do not think that the strongest advocate 
               <br />
               of the northern country will contend that 
               <br />
               we have a larger urban population north 
               <br />
               than we have in the south. Now if you add 
               <br />
               these two together you ﬁnd <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a,total</span> urban 
               <br />
               population of 63,750. As I understood 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice some three or four 
               <br />
               weeks ago in this House, he said that he 
               <br />
               assumed the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[population</span> of the province of 
               <br />
               Alberta was 173,000, instead of as now, 250,— 
               <br />
               000. If he took the two together there were 
               <br />
               500,000, and an estimate had been made. 
               <br />
               up which will be found in the ‘Hansard,’ 
               <br />
               that Alberta showed a population of 173,000. 
               <br />
               Now that tallies with the percentage of ur- 
               <br />
               ban population shown in the census of 1901, 
               <br />
               as near as any person can get at the ﬁg- 
               <br />
               ures. But that is one of the reasons Why 
               <br />
               I would like to see this whole matter re— 
               <br />
               ferred to an independent commission where 
               <br />
               full and complete inquiries could be made, 
               <br />
               so that every locality would have an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of being represented and stating its 
               <br />
               case. Proceeding on the ﬁgures suggested 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice, of 173,000, that 
               <br />
               leaves a balance of about 105,000 exclusive 
               <br />
               of Indians, of a rural population. The ques- 
               <br />
               tion arises, in what part of the country is 
               <br />
               the bulk of that rural population ? It is im— 
               <br />
               possible to determine anything deﬁnite in re- 
               <br />
               gard to that. As <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I,</span> have pointed out, home- 
               <br />
               stead entries are made up there in great 
               <br />
               numbers by people who have no idea ot 
               <br />
               ever settling upon the land. But when we 
               <br />
               cannot get any accurate information, we 
               <br />
               have to do the next best thing we can. I 
               <br />
               have a map here which was prepared for 
               <br />
               the government two years ago, made up to 
               <br />
               the 1st of December, 1902.

               On it are laid down in the proposed pro-
