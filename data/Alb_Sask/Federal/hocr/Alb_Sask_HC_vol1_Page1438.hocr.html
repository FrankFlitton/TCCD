               in fact, I gather that from the illustration

               <br />

               <br />
               henceforth be carried out by the executive 
               <br />
               of the province, the fact that the parliament

               or the executive of Canada was under a

               ground for refusing to transfer these

               contracts to the province to be carried 
               <br />
               out in future by the province. The pro- 
               <br />
               vince, in dealing with these subjects, would 
               <br />
               be bound by the same necessity of good

               <br />
               contracts; and so my hon. friend argues 
               <br />
               in the same way, that where you are deal- 
               <br />
               ing, 'not with a subject of executive action, 
               <br />
               but with a matter of legislative jurisdiction, 
               <br />
               you should act upon similar principles; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               where what one might call a legislative con- 
               <br />
               tract had been entered into, the mere fact 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> a legislative contract had been entered 
               <br />
               into is not a good ground for restricting the 
               <br />
               sphere of legislative jurisdiction, which, un- 
               <br />
               der the terms of the constitution, should be 
               <br />
               conﬁded to the new province. So far as that 
               <br />
               goes, of course, there is a very great deal 
               <br />
               to be said along that line. We can say all 
               <br />
               that without for one moment suggesting 
               <br />
               that it would be proper for this parliament 
               <br />
               or for the provincial legislature to deal in 
               <br />
               any way with rights created by contract 
               <br />
               without making due compensation for any 
               <br />
               violation of these rights which might be 
               <br />
               effected by legislation. The question arises, 
               <br />
               not only under section 22, but under section 
               <br />
               23; but as we are dealing now more par-

               ticularly with section 22. I would. in the

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I did not understand 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Lanai-k to go farther 
               <br />
               than that. For example, you might ex- 
               <br />
               propriate that right, I suppose. just as you 
               <br />
               would expropriate any other property of an 
               <br />
               individual, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'but</span> in doing so you avould neces- 
               <br />
               sarily—I say necessarily from the standpoint 
               <br />
               of justice and fair play—make compensation 
               <br />
               for it. It may be expedient l'or this parlia— 
               <br />
               ment or the provincial legislature to expro- 
               <br />
               priate that right. My hon. friend (Mr. Hag- 
               <br />
               gart) is simply arguing that under the 
               <br />
               sphere of provincial jurisdiction that power 
               <br />
               should be conﬁded to the provincial legisla- 
               <br />
               ture. As has been frequently said by judges 
               <br />
               in the courts: you are not to expect that 
               <br />
               the legislature or executive will do wrong; 
               <br />
               you are to expect they will act according to 
               <br />
               the principles of justice. I presume that 
               <br />
               my hon. friend (Mr. Haggart) in making 
               <br />
               the suggestion, was going upon the principle 
               <br />
               that in conﬁding this power to the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial legislature you would necessarily 
               <br />
               expect that not only would it be exercised 
               <br />
               wisely, but With due regard to all rights 
               <br />
