               Mr. SCOTT. Evidently not. Well, in my 
               <br />
               own opinion, section 23 in these Bills means 
               <br />
               absolutely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing—or</span> at all events very iit- 
               <br />
               tle. But I say that if section 23 is put in 
               <br />
               the Bill, then it is fair, it is right, it is 
               <br />
               imperative that further notice be put in 
               <br />
               the Bill that parliament intends, as the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister says, to negotiate the sur- 
               <br />
               render of these exemption rights from the 
               <br />
               company—that further notice be put in the 
               <br />
               Bill, so that the provinces, the people of 
               <br />
               Canada and the railway company will un- 
               <br />
               derstand that parliament, at some future 
               <br />
               day will take away these rights by expro- 
               <br />
               priation or by negotiation. But. as I have

               ton <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Henderson) that this government

               <br />

               <br />
               and parliament by any party or corporation.

               <br />
               not intend to repeat my remarks—I con- 
               <br />
               tend that if the government in 1881 had 
               <br />
               power to make this contract and to pass 
               <br />
               that law, there is no necessity for this sec- 
               <br />
               tion in the Act, for that law would apply, 
               <br />
               and it cannot be overridden by local legis- 
               <br />
               lation afterwards. On the other hand, if 
               <br />
               this law was ultra vires the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada in 1881, then this parliament is not 
               <br />
               called upon to conﬁrm any portion of a con- 
               <br />
               tract that was ultra vires of parliament 
               <br />
               when it was made. There is a vast diﬂer— 
               <br />
               ence between carrying out a contract made 
               <br />
               With a former parliament which contract 
               <br />
               was within the powers of that parliament, 
               <br />
               and carrying out a portion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«a</span> contract 
               <br />
               made that was not within the powers of

               parliament. If it was within the power 
               <br />

               it out. If it means nothing then striking 
               <br />

               <br />
               the hon. gentleman according to ‘his own

               If it has any meaning at all I would sup-
