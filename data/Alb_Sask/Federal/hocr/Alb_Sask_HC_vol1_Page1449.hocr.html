               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway system was con— 
               <br />
               structed by the provincial government, but 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rprOvince</span> of Ontario had something to do 
               <br />
               with the construction of that railway, and 
               <br />
               the people of that province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contributed</span> 
               <br />
               largely towards the expense. And one of the 
               <br />
               purposes they had in view was the opening 
               <br />
               up of the northern section of the province. 
               <br />
               The production of iron ore for 1902 was 
               <br />
               359,288 tons, most of which was smeltered 
               <br />
               in Ontario. Mining operations were com- 
               <br />
               menced at Sudbury in 1886, and the district 
               <br />
               now furnishes about half the world’s sup- 
               <br />
               ply of nickel. So it will be seen that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provincial</span> government have been giving 
               <br />
               some attention to the mining interests of 
               <br />
               northern Ontario. The copper-nickel matte 
               <br />
               is at present shipped to the United States, 
               <br />
               where the ﬁnal stages of the processes of 
               <br />
               extraction and reﬁning are carried on. That 
               <br />
               policy I_do not agree with. I am in favour 
               <br />
               of a policy that will cause these ﬁnal opera- 
               <br />
               tions to be carried on in Canada. I hope 
               <br />
               the time will come when this mineral will 
               <br />
               be completely reﬁned in Canada and the 
               <br />
               wages earned by Canadians. This is a 
               <br />
               ' policy that should receive the support, not 
               <br />
               only of the government of Ontario, but of 
               <br />
               this government as well. In 1902 11,890,000 
               <br />
               pounds of nickel were produced, valued in 
               <br />
               the matte .and before being exported for re— 
               <br />
               ﬁning at $2,210,961. And in the same year, 
               <br />
               1902, 4,932 tons of copper were produced, 
               <br />
               valued in the form of matte at $680,283. 
               <br />
               Now, I would like to say something of 
               <br />
               what has been done by the provincial gov- 
               <br />
               ernment .for the settlement of that part of 
               <br />
               the province. I may say that it has been 
               <br />
               a disappointment to the people of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario that a larger number of the 
               <br />
               sons and daughters of the province do not 
               <br />
               go to northern Ontario rather than to the 
               <br />
               west. One of the reasons of that is that 
               <br />
               the policy of the Ontario government—and 
               <br />
               I do not wish to refer to this in a party

               <br />
               Let me give you an example. In 1901 the 
               <br />
               legislature of the province passed an Act to 
               <br />
               provide for the appropriation of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">certain-</span> 
               <br />
               lands to be given to the volunteers who had 
               <br />
               served in South Africa and to those who 
               <br />
               had served on the frontier in the Fenian 
               <br />
               Raids of 1866. One reason urged in favour 
               <br />
               of this policy was that, of the men returning 
               <br />
               from South Africa, many would want to 
               <br />
               take up farming pursuits, and would be 
               <br />
               more likely to settle in the northern part of 
               <br />
               Ontario if the provincial government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were.</span> 
               <br />
               liberal with them. But there is a clause 
               <br />
               here over which a'great deal of comment 
               <br />
               has arisen by the people of Ontario. 
               <br />
               and which, I venture to say, is one of the 
               <br />
               chief reasons why a large number of the 
               <br />
               voters in the northern part of Ontario voted 
               <br />
               against the government in power in the 
               <br />
               province at that time. Clause 9 reads thus :

               <br />
               tle upon the farm, and he could clear the 
               <br />
               pine timber that he needed to construct his 
               <br />

               had to pay to the provincial government 
               <br />
               timber dues. Thus a large number of volun-

               teers complained bitterly, and a contention 
               <br />
               arose in the province of Ontario upon this 
               <br />
               question. There was a division in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               sisted that in their opinion the better way 
               <br />
               to settle that northern country was to re- 
               <br />
               serve the pine timber. However, when this 
               <br />
               question was tested before the electors in 
               <br />
               the northern part <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[of</span> the province they 
               <br />
               declared that that kind of policy was not 
               <br />
               in the best interests of the people, and was 
               <br />
               not calculated to invite settlers to locate in 
               <br />
               the northern part of the province. It is 
               <br />
               a policy which will now, I suppose, be made 
               <br />
               right, a policy that will of necessity be made 
               <br />
               right in the near future, because the people 
               <br />
               of all shades of politics in the province will 
               <br />
               be in favour of a liberal policy to the set- 
               <br />
               tler. so that he shall have the right to cut 
               <br />
               pine timber to sell if he wishes. and put his 
               <br />
               money in the bank and thereby help to 
               <br />
               make his home prosperous and happy. We 
               <br />
               must keep in view the fact that to-day the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario has an agent in the old 
               <br />
               country. and has had for some time, Mr. 
               <br />
               Byrne, who is stationed at Liverpool. The 
               <br />
               Ontario government has also had for the last 
               <br />
               year a special agent for the purpose of 
               <br />
               bringing out hundreds of men to engage in 
               <br />
               agricultural pursuits, it has been expending 
               <br />
               a large amount of money in this way for 
               <br />
               the purpose of settling up the northern part 
               <br />
               of the province. Let me also point out that
