               I could not conceive it possible for Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain to complain that the questions 
               <br />
               before us had not been properly treated, 
               <br />
               when, at the same time, he says he has 
               <br />
               been shown every possible consideration. lt 
               <br />
               would have been showing Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               very poor courtesy indeed simply to ask him 
               <br />
               to sit at the table of conference and give 
               <br />
               him no information whatever. But I will 
               <br />
               take the statement of Mr. Haultain. My 
               <br />

               <br />
               take the liberty of reading it again, so that 
               <br />
               the House may appreciate whether there 
               <br />
               has been any fault on my part or on the part 
               <br />
               of my colleagues on the sub—committee, or 
               <br />
               whether Mr. Haultain is making a case 
               <br />
               which, as I have said, it would have been 
               <br />
               better for him not to have attempted. Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain says :

               So it appears, according to this testimony 
               <br />
               of Mr. Haultain, that this matter was con- 
               <br />
               sidered twice by the conference—on the 
               <br />
               Friday previous to the 21st of February, 
               <br />
               and again on the let of February. Now, 
               <br />
               Sir, I do not propose, like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Mr.</span> Haultain, to 
               <br />
               go into the particulars of what took place 
               <br />
               there, but I will take his own language. 
               <br />
               True it is that we differed on several mat- 
               <br />
               ters with Mr. Haultain. True it is, as he 
               <br />
               says, that we differed with him on the land 
               <br />
               question. Mr. Haultain was of opinion that 
               <br />
               the land should be given to the provinces. 
               <br />
               We thought, on the contrary, that the land 
               <br />
               should be kept in the hands of the Dominion 
               <br />
               government. I have already given the rea- 
               <br />
               sons for that, and I think those reasons, 
               <br />
               when they come to be discussed, will stand 
               <br />
               good in the judgment of every one. Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain differed with us also in regard to 
               <br />
               the subject of irrigation. We thought that 
               <br />
               subject should go to those who have the 
               <br />
               management of the land, because the two 
               <br />
               are intimately connected. Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               refers to the fact that we proposed to es- 
               <br />
               tablish two provinces instead of one. We 
               <br />
               differed from Mr. __Haultain on this point 
               <br />
               also. We thought it would be preferable 
               <br />
               to have two provinces in that vast domain ; 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Haultain thought it would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">better'to</span> 
               <br />
               have only one province. But I appeal to the 
               <br />
               judgment of my hon. friend who has taken 
               <br />
               us to task because we have not adopted the 
               <br />
               ways and means of Mr. Hanltain, and I 
               <br />
               ask him if he is prepared to say that there 
               <br />
               shall be one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province</span> in that immense terri- 
               <br />
               tory instead of two—that we should create 
               <br />
               there one province which would have al- 
               <br />
               mbst twice the area of the largest province 
               <br />
               of the Dominion. Whatever may be the 
               <br />
               views of Mr. Haultain on this subject, the 
               <br />
               government came to a different conclusion, 
               <br />
               and our action in this regard, as on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every»</span> 
               <br />
               thing else, is in the judgment of the House. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But now I come to the principal point 
               <br />
               made by Mr. Haultain—that the education 
               <br />
               clauses did not receive fair consideration. 
               <br />
               As IMr. Haultain says, this question was 
               <br />
               debated on the Friday previous to the 21st 
               <br />
               of February. Mr. Haultain calls this a 
               <br />
               casual consideration only. Well, Sir, this 
               <br />
               is the result of having no record of what 
               <br />
               took place. What may have been casual 
               <br />
               to Mr. Haultaiu may have been thorough to 
               <br />
               somebody else; what may have been only 
               <br />
               passing to him, may have been suﬂicient 
               <br />
               for somebody else. On this I have only to 
               <br />
               say that the discussions which took place on 
               <br />
               the 21st of February between Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               and members of Council there revealed this 
               <br />
               fact, that while he held one view, we held 
               <br />
               another, with regard to the educational 
               <br />
               clauses. As Mr. Haultain has laid down 
               <br />
               his views in his memorandum, I shall not 
               <br />
               commit any breach of privacy if I say what 
               <br />
               his views were. Mr. Haultain took the 
               <br />
               ground that section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act applied mechanically to those 
               <br />
               new provinces. The ground we took was 
               <br />
               that section 93 of the British North'America 
               <br />
               Act did not apply mechanically, but that 
               <br />
               it should be made to apply in the legislation 
               <br />
               we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁered</span> to the House, subject only to 
               <br />
               such modiﬁcations as the circumstances of 
               <br />
               the new provinces would warrant. That 
               <br />
               was, therefore, a distinct difference of 
               <br />
               opinion between us and Mr. Haultain. The 
               <br />
               Bills before the House indicate what our 
               <br />
               position was. The letter of Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               speaks of the views he laid before the com- 
               <br />
               mittee of Council. Those views were that 
               <br />
               section 93 of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act applied mechanically to those provinces, 
               <br />
               and that there was, therefore, no necessity 
               <br />
               of going beyond section 2 of the Bill. But 
               <br />
               we said: No; we agree with you that 
               <br />
               section 93 must go into this Bill, but we 
               <br />
               think it should be done legislatively, subject 
               <br />
               to such modiﬁcations as are called for by 
               <br />
               the present condition of the people. There 
               <br />
               was the subject of difference. Therefore, 
               <br />
