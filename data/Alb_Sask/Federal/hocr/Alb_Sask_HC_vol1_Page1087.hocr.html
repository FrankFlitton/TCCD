               So. throughout all the documents leading 
               <br />
               up to the transfer of this territory to Can- 
               <br />
               ada, stress is laid upon the fact that when 
               <br />
               this territory becomes part of Canada, it 
               <br />
               shall do so under and in accordance with 
               <br />
               the terms of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. Now, in that view et the case, and 
               <br />
               having the British North America Act im- 
               <br />
               ported into the Act of 1871, under which 
               <br />
               this Bill is brought down, it seems clear, 
               <br />
               according to my reason and judgment, that 
               <br />
               the whole Act applies, and that these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are entitled to the same measure of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“responsibility</span> as the other provinces under 
               <br />
               all the sections of the Act, except where 
               <br />
               by direct statement <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> reasonable intend- 
               <br />
               ment only one or more provinces and not 
               <br />
               all the provinces is intended. That being 
               <br />
               the case, it seems to me that section 93 
               <br />
               applies to the Territories referred to in this 
               <br />
               Bill. It seems to me that section 93 applies 
               <br />
               by force and operation of the law, and, by 
               <br />
               section 2 of the Bill it is made to apply 
               <br />
               expressly, for it is so stated in the section, 
               <br />
               and the side note states ‘British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> Am- 
               <br />
               erica <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act,</span> 1867 to 1886 to apply.’ And 
               <br />
               so the minority in that province will have 
               <br />
               every beneﬁt of these sections and every 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of the law. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And,</span> whatever the 
               <br />
               law may be, in all parts ot‘ Canada, the 
               <br />
               minority equally with the majority have to 
               <br />
               submit. It may be that to-morrow the mino— 
               <br />
               rity may be seeking the protection of the 
               <br />
               statute that is now being invoked; they 
               <br />
               may need the protection of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. It does seem to me that it is 
               <br />
               better that the law should he lived up to. 
               <br />
               that in these matters we should, as it were, 
               <br />
               hue to the line, and that the law as laid down 
               <br />
               in our constitution should be maintained 
               <br />
               with regard to all classes of the community. 
               <br />
               A nd I believe that the minority in this coun- 
               <br />
               try have no desire to wrest from the major- 
               <br />
               ity anything to which they are not entitled. 
               <br />
               Moreover. I believe that the minority in 
               <br />
               these new provinces will receive a larger 
               <br />
               measure of justice if they are left to their 
               <br />
               legal rights.

               Now, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sir,</span> I have said that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> hon. leader of

               the opposition made it a point that the merits

               and demerits of separate schools did not enter 
               <br />
               into this discussion. Hon. genblemen opposite 
               <br />
               apparently did not think so, and I have won- 
               <br />
               der-ed too how some of them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.couild</span> bring them-

               full dual system of sectarian schools in the

               <br />
               a great detriment to those new provinces, but

               Now, Sir, upon this legal proposition, I do 
               <br />
               ask some consideration at the hands of my hon. 
               <br />
               friends. If .I am right, as I think I am, I can- 
               <br />
               not endorse the view of the leader of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, nor can I endorse the View of the 
               <br />
               leader of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposition,</span> because I think that 
               <br />
               in the event of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">litigation</span> over this

               <br />
               vary it, you will have a system of separate 
               <br />
               school-s imposed upon these provinces, a more 
               <br />
               effective syst-em, in the interests of supporters 
               <br />
               of separate schools, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{than</span> the present clause 16. 
               <br />
               In that respect I agree with the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Beaurharnois (Mr. Bergeron), who made the 
               <br />
               suggestion last night that such would be the 
               <br />
               result. Now, if that is so, I ask again for pro- 
               <br />
               tection in that regard for those who think as 
               <br />
               I do upon that question. It is necessary to vary 
               <br />
               this Act if you want to get rid of the effect of 
               <br />
               clause 93 of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> British North America Act, and 
               <br />
               to do that you will have .to insent in this Bill 
               <br />
               some such clause as that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(provinces</span> shall 
               <br />
               have unconditionally the exclusive right to 
               <br />
               legislate on educational <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matters.</span> If you do not 
               <br />
               do that, then I say that the constitution will 
               <br />
               take its course, and the courts will decide that
