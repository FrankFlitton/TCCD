               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cut</span> that in two. Next. like a detective 
               <br />
               with a supposed criminal, he had to make 
               <br />
               his schedules ﬁgure out 23 constituencies. 
               <br />
               giving two additioan ones to the north: 
               <br />
               and by that means he would get 13 north

               <br />
