               There was (a) difference between the two 
               <br />
               cases, in the Northwest Territories there were

               That statement to my mind is most signi- 
               <br />
               ﬁcant because it was made in the year 1869, 
               <br />
               the very year when the surrender was 
               <br />
               taken from the Hudson Bay Company ; and 
               <br />
               l am sure that‘ the First Minister and the 
               <br />
               Solicitor General will pardon the more ob- 
               <br />
               scure members from the west if we venture 
               <br />
               to differ from them in opinion, backed as 
               <br />
               we are by the statements of these men at 
               <br />
               the very time the contract went through. 
               <br />
               These were the views that prevailed at 
               <br />
               that time ; and in the consideration of this 
               <br />
               question we look to our fellow-citizens in 
               <br />
               the other provinces to admit our right to be 
               <br />
               put on an equal footing with them and be 
               <br />
               given the administration of our own public 
               <br />
               domain. I have shown what the arrange- 
               <br />
               ments were when the four original provinces 
               <br />
               entered confederation. Let us trace what 
               <br />
               the subsequent arrangements were in the 
               <br />
               case of those provinces which entered later.

               British Columbia, which entered in 1870, 
               <br />
               was a colony entitled to its public lands, 
               <br />
               and not only has it control of its lands, but 
               <br />
               the Dominion pays it annually the sum of 
               <br />
