               made an argument this afternoon that 
               <br />
               would be true if one fact was not forgotten. 
               <br />
               He said, Why don’t you go to Ontario and 
               <br />
               raise a cry about the use of the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage there ? For the very reason given by 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister a moment ago, that by 
               <br />
               the spirit of the constitution of this country 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario is not a creation of 
               <br />
               ours ; it was a sovereign colony when it en- 
               <br />
               tered the confederation in 1867, and the 
               <br />
               French language had no ofﬁcial recognition 
               <br />
               there at that time. But the representatives 
               <br />
               of Ontario as well as the representatives of 
               <br />
               Quebec declared, the ﬁrst time they made 
               <br />
               a new province, that the dual language 
               <br />
               would be ofﬁcial. The reason was obvious. 
               <br />
               What was the idea of parliament in 1870 
               <br />
               when they carved out the province of Maui— 
               <br />
               toba ? 
               <br />
               than merely to establish a new province. 
               <br />
               What were the words of Sir George E. Car- 
               <br />
               tier when he spoke of establishing for the 
               <br />

               toba, but the rest of our territory will not be 
               <br />
               organized on the same basis ? No, but what

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> said was this :

               <br />

               northwestern provinces ? We desire to prove 
               <br />
               that the agreement between the English and 
               <br />
               the French still endures.

               The Solicitor General. I was sorry to hear, 
               <br />
               made an argument this afternoon that be- 
               <br />
               cause the French Canadian-s are less numer- 
               <br />
               ous in the Northwest than the Germans. or 
               <br />
               the Scandinavians or the Doukhobors, there 
               <br />
               is no reason to grant us the ofﬁcial use of 
               <br />
               the French language. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               argued that it would not be fair to ask for 
               <br />
               the oﬂicial use of French because we were 
               <br />
               only a small percentage of the population 
               <br />
               in those provinces. Sir. a question like that 
               <br />
               which was considered by the fathers of 
               <br />
               confederation and by the framers of the 
               <br />
               Manitoba Act. is not one of those that can 
               <br />
               be settled by quoting ﬁgures. What are we 
               <br />
               doing at the present time by this legisla- 
               <br />
               tion ? We are not creating two provinces 
               <br />
               for ﬁve years. or ten years. What will be 
               <br />
               the character of the population of those pro-
