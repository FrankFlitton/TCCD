               that responsibility, but we do not admit a 
               <br />
               responsibility which properly rests upon the

               bring into this discussion the very people

               ed that this distribution is for the purpose 
               <br />
               of giving a preponderance of representation

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">OLIVER.</span> My hon. friend seeks to 
               <br />
               get away from the point. It is not a ques- 
               <br />
               tion of the premier of the Territories but 
               <br />
               of the legislature of the Territories. We 
               <br />
               are not questioning the action or the pro- 
               <br />
               posed action of the hon. the premier; we 
               <br />
               have had evidence within the past two or 
               <br />
               three weeks of his partisanship, of his read- 
               <br />
               iness to prostitute his premiership to the 
               <br />
               interests of hon. gentlemen on the other 
               <br />
               side. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘We</span> do not suggest that his personad 
               <br />
               view is any better than that of any other 
               <br />
               individual in the Northwest Territories, but 
               <br />
               we do suggest that as premier of the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories it is his right, it is within his power, 
               <br />
               it is his bounden duty, if an injustice is 
               <br />
               being done to the people of those Terri- 
               <br />
               tories by this Bill, to call the legislature 
               <br />
               and let the voice of the legislature be heard. 
               <br />
               Talk from the premier of the Territories is 
               <br />
               of no account; it is votes that count in the 
               <br />
               Territories, as it is votes that count here. 
               <br />
               Let him speak through his legislature and I 
               <br />
               will guarantee he will be heard and the 
               <br />
               voice of the legislature will be heard as 
               <br />
               well, but so far our friend the premier of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories has been content 
               <br />
