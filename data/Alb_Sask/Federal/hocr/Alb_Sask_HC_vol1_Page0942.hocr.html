               Catholic minority in the Northwest Terri—

               them. No Quebec Protestant, that news-

               <br />

               <br />
               of Quebec and at the same time give his

               the Catholic minority in the Territories 
               <br />
               similar rights and privileges. Sir, under the 
               <br />
               system now established in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, we have an ideal province, in which 
               <br />
               both Catholic and Protestant live side by 
               <br />
               side in perfect peace and harmony. Side 
               <br />
               by side they work out in harmony their 
               <br />
               municipal institutions, and in none of our 
               <br />
               political movements is the question of race 
               <br />
               and religion ever made an issue. We have 
               <br />
               in this House members from that province, 
               <br />
               who are Protestants, and yet are elected by 
               <br />
               constituencies, the large majority of which 
               <br />
               is French Canadian and Roman Catholic. 
               <br />
               We see the same thing in our municipal 
               <br />
               institutions, showing the disposition <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.the</span> 
               <br />
               ' part of the majority there to be just and 
               <br />
               even generous and meet their fellow citizens 
               <br />
               of different races and creeds more than 
               <br />
               half way. The result is peace, harmony 
               <br />
               and a good understanding. Well, if that be 
               <br />
               good policy in the province of Quebec, why 
               <br />
               should it not be good policy in other por- 
               <br />
               tions of the Dominion ? But has that policy 
               <br />
               always been carried out in the other prov- 
               <br />
               inces ? Who does not remember that the 
               <br />
               great Conservative party in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario fought two election campaigns on 
               <br />
               a proposal to curtail the privileges of the 
               <br />
               minority in that province and cripple their 
               <br />
               separate school system ? And if we con- 
               <br />
               trast that policy with the policy which has 
               <br />
               always been pursued in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, all of us who wish to be at all 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fail-minded</span> must admit that the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority in Quebec has been given far 
               <br />
               better treatment than that given the Catholic 
               <br />
               minority in the province of Ontario. -Then 
               <br />
               take the province of Manitoba. There cannot 
               <br />
               be the slightest doubt that the Dominion 
               <br />
               parliament intended to give the minority 
               <br />
               there separate schools. But one ﬁne day 
               <br />
               these schools were abolished by provincial 
               <br />
               legislation. And even in the Territories, a 
               <br />
               good deal of the same disposition has been 
               <br />
               shown. Do you think, Mr. Speaker, that 
               <br />
               that is right ? Do you think it is fair ‘? Do 
               <br />
               you think that that is living up to the spirit 
               <br />
               of our constitution and giving equal rights 
               <br />
               to all? We have men standing up in this 
               <br />
               House and telling us to trust the west. 
               <br />
               Well; after all that has happened in the 
               <br />
               great west, can anybody, can any fair mind- 
               <br />
               ed man blame the minority if it should dis- 
               <br />
               play a spirit of suspicion and apprehension. 
               <br />
               Why, it seems to me that nobody could 
               <br />
               argue with any fairness that the minority 
               <br />
               there have not any good ground for insist- 
               <br />

               the use of such appeals in connection with- 
               <br />
               this debate. Why, the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey (Mr. Sproule) even dragged in 
               <br />
               here a quotation which credited the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic church with making France a na- 
               <br />
               tion of atheists and illiterates. I do not 
               <br />
               suppose he did that to promote good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">relao</span> 
               <br />
               tions between the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂerent</span> elements of our 
               <br />
               population; I do not suppose he did it as 
               <br />
               holding out the olive branch to those who 
               <br />
               differ from him in religion. I fancy he did 
               <br />
               it for party purposes, that he did it with 
               <br />
               a View to making party capital. This af- 
               <br />
               ternoon that hon. gentleman denied the im- 
               <br />
               putation that he had done anything to set 
               <br />
               the heather on ﬁre. In accounting for his 
               <br />
               knowledge of the Bill in advance of its 
               <br />
               presentation to the House, he said that a 
               <br />
               little bird had whispered that something 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> this sort was likely to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introduced,</span> 
               <br />
               that this parliament would stand by the 
               <br />
               pledges it had given the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west and would enact legislation that would 
               <br />
               guarantee equal rights to the people of that 
               <br />
               great country. And at once he tells us, he 
               <br />
               saw that something was going to happen, 
               <br />
               that feeling was going to be stirred up, and 
               <br />
               so he sent out a warning to the people of 
               <br />
               Canada to look out, for passions were going 
               <br />
               to be stirred up. This, the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               assures us, he was not trying to do, in fact 
               <br />
               he was trying to prevent it. But, I think, 
               <br />
               that with all the facts before us, perhaps, 
               <br />
               we should take that statement with a grain 
               <br />
               of salt. The hon. gentleman sent out a— 
               <br />
               manifesto addressed to the members of this 
               <br />
               House—a manifesto in the interest of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peace,</span> 
               <br />
               as he said, to bring the people closer to— 
               <br />
               gether, to make us better friends. And he 
               <br />
               winds up with these words—that is, the 
               <br />
               order which sent it out with his approval 
               <br />
