               the conclusion that what they meant to do 
               <br />
               was to establish the system of separate

               <br />
               of that country for all future time. Mr. 
               <br />
               Scott is a lawyer; but I do not present his 
               <br />

               not presenting a legal argument; I quote 
               <br />
               these words simply to show that Mr. Scott, 
               <br />
               representing the government of the day, 
               <br />
               judged by the language he used, must have 
               <br />
               contemplated that the clause which they 
               <br />
               then adopted was intended, even though we 
               <br />
               might have the power to repeal it, to con—

               <br />

               tinguished leader of the Conservative op-

               position in the Senate at that time, Sir 
               <br />
               Alexander Campbell, also discussed the 
               <br />
               question. Sir Alexander Campbell was a 
               <br />
               lawyer, and for a time was Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice. He refers to an amendment which 
               <br />
               had been removed by Mr. Aikins, to strike 
               <br />
               out the separate school clause, and this is 
               <br />
               what he said : 
               <br />

               It would be much to be regretted if the 
               <br />
               amendment passed. The object of the Bill was 
               <br />
               to establish and perpetuate in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories the same system as prevailed in 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec, and which had worked so 
               <br />
               well in the interest of peace and harmony with 
               <br />
               the different populations of these provinces.

               <br />
               one, for all races and creeds, was to adopt the 
               <br />
               suggestion of the government and enable the 
               <br />
               people to establish separate schools in the ter-

               <br />
               evils from which Ontario and Quebec had suf— 
               <br />
               fered, but had judiciously rid themselves.

               Is it possible to attach to that language 
               <br />
               any other meaning than that Sir Alexander 
               <br />

               I have no doubt, from information that 
               <br />
               has reached me, that many immigrants have 
               <br />
               come into the Northwest Territories upon 
               <br />
               representations that the schools there would 
               <br />
               be conducted in accordance with their re- 
               <br />
               ligious views. I believe this to be cor- 
               <br />
               rect. I may mention a little incident bear- 
               <br />
               ing on that point. I had occasion recently 
               <br />
               to come into ofﬁcial contact with the re- 
               <br />
               presentative of one of the continental na- 
               <br />
               tions. I was discussing with him the ques— 
               <br />
               tion of immigration—we wished to have im- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">migrantscome</span> to Canada from his country. 
               <br />
               In the course of our conversation he said: 
               <br />
               If you are to get immigrants from our coun- 
               <br />
               try, this school question that is coming up 
               <br />
               becomes one of very great importance to 
               <br />
               us. I have no doubt therefore that it can 
               <br />
               be shown that some of the immigrants who 
               <br />
               have come to the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               have come—for we have many Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic settlers in that country—on the 
               <br />
               faith of representations that their schools 
               <br />
               were to be conducted in accordance with 
               <br />
               the views of the Roman Catholic minority.

               I ﬁnd that not only is there the evidence 
               <br />
               I have referred to, showing the intention 
               <br />
               at the time this Act was passed, but later on 
               <br />
               there were further discussions which may 
               <br />
               be cited in the same direction. I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               some years afterwards, in 1894, there was 
               <br />
               a discussion in this House with regard to 
               <br />
               some amendments of the Northwest Act 
               <br />
               that were proposed. I ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               late Mr. Dalton McCarthy, who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">de</span> 
               <br />
               sired that the separate school clause 
               <br />
               should be repealed, who was an oppo- 
               <br />
               nent of separate schools as hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               well remember, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘in</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speech,</span> at that time laid 
               <br />
               down the principle that if you should con- 
               <br />
               tinue to allow that separate school clause 
               <br />
               to remain on the statute—book, if you should 
               <br />
               go on year after year allowing the North- 
               <br />
               west people to possess this system of sep- 
               <br />
               ate schools up to the moment at which they 
               <br />
               would be brought in as a province, then they 
               <br />
               would be in a position to come to us and 
               <br />
               say: It is too late for you to change that 
               <br />
