               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I would like to ask 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister as to one matter that I 
               <br />
               do not think has been very clearly brought 
               <br />
               out by any information laid before the 
               <br />
               House, and that is what quantity of actually 
               <br />
               good land there is in the Northwest in each 
               <br />
               of these provinces, suitable for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span> 
               <br />
               purposes. The reason I ask is that a rather 
               <br />
               extraordinary statement was made by one 
               <br />
               of the hon. gentlemen from the Northwest, 
               <br />
               the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Strathcona</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Talbot). 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst place he says : 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There is another reason why it is best for 
               <br />
               the federal government to administer those 
               <br />
               lands. It may not be considered a good reason 
               <br />
               by some, but I think the experience of most ot 
               <br />
               the other provinces will give some weight to it. 
               <br />
               It is this. We might <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> some future time have 
               <br />
               a careless or extravagant government in one or 
               <br />
               both of the new provinces. If such a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span> did 
               <br />
               happen our resources would rapidly disappear, 
               <br />
               and we might in a. very few <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> be compelled 
               <br />
               to appeal to extensive direct taxation.

               I myself would not be inclined to think 
               <br />
               there was any greater danger in that regard 
               <br />
               from entrusting the lands to provincial con- 
               <br />
               trol than from leaving them in the control of 
               <br />
               the gover lent of Canada. There is 
               <br />
               certainly no more reason to apprehend a 
               <br />
               reckless or extravagant government in the 
               <br />
               Territories than there is to apprehend such 
               <br />
               a government in theDominion as a whole. 
               <br />
               Further than that, the direct and immediate 
               <br />
               interest of the people, the circumstances that 
               <br />
               the disposal of the lands would be a matter 
               <br />
               of immediate local concern, would seem to 
               <br />
               me to give greater security in that regard if 
               <br />
               they were under provincial control than that 
               <br />
               which might be expected to result from 
               <br />
               Dominion control. However, the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man of course is entitled to his opinions in 
               <br />
               that regard. But he went on to say some-

               thing else :

               <br />

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I am sorry 
               <br />
               that at this moment I cannot give my hon. 
               <br />
               friend information as to the exact quantity

               <br />
               tural purposes in these two new provinces. 
               <br />
               I could, however, make an effort to have a 
               <br />
               computation made, which I will do, and 
               <br />
               hope' to place in his hands at a very early 
               <br />
               date. Such information ought to be avail- 
               <br />
               able. I agree with my hon. friend that there 
               <br />
               is no more probability of a reckless govern- 
               <br />
               ment existing in those provinces than there 
               <br />
               is here at Ottawa. We remember that there 
               <br />
               has been a reckless government at Ottawa in 
               <br />
               the past, and there may be again. But if 
               <br />
               there is a reckless government at Ottawa. 
               <br />
               the consequences to the people in the deple- 
               <br />
               tion of their assets would be less grave than 
               <br />
               would be the case if there was a reckless 
               <br />
               government in the Northwest Territories. If 
               <br />
               the lands were left under the control of the 
               <br />
               provinces the temptation would be very 
               <br />
               great to waste them, as the lands would 
               <br />
               afford them a ready asset to meet their lia- 
               <br />
               bilities ; whereas if there were such a thing 
               <br />
               as a reckless government in Ottawa, they 
               <br />
               would have other resources to draw upon 
               <br />
               besides the lands. Therefore I should think 
               <br />
               the observation of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Strathcona was not Without some found- 
               <br />
               ation. As to the character of the lands, I 
               <br />
               must say that I am a little surprised at the 
               <br />
               description given of them by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Strathcona. My impression at the 
               <br />
               present time is that, with a very small excep- 
               <br />
               tion, especially in the province of Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan. all the lands are available, either for 
               <br />
               ranching or for agriculture, by far the 
               <br />
               greater proportion. I do not know how 
               <br />
               much waste land there is. I understand 
               <br />
               there is very little swamp land, as there is 
               <br />
               in Manitoba. At the same time, I cannot 
               <br />
               give the information to my hon. friend he 
               <br />
               asks for. but when we take up this question 
               <br />
               again I hope to be able to give him the in- 
               <br />
               formation.

               Mr. LAKE. I wish to make the remark,

               amongst others, that no money is sufﬁ-
