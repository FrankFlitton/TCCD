               under these Bills. But I do think that the

               debt. Therefore, I claim that the basis of 
               <br />
               this account should not be a population of 
               <br />
               125,000. Manitoba last year received from 
               <br />
               this source $178,947, whereas the new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro«</span> 
               <br />
               vinces are to receive half—yearly 5 per cent 
               <br />
               on $8.170,500, or an annual payment of 
               <br />
               $405,375, which is more than twice as much 
               <br />
               as the little province of Manitoba is receiv— 
               <br />
               ing, although its population is much larger. 
               <br />
               Another claim I would like to make for the 
               <br />
               province is a claim of $110,825.07, which 
               <br />
               was allowed to the other provinces on this 
               <br />
               account at the time of the better—terms 
               <br />
               agreement. And, in order to bring this mat- 
               <br />
               ter more clearly before you, let me call your 
               <br />
               attention to a letter which was addressed 
               <br />
               to this government by Hon. D. H. McMillan, 
               <br />
               who was then, in 1895, treasurer of the pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The second matter of difference refers to an 
               <br />
               item of $110,825.07, which was allowed on an 
               <br />
               adjustment of capital account by chapter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4.</span> 
               <br />
               Statutes of Canada, 1884. This amount was not 
               <br />
               allowed as a part of the future annual revenue 
               <br />
               ot the province, but ﬁxed as compensation for 
               <br />
               an amount which the province should have re- 
               <br />
               ceived in former years. A similar allowance 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> made to the other provinces. When the 
               <br />
               Act for conﬁrming the settlement of 1385 was 
               <br />
               passed, no mention was made of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> sum. and 
               <br />
               it was apparently dropped on the assumption 
               <br />
               that it was conm-pensated for by the other con- 
               <br />
               cessions made to the province. There was 
               <br />
               nothing in the negotiations to warrant this 
               <br />
               view. and Mr. N'orquay maintained that the 
               <br />
               exact contrary was understood in the negotia- 
               <br />
               tions. and that the passing of the Act in the 
               <br />
               form in which it was passed was clearly an 
               <br />
