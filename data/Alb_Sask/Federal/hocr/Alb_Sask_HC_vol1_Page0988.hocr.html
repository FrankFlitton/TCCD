               trol over the administration of both classes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               schools. The law does not permit religious in— 
               <br />
               struction to be taught in either school during 
               <br />
               school hours, but any schools may be opened in 
               <br />
               the morning by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reading</span> of the Lord’s prayer. 
               <br />
               Thus it will be seen that the separate school 
               <br />
               teachers are required to pass the qualifying ex— 
               <br />
               aminations, as are public school teachers. The 
               <br />
               school books are the same in each <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case.‘</span> The 
               <br />
               schools are opened in the same manner, are 
               <br />
               subject to the same inspection, and must come 
               <br />
               up to the same standard of elﬁciency. The 
               <br />
               teaching day ends at half-past three. Then, 
               <br />
               and not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">till</span> then, is any religious instruction 
               <br />
               permitted. Thus it will be seen that during 
               <br />
               school hours in no respect does a separate 
               <br />
               school differ from a public school.
