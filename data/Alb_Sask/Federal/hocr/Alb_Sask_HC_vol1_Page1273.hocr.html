               Mr. HERRON. As to the dividing line 
               <br />
               between the two provinces, I do not see how 
               <br />
               the conclusion is reached that it should be as 
               <br />
               is here proposed. What was at one time 
               <br />
               supposed to be a grazing country in Alberta 
               <br />
               has now turned out to be an agricultural 
               <br />
               country—that is perfectly true. As between 
               <br />
               an agricultural country and what is known 
               <br />
               to stockmen as a stock country there is a 
               <br />
               marked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diiferenice.</span> In carrying on agri— 
               <br />
               culture there is nothing to take any particu- 
               <br />
               lar harm because of severe weather. But, 
               <br />
               when stock has to run out the year around 
               <br />
               with no means of shelter provided, there is 
               <br />
               a vast difference. The country referred to 
               <br />
               by the hon. minister, no doubt, is that in the 
               <br />
               foothills of the Rocky mountains which has 
               <br />
               turned out to be a very admirable agricul- 
               <br />
               tural country. But I do not think there is a 
               <br />
               stockman of any experience in Canada to— 
               <br />
               day who would ever think of turning a herd 
               <br />
               of cattle loose in the country about Moose- 
               <br />
               jaw or in Prince Albert country or about 
               <br />
               Regina. There is only one place in our 
               <br />
               country, as I said a few nights ago that is a 
               <br />
               genuine stock country, and the eastern 
               <br />
               boundary of that country is from sixty 
               <br />
               to seventy miles east of where the present 
               <br />
               proposed boundary line runs. If you go be- 
               <br />
               yond that, you reach a country where, stock 
               <br />
               will not live out the year round. There is no 
               <br />
               use in a man trying to draw comparisons be- 
               <br />
               tween range and other cattle, for the reason 
               <br />

               <br />

               they run out the year round. They are only 
               <br />
               handled twice a year. The boundary line as

               <br />
               I make that statement as a matter of fact, 
               <br />
               and I do not think that any man who knows 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">facts</span> will dispute it. I have been over 
               <br />
               that country and have ranged cattle upon it. 
               <br />
               Now, there are 15,000 cattle brands in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories at the present time. 
               <br />
               Of course, some of these apply to cattle in 
               <br />
               the eastern portions of the country where 
               <br />
               they have this class of stock that is housed 
               <br />
               in winter and looked after by their owners 
               <br />
               in summer. But the great majority of these 
               <br />
               brands are for cattle running in what is 
               <br />
               known as the range country. The clashing 
               <br />
               of brands is a very serious thing. I said 
               <br />
               the other evening in the House that hundreds 
               <br />
               of thousands of cattle running in__ the stock 
               <br />
               country are known to their owners only by 
               <br />
               these brands. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now if one province establishes one brand 
               <br />
               law and another province a different brand 
               <br />
               law you can easily see the difﬁcult position 
               <br />
               the stock interest would be in. When cattle 
               <br />
               would drift <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:from</span> one province to another 
               <br />
               great confusion would result. I think this 
               <br />
               government is aware of the difﬁculties that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Avere</span> occasioned «by stock running across 
               <br />
               the international boundary line, and if I 
               <br />
               am not mistaken, a serious international 
               <br />
               question is under consideration at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent moment between this government and 
               <br />
               that of the United States in consequence o_f 
               <br />
               a seizure of stock that had drifted across 
               <br />
               the boundary line. There will be no dan- 
               <br />
               ger in our case of international troubles, 
               <br />
               but there might be serious commercial 
               <br />
               trouble to the two provinces. So I think 
               <br />
               the line proposed by the member for Cal- 
               <br />
               gary would be a very acceptable line <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.to</span> 
               <br />
               the stockmen, a line running to the 8th 
               <br />
               range west of the 3rd meridian to the 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, and then west to any 
               <br />
               range decided upon going north. I think 
               <br />
               that would be an acceptable line to the 
               <br />
               stockmen.

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. The hon. gentle-

               man said there were about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘15.000</span> brands

               registered in the Northwest Territories;

               could he tell me what proportion of those 
               <br />
               brands are registered in that part of the

               Mr. HERRON. I would think about 
               <br />
               20 per cent of those brands are registered 
               <br />
               east of the boundary, or east of the line that 
               <br />
               I would recommend. There might be 10 
               <br />
               per cent east of that. But probably these 
               <br />
               cattle would be branded similarly, because 
               <br />
               they would go further from home. They 
               <br />
               are different from barnyard cattle, because 
               <br />
               if they were with adjoining stock that 
               <br />
               was running wild it would be necessary to 
               <br />
               put a brand on them, because cattle that 
               <br />
               get into these wild herds are only found 
               <br />
               by their owners once a year. There is a
