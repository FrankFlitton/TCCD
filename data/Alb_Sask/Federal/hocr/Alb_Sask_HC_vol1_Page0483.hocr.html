               <br />

               <br />
               the westerners back. He recalls the artful 
               <br />
               method resorted to by Armour of Chicago. in 
               <br />

               the slaughter house. As they smell danger 
               <br />
               from afar. Armour keeps a large Mexican steer, 
               <br />
               fat and sleek, which he has trained to rush into 
               <br />

               all the others follow; the gates close behind,
