               Sir, I shall not refer to the hierarchy 
               <br />
               and the Quebec ecclesiastics. I think this 
               <br />
               question has been threshed out in the mas— 
               <br />

               <br />
               from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). I do not wish 
               <br />
               to pose as the defender of the Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lic clergy in this House. As a Liberal, I 
               <br />
               have, during the few years that I have 
               <br />
               been in public life felt at times the inter— 
               <br />
               ference of the clergy in politics. I will

               say nothing however in condemnation of

               the clergy of my province, as they acted 
               <br />
               within their rights as citizens, but I can say 
               <br />
               this, that the history of the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               clergy in this country‘ is its best vindication.

               My hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) 
               <br />

               not stay one hour more in the country, 
               <br />
