               appeal, we exert a certain control over

               Lastly, Mr. Speaker, if the legislatures of

               <br />
               to it ourselves and once for all. Sincerity 
               <br />
               is a grand virtue, greatly prized in private

               be willing to permit that all the provinces,

               mind, which testimony ﬁlls me with pride; 
               <br />

               Now, another objection has been raised; 
               <br />
               it has been contended that such legislation 
               <br />
               should be referred to the courts. I claim 
               <br />
               that such a contention is not new. Judges are 
               <br />
               appointed by parliament, or, at any rate by 
               <br />
               the government as representing the majority 
               <br />
               of the members, and while the courts are 
               <br />
               entrusted with the duty of applying the law, 
               <br />
               it devolves on paliament to enact it. I see 
               <br />
               no reason why, under these circumstances, 
               <br />
               the creative power should be superseded by 
               <br />
               the power it has created. We have here the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Justice who is the ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               head of the bench in all of the provinces. 
               <br />
               We have here a number of lawyers, of legal 
               <br />
               gentlemen, some of whom will become 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judges</span> without being possessed of a greater 
               <br />

               of my frankness. As for those who favour

               factory, want to see it accepted as such by 
               <br />
               all, they forget that everything in society, in 
               <br />
               the universe, is relative; that such a system 
               <br />
               which answers perfectly well the needs of 
               <br />

               requirements of somebody else. Those who 
               <br />
               start on such a narrow basis, who have only 
               <br />
               one term of comparison and who, utterly 
               <br />
               uncompromising, want the state to dis-

               tribute justice and protection to its citizens 
               <br />

               <br />
               views, while at the same time they claim 
               <br />
               equal rights for all, they recall to my mind 
               <br />
               the levelling theory of a certain monarch 
               <br />
               in olden times. Having put it into his head 
               <br />
               to etablish absolute equality in his domain, 
               <br />
               he took his own stature as a standard which 
               <br />
               all his subjects should conform to; he ordered 
               <br />
               his oﬂicers and soldiers to take hold in the 
               <br />
               cities and throughout the country of all tall 
               <br />
               men and to cut them down to the required 
               <br />
               height, while on the other hand smaller men 
               <br />
               were to be stretched out until they reached 
               <br />
               the full royal stature. While there may be 
               <br />
               men in this House who understand equality 
               <br />
               in that fashion, fortunately there are others
