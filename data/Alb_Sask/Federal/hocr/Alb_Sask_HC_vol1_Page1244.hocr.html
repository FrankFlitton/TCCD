               Mr. CRAWFORD. In connection with the. 
               <br />
               remarks of the leader of the opposition who 
               <br />
               attempted to call down the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior, I took down the words of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brantford (Mr. Cockshutt), and 
               <br />
               I do not see that any construction can be 
               <br />
               placed upon them other than that given by 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior. The hon. 
               <br />
               member, in referring to the matter, said: 
               <br />
               Get right class of settlers ; go slow and wait 
               <br />
               for settlement. These are the words he used 
               <br />
               in speaking of the immigration to this coun— 
               <br />
               try. Well, I happened to go into some of 
               <br />
               the details in connection with the cost of 
               <br />
               bringing immigrants to this country, and 
               <br />
               the information I got from the Immigratiox 
               <br />
               Department was that the American <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settlers</span> 
               <br />
               cost the country less per head than any 
               <br />
               others and that the British immigrants had 
               <br />
               more money spent on them than any other 
               <br />
               class. There was more spent on British 
               <br />
               immigration per head than any other class 
               <br />
               of people.

               brought more money into this country per
