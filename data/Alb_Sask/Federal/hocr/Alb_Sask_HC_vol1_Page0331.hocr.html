               the House rose at six o’clock, I was reading

               <br />
               the government because he could not agree 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> originally presented, and when he spoke 
               <br />
               here he seemed to take a great deal of 
               <br />
               pride in the fact that the government had 
               <br />
               amended that clause and substituted for it 
               <br />
               the provision as to separate schools which 
               <br />
               we are now discussing. We have had it 
               <br />
               stated throughout the country, by the friends 
               <br />
               of the government in some quarters, that 
               <br />
               the government had not changed their policy 
               <br />
               on this question, and that the amended 
               <br />
               clause is in effect the same as clause 16, the 
               <br />
               clitference being only in the phraseology.

               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) says, and he seems to know 
               <br />
               all about it, it is quite clear that he carried 
               <br />
               his point against the government, against 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
