               sometimes they are not granted. In this 
               <br />
               case I have not with me the petition that 
               <br />
               was presented for the extension, but I sup- 
               <br />
               pose that the reasons alleged were well- 
               <br />
               founded. I may mention that there are some 
               <br />
               ﬁshing waters where there is no close sea- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">son</span> at all. lIt depends entirely upon the 
               <br />
               circumstances of the case.

               Mr. PREFONTAINE. The ice-breaker is 
               <br />
               all right. She is anchored in clear water 
               <br />
               and communication is maintained with her 
               <br />
               by means of small boats, so that there 
               <br />
               is no danger at all to either the crew or 
               <br />
               the boat. An explanation of how the recent 
               <br />
               accident happened will appear in a report 
               <br />
               which I am getting from the captain. The 
               <br />
               facts are simply these. The ice-breaker broke 
               <br />
               the remnant of the ice bridge that had 
               <br />
               formed during the time she was out of work. 
               <br />
               About eight or nine hundred feet of ice 
               <br />
               remained unbroken. She went through that 
               <br />
               ice and broke it entirely. It created a move- 
               <br />
               ment of the whole body of ice which was 
               <br />
               lying on both sides of the channel, and 
               <br />
               that closed the channel so that the boat was 
               <br />
               unable to follow the ice and go back to 
               <br />
               Quebec. She remained behind and anchor- 
               <br />
               ed in clear water. That vast mass of ice
