               We have seen, in the interview with the

               educational clauses in this Bill have already 
               <br />

               intention of the government to change these

               <br />
               not put it 01f, allowing this bitterness to in-

               surely it would have been wiser on the part

               of the government to ﬁnd out what their

               the Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />
               will owe a deep apology in connection with 
               <br />
               this Autonomy Bill. I refer to his admirer— 
               <br />
               his late admirer—the man who has been for

               <br />
               of the right hon. Dr. Jekyll-Laurier in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">864</span>

               pages. He will now have to write the bio-

               graphy of the right hon. Mr. Hyde-Laurier, 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of Canada. It is a great 
               <br />
               misfortune for Mr. Willison that he had not 
               <br />
               a t‘ull knowledge of his subject before he 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’wrote</span> the right hon. gentleman’s biography. 
               <br />
               The man wrote the life of that strange dual 
               <br />
               character Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde knew 
               <br />
               from the very beginning of his writing the 
               <br />
               two sides of the man, and so was able to 
               <br />
               make his biography complete in every part. 
               <br />
               But Mr. Willison in his 864 pages, saw only 
               <br />
               one side of the character he was portraying. 
               <br />
               And now he has to undo all he has written

               to make a few observations with regard to 
               <br />
               the constitutional aspect of these Bills. The 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, as we know, were 
               <br />
               admitted into the Dominion in 1871,, pur- 
               <br />
               suant to section 146 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. When these Territories were 
               <br />
               admitted into Canada, they did not come in 
               <br />
               in the same way as other provinces had 
               <br />
               done. 'Dhey did not come in as the British 
               <br />

               Canada therefore under this section of 
               <br />
               the Blitish \oith America Act of 1871 was 
               <br />
               given full power to give these Teriitories 
               <br />
               such laws as, in its judgment, seemed wise, 
               <br />
               during the time they w e1e territor.ies Can— 
               <br />
               ada accordingly passed an Act which is 
               <br />
               known as the Northwest Territories Act of 
               <br />
               1875. Powers of local self- government were 
               <br />
               given these Territories, so that they could 
               <br />
               look after their own local affairs. Subse- 
               <br />
               quently these powers were from time to 
               <br />
               time. extended, and further powers were 
               <br />
               given as the circumstances made necessary. 
               <br />
               Let us consider for a moment the circum- 
               <br />
               stances surrounding the Act of 1875, the 
               <br />
               original Act granting local self-government 
               <br />
               to the Territories, so far as educational 
               <br />
               matters are concerned. We know that the 
               <br />
               Bill which. when passed. became the Act of 
               <br />
               1875. was brought down by the then Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, Hon. Alexander Mackenzie. It 
               <br />
               had no educational clauses. However, Hon. 
               <br />
               Edward Blake, whom we all know to be a 
               <br />
               staunch Protestant. pointed out the fact that 
               <br />
               the Bill did not contain any provision in re- 
               <br />
               spect of separate schools. Accordingly the 
               <br />
               suggestion was made to introduce section 
               <br />
               11, giving to the minority, Protestant or 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic, the right to establish sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools, and empowering the rate— 
               <br />
               payers, P1otestant or Roman Catholic. 
               <br />
               establishing schools, to be liable to assess- 
               <br />
               ment only for such rates as they might im- 
               <br />
               pose on themselves in respect of then 
               <br />
               schools. I may say that. this clause 11 was 
               <br />
               passed unanimously by the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons at that time. Some comments were 
               <br />
               made in favour of it. and it was approved 
               <br />
