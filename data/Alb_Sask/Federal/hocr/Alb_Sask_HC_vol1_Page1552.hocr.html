               constituency north of that line, that has

               tunity of doing so now, but looking at the

               map the only constituencies they have left 
               <br />
               unaltered are the constituencies in the 
               <br />
               southern part of this province according to 
               <br />
               this distribution carved out by two mem—

               bers from the northern part of the province 
               <br />
               in the month of February. Why is this div- 
               <br />
               ision unfair ? I would ask the First Minis- 
               <br />
               ter to look at the map. On May 1st, 1902, 
               <br />
               that country was divided up into local con- 
               <br />
               stituencies by the legislative assembly at 
               <br />
               Regina. As has been stated there were 15 
               <br />
               constituencies in Alberta, and as the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of the Interior has stated, nine of these 
               <br />
               constituencies were south of township 38 
               <br />
               and 6 north. There has never been any 
               <br />

               The member for Strathcona (Mr. P. Talbot) 
               <br />
               sat in the local assembly at Regina, and I 
               <br />
               venture to state that he will not say he 
               <br />
               ever raised his voice objecting to that div-

               ision at that time.
