               thing to base your action upon and it seems

               that you have based it simply upon the 
               <br />
               number of school districts. A fairer basis 
               <br />
               would be to get the number of schools and 
               <br />
               the number of children <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attending</span> these

               schools in each district. Where will the 
               <br />
               number of school districts lead you unless 
               <br />
               you know whether there are 5, 10 or 50 
               <br />
               Children attending a certain school? You

               you ﬁnd the number of children attending

               the schools in the different districts, but if

               Mr. FOSTER. We have the post oﬁîce,

               <br />
               oﬂice does not indicate much. You might

               would probably serve a large colony. Sim-

               ply the number of post otﬁces authorized

               is open to the same objection as the

               number of school districts and even 
               <br />
               more. I know for instance that where

               <br />
               possible, to give them a post ofﬁce, but the

               number of people that the post ofﬁce ac— 
               <br />
