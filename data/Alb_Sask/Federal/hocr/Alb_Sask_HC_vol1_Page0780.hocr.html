               religious strife in this country. Why ? 
               <br />
               Hon. gentlemen opposite have tried to place 
               <br />
               the responsibility for this on the government 
               <br />
               and on the Prime Minister especially. Sir, 
               <br />
               in any Autonomy Bill like this, whoever 
               <br />
               may frame it, it is necessary to specify in

               regard to education just as much as it is 
               <br />
               necessary to specify in regard to anything 
               <br />
               else with regard to the formation of the 
               <br />
               new provinces. No government could frame 
               <br />
               an Autonomy Bill without introducing an 
               <br />
               educational clause. The provisions of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act cannot apply 
               <br />
               under the peculiar circumstances and con-

               peculiar or special advantages for knowing

               what these clauses were to be and were, I

               down to parliament—both the ﬁrst clause 
               <br />

               as much as any Catholic member of the gov-

               <br />

               The clauses have been explained and dis- 
               <br />
               cussed over and over again, and it is not my

               I think I understand them both, and I am

               responsible for both as much as anybody

               <br />
               what would go on in this country and what 
               <br />
