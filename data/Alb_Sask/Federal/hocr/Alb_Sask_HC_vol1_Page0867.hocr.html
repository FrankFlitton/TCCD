               Sir, I have been surprised at some of the 
               <br />
               arguments addressed by hon. members on 
               <br />
               the government side of the House as a 
               <br />
               reason why these Bills in their present 
               <br />
               form should be supported by this House. 
               <br />
               Some hon. members have gone so far as to 
               <br />
               say that the passage of these Bills in one 
               <br />
               form or their defeat in another might 
               <br />
               mean the defeat of this government, 
               <br />
               that might mean the driving <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“from</span>

               power of the right hom gentleman

               <br />
               would be a thousand times better that this 
               <br />

               The sentiment expressed in regard to the 
               <br />
               defeat of the government or the driving of

               unpatriotic, and I hope that no hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle.</span>

               the vote on this question behind any such 
               <br />
               subterfuge as this. Since the introduction 
               <br />
               of these Bills a great change has come over 
               <br />
               some of the government supporters. It is 
               <br />
               pretty evident that the right hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               with the cat-o’-nine fails in his hand, has 
               <br />
               been able to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whip</span> his followers into line 
               <br />
               upon this question, but 1 venture to think 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman will waken up 
               <br />
               one of these days to the fact that he cannot, 
               <br />
               with the whip in his hand, whip the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion of Canada into line, and I believe the 
               <br />
               people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> this country will wrest that power 
               <br />
               from the right hon. gentleman and will ad- 
               <br />
               minister such a castigation as the insin- 
               <br />
               cerity displayed by the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               in this matter so richly deserves, and as 
               <br />
               the dominating powers have brought upon 
               <br />
               him. It is a well-recognized principle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">od?</span> 
               <br />
               legislation in all civilized communities, and 
               <br />
               one that I have never heard questioned, that 
               <br />
               all legislation should be so directed as to do 
               <br />
               the greatest good for the greatest number, 
               <br />
               and liberty is the boasted bulwark of the 
               <br />
               British constitution. I do not believe that 
               <br />
               by such legislation as that now before us 
               <br />
               the principle I have enunciated can be main- 
               <br />
               tained, nor can liberty be upheld if we are 
               <br />
               legislating for a class as against the mass, 
               <br />
               or asserting the principle of coercion as 
               <br />
               against the principle of liberty. I have 
               <br />
               taken some pains to read the constitution 
               <br />
               and the constitutional history of this coun- 
               <br />
               try, and while I acknowledge the fact that 
               <br />
               lawyers will differ, perhaps the view of 
               <br />
               this matter that has appealed to me will 
               <br />
               be such that some hon. members or the pub- 
               <br />
               lic will be able to gain some knowledge 
               <br />
               from it. I have searched the constitution 
               <br />
               in vain to ﬁnd one word, clause or para- 
               <br />
               graph that makes it incumbent upon this 
               <br />
               parliament to legislate in regard to educa- 
               <br />
               tion in these new provinces. Especially is 
               <br />
               this so in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">initiator-y</span> stages of this legis- 
               <br />
               lation. But, Sir, I ﬁnd that there is a pro- 
               <br />
               hibition contained in the words in the 93rd 
               <br />
               section of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
