               Speaker, in beginning to speak on this

               to you to listen to some of these long drawn 
               <br />
               out addresses that have hardly touched the

               question under discussion, listening to quota-

               attack made on both sides of the House, the 
               <br />
               same hairsplitting, the same twisting of

               language to suit the object of the different

               which there is now but little left to be said.

               It was natural that hon. members from the

               this Bill and they have expressed themselves 
               <br />
               most freely. I have been struck with the 
               <br />
               remarkable unanimity amongst these mem— 
               <br />
               bers as to the position they take in regard to 
               <br />
               the school question. They seem to think 
               <br />
               that the law as it now stands is all right, 
               <br />

               <br />
               be inaugurated for the Northwest. I think 
               <br />
               in such a case it would be right to incorpor-

               <br />
               very much, and that is that this discussion, 
               <br />
               although weary, has not been in vain. We 
               <br />
               are learning more of Canada, we are realiz-

               been the brightest jewel in this whole

               <br />
               hon. friends from the province of Quebec, it 
               <br />
               has amazed me how these men can speak so 
               <br />
               eloquently in a language which is foreign 
               <br />
               to them. It has broadened my patriotism 
               <br />
               and increased my admiration of my fellow 
               <br />
               countrymen of the province of Quebec to 
               <br />

               speaking Protestant as the speaker of their 
               <br />
               legislative assembly in a province which is 
               <br />
               largely composed of French Canadians. 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia is particularly to be envied.

               Solid eighteen! What a Liberal paradise 
               <br />
               this must be and such a bunch of ﬁne repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives! I have had .to admire a great 
               <br />
               many of the men from the west as well. 
               <br />
               Nearly all the speakers have said that this 
               <br />
               was the most important Bill that was ever 
               <br />
               presented to this House. Possibly it is true, 
               <br />
               but I think, if it is not one of the most 
               <br />
               important since confederation, it is the most 
               <br />
               remarkable. It gives to the two new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces a constitution. It deals with the difﬁ- 
               <br />
               cult matter of boundaries and it makes 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial arrangements for the conduct of 
               <br />
               the business of these new provinces. It 
               <br />
               makes provision for education, and yet such 
               <br />
               judgment has been exercised in the drafting 
               <br />
               of this Bill and so carefully has it been 
               <br />
               worded that there has practically been no 
               <br />
               discussion on any of the points of this Bill 
               <br />
               save on that in regard to education. The 
               <br />
               new provinces have accepted this Bill in its 
               <br />
               entirety. The school clauses have been en- 
               <br />
               dorsed by publicopinion and the reception 
               <br />
               given to the newly appointed Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior (Mr. Oliver) in the most important 
               <br />
               constituency between Winnipeg and the 
               <br />
               Rocky Mountains is a most signiﬁcant evi- 
               <br />
               dence of the feeling of the people in the 
               <br />
               west. The receptions which have been ac- 
               <br />
               corded him after his election at Calgary and 
               <br />
               Winnipeg have shown the unanimity of the 
               <br />
               western people in connection with this Bill. 
               <br />
               I am sure everybody will rejoice on July 
               <br />
               lst, when these Bills are brought into oper- 
               <br />
               ation and the new provinces are allowed to 
               <br />
               take their places in confederation. Let us 
               <br />
               look for a few moments at the details. The 
               <br />
               boundaries have been marked out in a way 
               <br />
               to meet with the general approval of the 
               <br />
               people in the west. It is true that the hon. 
               <br />
               ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               raised some objection and that the hon. mem- 
               <br />

               <br />
               that possibly something could be done to
