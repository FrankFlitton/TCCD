               Yet, I might have hoped that my hon. friend

               would abstain on this occasion from referr-

               <br />
               not in his seat, from a cause which, we 
               <br />
               might have hoped, would appeal to the hon.

               do I think his remarks were at all called 
               <br />
               for, in directing the attention of the House 
               <br />
               to the fact that the Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> James Sutherland) has not been

               in his place in this House during the pre- 
               <br />
               sent session. The fact is correctly stated, 
               <br />
               and, perhaps, under different circumstances, 
               <br />
               no fault could be found with the observa- 
               <br />
               tions which my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Bor- 
               <br />
               den) has made. But I was under the im- 
               <br />
               pression that the well known cause of the 
               <br />
               absence from the House of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works would warrant everybody in 
               <br />
               allowing that absence to pass without re- 
               <br />
               mark. The hon. gentleman (Mr. James 
               <br />
               Sutherland) has been absent from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this?</span> 
               <br />
               House because of the state of his health. 
               <br />
               I am reminded that, some six or seven years 
               <br />
               ago. when another of my colleagues. the 
               <br />
               Minister of Militia (Sir Frederick <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Borden)?</span> 
               <br />
               having suffered a severe shock in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railway!</span> 
               <br />
               accident, was absent from this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament)</span> 
               <br />
               for a whole session. not a word was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ever‘</span> 
               <br />
               uttered upon the subject. Everybody un-‘ 
               <br />
               derstood the circumstances and hoped that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman would resume his duties 
               <br />
               as we hope that the hon. Minister of Public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               Works will, in the near future, be able to 
               <br />
               resume his place. And that is the reason 
               <br />
               why the absence of the Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works should not be commented upon. My <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">!</span> 
               <br />
               hon. friend «Mr. R. L. Borden) has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">referred}</span> 
               <br />
               to a rumour that the Minister of Public' 
               <br />
               Works has tendered his resignation to me.I 
               <br />
               I would have preferred not to speak <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon?</span> 
               <br />
               this subject. I do not know that the House 
               <br />
               expects me to speak upon it even after 
               <br />
               the reference to it made by my hon. friend. 
               <br />
               Still, I. may say that the Minster of Public 
               <br />
               Works has not placed his resignation in my 
               <br />
               hands. When he told me that he was in 
               <br />
               poor health and could not attend to the 
               <br />
               business of the session, I took it upon my- 
               <br />
               self to say to him, ' My friend, you had bet- 
               <br />

               <br />

               ber of the House will be glad to know that 
               <br />
               there is hope that you will soon come back 
               <br />

               Now, it is true that my hon. friend has 
               <br />
               not been replaced yet. How many days 
               <br />
               have elapsed since he resigned his portfolio? 
               <br />
               Just thirty-one days. But, before I come 
               <br />
               to that, let me say that I do not think there 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the Interior and what took place some 
               <br />
               ten years ago, in 1895. Then we saw a 
               <br />
               very different spectacle—members coming 
               <br />
               in and members going out, members resign- 
               <br />
               ing one day and taking back their resigna- 
               <br />
               tion the following day, or the following 
               <br />
               week, members absent from parliament, 
               <br />
               not because they were called away a few 
               <br />
               days for any reason, but members not in 
               <br />
               their seats because they were neither in nor 
               <br />
               out of the government, and because they 
               <br />
               did not appear to know what position they 
               <br />
               occupied. There is nothing of the kind 
               <br />
               here, we know where we are, at all events. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But</span> when there are disagreements amongst 
               <br />
               ministers. the honourable course is for the 
               <br />
               dissenting minister to proffer his resigna- 
               <br />
               tion, and to say to the Prime Minister: I 
               <br />
               do not agree with your policy. This is what 
               <br />
               has taken place; and therefore there is no 
               <br />
               analogy whatever between what took place 
               <br />
               in 1895 and what is taking place to-day. 
               <br />
               It is true. as I say, that the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Brandon has not been replaced in the 
               <br />
               cabinet. My hon. friend the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition asks, for what cause ? Is it any 
               <br />
               lack of material? Perhaps it may be for 
               <br />
               an opposite cause, perhaps it is too abundant 
               <br />
               material. There is such a thing as an em— 
               <br />
               barras de richesse, although my hon. friend 
               <br />
               appears to be suffering from the reverse, 
               <br />
               he is suffering from penury. while we on 
               <br />
               this side are suffering from abundance and 
               <br />
               that may be just as good a reason as the 
               <br />
               reason suggested by my hon. friend.

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I do not know 
               <br />
               but that would be a good reason, I will think 
               <br />
               of it. It might be well to have two ministers 
               <br />
               instead of one; but I am sure that if I 
               <br />
               were to ask parliament for an appropriation 
               <br />
               for another minister my hon. friend would 
               <br />
               be one of the ﬁrst to object. he would not 
               <br />
               allow us to do it. However, we will have 
               <br />
               to be content with one Minister of the In— 
               <br />
               terior, that is all we are called upon to ap- 
               <br />
               point. I do not think my hon. friend can 
               <br />
               charge the government with negligence be— 
               <br />
               cause it has not appointed another minister 
               <br />
               to a portfolio which has been vacant only 
               <br />
               thirty-one days. I do not think there has 
               <br />
               been any negligence whatever, on the con- 
               <br />
               trary I think the government has done right 
               <br />
