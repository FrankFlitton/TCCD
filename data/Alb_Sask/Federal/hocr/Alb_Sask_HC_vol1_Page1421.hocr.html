               Which has been quoted this evening, is pub- 
               <br />
               lished. We have in Nova Scotia a great 
               <br />
               many Orangemen. I know a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">many,</span> I 
               <br />
               have grown up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">among</span> them, and I have yet. 
               <br />
               to hear in Nova Scotia a word offensive 
               <br />
               said by any one in that country of any man 
               <br />
               simply because he happens to bean Orange- 
               <br />
               man. I have never heard anything of the 
               <br />
               kind. We respect the Orangemen and we 
               <br />
               respect the society to which they belong, but 
               <br />
               I will tell you what we do not respect. We 
               <br />
               do not respect any man who plays on his 
               <br />
               position. If a man cannot give himself pro- 
               <br />
               minence in this country except by parading 
               <br />
               his position, for that man the Yoemanry of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia have no respect, and they can- 
               <br />
               not conceal the feelings contrary to respect 
               <br />
               which they hold regarding any individual of 
               <br />
               that character. I do not think that there is 
               <br />
               the slightest necessity for parading Orange- 
               <br />
               ism in this House, or for men in this House 
               <br />
               trading on their position as Orange leaders. 
               <br />
               I cannot imagine anything more ridiculous 
               <br />
               than to see a gentleman standing in this 
               <br />
               House and declaring that he cannot get a 
               <br />
               hearing because he is standing up for Pro— 
               <br />
               testantism. Why, about 90 per cent of this 
               <br />
               House are Protestants largely representing 
               <br />
               the Protestant people. How ridiculous 
               <br />
               therefore it must appear to see a man stand 
               <br />
               up here and say he will not be given a 
               <br />
               hearing because he is championing the 
               <br />
               Protestant cause. Nothing can be more 
               <br />
               ablsurd. I am a Pnotsltnnt myself, 
               <br />
               and largely represent a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestant</span> dis- 
               <br />
               trict, but at the same time I do not 
               <br />
               for one moment allow anybody to stand up 
               <br />
               in this House, without a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protestand</span> say he 
               <br />
               is speaking for Protestantism. There is no 
               <br />
               neceSSity for his doing so. There is no 
               <br />
               offence to Protestantism ever committed in 
               <br />
               this House and nothing offensive said re- 
               <br />
               garding it and no offence intended. The 
               <br />
               rights of Protestantism are here absolutely 
               <br />
               secured, and nobody need trail his coat 
               <br />
               along, to use an Irish expression, in order 
               <br />
               to see if any one will tramp on it and thus 
               <br />
               give him the opportunity of saying: I am 
               <br />
               the appointed leader of Protestantism and 
               <br />
               bound to defend it, and whatis said to me is. 
               <br />
               an insult to Protestants.

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SvPROULE.</span> W’hy, the very name 
               <br />
               was mentioned over and over again. The 
               <br />
               colour has been spoken of. I have been 
               <br />
               referred to as an ‘ Orangiste,’ and as parad- 
               <br />
               ing my orangism, and my name has been 
               <br />
               frequently mentioned in connection with 
               <br />
               petitions sent in by members of that body. 
               <br />
               I read a quotation from the Halifax ‘ Chro- 
               <br />
               nicle’ to which my attention had been 
               <br />
               drawn by Orangemen from the district of 
               <br />
               the hon. member (Mr. D. D. Mackenzie) 
               <br />
               who spoke just now, and which I recog- 
               <br />
               nized, and which other papers have com- 
               <br />
               mented on in the same sense. I say that 
               <br />
               paragraph was intended as a deliberate 
               <br />
               insult to the Orange Association. And the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Cape Breton (Mr. D. D. 
               <br />
               Mackenzie) has many Orangemen in his 
               <br />
               constituency who supported him and have 
               <br />
               written me that they supported him, but, 
               <br />
               who, I say, will resent such insults, as 
               <br />
               will Orangemen in other portions of the 
               <br />
               country. Though I have never posed as 
               <br />
               an Orangeman, I have received scant cour— 
               <br />
               tesy at the hands of hon. gentlemen oppo- 
               <br />
               site from whom I was entitled to the con- 
               <br />
               sideration due to a member of this House, 
               <br />
               because I have always extended that con- 
               <br />
               sideratiOn to others. I have been here for 
               <br />
               twenty-seven years, and I have always 
               <br />
               treated every hon. member of this House 
               <br />
               with due respect. If when a member was 
               <br />
               speaking I desired to ask a question, I 
               <br />
               have always asked permission to do so. 
               <br />
               But often when I have risen to ask leave 
               <br />
               in this way, a howl has gone up from the 
               <br />
               other side, as though I were not entitled 
               <br />
               to respectful hearing which should be given 
               <br />
               to every member of this House. Why was 
               <br />
               this ? I can attribute it to no other cause 
               <br />
               than the fact that I belonged to the Orange 
               <br />
               Association and for that reason was 
               <br />
               thought by some hon. gentleman to be un- 
               <br />
               worthy the courtesy Which should be ob- 
               <br />
               served between members of this House. It 
               <br />
               may be thought by some that I might rea- 
               <br />
               sonably expect that treatment from Roman

               Catholics, though I claim that, having 
               <br />
               treated them with due respect, I had a 
               <br />
               right to expect similar treatment in return. 
               <br />

               who ought to have had more respect for 
               <br />
               themselves and for the country to which 
               <br />
               they belong.
