               we may have a useful and workable piece

               cultural constituency and being a practical 
               <br />
               farmer myself, I have taken a very deep 
               <br />
               interest indeed in the Bill introduced by my 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span> friend regarding the inspection and 
               <br />
               sale of clover and other seeds, and I desire 
               <br />
               to compliment the hon. gentleman for what 
               <br />
               I believe is an honest effort on his part to 
               <br />
               bring about such legislation as will enable 
               <br />
               our farmers to obtain clean and pure seeds. 
               <br />
               I fear, however, that the provisions of this 
               <br />
               Bill will not have the desired effect, either 
               <br />
               as regards the farmers or the merchants, 
               <br />
               and certainly not that which the hon. min- 
               <br />
               ister himself desires. I am convinced that 
               <br />
               if it should become law, it will decrease the 
               <br />
               price of clover seeds which the farmers have 
               <br />
               to sell and increase the price to those farm- 
               <br />
               ers who have to buy it, and who are the 
               <br />
               only members of our community who would 
               <br />
               after all require to purchase. Let me illus— 
               <br />
               trate my argument. Let us take say four 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farmers</span> who have each 'ten bushels of 
               <br />
               clover seed to sell. The Bill provides that 
               <br />
               a farmer may sell his seed to another farm- 
               <br />
               er Without coming under the provisions of 
               <br />
               this measure: but if a farmer should have 
               <br />
               to go around among his neighbours and 
               <br />
               peddle his seed, that would not be only a 
               <br />
               humiliating position for him to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occupy,</span> but 
               <br />
               he would soon find that he would not get 
               <br />
               much sale for it. I fail to see how we can 
               <br />
               very well dispense with the services of the

               our seeds. Then when farmer No. 1 brings 
               <br />
               his ten bushels of seed to the merchant, the- 
               <br />
               merchant, with his keen eye or glass, ﬁnds- 
               <br />
               that it contains noxious seeds, and he says : 
               <br />
               There is an inspection law at present and 
               <br />
               this seed will not stand inspection and 
               <br />
               grade as No. 1, consequently I can only give 
               <br />
               you a low price for it. The farmer, who 
               <br />
               has no other recourse, must take the price 
               <br />
               offered. When farmer No. 2 comes with 
               <br />
               his ten bushels, the merchant says to him : 
               <br />
               Your seed is not quite so good as that which 
               <br />
               I have just got, because it contains a quanti- 
               <br />
               ty of oxeye daisy, mustard and other bad 
               <br />
               seeds, and consequently I can only give you 
               <br />
               a low price. The farmer, of course, must 
               <br />
               take the price offered, and his seed is 
               <br />
               dumped into the same bin with that of 
               <br />
               farmer <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’No.</span> 1. Then comes along farmer 
               <br />
               No. 3, and the merchant says to him : Your 
               <br />
               seed contains a certain proportion of noxious 
               <br />
               seed, and I can only give you a low price. 
               <br />
               The farmer again cannot help himself, and 
               <br />
               sells at the price offered, and the merchant 
               <br />
               dumps No. 3 seed into the same bin with 
               <br />
               the others. Then farmer No. 4 appears on 
               <br />
               the scene, and his. ten bushels are fairly 
               <br />
               good seed. The merchant says: I cannot 
               <br />
               detect very much noxious seed in your ten 
               <br />
               bushels and I will give you a fairly good 
               <br />
               price, and he buys it and dumps that also 
               <br />
               into the same bin. So that there are forty 
               <br />
               bushels in the same bin. Then the inspec- 
               <br />
               tor comes along, dips out a little of the 
               <br />
               seed from the bin, examines it and grades 
               <br />
               it as No. 1. When a purchaser comes to buy 
               <br />
               some clover seed, the merchant says to 
               <br />
               him : I have here a bin graded No. 1 by the 
               <br />
               government inspector, but I must charge 
               <br />
               a big price for it; but the purchaser, of 
               <br />
               course, can do nothing else but buy, and he 
               <br />
               gets his portion from the top. Another pur— 
               <br />
               chaser comes, and another, and so on. But 
               <br />
               at each sale the merchant has to dip deeper 
               <br />
               into the bin ; and according as the quantity 
               <br />
               in the bin decreases, the quality of the seed 
               <br />
               becomes worse. But it has all been graded 
               <br />
               as No. 1, and the last purchaser pays the 
               <br />
               same price as the ﬁrst. So that the farmer 
               <br />
               who sells has to take a low price, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whereas</span> 
               <br />
               those who buy have to pay a big price, and 
               <br />
               the proﬁt is to the merchant, who. of course, 
               <br />
               in view of the uncertainties and difﬁculties 
               <br />
               with which the law surrounds him, is en- 
               <br />
               titled to a fairly good price in order to en- 
               <br />
               able him to handle the goods at all. Any 
               <br />
               legislation which turns against the interests 
               <br />
               of the farmer should be most carefully con- 
               <br />
               sidered. If the 'Minister of Agriculture 
               <br />
               could devise some means for winnowing out 
               <br />
               the noxious seeds from the good, thereby 
               <br />
               giving to the farmer the clean seed on the 
               <br />
               one hand and the noxious weed seed on the 
               <br />
               other. There could be no objection to this 
               <br />
               measure, but so far, we have no 
               <br />
               machine which will accomplish that. 
               <br />
