               and that of Wilfrid Laurier, as political men 
               <br />
               on the educational question. The former has 
               <br />
               done for his people a work as durable as gran- 
               <br />
               ite. The latter, of his own free will, places his 
               <br />
               co—religionists in a position of manifest inferi- 
               <br />
               ority. Such was the work of both men from a 
               <br />
               purely political point of view.

               Lastly, a word as to the religious aspect of 
               <br />
               the question; it is clear that Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier, as a Catholic statesman, is perfectly 
               <br />
               satisﬁed of practically neutral schools for his 
               <br />
               co-religionists. Head over again attentively 
               <br />
               the discription which he makes of the so-called 
               <br />
               separate schools which exist in the west, which 
               <br />
               his Bill proposes to maintain, which our people 
               <br />
               must accept, and which the Protestants are 
               <br />
               humbly requested to tolerate, and you will see 
               <br />
               that they are really neutral or national schools, 
               <br />
               because, in the mind of Sir Wilfrid Laurier the 
               <br />
               two terms are synonymous.

               Where is the separation in these schools from 
               <br />
               a religious point of view ? It does not exist 
               <br />
               more than it does from the national point of 
               <br />
               view. They are institutions which are neutral, 
               <br />
               neutral. absolutely neutral.

               The famous half hour of religious teaching at

               essentially national and neutral character of 
               <br />
               the class itself. Mr. Laurier proclaims this
