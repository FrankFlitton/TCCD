               Minister of Canada has always exercised 
               <br />
               from the beginning of his public life, in fact 
               <br />
               before he could have been considered to 
               <br />
               be a public man, in resisting what ap- 
               <br />
               peared to him to be any undue effort 
               <br />
               upon the part of the Catholic Church to 
               <br />

               Toronto ‘ News ’ written also and edited by 
               <br />
               Mr. Willison. I ﬁnd in the Toronto ‘News’ 
               <br />
               expressions, not of admiration but of con- 
               <br />
               demnation for the Prime Minister; not of 
               <br />
               conﬁdence but of fear and mistrust. I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               in the Toronto ‘ News’ that the premier is 
               <br />
               credited, not with being a hero but with be- 
               <br />
               ing a coward; not with being able to resist 
               <br />
               the attacks of the Roman Catholic Church, 
               <br />
               if such attacks are made, but as being a 
               <br />
               slave of the Roman Catholic Church. Then 
               <br />
               I say, what a wonderful change in two years, 
               <br />
               and I ask : In whom has this change taken 
               <br />
               place ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Is</span> the change in the man of whom 
               <br />
               the words were written, or is the change 
               <br />
               in the man who wrote the words ? I look 
               <br />
               at.the Prime Minister and I say: Surely 
               <br />
               his position is not changed. Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier, two years ago; Sir Wilfrid Lau- 
               <br />
               rier nine years ago was 'premier of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada. He then was as he is 
               <br />
               to-day leader of the Reform party, and I 
               <br />
               say to myself: If there has been so great a 
               <br />
               change in Sir Wilfrid Laurier there must 
               <br />
               have been a reason, there must have been 
               <br />
               a motive, and Where is the reason and 
               <br />
               where is the motive ? Having achieved such 
               <br />
               wonderful success, having won the admira- 
               <br />
               tion not only of the people of Canada but of 
               <br />
               every land upon the face of the globe, I ask : 
               <br />
               What could have been the reason which in- 
               <br />
               duced Sir Wilfrid Laurier to have departed 
               <br />
               from that which has been his course all his 
               <br />
               lifetime. Must not his ambitions be the 
               <br />
               same ; what is there to change his position ? 
               <br />
               I look at the Roman Catholic Church and I 
               <br />
               ask : Is this church possessed of any greater 
               <br />
               power to—day than it was two years ago 
               <br />
               when that biography was published, or even 
               <br />
               nine years ago ? Sir, I cannot see any rea- 
               <br />
               son to believe that the power of that church 
               <br />
               has been augmented. I remember that Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier did resist certain demands 
               <br />
               of the Roman Catholic Church nine years 
               <br />
               ago. Did it occasion him any loss? Has 
               <br />
               he sutt'ered any loss of power or popularity 
               <br />
               or any diminution in his following, or any 
               <br />
               loss of prestige? I cannot see that he has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffered</span> any loss whatever because of the 
               <br />
               action he took in 1896 or because of any 
               <br />
               action he has taken towards the Roman Ca- 
               <br />
               tholic Church all his life. Surely not having 
               <br />
               suffered any loss from the course he has 
               <br />

               Then I turn to Mr. Willison, the writer of 
               <br />
               a biography 01' the right hon. gentleman. 
               <br />
               Has there been any change in that gentle- 
               <br />

               <br />
               has been a change and a very radical one. 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd that when Mr. Willison wrote that 
               <br />
               biography he was a member of the Reform 
               <br />
               party and had been all his life a Reformer. 
               <br />
               But since then he has gone over to the ranks 
               <br />
               of the oppositibn, and, as usual in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such-</span>

               <br />
               been brought up in the fold. And I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that Mr. Willison is in the employ of a

               on its retaining the support of the Con-

               attitude, and I am sure that the change is 
               <br />
               not in the man of whom the words were 
               <br />

               Does any one doubt the motives that ac-

               <br />
               him to look at the Toronto ‘News’ of April 
               <br />

               <br />
               ready to do his bidding. There you ﬁnd the 
               <br />
