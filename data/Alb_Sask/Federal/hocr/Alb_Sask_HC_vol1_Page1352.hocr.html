               Mr. LENNOX. I understood the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice to virtually admit that the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories Representation Act is not 
               <br />
               satisfactory. It was suggested by the mem— 
               <br />
               ber for East Assiniboia that a number of 
               <br />
               certiﬁcates could not be granted, but it ap- 
               <br />
               pears from sections 40 and 48 of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories Representation Act that any 
               <br />
               number can be granted. Another diﬁiculty 
               <br />
               pointed out was as to the blank certiﬁcates 
               <br />
               which is a very serious matter in itself, and 
               <br />
               it was shown that there was no provision 
               <br />
               in the law to compel the enumerator to be 
               <br />
               present in his ofﬁce at certain hours when 
               <br />
               he might be required. I call the attention.
