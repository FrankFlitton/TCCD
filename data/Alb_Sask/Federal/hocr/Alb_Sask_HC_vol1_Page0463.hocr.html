               should give them a constitution which shall 
               <br />

               federation, and in doing so we must not for- 
               <br />
               get that these lands of the Northwest have 
               <br />
               been acquired, not by ‘Protestant Canada, 
               <br />
               but by the Canadian confederation, French 
               <br />
               and English, Protestant and Catholic. And, 
               <br />
               Sir, in view of the condition of certain 
               <br />
               minds in the country and in view of the 
               <br />
               agitation, fomented by certain narrow spirits 
               <br />
               it is most expedient that in giving these 
               <br />
               Territories autonomy there should be a clear 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               protected, not only against agitators from 
               <br />

               We have been told, lSir, many a time that

               we should trust the majority. This might 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               can we trust the majority there ? I need not
