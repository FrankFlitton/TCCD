               <br />
               which was to cover the whole of Rupert’s 
               <br />
               Land and the Northwest Territories._ What 
               <br />
               is Rupert’s Land ? Rupert's Land is all 
               <br />
               the territory which is washed by the waters 
               <br />
               which ﬂow into Hudson Bay and Hud- 
               <br />
               son straits. It is a very large territory. 
               <br />
               What is the Northwest ? It is all the terri- 
               <br />
               tory which was not included in Rupert’s

               cluded in one province was Rupert’s Land, 
               <br />
               which comprised part of Keewatin, part of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, the whole of Saskatchewan, the 
               <br />

               Mackenzie which was washed by the

               waters of Mackenzie river was the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. It was asked that the 
               <br />
               whole of this territory should be organized 
               <br />
               into one province. The prayer of the peti- 
               <br />
               tion was not granted. It was restricted to 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba and therefore my 
               <br />
               hon. friend will not ﬁnd it here. but if he 
               <br />
               refers to the Manitoba Act he will ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba was organized on 
               <br />
               the petition of these delegates but not or- 
               <br />
               ganized as they had asked it. The new pro- 
               <br />
               vince was conﬁned to a very small portion 
               <br />
               of that which they had asked to be organ- 
               <br />
               ized into a province and in which they had 
               <br />
               asked for the right to use the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage and to establish separate schools. 
               <br />
               Therefore, it is useless to say that the 
               <br />
               French language has been introduced into 
               <br />
               the Northwest, Rupert’s Land, Mackenzie 
               <br />
               and Saskatchewan.

               friend has argued that there is a consti-

               tutional compact. I admit there was a com- 
               <br />
               pact so far as Manitoba is concerned, but 
               <br />
               there was no compact with regard to Ru— 
               <br />
               pert’s Land except Manitoba. Therefore 
               <br />
               the whole argument of my hon. friend is 
               <br />
               absolutely without foundation. It is true, 
               <br />
               that the parliament of Canada at that time 
               <br />
               would not accede to the petition on behalf of 
               <br />
               the people of the Northwest Territories. and 
               <br />
               eight years later, in 1875, when Mr. Mac— 
               <br />
               kenzie introduced the Act for the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of the Northwest Territories, a clause 
               <br />
               was introduced with regard to the schools, 
               <br />
               but that clause was introduced not as a re- 
               <br />
               sult of this compact or of the petition of the 
               <br />
               delegates, but on the ground that it might 
               <br />
               avoid the difﬁculties which had taken place 
               <br />
               in other provinces, in regard to the educa- 
               <br />
               tion question. There was not a word <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> to 
               <br />
               the petition which had been presented in 
               <br />
               1870; there was not a word said about the 
               <br />
               Bill of Rights; all that was said was: let us 
               <br />
               introduce a school clause as a matter of

               the friction and the had blood which re-

               sulted elsewhere because separate schools 
               <br />
               were notgranted. In the original law intro- 
               <br />
               duced by Mr. Mackenzie in 1875, there Was 
               <br />
               not a single word about the language; it 
               <br />
               referred only to the schools. Two years 
               <br />
               afterwards an amendment to that law was 
               <br />
               brought from this House to the Senate by 
               <br />
               Mr. Girard, then a member of the Sen-ate, 
               <br />
               asking for the introduction of the French 
               <br />
               language into the Territories. Did Mr 
               <br />
               Girard base his case upon the ground laid 
               <br />
               down by the hon. member for Jacques 
               <br />
               Cartier and the hon. member for Beauhar— 
               <br />
               nois ; did he base his case upon the ground 
               <br />
               of an agreement or a compact or a Bill of 
               <br />
               Rights ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">=No.</span> Mr. Girard supported his case 
               <br />
               upon the ground of expediency, necessity 
               <br />
               and justice. Mr. Girard based his case on 
               <br />
               the fact that at that time there were as 
               <br />
               many French speaking people in the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories as there were English speaking peo- 
               <br />
               ple. He said: I believe the French Can- 
               <br />
               adians are just as numerous and more 
               <br />
               numerous than the English speaking people 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories and you cannot 
               <br />
               refuse us the use of our language. It was 
               <br />
               on that ground that the use of the French 
               <br />
               language was granted in 1877. It was not 
               <br />
               granted as the result of a compact or as 
               <br />
               a constitutional right, but simply as a con— 
               <br />
               cession to the inherent sentiments of justice.
