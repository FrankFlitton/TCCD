               <br />
               average for the whole of the province. He 
               <br />
               has just told us exactly how many votes 
               <br />
               were polled in each of these new constitu- 
               <br />
               encies, which he has been redistributing. 
               <br />
               How does he get at that? For instance, 
               <br />
               here I ﬁnd the polling division of Yellow 
               <br />
               Grass for the federal election had a voters’ 
               <br />
               list of 300 names. Right through the centre 
               <br />
               of that polling division, which is a very large 
               <br />
               one, containing some eight townships, goes 
               <br />
               the dividing line between the two consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies. How many does he reckon cast 
               <br />
               their votes on the west side of the divid- 
               <br />
               ing line and how many on the east side?

               Mr. SCOTT. It seems to me that when we 
               <br />
               have to come down to a dispute about ln— 
               <br />
               dividual cases in a matter dealing with so 
               <br />
               large an area, we pretty nearly bring the 
               <br />
               whole thing down to the level of farce. 
               <br />
               Nobody imagines that these ﬁgures are ac- 
               <br />
               curate, but they are approximately so. If 
               <br />
               there are divergencies on the one side, there 
               <br />
               will be corresponding divergencles on the 
               <br />
               other.
