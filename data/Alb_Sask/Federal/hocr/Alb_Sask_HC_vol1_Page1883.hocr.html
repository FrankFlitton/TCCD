               either abrogated, amended or changed by

               <br />
               the time when the amendment which I 
               <br />
               have just mentioned of my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of— Justice was submitted to the 
               <br />
               House I asked the hon. minister if it was 
               <br />
               not the case that the provision of 
               <br />
               law which had existed in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories ever since their com- 
               <br />
               plete organization regarding the local use 
               <br />
               of the French language was not con— 
               <br />
               tinued by this very Act, and if it was 
               <br />
               not the case that it was so continued. I 
               <br />
               pointed out that it might fairly be claimed 
               <br />
               by the local legislature that it was a pro- 
               <br />
               vincial matter and that consequently the 
               <br />
               legislatures of these two provinces might 
               <br />
               claim the right to abrogate that old disposi- 
               <br />
               tion of law and abolish completely the use 
               <br />
               of the French language. My hou. friend 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice was of the opinion, 
               <br />
               and no doubt correctly, that the" clause in 
               <br />
               the law was continued, tue clause which 
               <br />
               dates from the year 1877, but he also added 
               <br />
               that in his opinion it was a local matter 
               <br />
               and that the provincial legislature might 
               <br />
               validly abrogate that disposition of law. He 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> further declared that in his opinion it was 
               <br />
               a matter that should be left entirely to the 
               <br />
               discretion of the legislature. I do not wish 
               <br />
               to go too fully into the history of this legis—

               <br />
               tinued for many reasons, but there is so 
               <br />
               much ignorance abroad as to the circum—

               _stan‘ces under which the French language 
               <br />

               what was the origin of this legislation, in

               what sense it is to be considered as an

               <br />

               hon. members are no doubt aware, after the 
               <br />
               formation of the Canadian confederation and 
               <br />
               the passage of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               two members of the new Dominion cabinet, 
               <br />
               Sir George Cartier and the Hon. William 
               <br />
               Macdougall were deputed to England to in-

               have incorporated in the new confederation 
               <br />
               that vast territory in the west known as 
               <br />
               Rupert’s Land. These negotiations were 
               <br />
               successful and culminated in the passage by 
               <br />
               the imperial parliament in 1868 of the 
               <br />
               Rupert’s Land Act which gave power to the

               which we coveted the moment we became a 
               <br />
               confederation. Sir George Cartier and his 
               <br />
               colleague returned to Canada after the Order 
               <br />

               that territory having been settled, it be-

               came incorporated into the Dominion of Can- 
               <br />
               ada. Upon their return to Canada proceed— 
               <br />
               irgs were taken by the Dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment to take possession of this newly ac- 
               <br />
               quired territory. As hon. members are aware 
               <br />
               ——-it is a story that has been often told in 
               <br />
               this House—the inhabitants, then settled 
               <br />
               principally on the Red river, oﬂered a strenu- 
               <br />
               ous resistance to the taking possession of 
               <br />
               that territory by the Dominion government. 
               <br />
               They organized as a provincial government 
               <br />
               and prepared to resist violently the arrival 
               <br />
               of the new governor of these territories, the 
               <br />
               envoy of the Dominion government. We, 
               <br />
               on our side sent out an armed expedition 
               <br />
               with the knowledge and co-operation and 
               <br />
               assistance of the imperial authorities. At

               this juncture, and in order to avoid blood-
