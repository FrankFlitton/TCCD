               days agd in this House, I came to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that there was certainly a very ma- 
               <br />
               terial. change of front and I asked myself 
               <br />
               the question: What could have occasioned 
               <br />
               that change of front? Was it the fact that he 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has!</span> changed sides in this House? Was it 'the 
               <br />
               fact that he was no longer in power? After 
               <br />
               having given the matter careful considera- 
               <br />
               tion I came to the conclusion that it was 
               <br />
               due to neither of these things, it was due to 
               <br />
               a change of climate; the sudden change from 
               <br />
               the cooling breezes of the Atlantic ocean to 
               <br />
               the more contracted and sultry breezes from 
               <br />
               Toronto bay must have brought about the 
               <br />
               change of front displayed by that hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman. He said in that speech, in which 
               <br />
               he was very strong for toleration:

               years, while a priest was chairman of one

               board and I chairman of the other, always 
               <br />
               the kindliest relations existed between us, 
               <br />
               and nothing but courtesy prevailed between

               one and the other. I simply mention this

               from the member for East Grey (Mr.

               man of the ﬁnance committee of the Mon- 
               <br />
               treal city council, he was defeated in a 
               <br />
               French Canadian ward, and it being felt 
               <br />
               that his services were of great value to the 
               <br />
               city, one of the aldermen for St. Antoine 
               <br />
               ward resigned to give him theseat, and 
               <br />
               we, the Protestants of that ward, unani- 
               <br />
               mously elected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Mr.</span> Rolland. Here is an- 
               <br />
               other instance of the good feeling which 
               <br />
               exists among the people of different religions 
               <br />
               in the city of Montreal. We had a very 
               <br />
               saintly old priest there, the Reverend Father 
               <br />
               Dowd, of St. Patrick’s Church. and when 
               <br />
               the funeral service for Father Dowd was 
               <br />
               proceeding no church bells in the city tolled 
               <br />
               more solemnly than did the bells of Christ 
               <br />
               Church Cathedral. About the same time 
               <br />
               Archbishop Bond took seriously ill, and 
               <br />
               when it was feared that his sickness was 
               <br />
               unto death, prayers were offered up in near- 
               <br />
               ly every Roman Catholic church in the city 
               <br />
               for his restoration to health. I am sure that 
               <br />
               no happier state of affairs could exist in any 
               <br />
               country ; I do not think that it could possi- 
               <br />
               bly exist in any other province than Quebec. 
               <br />
               Let me point also that when Bishop Moun- 
               <br />
               tain, the ﬁrst bishop of the Church Of Eng- 
               <br />
               land in Canada, arrived in the city of Que- 
               <br />
