               give a pledge in 1896. This is the pledge

               that the Minister gave and has more than 
               <br />
               once admitted frankly that he gave this 
               <br />
               pledge. He has told the House that he will

               <br />

               impress upon his mind the grandeur and 
               <br />
               nobility of having a great mind such as his 
               <br />
               at the head of the affairs of Canada. 
               <br />
               and to point out that, after all it might be 
               <br />
               better that the Postmaster General should 
               <br />
               represent the Dominion of Canada in succes- 
               <br />
               sion to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, than his rival 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance who has evidently 
               <br />
               been aspiring to the position. Well! A 
               <br />
               vacancy was approaching, the plums were 
               <br />
               hanging above the head of the Postmaster 
               <br />
               General, his mouth was open and watering 
               <br />
               for them. and Jacob—the Postmaster Gen- 
               <br />
               eral ﬁguratively speaking—was willing in 
               <br />
               the absence of Esau to take the position, 
               <br />
               and so he capitulated to the seductive in— 
               <br />
               ﬂuences that surrounded him. Was that it? 
               <br />
               Or may it have been that the Post- 
               <br />
               master General was actuated by a 
               <br />
               more noble ambition, and that he was 
               <br />
               anxious to secure the leadership of his 
               <br />
               party so that he might put an end to the 
               <br />
               iniquitous infringements of the independ- 
               <br />
               ence of Parliament Act which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we,</span> see oc-

               curring day after day. Or may it have been
