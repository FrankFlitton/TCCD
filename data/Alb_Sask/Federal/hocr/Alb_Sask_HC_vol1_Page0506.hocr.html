               —February 20, a letter was received from His 
               <br />
               Excellency, Monseigneur Sbarretti, asking for a 
               <br />

               <br />
               His Excellency then presented the folewing 
               <br />

               <br />
               it would greatly facilitate an early settlement

               of our mission, the ﬁxing of our boundaries,

               which would be extended to the shores of Hud-

               our failure to act in the past had prejudiced

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">According</span> to this statement, it appears 
               <br />
               that Mr. Rogers and Mr. Colin Campbell, 
               <br />
               who were the delegates of the Manitoba 
               <br />
               government, had a conference with Mon- 
               <br />
               seigneur Sbarretti, the Papal ablegate, 
               <br />
               There has been a rumour in the press—not 
               <br />
               in the press, but at all events, about the 
               <br />
               corridors of this House—that this confer- 
               <br />
               ence had been brought about by means of 
               <br />
               one of my colleagues. I have to say to 
               <br />
               the House, and I have the authority of my 
               <br />
               colleague for this, that there never was any 
               <br />
               conference brought about by him between 
               <br />
               the delegates and Monseigneur Sbarretti, 
               <br />
               and I have to make the further statement 
               <br />
               that neither myself nor any of my col- 
               <br />
               leagues were the intermediaries between 
               <br />
               Monseigneur Sbarretti and the delegates of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. If there has been such a con— 
               <br />
               ference how it came about I cannot say. 
               <br />
               Perhaps Monseigneur Sbarretti may have 
               <br />
               had previous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">communication</span> with these 
               <br />
               gentlemen; I do not know. Perhaps he 
               <br />
               knew them and perhaps that is the reason 
               <br />
               why he called upOn them to have a con- 
               <br />
               ference. At all events, it is no concern of 
               <br />
               mine. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Know</span> nothing, and I never knew 
               <br />
               anything of it until this day, nor did the 
               <br />
               government. What conversation took place 
               <br />
               between the papal ablegate, Mr. Rogers 
               <br />
               and Mr. Colin Campbell I do not know. 
               <br />
               This is a question, perhaps, as to which 
               <br />
               there may be something later on; I do not 
               <br />
               know. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«But,</span> I take the statement as I ﬁnd

               right to make some comments which may 
               <br />
               throw some light, perhaps, on what has 
               <br />

               Well, Sir, I cannot conceive how the papal 
               <br />
               ablegate, or anybody else. could have stated 
               <br />
               that the failure of the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               to amend the School Act prevented the ex-

               ment could have been made, considering the

               January, 1905, we never received from the

               government of Manitoba a communication 
               <br />
               asking for the extension of the boundaries 
               <br />
               of that province. There may have been re- 
               <br />
               solutions passed by the legislature, asking 
               <br />
               for the extension of their boundaries; I do 
               <br />
               not know. I am told that there have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been,</span>

               and I have seen in the press that resolu-

               <br />
               were passed also, as I understand, in 1902, 
               <br />
               and resolutions were passed, I know, in 
               <br />
               1905. In 1905, these resolutions were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fol«</span> 
               <br />
               lowed by executive action, they were called 
               <br />
               to our attention, but neither in 1901 nor 
               <br />
               in 1902, were these resolutions passed by 
               <br />
               the legislature of Manitoba, followed by 
               <br />
               executive action or called to the attention 
               <br />
               of the government of Canada. This morn-

               ing, when I read the interview with Mr.

               at fault, and if there had been any com—

               <br />
               upon to deal, I might have forgotten. I in—

               quired of my colleagues if they had any 
               <br />
               recollection of any such communication be-

               <br />
               they had no such recollection. I then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span> 
               <br />
               quired from the clerk of the Privy Council 
               <br />
               if there was anything in the archives of
