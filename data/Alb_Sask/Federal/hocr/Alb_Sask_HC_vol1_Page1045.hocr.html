               Surely the leader of the opposition cannot

               beyond it we ﬁnd we have varied the terms 
               <br />

               <br />
               effect on the 15th of July, 1870; clearly 
               <br />
               showing that all that transpired was that 
               <br />
               the Territories became part of the Dominion 
               <br />
               territoriaily at that date, and that the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion was authorized to legislate for those 
               <br />
               Territories so far as their peace, welfare 
               <br />
               and good government were concerned.

               Now, what happened under the Manitoba 
               <br />
               Act? That Act was passed in May, 1870, 
               <br />
               and sought to form the province of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba out of those very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> which 
               <br />
               came into the Dominion in July, 1870. All 
               <br />
               the authority to form the province of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba was contained in section 146 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act of 1867; and 
               <br />
               when that Act was laid before the law oﬂî— 
               <br />
               cers of the Crown, they held it to be ultra 
               <br />
               vii-es. They held that there was no author- 
               <br />
               ity in section 146 to pass such an Act or to 
               <br />
               constitute a province—that the only author- 
               <br />
               ity there given was to bring those Terri- 
               <br />
               tories territorially Within the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada. Then it became necessary either to 
               <br />
               have a new Imperial Act or a new Imperial 
               <br />
               Order in Council to rectify matters, and 
               <br />
               the Imperial Act known as the British North 
               <br />
               America Act of 1871 was thereupon passed. 
               <br />
               It was mentioned in this House by the 
               <br />
               late Sir John Macdonald as an Act which 
               <br />
               was necessary to conﬁrm the Manitoba Act, 
               <br />
               on account of doubts which had arisen as 
               <br />
               to its validity. Now, what did the Manitoba 
               <br />
               Act profess to do ? By sectiOn 2 it enacted 
               <br />
               that the British North America Act of 1867 
               <br />
               should apply except in so far as varied 
               <br />
               by this Act; and they varied it. The edu- 
               <br />
               cational clause of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act, section 93, was varied; but when it 
               <br />
               was conﬁrmed by the imperial Act of 1871, 
               <br />
               the imperial Act went a little further than 
               <br />
               the Manitoba Act did. The imperial legis- 
               <br />
               lature no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doubt</span> thought that they would set 
               <br />
               at rest for ever the question of these Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, and the greater question of their 
               <br />
               formation into previnces when the time to 
               <br />
               form them into provinces should arrive. 
               <br />
               Now, the British North America Act of 1871, 
               <br />
               in its preamble, reads as follows:
