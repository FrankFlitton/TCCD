               tainly given us a deluge of statement in

               <br />
               ten in the northern part, but I think he has

               his contention that this question should be 
               <br />
               referred to a commission of judges. It 
               <br />
               struck me that the whole argument we have

               heard in regard to this matter from the

               other side of the House was very strongly

               tinged with partisan-ship, that from begin-

               could hardly be expected to agree with his

               that admission on his part is a sufﬁcient
