               the day, the dogmas and tenets of the 
               <br />
               Catholic church shall be taught. Now, I 
               <br />
               am free to say that I believe that it would 
               <br />
               be better if there Were no separate schools 
               <br />
               either in the province of Ontario or in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec. If the children all 
               <br />
               went to one school it would be better for 
               <br />
               all hands. But I do not see that we in the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario are suffering very 
               <br />
               severely because of the existence of sep— 
               <br />
               arate schools in that province. In the con- 
               <br />
               stituency I have the honour to represent, 
               <br />
               there is only one separate school. A few 
               <br />
               years ago there were several. But the 
               <br />
               people found that these schools were expen- 
               <br />
               sive and that the children trained in them 
               <br />
               were not receiving as good an education 
               <br />
               as they would receive it they attended the 
               <br />
               public schools. And so, in the rural parts 
               <br />
               of the county, they have united with the 
               <br />
               public schools;‘and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> there is only 
               <br />
               one separate school in the whole riding of 
               <br />
               Centre York. In a short time, I am con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdent, the separate schools will be con- 
               <br />
               ﬁned to the cities and larger towns. In the 
               <br />
               rural districts where the population is 
               <br />
               about equally divided between Protestant 
               <br />
               and Catholic it is a misfortune to have two 
               <br />
               schools. It weaken-s both; it destroys the 
               <br />
               usefulness of both. But, as I have said, 
               <br />
               in the rural districts the separate schools 
               <br />
               are becoming a thing of the past, and I can- 
               <br />
               not see that we in Ontario are suffering 
               <br />
               very much because of the existence of the 
               <br />
               separate schools—I do not believe we are 
               <br />
               suffering at all. There is no province in 
               <br />
               the Dominion where the people are better 
               <br />
               educated than they are in Ontario. The 
               <br />
               laws are well observed and the administra- 
               <br />
               tion of justice is all that could be desired, 
               <br />
               and, in every way, the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               stands at the head of all the provinces in 
               <br />
               this vast Dominion. And no country in the 
               <br />
               world has a better system of education 
               <br />
               than we have in the province of Ontario. 
               <br />
               At the great exhibition in Chicago, Buffalo 
               <br />
               and St. Louis the educational system of On- 
               <br />
               tario was praised and admired by every 
               <br />
               country in the world. In the United States 
               <br />
               there is not a single state that has not been 
               <br />
               copying the educational laws of Ontario. So 
               <br />
               While I say, that in my opinion, it would 
               <br />
               be .in the interest of the province if sep— 
               <br />
               arate schools were done away with and we 
               <br />
               had only one school system a national sys— 
               <br />
               tem, I say that if our Catholic friends de- 
               <br />
               sire, as they have a right under the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, to continue that sys- 
               <br />
               tem, it is for them to say. I point this 
               <br />
               out to show what is a separate school and 
               <br />
               to show <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the reason why they are sep- 
               <br />
               arate is because of the religious instruction 
               <br />
               they give. In the province of Ontario it 
               <br />
               would be very hard if Protestants were 
               <br />
               obliged to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">send—their</span> children to the sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools, because the religion that is 
               <br />
               taught in those schools is not acceptable to 
               <br />
               the Protestant. Now, what is the system 
               <br />

               <br />
               the one we are continuing in the North— 
               <br />
               west? Not at all. I have in my hand the 
               <br />
               ordinances passed by the Northwest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Terri»</span> 
               <br />
               tories themselves. As I have said, the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 gave the territorial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> 
               <br />
               power to establish separate schools, and 
               <br />
               they did establish them. They had the 
               <br />
               dual system, and from 1875 to 1891 one 
               <br />
               class of schools carried on by Catholics and 
               <br />
               the other by Protestants. But in 1891, the 
               <br />
               territorial government, believing that this 
               <br />
               system was not the best for that country, 
               <br />
               that it was an expensive system, that in 
               <br />
               that vast region where the population was 
               <br />
               few and far between the number of children 
               <br />
               of school age must necessarily be very 
               <br />
               small, they found that continuing a system 
               <br />
               of dual schools as not only expensive, but 
               <br />
               that it was not meeting the wishes of the 
               <br />
               people or accomplishing the object they 
               <br />
               desired. So in 1891 they abolished this 
               <br />
               system altogether, and established a system 
               <br />
               that to my mind seems to be one of the 
               <br />
               best national school systems to be found in 
               <br />
               any country in the world. What is that 
               <br />
               system? The whole management and con- 
               <br />
               trol of education in the Northwest is placed 
               <br />
               in the hands of a minister of the Crown 
               <br />
               called the Commissioner of Education. He 
               <br />
               has power to make laws in relation to all 
               <br />
               these schools. What are the duties and 
               <br />
