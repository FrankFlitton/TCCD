               ful and reprehensible on the part of these

               placed in him. We are invited to witness

               Sir. there is not a sentence in those edu-

               that if a prelate of the Roman Catholic

               taught by duly licensed teachers, in which 
               <br />
               only authorized school books were used, 
               <br />
               schools subject to strict public inspection and 
               <br />
               controlled altogether by the local legislature, 
               <br />
               schools in which the only concession made to 
               <br />
               his views is that both Protestants and Cath-

               That, Sir, is the opinion of the Montreal

               history must know that no p tical leader 
               <br />
               in this country ever yet succeeded in doing 
               <br />
               that. The coterie that surrounded the old 
               <br />
               ‘Family Compact’ tried to do it and no 
               <br />
               political combination in this country ever 
               <br />
               had so good an opporunity to succeed in 
               <br />
               that attempt and they failed.
