               nexed or added to that province. There 
               <br />
               should be no more difﬁculty in declaring the 
               <br />
               lands in the new provinces to belong to our 
               <br />
               fellow citizens in those provinces than in 
               <br />
               declaring the lands lying north of Quebec 
               <br />
               to belong to our fellow citizens in Quebec. 
               <br />
               There is a very prevalent opinion in the 
               <br />
               Northwest that neither the good of the new 
               <br />
               provinces, nor that of the Dominion were 
               <br />
               the chief factors in shaping the govern- 
               <br />
               ment‘s policy in regard to the Crown lands. 
               <br />
               The impression is that the most potent mo- 
               <br />
               tive for the retention of the lands was that 
               <br />
               it would enable the government to maintain 
               <br />
               an army of land immigration ofﬁcials who 
               <br />
               would without cost to party funds act as 
               <br />
               the political mentors of those immigrants 
               <br />
               who come to our western lands without: 
               <br />
               experience or knowledge of the pOIitics of 
               <br />
               the country and are instructed to vote for 
               <br />
               the good Liberal party who brought them 
               <br />
               out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and'will</span> give them patents for their 
               <br />
               land it they do as they are told. Such men 
               <br />
               can and do act as the political agents of the- 
               <br />
               Liberal party. If the amendment I am 
               <br />
               about to propose is voted down, I trust the 
               <br />
               government will take most strenuous steps 
               <br />
               to prevent political interference by their 
               <br />
               ofﬁcials. Let them provide a penalty for 
               <br />
               such interference and put it into the power 
               <br />
               of the ordinary citizen to invoke the law in 
               <br />
               such cases. As I understand from the de—

               cerned. I do not think there can be any 
               <br />
               objection. As far as the principle is con-

               cerned, that has been somewhat fully .dis-

               ter administered by the Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior than they would be by the Crown 
               <br />
               Lands Departments of the new provinces. 
               <br />
               We have had some examples of the admin- 
               <br />
               istration of the Northwest lands by the 
               <br />
               Department of the Interior. We have heard 
               <br />
               something of a company known as the Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Land</span> Company, which obtained 
               <br />
               from that department a very large block of 
               <br />
               valuable land for the beggarly sum of $1 
               <br />
               per acre, which it is now offering for sale 
               <br />
               at from $8 to $12 an acre, and it obtained 
               <br />
               these lands without conditions of settlement 
               <br />
               such as would correspond at least to the 
               <br />
               tremendous proﬁt it is making. I do not 
               <br />
               think any province could possibly do worse 
               <br />
               than the Department of the Interior did in 
               <br />
               that particular instance, and that is only one 
               <br />
               instance of maladministration out of many. 
               <br />
               Therefore. I fail to understand why these 
               <br />
               new provinces should be treated, as my hon.
