               ago, in defending the position taken by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Labelle. He was recall- 
               <br />
               ing, in no smooth terms, what the Solicitor 
               <br />
               General had said last night—‘ You are pull- 
               <br />

               The Solicitor General may have used this 
               <br />
               expression, and it is hard to make it a crime 
               <br />
               for him to have used it, but I dare say it 
               <br />
               may not be so hard to prove that he was 
               <br />
               perfectly right. There is a way to pull to- 
               <br />
               gether in two different directions, and if it 
               <br />
               should be true that extremes meet, then I 
               <br />
               think I am fairly justiﬁed in stating that the 
               <br />
               hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lalbelle</span> (Mr. Bourassa) and 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Grey (Dr. Sproule) 
               <br />
               are hugging each other pretty closely at 
               <br />
               times. Coming again to the hon. members 
               <br />
               for Labelle and Beauharnois, I think it in- 
               <br />
               cumbent upon me to take up, as was done a 
               <br />
               moment ago by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Kamouraska, the unwarranted insult hurled 
               <br />
               at the French-speaking members in this 
               <br />
               House, when we were charged by them with 
               <br />
               being cowards and poltroons. He who re- 
               <br />
               fuses to perform <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> duty is undoubtedly a 
               <br />
               coward and a poltroon, but he also is a 
               <br />
               coward and a poltroon who does not per- 
               <br />
               form his duty the way he should. To charge 
               <br />
               the French-speaking members on this side of 
               <br />
               the House with being cowards and poltroons 
               <br />
               as did the hon. member for Labelle last 
               <br />
               night, I think I can fairly be allowed to 
               <br />
               retort. with all due deference to the chair, 
               <br />
               that the expression cowardice does not apply 
               <br />
               to those it was aimed at, but rather to those 
               <br />
               who uttered it. Why insult the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister? Can any occasion be pointed out 
               <br />
               when the right hon. the leader of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment has shown himself to be unworthy 
               <br />
               of his countrymen? I challenge the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Labelle to point out to a single 
               <br />
               action. a mere fact, any circumstance what- 
               <br />
               ever in his lifetime which justiﬁes the insult? 
               <br />
               I do not know ‘that the Prime Minister was 
               <br />
               in any way unworthy of his countrymen 
               <br />
               when in: England, where he held out so suc- 
               <br />
               cessfully against Mr. Chamberlain, the most 
               <br />
               powerful man in Great Britain at that time, 
               <br />
               and where he the Prime Minister of a Brit- 
               <br />
               ish colony, was putting his political career 
               <br />
               at stake by resisting so vigorously such a 
               <br />
               mighty statesman. Would this be one of 
               <br />
               the occasions in which he displayed his lack 
               <br />
               of courage? I do not believe either that the 
               <br />
               Hon. Minister of Inland Revenue (Mr. 
               <br />
               Brodeur) deserved to be called a coward by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Labelle. Was he act- 
               <br />
               ing the part of a coward when he stood 
               <br />
               ﬁrm against one of the most gigantic trusts 
               <br />
               that ever operated in this country, in order 
               <br />
               to put a stop to the shameful dealings that 
               <br />
               had been going on for some years? Surely 
               <br />
               not.

               our good humoured good natured and

               bers of this House, of whom he said he

               thought they were perhaps broader-minded 
               <br />
               than some of his own compatriots. I do 
               <br />
               claim to be broad-minded; I would rather 
               <br />
               deserve the reputation of being broad-minded

               Canadian, as a broad-minded member “of

               <br />
               of my hon. friend in a few words. Before 
               <br />
               coming to this House I had but a limited 
               <br />
               knowledge of the French Canadian people, 
               <br />
               not having had many opportunities to come 
               <br />
               personally in contact with them. I came 
               <br />
               here without any prejudice whatever against 
               <br />
               my French Canadian fellow citizens, either 
               <br />
               because of their language or because of their 
               <br />
               religion; but since coming here, I can say 
               <br />
               that my greater knowledge <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of’them</span> has cer- 
               <br />
               tainly not led me to esteem them less highly 
               <br />
               or appreciate less their value as fellow citi— 
               <br />
               zens of this great Dominion. I think we will 
               <br />
               all admit that the French is a beautiful lan- 
               <br />
               guage._ Our sons and daughters are study- 
               <br />
               ing that language, and deem their education 
               <br />
               quite incomplete without a knowledge of it. 
               <br />
               We, Sir, who are ignorant of the language, 
               <br />
               who have not been sufﬁciently able or have 
               <br />
               not had sufﬁcient opportunity to acquire a 
               <br />
               knowledge of it, deeply regret our ignor- 
               <br />
               ance; but as our children are studying to- 
               <br />
               day and acquiring a knowledge of the French 
               <br />
               language because of its beauty and its place 
               <br />
               in literature, so are the children of our 
               <br />
               French Canadian citizens studying and 
               <br />
               learning the English language because of 
               <br />
               its utility. They are learning the English 
               <br />
               language because it is fast becoming the 
               <br />
               commercial language of the world; because 
               <br />
               it is the language of the people of Great 
               <br />
               Britain from whom we buy so largely and 
               <br />
               to whom we sell so largely; because it is 
               <br />
               the language of the great American repub- 
               <br />
               lic to the south of us with whom we so 
               <br />
               largely deal; and because the English langu- 
               <br />
               age is the language of the larger portion 
               <br />
               by far of the people of this Dominion, it 
               <br />
               seems to me it goes without saying that if 
               <br />
               in the new provinces there is to be but one 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial language, it ought to be the English 
               <br />
               as a matter of convenience and utility. I 
               <br />
               obJect to implanting in the new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span> 
               <br />
               any second language, not because it is 
               <br />
               French, but because it is a second <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">language:</span> 
               <br />
               and because only one, it seems to me, is 
               <br />
               required.
