               not only responsible to the whole country, 
               <br />

               stripped off from the right hon. gen-

               day the Northwest has no representative in 
               <br />
               the cabinet. To-day I cannot say that the

               <br />
               is a very small way indeed. Thus we, the

               representative of these other provinces, are 
               <br />

               mensely greater people hereafter, laying 
               <br />
               down a hard granite mould, outside of 
               <br />

               growing life for all the years that are to 
               <br />
               come. Yet these gentlemen who stood up in 
               <br />
               1896 to demand provincial rights, who stood 
               <br />
               up in 1896 in strong demand that the people 
               <br />
               in the country for which that legislation 
               <br />
               was demanded were the people whose-

               consulting the accredited representative of 
               <br />
               the Northwest, who, I do not think, have

               <br />
               ter of the Interior had his convictions. He 
               <br />
               made them known. The right hon. First 
               <br />
               Minister knew them. But there were other 
               <br />
               men who said they had convictions. The

               hon. friend, the Postmaster General (Sir

               Northwest Territories, without having the 
               <br />
               cabinet ﬁlled up ‘? The hon. Postmaster 
               <br />
               General had ideals at one time. One <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ideal</span> 
               <br />
               was that you should not keep ofﬁces

               dangling before the minds and eyes of re-

               presentatives for fear you might inﬂuence 
               <br />
               them corruptly. What a splendid thing to 
               <br />
               keep dangling to—day is the ministership for 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories ? How effective— 
               <br />
               ly my right hon. friend might use it, and 
               <br />
               he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knows‘how</span> to use such things. He used 
               <br />
               them with Mr. Langelier, and all the world 
               <br />
               knows it. He has been using them ever 
               <br />
               since, and all Canada knows it. How nice

               <br />
               the right hon. First Minister to say it in 
               <br />

               patronage and power that are attached to. 
               <br />
               it! Look at the splendour which crowns 
               <br />
