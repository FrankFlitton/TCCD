               the Dominion government and the delegates,

               <br />
               portance. In the Manitoba Act which was

               <br />

               <br />
               friend from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) has 
               <br />
               suggested the possibility that this covenant 
               <br />
               ' applied only to Manitoba. Now it applied 
               <br />
               to the entire new territory. It was so un- 
               <br />
               derstood by all parties treating during the 
               <br />
               negotiations and, as a matter of fact, effect

               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given.</span> to the covenant and the agree- 
               <br />
               ment arrived at as soon as possible after 
               <br />
               the delegates of the Dominion had agreed and 
               <br />
               that question has never been raised since. 
               <br />
               As a matter of fact while the delegates 
               <br />
               were deliberating with the Dominion min- 
               <br />
               isters there was no certainty as to the crea— 
               <br />
               tion of the province of Manitoba with its 
               <br />
               present limits. Correspondence which I 
               <br />
               need not read here shows, and it is a fact 
               <br />
               of history that it was supposed when the 
               <br />
               new territory of Rupert’s Land was taken 
               <br />
               possession of, when delegates came down 
               <br />
               here, that one government, either a provin— 
               <br />
               cial or some kind of government, would be 
               <br />
               organized for the whole new territory, and 
               <br />
               it was only after the delegates had stipu- 
               <br />
               lated for their rights that the limits of the 
               <br />
               new province of Manitoba were settled up- 
               <br />
               on. As a matter of fact at that period 
               <br />
               the Red River settlers as they were called. 
               <br />
               were the only white civilized people in the 
               <br />
               whole of Rupert’s Land. The country 
               <br />
               back of that, which had been discovered 
               <br />
               was hunted over, inhabited by Indians, but 
               <br />
               there were there simply occasional travel- 
               <br />
               lers from the Red River and the whole ter- 
               <br />
               ritory was known as Rupert’s Land. I 
               <br />
               submit that the whole of that ter— 
               <br />
               ritory has to he considered. and was under-

               <br />
               lated for in the Bill of Rights. and it was 
               <br />
               so understood, as my hon. friend from Beau-

               harnois (Mr. Bergeron) mentions, .by the

               <br />
               the letters, leaves no doubt upon that point.
