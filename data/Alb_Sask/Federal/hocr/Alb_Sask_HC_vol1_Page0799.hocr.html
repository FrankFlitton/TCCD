               parliament by section 2 of the Act of 1871 
               <br />
               must necessarily be read as being subject 
               <br />
               to the provisions of those Acts, and of the 
               <br />
               original Act just as the power of the Queen 
               <br />
               in Council to admit the provinces of Prince

               provisions. Now it surely was not intend- 
               <br />
               ed that this parliament which is the creature 
               <br />
               of the British l\orth America Act and which 
               <br />
               is subject to all the limitations embodied 
               <br />
               in that Act as all the provinces of this 
               <br />
               Dominion are subject to the same limitations, 
               <br />
               it was surely not intended that this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. which is a creature of this Act, could 
               <br />
               constitute <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a‘</span> province and give it what- 
               <br />
               ever powers it pleased without reference 
               <br />
               to the terms of the Act under which this 
               <br />
               parliament itself was created. If we have 
               <br />
               any power to vary in anyway, in the slight- 
               <br />
               est degree, the terms ot the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. then we can vary them to 
               <br />
               whatever extent we please and we could 
               <br />
               withhold from the new provinces any one 
               <br />
               oi the subjects or all of the subjects which 
               <br />
               are assigned exclusively by the British 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> America Act ”to the provincial legis- 
               <br />
               latures, and we could confer upon the new 
               <br />
               provinces in the west the power to legislate 
               <br />
               with reference to any one of the several 
               <br />
               subjects which the British North America 
               <br />
               Act assigned exclusively to this parliament. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that that would be an 
               <br />
               absurd view for any lawyer to advance, 
               <br />
               and I think it is perfectly clear that the 
               <br />
               intention of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               is that in the case of the constitution of any 
               <br />
               new province. it must be subject to the 
               <br />
               terms and conditions of the Act as they ap- 
               <br />
               ply to the other provinces of the confedera— 
               <br />
               tion. My View is in common with the views 
               <br />
               that have been advanced not only by the 
               <br />
               leader of the Opposition <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> R. L. Borden) 
               <br />
               who is opposing this Bill, but by other legal 
               <br />
               authorities, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> instance the hon. and 
               <br />
               learned member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. 
               <br />
               Monk) who is supporting this Bill, that we 
               <br />
               have power only to create this province and 
               <br />
               that the provisions of the British North

               <br />
               cally to the new provinces. I think I shall 
               <br />
               be able to show that this is not only the 
               <br />

               of section 146 is this, that the Queen had the 
               <br />
               right by Order in Council to legislate in the

               way and subject to the limitations contained in 
               <br />
               section 146. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Order in Council became and 
               <br />
               had the effect of an imperial Act of parliament

               so long as the powers conferred by section 146 
               <br />
               were exercised subject to the limitations con- 
               <br />
               tained in section 146. Legislation by Order in 
               <br />
               Council is an exceptional legislation and can
