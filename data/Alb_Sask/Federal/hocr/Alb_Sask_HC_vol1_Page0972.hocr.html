               rights respected as a hundred thousand. 
               <br />
               It is the duty of this parliament to protect 
               <br />
               the legal rights of one man just as well as 
               <br />
               those of a thousand or ten thousand men. 
               <br />
               In 1896 the Liberals stood by the principle 
               <br />
               of provincial rights in supporting the ma- 
               <br />
               jority of the province of Manitoba, and to- 
               <br />
               day we are standing by that same principle 
               <br />
               in protecting the minority of the Territories. 
               <br />
               That minority is entitled to separate schools. 
               <br />
               I venture to say that there is not a lawyer, 
               <br />
               including Mr. Christopher Robinson, who 
               <br />
               will say that the Roman Catholics of the 
               <br />
               Territories have not the right to-day to 
               <br />
               separate schools. If they have that right. 
               <br />
               then this parliament is bound to safeguard 
               <br />
               it; and it is because we are standing by 
               <br />
               the principle of provincial rights that this 
               <br />
               Bill will pass the parliament of Canada by 
               <br />
               the largest majority that any contentious 
               <br />
               measure ever received. It is because we 
               <br />
               are standing by the principle of provincial 
               <br />
               rights that this Bill will receive the appro- 
               <br />
               val of the province of Ontario, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notwith’</span>

               opposite to set the heather aﬁre. It will 
               <br />
               receive the approval of the people of Onta- 
               <br />
               rio just so soon as they thoroughly under- 
               <br />
               stand the principles of the Bill. There has 
               <br />
               been considerable agitation created and 
               <br />
               every attempt possible has been made to 
               <br />
               obscure the issue, and I doubt very much 
               <br />
               whether until very lately the great bulk 
               <br />
               of Ontario fully understood this measure. 
               <br />
               But as soon as they do understand it it will 
               <br />
               receive their support as it will receive the

               ments of my hon. friend from East Tor-

               than ever to vote for the Bill brought down 
               <br />
               by the Prime Minister. I echo that senti-

               lows out his own reasoning he will be com- 
               <br />
               pelled to vote against the Bill also. He 
               <br />
               dealt with the legal aspect of the case, and 
               <br />
               I am bound to say that he diﬂ’ered entirely 
               <br />
               with every legal gentleman on his own side 
               <br />
               who has discussed the subject. He does 
               <br />
               net agree with clause 16 of these Autonomy 
               <br />
               Bills. He declares that this clause is not 
               <br />

               ica Act applies. This being his contention, 
               <br />
               surely he should vote against the Bill along
