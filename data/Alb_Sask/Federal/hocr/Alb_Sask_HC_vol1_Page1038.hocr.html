               stand the question at all, I venture to say 
               <br />
               that there is no difference in principle or 
               <br />
               substance between the amended clauses now 
               <br />
               presented and the clause originally intro- 
               <br />
               duced. What then becomes of this extra- 
               <br />
               ordinary much vaunted compromise ? But 
               <br />
               let us assume that what is now provided is. 
               <br />
               the law as it is at present in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. I would like to ask if anybody 
               <br />
               in this House is able to say what that law 
               <br />
               is. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">XVe</span> are told that if this Bill be passed, 
               <br />
               everything will be lovely. there will be no 
               <br />
               litigation, and everybody will be happy. 
               <br />
               Well, Mr. Speaker, in view of the statement 
               <br />
               made by the ex-Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) that the amended section 16 
               <br />
               is a great compromise and practically in- 
               <br />
               troduces and makes permanent national 
               <br />
               schools in the new provinces—separate 
               <br />
               schools existing in name only—and in View 
               <br />
               of the contrary statement which my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the leader of the opposition has 
               <br />
               made, namely, that there is no difference 
               <br />
               in substance or principle between the orig- 
               <br />
               inal and the amended clause 16, in view of 
               <br />
               the statement made by the First Minister 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories (Mr. Haultain) 
               <br />
               to the same effect, which statement I have 
               <br />
               just endeavoured to make plain by an ex- 
               <br />
               amination and comparison of the original 
               <br />
