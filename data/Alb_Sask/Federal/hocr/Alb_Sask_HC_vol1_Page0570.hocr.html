               necessary, it will not be the last. I say that, 
               <br />
               in 1896—and hon. gentlemen opposite do not 
               <br />
               seem to like me to get too close to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that—we</span> 
               <br />
               found the state of affairs that I have spoken 
               <br />
               of. And here is the peculiarity of the situ- 
               <br />
               ation. In that year, we found the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen who are now in opposition in close 
               <br />
               alliance with the bishops of the church of 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec. It became neces- 
               <br />
               sary, apparently,if justice was to be done, for 
               <br />
               the Papal power to be asked to interfere. If 
               <br />
               we are to believe what we have heard with- 
               <br />
               in the last two days, the Papal delegate 
               <br />
               came <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'to</span> settle some difﬁculties—and un- 
               <br />
               questionably they were difﬁculties with re- 
               <br />
               gard to political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs—between</span> the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on this side of the House and 
               <br />
               their bishops. If the Papal delegate is in- 
               <br />
               terfering I declare his action is highly im- 
               <br />
               proper and I denounce it. But, I want this 
               <br />
               House and country to understand that if 
               <br />
               the respective parties expect to make capital 
               <br />
               out of it, their whole record on the subject 
               <br />
               should be considered. Take the history of 
               <br />
               Canada from confederation down to the

               record is history. But I do not know that

               anybody would venture to express a belief

               that the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr.

               <br />
               tory. The hon. gentleman spoke at a meet- 
               <br />
               ing in Toronto a short time ago, and was then 
               <br />
               very boastful of his Protestantism and of 
               <br />
               the Protestantism of his family before him. 
               <br />
               He told the people assembled on that occa- 
               <br />
               sion that the cry of equal rights and oppo- 
               <br />
               sition to French domination in Canada was 
               <br />
               the cry he had always raised in North Sim- 
               <br />
               coe; that on that policy he had nailed his 
               <br />
               colours to the mast and would stand or fall 
               <br />
               by them. There was a contest last fall in 
               <br />
               North Simcoe. as there was in the rest of 
               <br />

               Mr. L. G. McGARTHY. I may tell the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman (Mr. Bennett) that I made 
               <br />
               no such statement in Toronto as that he 
               <br />
               has attributed to me as to this question 
               <br />
               been in issue in my campaign last election. 
               <br />
               I stated that in the ﬁrst and second cam- 
               <br />
               paigns it was an issue. But, if the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman wants to know I ‘can tell him that I 
               <br />
               can produce evidence that I stated at 
               <br />
               Hawkestone, in the township of Oro. that I 
               <br />
               was certain that when the Bill for the grant- 
               <br />
               ing of autonomy to the Northwest came up, 
               <br />
               the school question would again arise.

               Mr. BENNETT. I took occasion to look 
               <br />
               up the ﬁle of a Collingwood newspaper de— 
               <br />
               voted to the government, and, it will be ap-

               parent to any body reading that newspaper 
               <br />
               that the great issue in North Simcoe last 
               <br />
               election was whether or not the Collingwood 
               <br />
               harbour should have the beneﬁt of a large 
               <br />
               grant of government money. And that was 
               <br />
               the whole question. As to the hon. gentle-

               <br />
               stock in trade in that riding, I can tell the 
               <br />
               House that it does not carry the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as»</span>

               his late uncle used to do. In the township of

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vespra</span> the late Dalton McCarthy used to- 
               <br />
               get a majority of about one hundred; the

               hon. member (Mr. L. G. McCarthy) was in 
               <br />
               a minority of thirty in the last election.
