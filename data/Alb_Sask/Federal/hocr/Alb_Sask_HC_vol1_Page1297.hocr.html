               Let me point out that between 250 and 
               <br />
               300 pounds of ﬂour would represent the 
               <br />
               enormous total of 72 hundred-weight in the 
               <br />
               year, and yet the importance of this great 
               <br />
               mill is given as a reason why the boundaries 
               <br />
               of this province should be extended up into 
               <br />
               that district. Surely the right hon. First 
               <br />
               Minister will see that the proportions of 
               <br />
               this mill are not very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large—from</span> 250 to 
               <br />
               300 pounds per hour. That cannot very 
               <br />
               well be the reason why the line is extended 
               <br />
               up into that section of the country. This 
               <br />
               Peace river question is a pretty live ques- 
               <br />
               tion; we had it up last year, and I know 
               <br />
               it was like a red rag before some animals 
               <br />
               when it was talked about, and to no one 
               <br />
               more so than to the hon. Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior. He does like this subject. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> He 
               <br />
               did not like it then, and l presume he does 
               <br />
               not like it any .better now. But there must 
               <br />
               be some other reason for extending the 
               <br />
               boundary up there than the existence of this 
               <br />
               mill. The extension of the boundary line 
               <br />
               gives'them two representatives, and I think 
               <br />
               that was probably a greater reason why the 
               <br />
               boundary was placed where it is rather 
               <br />
               than being placed where it was suggested 
               <br />
               by the premier of the Northwest Territories.
