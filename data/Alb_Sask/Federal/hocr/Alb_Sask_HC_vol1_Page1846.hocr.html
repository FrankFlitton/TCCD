               Mr. BRODEUR. I put a very simple 
               <br />
               question to my hon. friend from Beauhar- 
               <br />
               DOÎS (Mr. Bergeron). I wanted to know from 
               <br />
               him the nature of the amendment which he 
               <br />
               is now proposing before the House, and I 
               <br />
               thought my question being put in a civil 
               <br />
               way should have been answered in the same 
               <br />
               way. Instead of that the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Beauharnois sta'l‘ts to make a political 
               <br />
               speech, a party speech. I thought he 
               <br />
               was here not to make party capital 
               <br />
               out of this question, that he was 
               <br />
               sincere in the desire to,protect and de- 
               <br />
               fend the interests of the minority in the 
               <br />
               Northwest. I thought he was here not to 
               <br />
               make party capital in the interest of his 
               <br />
               party which now is in a serious condition 
               <br />
               with regard to that question, but that he 
               <br />
               was here to protect and defend the minority. 
               <br />
               I asked him what was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{mi-port</span> of his 
               <br />
               motion. Was it for the restoration of the 
               <br />
               rights of the minority as they existed be- 
               <br />
               fore 1892, or wasit simply for the main- 
               <br />
               tenance of the rights which are now in ex- 
               <br />
               istence ? He has not been able to give me 
               <br />
               an answer to that because I do not think 
               <br />
               his motion as drafted shows whether it con- 
               <br />
               templates the restoration of the rights of 
               <br />
               the minority as they were before 1892 or 
               <br />
               the rights of the minority as they exist to- 
               <br />
               day. My hon. friend has no policy; he is 
               <br />
               not able to proclaim before the country and 
               <br />
               before the House a policy which can be 
               <br />
               sustained by a certain number of people. 
               <br />
               They want simply to make party capital. 
               <br />
               They want simply to arouse prejudices in 
               <br />
               some parts of the country—and perish the 
               <br />
               minority in the Northwest provided they 
               <br />
               get some political gains in Quebec. If the 
               <br />
               minority <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'can</span> not get more than what they 
               <br />
               get to—day, to what party is it due? It is 
               <br />
               to the party of my hon. friend who in 1892 
               <br />
               refused to give to the minority the protec- 
               <br />
