               <br />
               name of my countrymen I can declare here 
               <br />
               that we are too much devoted to the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish Crown to think for a moment of break- 
               <br />
               ing the British tie. And why? It is be- 
               <br />
               cause we are always certain to ﬁnd under 
               <br />
               the British Crown protection for our rights 
               <br />
               and privileges; it is because we will al- 
               <br />
               ways ﬁnd on the throne of the British em- 
               <br />
               pire a sovereign desirous of supporting the 
               <br />
               cause of the weak and feeble; it is because 
               <br />
               Great Britain will always respect her 
               <br />
               treaties. And, Sir, if mayhap, one day the 
               <br />
               agitators, backed up by a majority, should 
               <br />
               succeed in depriving the Catholics of their 
               <br />
               rights and privileges, we know that Great 
               <br />
               Britain will come to their rescue and pro- 
               <br />
               tect them against injustice. Is not the

               Mr. Speaker, I can assue you that it is with 
               <br />
               a great deal of temerity I rise to contri— 
               <br />
               bute a few words to this debate. I feel 
               <br />
               that I can add but little to what has been 
               <br />
               already said, but I believe it my duty. to 
               <br />
               give reasons for my vote on such an impor- 
               <br />
               tant matter as this. I formed an opinion 
               <br />
               upon the merits of the question when the 
               <br />
               Bill was ﬁrst introduced, and I have listen—

               with the intention of becoming informed

               <br />
               than I am. I may say, Sir, that I am of

               the same opinion now that I was when this

               matter was ﬁrst brought before the House. 
               <br />
               I regard this as a measure intended to give
