               there. I say there is no objection so far as 
               <br />
               I have ever heard. There are I think in the’ 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories 11 separate schools, 
               <br />
               Line Roman Catholic and two Protestant. 
               <br />

               enter any protest against the separate 
               <br />
               school. There is one at Lethbridge and one 
               <br />

               There is another one at Regina and another 
               <br />
               one at or near VVapella. Speaking of the 
               <br />
               Regina separate school, I say that it is 
               <br />
               satisfactory to all the people in Regina 
               <br />
               and that any proposition to abolish the 
               <br />
               separate school in existence in Regina 
               <br />
               would be more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unsatisfactory</span> to the 
               <br />
               Protestants who live there than to the 
               <br />
               Roman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span> Catholics. I admit that there 
               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> objection against the permission 
               <br />
               of separation in school matters. That is the 
               <br />
               only possible objection there can be to separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools in the west, the objection against 
               <br />
               separation, but In the practical operation 
               <br />
               in town school districts there is no practical 
               <br />
               objection, because, as in the case of Regina, 
               <br />
               the separate school takes the place of a 
               <br />
               ward school in the same way as it does 
               <br />
               in Nova Scotia, as I am informed. For in— 
               <br />
               stances, in towns in Nova Scotia there is 
               <br />
               one ward school set apart for R0-

               It is merely in effect the system we have

               tempt to deceive the people of this

               <br />
               matter is to distort the meaning of the 
               <br />
               word. You cannot ﬁnd a protest in the

               Northwest Territories against existing con- 
               <br />
               ditions. You cannot ﬁnd an advocate of 
               <br />
               any alteration in the separate school feature 
               <br />
               of the existing law. We will have the

               <br />
