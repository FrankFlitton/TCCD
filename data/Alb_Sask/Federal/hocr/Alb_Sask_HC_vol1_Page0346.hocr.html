               and that it was my duty to do it. Then I 
               <br />
               said after that had taken place there was 
               <br />
               a power higher than the constitution and 
               <br />
               that power was the sovereign will of the 
               <br />
               people; that after the position was laid 
               <br />
               before the people in 1896 in 1900 and in 
               <br />
               1904: the people by their votes had endors- 
               <br />
               ed the party that opposed remedial legis— 
               <br />
               lation and consequently, as long as water 
               <br />
               ran and grass grew, I did not think I would 
               <br />
               be found in that same programme. Now 
               <br />
               my position is as I have stated. The state- 
               <br />
               ment made by my hon. friend is exactly to 
               <br />
               the reverse. Mine gives as a reason a re- 
               <br />
               gard for the principle of the constitution 
               <br />
               and a regard for the will of the people. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Inn].</span> gentleman stated that my reason was 
               <br />
               that I would not do it again because it did 
               <br />
               not pay.
