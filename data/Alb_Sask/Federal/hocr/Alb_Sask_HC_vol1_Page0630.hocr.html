               Now, Sir, I only remark in passing, that 
               <br />
               it is not a declaration. Let‘ the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion take its course; that is not a declara- 
               <br />
               tion that the constitution applies automati- 
               <br />
               cally. It is a declaration to this parliament, 
               <br />
               and to those men who were endeavouring 
               <br />
               to get rid of that clause to prevent any 
               <br />
               such argument being used as is now used. 
               <br />
               Keep quiet, be still, because when the time 
               <br />
               comes—as it has come now—you will be

               I am very glad that the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has explained it in that way, and perhaps I 
               <br />
               was wrong in my understanding of his remarks. 
               <br />
               Of course it is an important declaration from 
               <br />
               the First Minister. Now, the House will have 
               <br />
               to use its own judgment on this question. What 
               <br />
               I say is this : that if this question of separate 
               <br />
               schools is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»to</span> remain in its present position 
               <br />
               until we grant provincial autonomy to any por- 
               <br />
               tion of the Northwest. it will be practically 
               <br />
               impossible, unless there is an enormous change 
               <br />
               in public opinion, to deny them what every 
               <br />
               other province that has joined the confedera- 
               <br />
               tion has been entitled to, what Manitoba was 
               <br />
               entitled to, and what I submit under the cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances every province would be entitled to. 
               <br />
               Now, let me draw attention to the constitution 
               <br />
               conferred upon Manitoba in that regard. I 
               <br />
               have not got it under my hand, but it will be 
               <br />
               found on consulting it that when we conferred 
               <br />
               autonomy upon the province of Manitoba we 
               <br />
               did it by reference to the British North Ameri- 
               <br />
               ca Act. What we declared was, that‘ where 
               <br />
               not otherwise provided for in the Act, all the 
               <br />
               provisions of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               should apply to the province of Manitoba, and 
               <br />
               I think the very same words were contained 
               <br />
               in the resolutions which were passed at the 
               <br />
               time British Columbia and the province of 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island came into the union. So 
               <br />
               that we have got that precedent before us; 
               <br />
               that was the promise upon which we admitted 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and looking at the character of the 
               <br />
               legislation, I do not think there can be any 
               <br />
               doubt that the same rule must apply when we 
               <br />
               admit the provinces to be created out of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories.

               Now, Sir, what happened? There are 
               <br />
               many hon. gentlemen sitting opposite who 
               <br />
               were present on that occasion. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for East Grey (Mr. Sprouie), I 
               <br />
               think, is the only gentleman in this House 
               <br />
               on that side who is consistent to-day. He 
               <br />
               said: You should not give them a chance, 
               <br />
               or let them have an argument that they 
               <br />
               can use for fastening separate schools on 
               <br />
               the new provinces under the constitution. 
               <br />
               But of course he might have justiﬁed himself 
               <br />
               in voting with the then premier by saying: 
               <br />

               <br />
               the then premier said. But they were 
               <br />
               warned that when this time did come that 
               <br />
               would happen which is happening to-day. 
               <br />
               Again, what happened ? The vote was 
               <br />
               taken, and 114 members to 21 maintained 
               <br />
               that clause on the statute-book, notwith- 
               <br />
               standing the warnings which were then 
               <br />
               given, and we are now face to face with 
               <br />
               the position that was then foreseen. Now, 
               <br />
               Sir, up to that point which brings us to 
               <br />
               1894, there cannot be any carilling, there 
               <br />
               cannot be any quibbling over the statement 
               <br />
               that from the standpoint of policy both 
               <br />
               political parties were of the same mind. 
               <br />
               There were independent men who broke 
               <br />
               away from party lines on that question 
               <br />
               and who chose to think for themselves as 
               <br />
               I do. First, there was George Brown. Then 
               <br />
               later there were my revered uncle, Dalton 
               <br />
               McCarthy, the member for East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule), Col. O’Brien, the Hon. Clarke Wal- 
               <br />
               lace, Clift'ord Sifton, Joseph Martin, John 
               <br />
               Charlton, and several others—there are men 
               <br />
               who have always spoken their minds freely 
               <br />
               and from conviction. Then we come to 1895, 
               <br />
               when the agitation began with reference to 
               <br />
               the Manitoba schools. We then had, as you 
               <br />
               will remember, a ﬁght in Haldimand. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon».</span> Mr. Montague sought re-election after 
               <br />
               the remedial order was passed; we faced 
               <br />
               him in Haldimand and we were defeated. 
               <br />
               We fought the question over again in Card- 
               <br />
               well and we won. As to what took place 
               <br />
               in Cardwell, I will have more to say, be- 
               <br />
               cause upon that occasion a gentleman who 
               <br />
               has grown very eloquent in this House,

               <br />
