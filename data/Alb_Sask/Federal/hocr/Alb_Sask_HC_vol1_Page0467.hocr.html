               Sir, as a French Canadian who has studied 
               <br />
               and learned something of British institu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               from North Toronto what is British liberty 
               <br />
               if the Catholics are not allowed to have 
               <br />
               their own schools ? Is not that political 
               <br />
               liberty the pride of Englishmen, inclusive 
               <br />
               and widely tolerant ? Is it a selﬁsh and

               narrow liberty, in some sort Protestant 
               <br />
               and privileged, and which is only a means 
               <br />
               to better shackle some of the people with 
               <br />
               the heavy chains of an intolerable despot- 
               <br />

               <br />
               hon. gentlemen, if the minority, because it 
               <br />
               is a minority, cannot enjoy the liberties

               which were promised them in the name of 
               <br />

               church, and asked all the members to main- 
               <br />
               tain their principles, even if the occasion 
               <br />
               demanded that they fought for them. Well. 
               <br />
               Sir, I do not say that a man has not a right 
               <br />
               to tight for his principles, but I am not quite 
               <br />
               sure that the hon. gentleman means a con- 
               <br />
               stitutional ﬁght. I am afraid that he is 
               <br />
               appealing to the Orange lodges to ﬁght an- 
               <br />
               other battle of the Boyne. Well, here is 
               <br />
               something more. If there is one right of a 
               <br />
               British subject which has been claimed by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Grey on many 
               <br />
               occasions during this session, it is the right 
               <br />
               of petition. After the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               began to petition like British subjects for 
               <br />
               the maintenance of separate schools in the 
               <br />
               Northwest, the ‘Orange Sentinel’ of March 
               <br />
               23. 1905, contained the following, under the
