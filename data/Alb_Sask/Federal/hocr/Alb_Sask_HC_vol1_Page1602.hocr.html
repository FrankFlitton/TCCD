               on that point here and now. There is an— 
               <br />
               other consideration. The subsidies which 
               <br />
               the new provinces will receive have a nom- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the amount of ungranted land available for 
               <br />
               revenue purposes. It is because of the 
               <br />
               large areas of the new provinces that it is 
               <br />
               possible to give them the liberal subsidies 
               <br />
               we have accorded. Were it only the old 
               <br />
               districts of Alberta, Saskatchewan and As- 
               <br />
               siniboia, that were organized into two new 
               <br />
               provinces, they could not have claimed, and 
               <br />
               I believe they would not have obtained, that 
               <br />
               liberal treatment which it is proposed to 
               <br />
               give the new provinces. Is it to be said 
               <br />
               that we are to give the new provinces a 
               <br />
               large subsidy proportionate to their large 
               <br />
               area, and then cut off that very area from

               Mr. OLIVER. I will accept the apology 
               <br />
               of the hon. member (Mr. Foster), and I will 
               <br />
               say that he was threatening revenge and 
               <br />
               not revolution. Last night the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Montreal (Mr. Am-es) was almost 
               <br />
               eloquent in informing us of how little im- 
               <br />
               portance this division was because it was 
               <br />
               momentary, and immediately the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture met it could make its own redistribu- 
               <br />
               tion. I say that this parliament has respon- 
               <br />
               sibility in this matter irrespective of what 
               <br />
               action the provincial legislature may take. 
               <br />
               We propose to create these provinces with 
               <br />
               these areas, the duty is laid upon us of dis- 
               <br />
               tributing the seats, and our responsibility is 
               <br />
               to see that that area is represented proper— 
               <br />
               ly and adequately. It is for that reason we 
               <br />
               propose to give this representation to the 
               <br />
               district of Athabaska. It is entitled to re- 
               <br />
               presentation as a part of the province, and 
               <br />
               this parliament would be doing less than its 
               <br />
               duty if it did not provide representation for 
               <br />
               that district. Is it to be said that the dis- 
               <br />
               trict of St. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Albert,</span> or the district of Stur— 
               <br />
               geen, or the district of Saskatchewan, which 
               <br />
               border on this district of Athabaska, and 
               <br />
               which already are two or three times the 
               <br />
               area of any of the districts in the southern 
               <br />
               Dart of the country; is it to be said that 
               <br />
               these districts shall also have the charge 
               <br />
               Of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representing</span> the district of Athabaska ? 
               <br />
               Surely that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggestion,</span> would be as unfair
