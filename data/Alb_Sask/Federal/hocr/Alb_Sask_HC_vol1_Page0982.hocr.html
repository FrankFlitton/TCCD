               Now, Mr. Speaker, I cannot for the life 
               <br />
               of me see how the people in the Northwest 
               <br />
               can do anything else than support such a 
               <br />
               school system as that. This class of 
               <br />
               schools has been in operation now for 
               <br />
               thirty years, it. was instituted by the people 
               <br />
               themselves, it has been voted upon and 
               <br />
               approved as it now stands, ever since 1892. 
               <br />
               It has given the very best of satisfaction, 
               <br />
               and the people say themselves that if it 
               <br />
               were left to them to decide they would 
               <br />
               continue this identical system. Now why 
               <br />
               should we not allow them to do so, es- 
               <br />
               pecially when we ﬁnd the system itself so 
               <br />
               excellent? Now we are told by people 
               <br />
               in Toronto and other places that the people 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories do not want 
               <br />
               these schools, that there is a terrible state 
               <br />
               of excitement in the Northwest. Well, Sir, 
               <br />
               I would like to give you a little evidence 
               <br />
               of how the people in the Northwest look 
               <br />
               at this subject, and I will read a letter 
               <br />
               which has just appeared in the ‘Globe’ 
               <br />
               from a gentleman in the Northwest. He 
               <br />
               is one of my constituents and has lived 
               <br />
               in my constituency for many years, but at 
               <br />
               present he is travelling on the road. The 
               <br />
