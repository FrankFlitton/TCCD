               the polling subdivisions which run north and 
               <br />
               south of it and take the names out from the

               list and see how many are in the south

               and north, you would get at the exact 
               <br />
               ﬁgures. The illustration the hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               man gave is hardly fair, having regard to 
               <br />
               the fact that there are about 1,650 more 
               <br />
               names in Medicine Hat and that Strathcona 
               <br />

               Mr. SCOTT. I would ask what greater

               dividing line between the south and the

               done, why not trace a line through the centre

               Mr. HE-RRON. One good reason why 
               <br />
               the capital should not be placed at Edmon— 
               <br />
               [on is that at present the population does 
               <br />
               not extend a great distance north of that 
               <br />
               It extends south to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the—boundary.</span> 
               <br />
               about 350 miles by the most direct way of 
               <br />
               travel. One travelling from the Crow’s 
               <br />
               Nest Pass. for instance, would have to make 
               <br />
               a three-day‘s journey by rail. The journey 
               <br />
               from Cardston by rail would be about as 
               <br />
               long. If the capital were ﬁxed at Calgary 
               <br />
               it would be the most convenient point for all 
               <br />
               parts of the province. The people of the 
               <br />
               southern country certainly protest against 
               <br />
               having the capital placed at Edmonton.
