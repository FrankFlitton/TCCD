               <br />

               <br />
               We are dealing with a territory not with

               <br />
               says, separate—schools. The words ‘by 
               <br />
               law’ occurring both in subsection 1 and 
               <br />
               subsection 3, I submit, mean, by an inde— 
               <br />
               pendent law of the provinces, and do not

               mean by a law of the Dominion forced upon 
               <br />
               any province. The Act of 1875, as I have 
               <br />
               before observed, was a Dominion Act passed 
               <br />
               at a time when the Territories had no re- 
               <br />
               presentation in this parliament. It was 
               <br />
               not a voluntary independent law of even 
               <br />
               a territory. The ordinances as I have also 
               <br />
               observed can only be regarded as the out- 
               <br />
               come of the Act of 1875, which, we cannot 
               <br />
               hear too strongly in mind, was a Dominion 
               <br />
               Act which forced separate schools upon the 
               <br />
               Territories. As a third reason it may be 
               <br />
               observed that the class of persons must 
               <br />
               have such right at the union. The Terri- 
               <br />
               tories came into confederation, beyond ques- 
               <br />
               tion, in 1870, and there is no pretense that 
               <br />
               at that time such a right existed, for the 
               <br />
               very good reason that practically no schools 
               <br />
               of any kind then existed in the Territories 
               <br />
               As regards subsection 2 of section 93, that 
               <br />
               admittedly relates only to Ontario and Que— 
               <br />
               bec and does not enter into this discussion. 
               <br />
               For the same identical reasons which 1 
               <br />
               have stated as to subsection 1 of section 
               <br />
               93. I would contend that subsections 3 and 
               <br />
               4 providing for a remedial order and for 
               <br />

               tion 3, if Alberta or Saskatchewan when 
               <br />
               they become provinces, should enact a

               <br />
               result is that the Dominion parliament 
               <br />
               can create a province, and then the gen-

               of section 93 apply or not is dependent on

               three facts, which. being facts, cannot be 
               <br />
               altered by legislation. And these facts are : 
               <br />
               First, Whether the area to be admitted is 
               <br />
               or is not already a province; second, whe- 
               <br />
               ther there is or is not a system of. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> 
               <br />
               schools <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">already/_</span> in existence there by law 
               <br />
               of that province; and third, whether such 
               <br />
               law exists at the union. All three ot‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these:</span> 
               <br />
               questions must be answered in the negative 
               <br />
               in the case both of Alberta and Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan. But as I have observed, if either of 
               <br />
               these provinces. after their erection into 
               <br />
               provinces, saw ﬁt to enact a separate school 
               <br />
               law. such law at once would become irre- 
               <br />
               vocable; and to that extent, but to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> 
               <br />
               extent only, in my humble judgment, sub-

               sections 3 and 4 of section 93 would apply. 
               <br />
               In view of these considerations, which, it 
               <br />
               is clear to me, are beyond question, what
