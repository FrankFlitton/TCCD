               There is also the question of vested 
               <br />
               rights. In 1875, parliament passed a law 
               <br />
               granting a temporary constitution to the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, and by that consti- 
               <br />
               tution parliament declared that certain 
               <br />
               rights granted to the minority would be 
               <br />
               for ever assured to them. The rights of the 
               <br />
               Catholic minority were recognized by re- 
               <br />
               presentatives of a dilÏerent religious belief, 
               <br />
               and it was Mr. Blake himself who brought 
               <br />
               up the question. That same policy was 
               <br />
               conﬁrmed, in 1880, by the Conservative gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the time. It was enacted once 
               <br />
               more that the Catholic population would 
               <br />
               have their separate schools, and parliament 
               <br />
               is to-day bound in honour to continue that 
               <br />
               system. The government itself through its 
               <br />
               oiﬁcers has declared that the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada had guaranteed that right to the 
               <br />
               minority. I ﬁnd the proof of this in a

               Mr. Speaker, in the course of this debate, 
               <br />
               we hare often heard about provincial rights; 
               <br />
               but we have heard very little about other 
               <br />
               rights of 'much more value, I mean indi- 
               <br />
               vidual rights. Among those privileges 
               <br />
               which, in England, Simon de Montfort and 
               <br />
               .the other Norman barons forced King John 
               <br />
               to grant them in that Magna Charta so dear

               <br />
               was that personal liberty so dear to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">English</span> people ? It was because <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they,</span> even 
               <br />
               at that time understood the true principles 
               <br />

               turn to the old notions which were current 
               <br />
               in the days of tyranny. ‘ I have here a letter 
               <br />
               published in one of the city newspapers 
               <br />
               against separate schools, under the signature 
               <br />
               of a man of some education. In support of 
               <br />
               .his view, he quotes Aristotle. in the follow— 
               <br />
               ing words: ‘The state, as regards its citi- 
               <br />
               zens. plays the part of an educator. It 
               <br />
               strives to regulate their actions. The most 
               <br />
               despicable of states is that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> lets each

               <br />
               cation should be public and common ’. Such, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, was the tyrannical system o_t 
               <br />
               the Ancients. The Spartans, in the interest 
               <br />
               of the commonwealth, deprived the head of a

               <br />

               <br />
               only nourishment of all; strict regulations 
               <br />
               were enacted on all subjects. The indivi-

               but left a hateful name in history.
