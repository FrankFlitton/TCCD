               to take place within six months from the 
               <br />
               date of the creation of these provinces and 
               <br />
               any foreigner coming into the country after 
               <br />
               the 1st of January would have no vote. 
               <br />
               Even a man coming from one of the older 
               <br />
               provinces would not be in these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces long enough to vote. On that map 
               <br />
               it will be found there are 325 thickly settled 
               <br />
               townships south of 38, and 239 sparsely 
               <br />
               settled. North of 38 there are 248 
               <br />
               thickly settled and 159 sparsely settled 
               <br />
               townships. What I desire to point 
               <br />
               out .to the House is that all the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures I have given show that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distribution</span> made by the legislative as- 
               <br />
               sembly on the 1st May, 1902, was absolutely 
               <br />
               fair, that the proportion was 9 to 6 and that 
               <br />
               if there has been any change since that date 
               <br />
               the change has been in favour of the south 
               <br />
               as the inﬂux of population <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;there</span> .has, of 
               <br />
               course, been greater. I will take these 
               <br />
               thickly settled townships and the scattered 
               <br />
               townships and try to determine where the 
               <br />
               bulk of the rural population is. That is a 
               <br />
               much more deﬁnite way of arriving at it 
               <br />
               than by any local improvement districts, I 
               <br />
               submit. If you take it that there are eight 
               <br />
               times the number of people in a thickly 
               <br />
               settled township as in a sparsely settled 
               <br />
               township your <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> will work out so as 
               <br />
               to show a rural <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population,</span> bo be 105,504. 
               <br />
               While a calculation of that kind may 
               <br />
               result in certain local inaccuracies if you 
               <br />
               take it over the whole province you will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that it will equalize or balance. The 
               <br />
               result of it is. adding. rural and urban pop- 
               <br />
               ulation together. that there are, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">102,834</span> 
               <br />
               people south of 38 and 69.021 north of 38. 
               <br />
               My right hon. friend the First Minister 
               <br />
               seems inclined to doubt this calculation, but 
               <br />
               I desire to be perfectly fair and to make 
               <br />
               myself clear, and perhaps I will be able to 
               <br />
               give him some more calculations which bear 
               <br />
               out. the proportions I have arrived at and

               south to 10 north. I am going to trouble 
               <br />
               the House for a moment in giving some 
               <br />
               further ﬁgures to verify what I have said, 
               <br />
               and I submit that whatever investigation 
               <br />
               you may make will bring you to the same 
               <br />
               conclusion as that which I have arrived. 
               <br />
               But, before I proceed to discuss that let 
               <br />
               me take up the basis of calculation adopted 
               <br />
               by the government—the schools. They say 
               <br />
               that there are 130 more schools north. 
               <br />
               What does that prove ? Twelve children 
               <br />
               can form a school. You will ﬁnd schools 
               <br />
               more frequently in a country where the 
               <br />
               roads are bad. No person will contend for 
               <br />
               one minute that in the ridings to the north 
               <br />
               Where they have a continuous agitation for 
               <br />
               better roads, they would have the same 
               <br />
               number of schools if their roads were ot“ the 
               <br />
               class that they have in the riding of Calgary. 
               <br />
               It simply <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proves</span> nothing. Then, take the 
               <br />
               post ofﬁces. I have not been able to get 
               <br />
               a post ofﬁce established in my constituency. 
               <br />
               We had the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty</span> with the hon. 
               <br />
               minister of the Interior when 'he represented 
               <br />
               that riding. We would plead with him for 
               <br />
               a post oﬂice but we could not get it. I 
               <br />
               might mention one that we desire to have 
               <br />
               established at Carbon. We could not get 
               <br />
               it. I can point out post ofﬁces in that 
               <br />
               northern country where the revenue is $60 
               <br />
               and where it costs the government $1,500 
               <br />
               a year to pro-vide for them. The people in 
               <br />
               the neighbourhood of Carbon petitioned the 
               <br />
               minister time after time and they could not 
               <br />
               get their post otﬁce. Eventually it was got 
               <br />
               by sending the wife of a member of parlia— 
               <br />
               ment to the hon. Postmaster General and 
               <br />
               telling him that she had two sons north of 
               <br />
               the Rosebud river and she could not hear 
               <br />
               from them more than once every two weeks. 
               <br />
               The result was that the post ofﬁce was 
               <br />
               granted. The only post oﬁice that has been 
               <br />
               established in the Calgary district has been 
               <br />
               one that was asked for by the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Strathcona (Mr. Talbot). I have 
               <br />
               asked for several myself; one of them I 
               <br />
               might mention at Sbrathmore. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But,</span> the
