               struck at the national school idea in the new

               those who hold his views, the word ‘ union ’

               British North America Act of 1867 applies 
               <br />
               to the Territories when taken over by the 
               <br />
               Canadian government in 1870. If that opin-

               ion be good law, then the national school

               <br />
               of the new provinces might feel it their 
               <br />
               duty to enact would have full sway, because 
               <br />
               in 1870 there were no separate schools in the 
               <br />
               Territories to claim the protection of the

               vinces the day they are constituted as such, 
               <br />
               and if nevertheless the legislatures of the 
               <br />
               new provinces should refuse to establish 
               <br />
               separate schools, it is fair to assume that 
               <br />
               the courts, when appealed to by the minor- 
               <br />
               ity, would compel them to do so. More than 
               <br />
               that the courts would be asked to decide 
               <br />
               the kind of separate schoolst'he minority are

               entitled to—whether the kind provided by 
               <br />
               the ordinance of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               in 1892; or the kind anticipated by the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories Act of 1875, which 
               <br />
               were in vogue between 1884 and 1892. If 
               <br />
               the courts should decide in favour of the 
               <br />
               latter, the people of the Territories would 
               <br />
               for ever be tied to a system of separate 
               <br />
               schools of the extreme type, purely denomi-

               <br />
               national schools prepared to take that risk, 
               <br />
               for that is the risk they take by supporting

               What is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diit‘erence</span> between these two

               of this House have had before them the text

               of the Northwest Territories ordinance of 
               <br />
               1892, so that it is not necessary to explain 
               <br />
               in detail the school system now existing in 
               <br />
               the Territories. I may brieﬂy say that the 
               <br />
               schools now in vogue are national in the full 
               <br />
               meaning of the word. A responsible min- 
               <br />
               ister is at their head, they are administered 
               <br />
               by a national council, they are inspected by 
               <br />
               a national inspector, they are taught by 
               <br />
               teachers qualiﬁed under national and com-

               <br />
               remote and distorted connection with this 
               <br />
               agitation that is existing in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario to-day. Mr. Speaker, I am here to 
               <br />
               say that if it is a proper thing to have the 
               <br />
               name of God mentioned in our schools, if 
               <br />
               it is proper to supplement the religious 
               <br />
               teachings of the home and church with a 
               <br />
               Christian atmosphere in the school-room— 
               <br />
               and such a thing is declared proper by the 
               <br />
               leaders of all the churches—then the only 
               <br />
               practical way is to separate the children for 
               <br />
               this purpose. My hon. friend from Montreal 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Ames) quoted the other day the opinion 
               <br />
               of the late Dr. King, principal of the Mani- 
               <br />
               toba college in favour of teaching religion 
               <br />
               in the schools. He might also have quoted 
               <br />
               his successor Dr. Patrick, who is a strong. 
               <br />
               advocate of religious exercises in our public 
               <br />
               schools. He might also have quoted the 
               <br />
               late Archbishop Macrae, primate of all Can- 
               <br />
               ada, who expressed very strong views on 
               <br />
               the same subject. and the leaders of the- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Methodist</span> church in Manitoba. If then. it is 
               <br />
               right and proper to have the name of God 
               <br />
               mentioned and honoured in our public 
               <br />
               schools and a short time devoted to religious 
               <br />
               teaching, the only practical way in which 
               <br />
               you can do that is to separate the children. 
               <br />
               It is beyond the wisdom of mortals, it is 
               <br />
               impossible for. human ingenuity to devise a 
               <br />
               common religious ground upon which all 
               <br />
               can stand. But we are told that if the 
               <br />
               children are separated in school, they will 
               <br />
               be separated as citizens in manhood and 
               <br />
               womanhood. There is no doubt some little 
               <br />
               truth in that statement ; but if we carry this 
               <br />
               idea to a logical conclusion, we must close 
               <br />
               all our denominational colleges and semi- 
               <br />
               naries. Are there half a dozen hon. mem- 
               <br />
               bers in this House who are not supporting 
               <br />
               voluntary separate schools? I am at this-
