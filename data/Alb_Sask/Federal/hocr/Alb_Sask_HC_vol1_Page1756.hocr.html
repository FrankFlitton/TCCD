               at once subject to the provisions of this

               a thing under our constitution, in matters 
               <br />
               of education, as absolute provincial rights. 
               <br />
               Speaking upon this subject on the second 
               <br />
               reading of the Bill my hon. friend (Mr. It. 
               <br />
               L. Borden) quoted some remarks of mine 
               <br />
               in which I deprecated the interference of 
               <br />
               the Dominion with provincial legislation. 
               <br />
               If my hon. friend will do me the honour to 
               <br />
               study the opinions I have expressed on this 
               <br />
               subject since I have been in parliament, he 
               <br />
               could have quoted much more in the same 
               <br />
               line, and expressing the same views. More 
               <br />
               than once upon the ﬂoor of this House I 
               <br />
               have compared, upon this subject and other 
               <br />
               subjects, our constitution with the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of the United States; and whilst in 
               <br />
               general terms I have always maintained 
               <br />
               that in many respects our constitution is 
               <br />
               superior to the American constitution, my 
               <br />
               opinion has never varied that upon this 
               <br />
               subject, namely, the respective powers of 
               <br />
               the federal and state governments, the Am- 
               <br />
               erican constitution is far superior to our 
               <br />
               own. Under the American system the 
               <br />
               powers of each government, both the federal 
               <br />
               and the state, are clearly deﬁned, so that 
               <br />
               there can be no overlapping by one over the 
               <br />
               other, and no supervision of the one over 
               <br />
               the other, except the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:judicial</span> authority 
               <br />
               which keeps each <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one-in</span> check. Unfortuna- 
               <br />
               tely such has not been our system ; unfortu- 
               <br />
               nately, I say, the fathers of confederation, 
               <br />
               for good and sufﬁcient reasons, I am sure, 
               <br />
               reasons which I understand and appreci— 
               <br />
               ate, came to a different conclusion, and did 
               <br />
               not make an absolute separation between 
               <br />
               the local powers and the powers of the cen~ 
               <br />
               tral government, but in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">avnumber</span> of cases 
               <br />
               allowed them to overlap each other, though 
               <br />
               in all cases they made the powers of the 
               <br />
               legislature subject to the power of the cen- 
               <br />
               tral government; and in some cases, as in 
               <br />
               this one, they made special provision that 
               <br />
               the powers of the legislature, under certain 
               <br />
               circumstances, were subject to supervision 
               <br />
               by the central government. The fathers of 
               <br />
               confederation, I say, for good and sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               reasons, came to that conclusion. Now, it 
               <br />
               has been stated, and I believe it is true, 
               <br />
               that it would not have been possible at that 
               <br />
               time to accomplish the project of confedera— 
               <br />
               tion unless this provision had been inserted 
               <br />
               in the constitution. But my hon. friend on 
               <br />
               the occasion I have referred to, expressed 
               <br />
               the idea that the restrictions which are con- 
               <br />
               tained in the British North America Act and 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">curtail</span> the powers of the legislature 
               <br />
               in matters of education, must be and are 
               <br />
               conﬁned by the letter of the constitution to 
               <br />
               Quebec and Ontario alone. In order that I 
               <br />
               may do my hon. friend no injustice, and 
               <br />
