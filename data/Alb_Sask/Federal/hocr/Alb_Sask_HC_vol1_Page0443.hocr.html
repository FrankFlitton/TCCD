               hon. gentleman who has taken his seat 
               <br />

               <br />
               he has discussed this question, and I am 
               <br />
               afraid that, as a new member, with very 
               <br />
               little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">experience</span> in this House, I shall be

               for me in dealing with the subject under 
               <br />
               discussion. My hon. friend started out by 
               <br />
               ﬁnding fault with the land policy of this 
               <br />
               government. But that policy, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               is not a new one. It is not a policy of to-day 
               <br />
               or yesterday, but one which was laid down 
               <br />
               by a gentleman who had about as able a 
               <br />
               mastery of public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> in this country as 
               <br />
               any man who ever lived in it. I refer to 
               <br />
               the Rt. Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald, the 
               <br />
               greatest leader of which the party to which 
               <br />
               my hon. friend belongs could ever boast. It 
               <br />
               was he who laid down the land policy we 
               <br />
               have since followed, and in criticising that 
               <br />
               policy my hon. friend is setting himself at 
               <br />
               issue with that great leader. 
               <br />

               The right hon. Sir John Macdonald, in 
               <br />
               1870, laid down the land policy of this coun- 
               <br />
               try. In 1872 he went to the country and 
               <br />
               was sustained. In 1878 he was returned to 
               <br />
               power; and he was sustained after that 
               <br />
               in the general elections of 1882, 1887 and 
               <br />
               1891. I should say that was a sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               test of the policy of Sir John Macdonald 
               <br />
               so far as the land question is concerned, 
               <br />
               and that it is rather too late in the day now 
               <br />
               to declare that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> is a policy that should not 
               <br />
               be followed in this country. A few days ago 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster) laid down a doctrine, which, if it is 
               <br />
               a wise one in regard to the matter to which 
               <br />
               he referred, would be equally wise here. 
               <br />
               Speaking of the school question, he said 
               <br />
               that the people of this country had recog- 
               <br />
               nized the wisdom of the policy of the Lib- 
               <br />
               eral party in 1896, and again in 1900, and 
               <br />
               again in 1904, and, so far as he was con- 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               cerned, he would not bother with the subject 
               <br />
               any longer, but would let well enough alone. 
               <br />
               I say if that was a Wise policy with respect 
               <br />
               to the school question it is equally wise <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">With</span> 
               <br />
               respect to the land policy of Sir John Mac- 
               <br />
               donald which has been so often approved by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               the people of this country. I submit that 
               <br />
               Lot only did the country generally com- 
               <br />
               mend that policy, but the province of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba, in which the policy was ﬁrst put in 
               <br />
               operation, has, it I am correctly informed, 
               <br />
               always given a handsome majority to the 
               <br />
               Conservative party of which Sir John Mac- 
               <br />
               donald was the head. When the land 
               <br />
               policy of Sir John Macdonald has been 
               <br />
               approved by the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               for thirty—ﬁve years, I think it comes 
               <br />
               ——I will not say with ill grace but—- 
               <br />
               with little force from the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               (Mr. W. J. Roche) to ﬁnd fault with the 
               <br />
               right hon. Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laur- 
               <br />
               ier), because he continues that policy. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, the hon, member for Marquette 
               <br />
               makes an onslaught on this government, 
               <br />
               and especially on the Prime Minister, be- 
               <br />
               cause he does not change the boundaries of 
               <br />
               the province. I understood my hon. friend 
               <br />
               (Mr. Roche) to be strongly in favour of 
               <br />
               provincial rights and as strongly against' 
               <br />
               anything that would interfere with those 
               <br />
               rights without the provinces being con- 
               <br />
               sulted. I happen to have in my hand 
               <br />
               the statute on this particular question 
               <br />
               showing that it is not open to any 
               <br />
               Prime Minister or government to deal 
               <br />
               with the question exactly as he may 
               <br />
               think proper. I gather from what the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman (Mr. W. J. Roche) says 
               <br />
               that if there were a provision in this Bill 
               <br />
               extending the boundaries of Manitoba and 
               <br />
               making half a dozen other changes in the 
               <br />
               boundaries of Ontario, Quebec and other 
               <br />
               provinces, he would support it. But the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman must not forget that we have 
               <br />
               no powers to deal indiscriminately with the 
               <br />
               dividing lines between provinces. There 
               <br />
               is an Act of the imperial parliament regulat- 
               <br />
               ing matters of this kind; and, before we 
               <br />
               do anything about changing our neighbours’ 
               <br />
               land mark, we must consider that statute 
               <br />
