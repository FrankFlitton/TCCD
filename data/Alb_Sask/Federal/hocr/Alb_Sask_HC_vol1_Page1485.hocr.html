               cure of them is rather in negotiation and in

               arise out of this Act which we are now

               on parliament and on the govermnent the

               <br />
               relief of the settlers of the Northwest in the 
               <br />
               matter of this exemption clause. The relief 
               <br />
               in regard to the lands is coming gradually 
               <br />
               by the sale of the lands after twenty years. 
               <br />
               But this other frightful exemption, which 
               <br />
               declares that the company shall be for ever 
               <br />
               tree from taxation by the Dominion or any 
               <br />

               <br />
               ever put on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statute‘book</span> of Canada. 
               <br />
               There is no such exemption in any other con- 
               <br />
               tract in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> of ours. I challenge 
               <br />
               any one to produce an equal one. It may 
               <br />
               not have been regarded in that light at the. 
               <br />
               time it was imposed. The opposition of 
               <br />
               that day did so regard it, but the govern- 
               <br />
               ment did not; but it is to—day the most in- 
               <br />
               iquitous exemption in Canada or in any 
               <br />

               iniquity of the exemption and asking for

               <br />

               <br />
               To that extent that clause is a contract be-

               <br />
               than that. That clause is in effect a contract

               between this parliament and the Canadian

               my hon. friend refers to is concerned, if par— 
               <br />
               liainent wants to rid the Territories of that 
               <br />
               incubus. if I may use'the word, parliament 
               <br />
               is free to do it. Parliament has the means 
               <br />
               in its own hands, if the people of this coun- 
               <br />
               try want to assume additional burdens to 
               <br />
               those which they already assumed in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with that railway. But let us do one 
               <br />
               thing at a time. Let us give effect to what 
               <br />
               we contracted to do in 1881. When we have 
               <br />
               done that, the door is still wide open to us 
               <br />
               it' we want to go further.
