               <br />
               a right that does not belong <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> him. Now we 
               <br />
               are asked at this late, late date, after we have 
               <br />
               been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislsartinlg</span> for the last three or four 
               <br />
               months, to put a chain around the neck of 
               <br />
               these new provinces, restricting their rights, 
               <br />
               coercing them. That is what the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man is doing. Now 'he says they have not 
               <br />
               been coerced enough. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Labelle (LMr. Bourassa) has opened his eyes, 
               <br />
               and he makes out that they are not coerced 
               <br />
               enough, so he wants to apply a further mea- 
               <br />
               sure of coercion, he wants to add an amend- 
               <br />
               ment that will coerce them not only in rela- 
               <br />
               tion to separate schools, but also in relation 
               <br />
               to their public schools. I think this isa very 
               <br />
               serious question indeed. What right have 
               <br />
               we to interfere with the public schools of 
               <br />
               Alberta and Saskatchewan ? The provinces 
               <br />
               alone have the right to legislate on that mat- 
               <br />
               ter. But the hon. member for Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lLamont)</span> does not think so. Well, 
               <br />
               I do not think he is representing the people 
               <br />
               of his constituency, and when the time 
               <br />
               comes they will tell him that he has not 
               <br />
               represented their views on this question, 
               <br />
               that they do not wish to be coerced in the 
               <br />
               matter which belongs exclusively to them to 
               <br />
               deal with. The amendment has just been 
               <br />
               handed to me, and I have scarcely had an 
               <br />
               opportunity of reading it; but I under- 
               <br />
               stand it is to apply a further measure of co- 
               <br />
               ercion. Now I take the ground that we have 
               <br />
               no right to restrict the provinces at all in 
               <br />
               relation to education. Unfortunately clause 
               <br />
               16 is likely to go through, because hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen opposite are bound that these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">throttledband</span> gagged and 
               <br />
               restricted. On the general principle that 
               <br />
               I disapprove of interfering with the 
               <br />
               rights of the provinces I propose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to,</span> vote 
               <br />
               against this amendment. We have gone 
               <br />
               already too far in the matter of restric- 
               <br />
               tion, and I think the hon. gentlemen ought 
               <br />
               to hesitate before they apply this further

               <br />
               is unfair. The hon. member for West As- 
               <br />
               siniboia (Mr. Scott) read an extract from a 
               <br />
               gentleman whom he said was the Reverend 
               <br />
               Mr. Carmichael. I do not know the gen- 
               <br />
               tleman, he may be a very estimable gentle- 
               <br />
               man, probably he is, because he has-the 
               <br />
               honour to belong to the same church as I 
               <br />
               do. But we know that many good men go 
               <br />
               wrong at times—like the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Cape Breton (Mr. D. D. McKenzie), a very 
               <br />
               decent man under ordinary conditions, but 
               <br />
               when he gets excited <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“and</span> carried away, he 
               <br />
               goes wrong. The hon. member for Assini- 
               <br />
               boia goes wrong; the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan has gone very far astray 
               <br />
               when he consented to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">something:</span> that 
               <br />
               even a member of the government had not 
               <br />
               the cheek to undertake. I do not think that 
               <br />
               what the Reverend Mr. Carmichael said was 
               <br />
               very pertinent to this question. By the way, 
               <br />
               did Mr. Carmichael know that the member 
               <br />
               for Saskatchewan was going to move this 
               <br />
               further coercion measure ? When he knows 
               <br />
               that he may change his opinion. It is unfair 
               <br />
               to quote him until he has had an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of reading the amendment of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Saskatchewan. Now, I 
               <br />
               have stated my opinion plainly, I am going 
               <br />

               Mr. SPROULE. I stated a short time ago 
               <br />
               that this was an attack upon the public 
               <br />
               schools. In fact, since this Blll was intro- 
               <br />
               duced, the government have been proceed- 
               <br />
               ing step by step to attack public schools. 
               <br />
               Let me give the steps brieﬂy. First, there 
               <br />
               was the attempt to discredit the public 
               <br />
               schools by declaring the superiority of 
               <br />
               church schools. That was the ﬁrst step 
               <br />
               when the Bill was introduced, and the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister was responsible for that, when he 
               <br />
               tried to show the superiority of the dual 
               <br />
               system over the-national system of the 
               <br />
               United States. Next, by restricting the right 
               <br />
               of the provinces to deal with their own edu- 
               <br />
               cational affairs.‘ This has always hereto— 
               <br />
               fore been understood as one of the exclusive 
               <br />
               rights of the provinces, except the provinces 
               <br />
               of Ontario and Quebec. The third is taking 
               <br />
               out of the province the control of separate 
               <br />
               schools ; the next is that in the federal par- 
               <br />
               liament we, by virtue of the law we pass 
               <br />
               here. compel them to give separate schools; 
               <br />
               and the fourth is that we propose by this 
               <br />
               amendment to give them, not only control 
               <br />
