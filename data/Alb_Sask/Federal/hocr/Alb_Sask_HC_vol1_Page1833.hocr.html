               The Privy Council for Canada was not 
               <br />
               an expert in the art of governing and 
               <br />
               organizing a colony. It would not be saying 
               <br />
               too much that many of the members of that 
               <br />
               Privy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council</span> believed that Canada was 
               <br />
               still a colony at that time. The Privy Coun- 
               <br />
               cil made many mistakes which necessitated 
               <br />
               the interference of the English cabinet. 
               <br />
               These mistakes and this interference brought 
               <br />
               the recognition of the rights and privileges 
               <br />
               of the inhabitants of the Territories, and 
               <br />
               the solemn promise that these rights and 
               <br />
               privileges <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would!</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">always</span> be: protected. 
               <br />
               Right shall be done in all cases, but let us 
               <br />
               not anticipate. This drama of the transfer 
               <br />
               of the territory to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Canada</span> lasted for more 
               <br />
               than a year. There were some comical in- 
               <br />
               cidents, when the governor of the new pro— 
               <br />
               vince would not be accepted by his subjects ; 
               <br />
               tragical incidents, such as the execution of 
               <br />
               Scott, and last the opera bouffe ﬁnale, when 
               <br />
               Fort Garry was taken by Colonel Wolseley. 
               <br />
               These incidents of so different nature were 
               <br />
               merely incidents. The main part was the 
               <br />
               resistance of twelve or thirteen inhabitants 
               <br />
               of the territory who did not want to come 
               <br />

               <br />

               It was in March, 1869, that «the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conditions</span> of

               <br />
               of the country were entirely ignored. Later on,

               Lord Granville in his despatch to Sir John

               <br />
               from the dangers of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">approaching</span> change.’ 
               <br />
               This wise advice was not noted upon; on the 
               <br />
               contrary, such measures .were taken that Lord

               <br />
               ber, 1869, did not hesitate to state : ‘ The Can-

               <br />
               ‘ Those proceedings have certainly enhanced the 
               <br />
               responsibility of the Canadian government.’ 
               <br />

               selves a closer direction of affairs, in order, 
               <br />
               according to Lord Granvillie’s words: ‘to ex-

               <br />
               before having recourse to force.’ To comply 
               <br />
               with such direction the Canadian government 
               <br />
               asked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vicar</span> General Thibault and my friend Mr.

               I was then at Rome, enjoying the happiness 
               <br />
               that the grand and imposing ceremonies and

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deliberations</span> of the Ecumenical Council of the

               summons, the sovereign pontiff dispensed me

               <br />
               myself and added with emotion: ‘I bless the

               January, 1870. On my meeting Sir George Car- 
               <br />
               tier in Montreal, he said to me, with his usual 
               <br />

               remained in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">capital-1</span> some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«ten</span> days. I often
