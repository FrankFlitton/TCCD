               <br />
               _he made the statement—and I do not think

               he will deny it—that the distances were so

               great, that the means of communication 
               <br />
               were so few and that settlement was so 
               <br />
               sparse that it would be absolutely impos-

               sible for any man to attempt to adequately

               ing them representation in the local house 
               <br />
               with the northern part of Alberta than you 
               <br />
               are doing to the district ‘of Nipissing, the 
               <br />
               northern parts of the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               and the outlying parts of the constituencies 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec. If the argument 
               <br />
               applies that they should have representation 
               <br />
               because there is no person representing them 
               <br />
               in the local house, and that, as the lion. 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior says, they are con- 
               <br />
               tributing man for man their share towards 
               <br />
               the revenue of the country, then, why- not 
               <br />
               give representation in this house to Atha- 
               <br />
               baska, Mackenzie, Ungava, Franklin or 
               <br />
               Keewatin? The men living in these dis- 
               <br />
               tricts are contributing equally their share 
               <br />
               man for man towards the revenue of the 
               <br />
               country. Why should an exception be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made</span> 
               <br />
               in this case? What is it that requires specral

               representation up there ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Is</span> it an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultur-</span>

               or of wheat shipped in or out of Edmonton 
               <br />
               might be interesting. They have two ﬂour 
               <br />
               mills up there, but it is simply because they 
               <br />
               tell us of the great distance they are from 
               <br />
               where that commodity can be obtained. What
