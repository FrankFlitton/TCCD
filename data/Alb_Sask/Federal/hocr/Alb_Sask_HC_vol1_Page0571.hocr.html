               It is, as has been put by the leader of the

               opposition, a question as to whether or not 
               <br />
               any member of this government is respon-

               government or of the government as a whole 
               <br />
               commissioned the Papal ablegate to have 
               <br />
               this conference with Mr. Colin Campbell. 
               <br />
               \‘Ve heard a denial yesterday by one member 
               <br />
               of the government. What was that ? When 
               <br />
               it was charged by some gentlemen on this

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">side</span> of the House that the government of

               <br />
               the Papal ablegate does not say that he did 
               <br />
               not consult some member of the govern- 
               <br />

               Campbell. He makes a speciﬁc statement 
               <br />
               that he was not instructed 'by the govern- 
               <br />
               ment, but he did not make the statement 
               <br />
               that some hon. member of this cabinet did 
               <br />
               not ask him to have that interview and 
               <br />
               there is no denial by every member of the

               <br />

               the Papal ablegate as to the terms of this 
               <br />
               measure. That is not denied. The premier 
               <br />
               has had ample opportunities of denying it 
               <br />
               but he has not done so. The position of the 
               <br />
               Papal ablegate is reduced to this that he 
               <br />
               has made a speciﬁc denial of the statement

               <br />
               distinguished a member, and does any one 
               <br />
               believe that the Papal ablegate would be 
               <br />
               so lost to any sense of common reason that 
               <br />
               he of his own accord and off his own bat, 
               <br />
               would go about negotiating as he has been 
               <br />
               doing? I am not going to traverse the 
               <br />
               ground that has been gone over by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Toronto as to the

               equestrian performances of the premier on 
               <br />
               this question. The Prime Minister has 
               <br />
               played this game of fast and loose on this 
               <br />
               question from end to end of Canada. He 
               <br />
               has gone before Ontario posing as a per- 
               <br />
               fect Ajax defying the lightning as one who 
               <br />
               has been assailed by the hierarchy, and ask— 
               <br />
               ing Protestant votes on that score. It is 
               <br />
               amusing to read the utterances of that hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman in Ontario when he felt that he 
               <br />
               had not the power of the church behind him. 
               <br />
               Let me read his utterance in Toronto on a 
               <br />
               certain occasion when he thought it was 
               <br />
               necessary for the exigencies of his political 
               <br />
               party to make a bid for Ontario support. 
               <br />
               At a great meeting in September, 1889, in 
               <br />
               Toronto speaking on the Jesuits Estates 
               <br />
               Bill, he said:

               <br />
               IS prominently introduced in it, and that it 
               <br />
               was construed in such a manner as to mean a 
               <br />
               thing which I shall presently discuss—that it
