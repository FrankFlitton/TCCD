               tion of particulars, how can you argue that

               because in the north there are so many im-

               <br />
               many, therefore you have a basis from 
               <br />
               which you can deduce a greater or.a less 
               <br />
               population for the one part than for the 
               <br />
               other? These are three of the considera- 
               <br />
               tions upon which you say you rest your 
               <br />
               distribution. The Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               says he does not rest the division on these 
               <br />
               things. He is not driven by his assertion to 
               <br />
               argue an absurdity. The right hon. the 
               <br />
               First Minister is driven to argue an ab- 
               <br />
               surdity, and the absurdity is by making it 
               <br />
               appear that mere numbers of school—houses, 
               <br />
               numbers of post ofﬁces and numbers of im-

               the grain-growing areas on the farms are

               restricted to a few acres comparatively,

               whereas in rthe Northwest one man may

               moment that there is any connection be-

               cultural products raised in one section of

               that may be in each ? The argument, if 
               <br />
               any-thing, is against him. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> says; when 
               <br />
               you come to the south, it is rich in cattle, 
               <br />
               and cattle require great areas. But the 
               <br />
               south is not conﬁned to cattle entirely ; my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend ought to know that. Gen— . 
               <br />
               tlemen who come from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4Northwest</span> know 
               <br />
               that. Go down to the border, and you ﬁnd 
               <br />
               large ranching interests, but you ﬁnd other 
               <br />
               interests as well. Is it the one or the two 
               <br />
               kinds of products that you take as indi- 
               <br />
               cative of population, or is it the value of 
               <br />
               the whole mass taken together, and the 
               <br />
               value of the trade current in and out ? That 
               <br />
               is the kind of ﬁgures my hon. friend gave. 
               <br />
               In that there is some force ; but in the argu- 
               <br />
               ment used by my right hon. friend, I put it 
               <br />
               to himself whether there is either logic or 
               <br />
               good sense. Let me press it home to him 
               <br />
               once more, so as if I can to make him un- 
               <br />
               derstand what I am after. A school-house 
               <br />
               is standing in a certain place and a school- 
               <br />
               house is standing in another place. From 
               <br />
               the mere fact that a school—house is stand— 
               <br />
               ing in each place, how can you deduce the 
               <br />
               population which supports the school-house 
               <br />
               in each place? Is it possible ? Give the 
               <br />
               school population in the one case and the 
               <br />
               school population in the other, and any well 
               <br />
               instructed and informed man will give you 
               <br />
               a pretty close guess as to the total popula- 
               <br />
               tion in each. Let me go a little further.

               discursively about the three bases of this 
               <br />
               distribution. What was the ﬁrst ? The ﬁrst 
               <br />
               he declared to be existing conditions. Does 
               <br />
               any one know what he meant by that? I 
               <br />
               followed him very closely to get at the con- 
               <br />
               clusion he was going to deduce by saying 
               <br />
               that they had taken existing conditions into 
               <br />
               account. The only thing I could find was 
               <br />
               this. Under existing conditions you have 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen local members in what is the present 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province</span> of Alberta, and you must add ten 
               <br />
               more in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">)order</span> to make up twenty-ﬁve. I 
               <br />
               cannot see the argument in that. None of 
               <br />
               these ﬁfteen representatives are for the new 
               <br />
               province. The moment the province is form- 
               <br />
               ed, these members disappear, and you will
