               dressing the House. Therefore, I claim from 
               <br />
               my confreres here an unusual degree of le-

               any mistakes I may make, assuring them

               that those mistakes will be of the head not 
               <br />
               of the heart. Before I go further, I appeal to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iron.</span> members for consideration especially 
               <br />
               upon one point. I would ask an avoidance 
               <br />
               of interruptions such as we have just heard. 
               <br />
               If any statements I make are such as hon. 
               <br />
               members cannot agree with, they will have 
               <br />
               their opportunity to reply. I would ask, 
               <br />
               therefore, that I be spared interruption of 
               <br />
               the few remarks I am to make and I know

               would not speak. But I feel that I have 
               <br />
               behind me a constituency that should be

               heard on the ﬂoor of this House on this 
               <br />
               momentous question. But, if against my

               I can assure hon. members that it will not

               The question before us has been discussed 
               <br />
               threadbare. A man would need to be heaven- 
               <br />
               born, or at least heaven-inspired, to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               anything new to say upon this subject. 
               <br />
               Everything that can be thought of by the 
               <br />
               human mind has been thought of already, 
               <br />
               and everything that can be said has been 
               <br />
               said. I shall not even attempt anything 
               <br />
               of an original nature. Among the draw- 
               <br />
               backs to parliamentary life is the fact that 
               <br />
               we are called upon to hear again and again 
               <br />
               the same things said until they grow weari- 
               <br />
               some and make one look back to private 
               <br />
               life with longing.

               I said that I am here to speak, not in my 
               <br />
               individual capacity, but as representing the 
               <br />
               sentiments of the people in my constituency. 
               <br />
               The whole Dominion of Canada, I believe, 
               <br />
               is in favour of the establishment of the new 
               <br />
               provinces in the Northwest. I think there 
               <br />
               is no difference of opinion on that matter. 
               <br />
               But I think the government should have 
               <br />
               taken the people into their conﬁdence before 
               <br />
               taking a step of such grave import. Had they 
               <br />
               done so we would not have seen so much 
               <br />
               difference as has been in evidence on the

               part of our hon. fn'ends of the Liberal party. 
               <br />
               The premier, when he brought in this mea-

               sure, said that he would stand or fall by

               the great proﬁt of the country. I think it 
               <br />
               was a great mistake to introduce legislation 
               <br />
               so important as this after a general election 
               <br />
               in which the subject of such legislation had 
               <br />
               scarcely been mentioned. The government 
               <br />
               should have given the people an opportunity 
               <br />
               of expressing their opinion on this legisla- 
               <br />
               tion before it was introduced. But the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment did not see ﬁt to do so, and conse- 
               <br />
               quently this legislation has been brought be- 
               <br />
               fore a House elected, in my humble judg- 
               <br />
               ment, without any warrant to deal with the 
               <br />
               question. Had the boundaries of the new 
               <br />
               provinces been known to the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest, I think the result of the election 
               <br />
               would have been very different in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. Had the proposed bound- 
               <br />
               aries been known, would Manitoba have 
               <br />
               given this government one supporter? Would 
               <br />
               the men from the Territories have sent the 
               <br />
               same contingent had it been known that the 
               <br />
               control of the lands was to be wrested from 
               <br />
               their possession ? I pause ‘for a reply. 
               <br />
               Would they have been satisﬁed ? I say 
               <br />
               unhesitatingly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> defeat would have over- 
               <br />
               taken the government had inis Bill been in 
               <br />
               question at the last general election. I 
               <br />
               think that Manitoba has been treated with ' 
               <br />
               extreme injustice in leaving that province 
               <br />
               with an area only one-third that of each of 
               <br />
               the new provinces. There must be a. mys— 
               <br />
               tery attached to such an apportionment. Can 
               <br />
               the government defy or set aside the will 
               <br />
               of an entire province ? A new province 
               <br />
               bereft of the control of its lands is little 
               <br />
               more independent than the Indian reserve. 
               <br />
               I think that the local government is in a 
               <br />
               better position to deal with the lands of the 
               <br />
               province than is the federal government. 
               <br />
               They are on the spot, they are more directly 
               <br />
               in touch with everything concerning those 
               <br />
               lands than is the federal government situ- 
               <br />
               ated at Ottawa. Another objection I have 
               <br />
               to federal control of these lands is the 
               <br />
               temptation to spoliation offered to the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion government. I do not refer to this 
               <br />
               government any more than to any other 
               <br />
               government that might be in power at Otta— 
               <br />
               wa. I think there is less liability to act 
               <br />
               unfairly in regard to the disposition of those 
               <br />
               lands when they are left to the local author- 
               <br />
               ities than when they are left to the Dominion 
               <br />
               authorities.
