               Mr. FIELDING. This is one of the Bills 
               <br />
               for extending the time of insurance com- 
               <br />
               panies for organizing. We had a discussion 
               <br />
               in the House the other day on this subject, 
               <br />
               and I think the tendency of the House, and 
               <br />
               I may say the tendency of the committee 
               <br />
               which investigates these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matters,</span> is to dis- 
               <br />
               courage these extensions. I think every 
               <br />
               hon. member who is interested in these 
               <br />
               Bills should understand that unless an in- 
               <br />
               surance company, Oli' the people promoting 
               <br />
               it, have capitalists in sight ready to organ- 
               <br />
               ize the company, they ought not to approach 
               <br />
               the House for a charter, and if they after- 
               <br />
               wards ﬁnd that they cannot raise the money 
               <br />
               and they come for an extension, they should 
               <br />
               understand that such an extension should 
               <br />
               only be granted when special cause is 
               <br />
               shown. If this is generally understood, 
               <br />
               perhaps there‘ will be a little more care in 
               <br />
               the promotion of these Bills. The commit- 
               <br />
               tee agreed to pass this Bill, but I think I 
               <br />
               am voicing the general feeling of the com- 
               <br />
               mittee when I say that there is a very 
               <br />
               strong disinclination to grant these exten- 
               <br />
               sions from year to year. The same policy, 
               <br />
               I think, should be followed in reference to 
               <br />
               banks.
