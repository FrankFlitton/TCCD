               Now, Sir, such was the condition of things 
               <br />
               at the time of confederation. But I shall 
               <br />
               be told that this exception applies to On- 
               <br />
               tario and Quebec alone, and not to the 
               <br />
               other provinces. Sir, that is true. Amongst 
               <br />
               the four provinces then united, Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec alone had a system of separate 
               <br />
               schools. But I reminded the House a mo- 
               <br />
               ment ago that it was not the intention of 
               <br />
               the fathers of confederation, it was not the 
               <br />
               intention of Sir John Macdonald or Mr. 
               <br />
               Brown to limit confederation to the narrow 
               <br />
               bounds it had in 1867. They had made pro- 
               <br />
               vision in the very instrument of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, to extend it over the northern part of 
               <br />
               the continent; they had made provision to 
               <br />
               take in British Columbia, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and Prince Edward Island; they had made 
               <br />
               provision to take in also the Northwest Ter- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;</span> 
               <br />
               ritories, which were then uninhabited, buti 
               <br />
               which now have a teeming population 
               <br />
               and are at our doors asking admission. 
               <br />
               Is it reasonable to suppose, if the Con- 
               <br />
               federation Act recognizes that other pro- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               been the value of the invitation to enter 
               <br />
               confederation, if the provinces invited to 
               <br />
               enter. had been told that the security to the

               <br />

               had no system of schools either by law or
