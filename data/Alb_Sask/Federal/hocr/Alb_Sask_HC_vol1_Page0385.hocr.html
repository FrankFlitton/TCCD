               contained in his speech. The proposalsof 
               <br />
               the government contemplate a payment in 
               <br />

               <br />
               provinces aggregating $750,000 per annum at 
               <br />
               the beginning; as the population of the 
               <br />
               provinces increases, this payment is to

               to these proposals and suggests instead that

               the public domain should be transferred to
