               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I would be inclined 
               <br />
               to think that apart from the Act of 1885 
               <br />
               with which I am not familiar, the amend- 
               <br />
               ment of the Minister of Finance would 
               <br />
               be sufﬁcient for the purpose intended, al- 
               <br />
               though I have not given it very much con- 
               <br />
               sideration. but as I understand the mat- 
               <br />
               ter will be open when we get into com-

               Mr. R L. BORDEN. I intended to have 
               <br />
               asked. when clause 2 was being discus- 
               <br />
               sed why it is that the sum of $$, 107 500 has 
               <br />
               been selected as the amount of debt the 
               <br />
