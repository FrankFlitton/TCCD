               have tried to invade provincial rights we

               party. But, for a moment or two let us 
               <br />
               examine <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span> has happened on the other 
               <br />
               side. The moment the hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition has placed his constitutional gun 
               <br />

               splits to pieces. The hon. member for Jac- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the hon. member for Beauharnois (Mr. Ber- 
               <br />
               geron) not quite so badly wounded. The list 
               <br />
               of wounded grows every day. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Toronto says that 
               <br />
               the weakness of the Czar of Russia 
               <br />
               is that he does not consult his people. 
               <br />
               Then, I might retort: What is the weak- 
               <br />
               ness of the hon. leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion? If it is a mistake for the Czar 
               <br />
               of Russia not to consult his people how 
               <br />
               much greater a mistake must it be for that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman to turn his gun against his 
               <br />
               own lieutenants and his own regiment? 
               <br />
               But, we have not heard so far in this House 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the hon. member for South York (Mr.

               <br />
               making a plea such as he made to-day in 
               <br />
               favour of provincial rights. That hon. gen-

               tleman succeeded in the not very remote 
               <br />
               past in making himself plainly understood 
               <br />
               on the question of provincial rights. It was 
               <br />
               in March. 1902. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vhat</span> did the hon. member

               for South York say? He was speaking in

               provincial government in Canada has been 
               <br />

               against the interests of the country as a whole. 
               <br />
               That I regret. I agree with the hon. member

               vincial rights. He sought to escape the con-

               <br />
               There have been very strong appeals made 
               <br />
               to religious and racial prejudices in this 
               <br />
               country. I will not refer to the circular 
               <br />

               <br />
               a purely local paper, and from the extracts
