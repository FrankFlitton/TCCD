               Now. I think it perfectly plain that this 
               <br />
               parliament has no power to pass this legis-

               <br />
               to pass it, I would still oppose it upon the 
               <br />
               ground that it is an unwarrantable, ﬂagrant

               invasion of provincial rights. Education is 
               <br />
               a matter essentially of provincial concern. 
               <br />
               What right have we sitting in this House,

               matter that should be left entirely to the 
               <br />
               provincial legislatures of the Northwest. I 
               <br />
               submit that this parliament has no more 
               <br />

               this year or even for the term of this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment for which we are here. but we are 
               <br />
               passing a law which will be binding upon 
               <br />
               the people of the Northwest for all time to 
               <br />
               come. It seems to me it is nothing short of 
               <br />
               a political outrage, a piece of tyranny for this 
               <br />
               parliament to attempt to impose such legisla-

               tion for ever upon the people of the North— 
               <br />
               west. Let me emphasize it in this way. We 
               <br />
               have here a House composed of 214 members, 
               <br />
               only 10 of whom represent constituencies in

               other 204 members who are to pass this law 
               <br />
               and impose it upon these people have no in- 
               <br />
               terest whatever in the educational system of 
               <br />
               the Northwest, no direct interest whatever, 
               <br />
               except the possible interest of seeing systems 
               <br />
               to which we have become attached in our 
               <br />
               own provinces established in the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces as well. I submit, therefore, that it 
               <br />
               is a most tyrannical thing for this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment to put through such legislation as that 
               <br />
               now before us. In my judgment it is not a 
               <br />
               matter of separate schools or no separate 
               <br />

               omy, provincial rights and local self—govern- 
               <br />
               ment. And it seems to me a most striking

               is preferable to a system which is based

               upon the principle of separation, and which 
               <br />

               tagonism and discord rather than harmony 
               <br />
               in our citizenship. I am one of those who 
               <br />
               hold that the state, which is pre- 
               <br />
               sumed to regard all people as citizens 
               <br />
               and as citizens only, and in the eye of which 
               <br />
               all are equal, without reference to their 
               <br />
               religious faith or whether indeed they have 
               <br />
               any religious faith at all, has no right to

               provide for the teaching of any particular 
               <br />
               religious belief under the auspices of the 
               <br />
               state. A good deal has been said regard- 
               <br />
               ing the character of the schools in the 
               <br />
               Northwest, and the argument is made that 
               <br />
               these schools are public and not separate 
               <br />
               in the true sense of the term. There can 
               <br />
               be, however, in my judgment, no question 
               <br />
               about this. There can be no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doubt</span> that 
               <br />
               this Bill distinctly provides for separate 
               <br />
               schools, and it does so for the purpose of 
               <br />
               enabling religious instruction to be taught 
               <br />
               in them. That is the only object of a separ- 
               <br />
               ate school system. There can be no doubt 
               <br />
               also that this Bill compels every municipal 
               <br />
               body, wherever such bodies may be consti- 
               <br />
               tuted in the Northwest, to collect the taxes 
               <br />
               of Roman Catholic citizens for the support 
               <br />
               of schools which are maintained as separate 
               <br />
               schools for the propagation of that religion. 
               <br />
               The Bill also provides that the separate 
               <br />
               schools shall share in whatever money may 
               <br />
               be voted by the legislatures of the new 
               <br />
               provinces for educational purposeS, includ- 
               <br />
               ing the school land fund which is payable 
               <br />
               to the provinces, under section 25 of the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion Lands Act, which Act sets apart two 
               <br />
               sections in every township as an endowment 
               <br />
               in aid of education and provides that the 
               <br />
               proceeds of those lands, when sold, shall be 
               <br />
               invested in Dominion securities and form 
               <br />
               a fund, the interest on which shall be paid 
               <br />
               for the support of public schools. Yet we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that this Bill will divert a proportion 
               <br />
               of that fund which was distinctly established 
               <br />
               for the support of public schools. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend the Minister of Customs argued that 
               <br />
               we ought to pass this measure because it 
               <br />
               gives what is now the law in the Territories 
               <br />
               and what has been the law a long time 
               <br />
               past. If that be a good reason why this 
               <br />
               parliament should enact the legislation 
               <br />
               now proposed in respect of separate 
               <br />
               schools, I submit that it affords an 
               <br />
