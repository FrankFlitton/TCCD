               Mr. SPROULE I can only say that Mr.

               McCarthy did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notshold</span> to that contention 
               <br />
               after Sir John Thompson’s explanation, be- 
               <br />
               cause he said: I frankly confess I have 
               <br />
               not looked into it as closely as the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice has done, and, therefore, I would 
               <br />
               not stand upon my own opinion to the same. 
               <br />
               extent, but for fear that this should be plead 
               <br />
               afterwards as a justiﬁcation for continuing 
               <br />
               these rights then I will move my motion. 
               <br />
               In supporting that motion I remember dis- 
               <br />
               tinctly that I referred to the custom which 
               <br />
               prevailed in this House, especially amongst 
               <br />
               lawyers, of pleading vested rights and pre- 
               <br />
               cedents as a justiﬁcation for continuing 
               <br />
               rights acquired, and I said because of that, 
               <br />
               because that might be plead in the future, 
               <br />
               I will feel constrained to vote with the mem-
