               He was elevated no doubt for the reason

               that he was a student of constitutional law

               <br />
               refer again to Sir Louis Davies. That gen-

               My opinion is now and has been for years

               a Bill is introduced to erect those Territories 
               <br />

               <br />
               question now. I only express this view lest I 
               <br />
               might be supposed by my silence to give assent 
               <br />
               to some extreme doctrines which hon. gentle- 
               <br />

               <br />
               which have been made, I thought it necessary 
               <br />
               to disclaim that. in assenting to the passing of 
               <br />
               this Bill, I bound myself for all time on this 
               <br />
               question of education. I do not. Although we 
               <br />
               are giving powers almost equal to those con—

               <br />
               When that is done I suppose it will be done by

               the Queen in Council under the 146th section of
