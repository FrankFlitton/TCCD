               about. For example, we might take “for il-

               <br />
               the moment the consideration of section 16, 
               <br />
               because at all events we do not want any 
               <br />
               conﬂict, we do not want a provision which 
               <br />
               is inconsistent in any way with section 16. 
               <br />
               But putting to one side section 16, then do 
               <br />
               you not incorporate section 14 of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories Act as a constitutional pro- 
               <br />
               vision of this new province, and if you do 
               <br />
               bring about that result, is it not equally true 
               <br />
               that this parliament could not afterwards 
               <br />
               repeal that provision? I am mentioning 
               <br />
               that, not in a controversial spirit, but simply 
               <br />
               by way of illustration.

               <br />
               no difﬁculty. There are the two classes 
               <br />
               which the Minister of Justice has mentioned, 
               <br />
               there is the class of legislation which will 
               <br />
               hereafter belong to the province, and there 
               <br />
               is the class of legislation which belongs to 
               <br />
               the Dominion. But it seems to me that 
               <br />
               in addition there is another class of legis- 
               <br />
               lation, namely, certain provisions in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories Act which might be 
               <br />
               regarded as constitutional provisions, which 
               <br />
               do not deal with the Dominion as a whole, 
               <br />
               but deal with the constitution of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories; and, as I said before, 
               <br />
               I thought it might be possible that under- 
               <br />
               the very generous expressions which 
               <br />
               we are now employing, those consti- 
               <br />
               tutional provisions, not being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inscon~</span> 
               <br />
               sistent with any provision of this Act, 
               <br />
               and not being inconsistent with the 
               <br />
               general provisions of the British North- 
               <br />
               America Act, which are brought into force 
               <br />
               by section 2, might be regarded as a part 
               <br />
               ot‘ the constitution of the province, and that 
               <br />
               somewhat unexpected results might be found 
               <br />
               to ensue from this general mode of legis- 
               <br />
               lation. The Minister of Justice will observe 
               <br />
               that the language is very general. When 
               <br />
               he spoke of it a little while ago. I noticed 
               <br />
               that he spoke of the eifect of this legislation; 
               <br />
               he said What is no doubt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">veryr</span> true. that 
               <br />
               the intention is to continue in force all 
               <br />
               such provisions as would be applicable to 
               <br />
               the new provinces. But there are no words 
               <br />
               of that character in this clause so far as I 
               <br />

               Mr. L. G. MCCARTHY. Is it not possible 
               <br />
               that there are more than two classes of 
               <br />
               legislation incorporated in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories Act, I mean one class within 
               <br />
               the power of the provincial legislature, the 
               <br />
               other class in the power of the federal legis- 
               <br />
               lature ? If there is not a third-class, then 
               <br />
               the suggestion which struck me most forc- 
               <br />
               ibly of the hon. leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               (Mr. R. L. Borden) is not effective because 
               <br />
               the provincial legislature having exclusive 
               <br />
               jurisdiction in one class, the federal power 
               <br />
               having jurisdiction in the other. if both of” 
               <br />
               these classes are covered by both jurisdic- 
               <br />
               tions there cannot be any difﬁculty.

               Mr. R. L. BURDEN. There is no doubt‘ 
               <br />
               about that, but my point was that there 
               <br />
               was a third class.
