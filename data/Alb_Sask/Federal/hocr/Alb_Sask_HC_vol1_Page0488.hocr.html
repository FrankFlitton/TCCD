               Mr. SAM. HUGHES. At the close of the 
               <br />
               ﬁfteenth century. It was not through the 
               <br />
               schools of Catholic Spain that the arts and 
               <br />
               sciences and learning were maintained there, 
               <br />
               but through the schools established by the 
               <br />
               Moors in the old Iberian peninsula, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bt-fore</span> 
               <br />
               the dark ages swept over Europe. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman is entirely Wrong in his history. 
               <br />
               Another mistake made by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Labelle was in speaking of the United 
               <br />
               States, where, he said:

               People recognize that what must save the 
               <br />
               United States from the social plague which is 
               <br />
               going to involve all nations between the crush- 
               <br />
               ing burden of capitalism and the equally crush- 
               <br />
               ing burden of standing armies, is the inﬂuence 
               <br />
               of the Catholic Church on the working classes.

               Well, if the hon. gentleman wants to be-

               little his Roman Catholic co—religionists, it 
               <br />
               is none of my funeral ; but let me tell him 
               <br />
               that I would hesitate a long time before 
               <br />
               I would offer to the Roman Catholic people 
               <br />
               such an insult. In the United States there 
               <br />
               are only 10,000,000 Roman Catholics to 70.- 
               <br />
               000,000 who are not Roman Catholics, and if 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman says that these 10,000,000 
               <br />
               are going to lead the anarchical, socialistic 
               <br />
               and revolutinary movements, he is paying 
               <br />
               a poor compliment to the people of that 
               <br />
               faith.

               I would not dream of insulting the Ro—

               <br />
               me tell him that what is going to save the
