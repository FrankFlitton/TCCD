               Mr. A. MARTIN. Before the Orders of 
               <br />
               the Day are called, I wish to call the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of the Minister of Railways to seine re- 
               <br />
               turns which were ordered some time ago 
               <br />
               and have not yet been laid on the table. I 
               <br />
               asked questions in regard to a railway sta- 
               <br />
               tion at Charlottetown in January last. The 
               <br />
               minister would not answer, but told me to 
               <br />
               ask for a return. I did so, and have 
               <br />
               been trying in vain to get it ever since. 
               <br />
               I asked also for a return showing the ex- 
               <br />
               penditure on railways and canals in each 
               <br />
               province, and in the return brought down. 
               <br />
               there is the statement by the minister that 
               <br />
               certain information could not be obtained. 
               <br />
               This seems very strange because I obtained 
               <br />
               a return in 1898 for similar expenditure up 
               <br />
               to that date, and I see no reason why the 
               <br />
               government should not be able to supple- 
               <br />
               ment that return by giving the information 
               <br />
               from 1898 down to the present. I would 
               <br />
               also bring to the notice of the Postmaster 
               <br />
               General a similar remissness on the part of 
               <br />
               his department. I asked for a return with 
               <br />
               regard to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">additional</span> subsidy given the 
               <br />
               province of Prince Edward Island in 1901 
               <br />
               and have not yet got it.

               ways and Canals). It is true that my hon. 
               <br />
               friend has spoken to me on several occasions 
               <br />
               with respect to certain returns, and I have 
               <br />
               frequently brought his complaints to the 
               <br />
               attention of my deputy. My deputy has 
               <br />
               always assured me that he had applied to 
               <br />
               Moncton for that information but it had not 
               <br />
               been received. Only within the last day or 
               <br />
               two I spoke to him again and he assured me 
               <br />
               he would do everything possible to get the 
               <br />
               information at the earliest moment. I per- 
               <br />
               sonally cannot attend to these matters and 
               <br />
               have to depend on my ofﬁcials. I shall make 
               <br />
               a note of what my hon. friend says and see 
               <br />
               if I cannot spur them up. As regards the 
               <br />
               expenditure on railways and canals since 
               <br />
               1898, I was under the impression that the 
               <br />
               return brought down gave all the informa- 
               <br />
               tion called for. I did not read the return 
               <br />
               but took it for granted that it furnished the 
               <br />
               information required. If my hon. friend 
               <br />
               will give me a memo. of what is lacking, I ‘ 
               <br />
               will have the matter looked up.
