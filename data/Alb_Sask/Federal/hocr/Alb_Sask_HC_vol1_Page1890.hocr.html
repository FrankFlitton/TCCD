               Mr. Chairman. I am no believer, and I 
               <br />
               have often so stated, in what Mr. McCarthy, 
               <br />
               in 1890, termed the uniﬁcation of the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian people by the sacriﬁce of race, religion 
               <br />
               or anything of that sort. It is an impos- 
               <br />
               sible and Eutorpian task anyway. No man 
               <br />
               has yet invented the secret of causing a 
               <br />
               nation worthy of the name, a nationality 
               <br />
               with all its distinctive characteristics and 
               <br />
               traits to disappear or to be merged into an- 
               <br />
               other nationality. Nor, are these conditions, 
               <br />
               as might be supposed, general even in the 
               <br />
               United States. I think that in four states 
               <br />
               of the Union there are two or more lan~ 
               <br />
               guages that are oﬂicial or legal. In auto- 
               <br />
               cratic Russia, the government, certainly not 
               <br />
               a liberal one, tolerates the legal use of a 
               <br />
               hundred diﬂferent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">languages.</span> There are 
               <br />
               only four countries in Europe where there 
               <br />
               is one language absolutely and those are 
               <br />
               Italy, Portugal, Denmark and Greece. The 
               <br />
               policy of the British government has been 
               <br />
               one of unsurpassed unequalled tolerance 
               <br />
               as regards language and in that great em-

               stances, Sir, there is great justiﬁcation for 
               <br />
               the amendment I have moved. To carry 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               only the honour of this parliament and this 
               <br />
               government. but the honour of the British

               <br />
               ing maintained to British subjects. It would 
               <br />
               have been extremely regrettable had this 
               <br />

               speaking colleagues the justice of saying 
               <br />
               that I feel perfectly convinced that if this 
               <br />
               matter had been one particularly committed 
               <br />
               to their care, not one of them would have

               <br />
               butes very unworthy motives to me. That 
               <br />
               newspaper has been sent under cover to the 
               <br />

               lated elsewhere or I would take no notice 
               <br />
               of it. I suppose I ought to say that I

               deny the allegations contained in that ar-

               the beginning to the end the article is a

               tissue of falsehoods. It is there alleged 
               <br />
               that my hon. friend (Mr. Monk) has enjoyed 
               <br />
               my hospitality with the view of coming

               <br />
               ranks of the Liberal party. It is my great

               privilege to be a friend, a true friend, of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr.

               <br />
               there has never been between us any com- 
               <br />
               pact with a view of bringing that hon. gen- 
               <br />

               day would show conclusively that he intends

               to remain in the Conservative party. His 
               <br />

               ductive one, especially to the province of 
               <br />
