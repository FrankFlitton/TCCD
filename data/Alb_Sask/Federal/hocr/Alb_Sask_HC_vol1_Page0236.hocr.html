               The House Wii-i bear in mind that Mr.

               <br />
               his provinces. I was a little surprised the 
               <br />
               other evening when the hon. gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.ad-</span>

               dressed the House on these Bills that he

               should say nothing or almost nothing about 
               <br />
               the land. It isawell known fact that the

               My hon. friend from Labelle made some re- 
               <br />
               ference to separate schools, pointing out the 
               <br />
               splendid educational system in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, a system that, he said, turned out

               ﬁrst-class students, who were the pride and 
               <br />
               admiration of the people of the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec. I would not venture to put my opin-

               ion against that of the hon. gentleman ; 
               <br />
               but I will quote the opinion of a gentle-

               man who occupied a high position in his
