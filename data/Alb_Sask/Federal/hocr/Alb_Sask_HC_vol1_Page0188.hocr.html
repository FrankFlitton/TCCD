               question, which are so closely connected as 
               <br />
               to form one subject, we ﬁnd that al- 
               <br />
               though the hon. gentleman had strong views 
               <br />
               ———and I may say that I think his views are 
               <br />
               far more correct than those of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment—although he presented his case as 
               <br />
               ably, as eloquently and as persuasively as 
               <br />
               he has this afternoon spoken to the House, 
               <br />
               still, on that point too, the government re~ 
               <br />
               fused to listen, and so the land and ﬁscal 
               <br />
               questions are complicated by the introduc— 
               <br />
               'tion of a principle which, as pointed out by 
               <br />
               the minister this afternoon, shows that the 
               <br />
               government, by admitting to the provinces 
               <br />
               that we should pay for the land, have ad- 
               <br />
               mitted that the provinces have a right to 
               <br />
               the land. Again I say that, although he 
               <br />
               was right in his representations, the gov-- 
               <br />
               ernment treated them with contemptuous 
               <br />
               indifference. Then, after making these pro- 
               <br />
               testations and after being badly treated, 
               <br />
               treated with indifference in this way, could 
               <br />
               one imagine that there was no irony conceal- 
               <br />
               ed in his remarks when he said in this 
               <br />
               House that there was no pique when he re- 
               <br />
               signed after this Bill was brought down 
               <br />
               two days before his arrival? We have 
               <br />
               heard many details of the hon. gentleman’s 
               <br />
               exploits in the west; many rumours 'have

               drifted “down to us during the past ten

               them will be received with less credulity 
               <br />
               by the country than the statement he 
               <br />
               made this afternoon as to the causes 
               <br />
               of his resignation. Just think for a 
               <br />
               moment the position that he put his 
               <br />
               colleagues in. Had the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(ex-minister</span> come 
               <br />
               ont ﬂatly, and bravely said: ‘ I resign

               the country would have understood. But

               <br />

               minister pointed out, and the existence of 
               <br />
               which they admitted by changing the Bill, 
               <br />
               what are we to think of the capacity of a

               cabinet that would plunge the country into

               agree with every word he uttered on that

               point, but let me add one or two words to 
               <br />
               what he said. It is perfectly true that when 
               <br />
               confederation was about to be formed it 
               <br />
               was agreed between the politicians of Upper 
               <br />
               and Lower Canada that two Bills should be 
               <br />
               introduced to this House, one giving educa- 
               <br />
               tional privileges to the Catholic minority in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, the other giving educational 
               <br />
               privileges to the Protestant minority in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. These Bills were introduced 
               <br />
               but for reasons which we need not now dis— 
               <br />
               cuss. they were not passed, and those Bills. 
               <br />
               not having been passed, and confederation 
               <br />
               being about to be effected, the whole scheme 
               <br />
               would have fallen through, because the 
               <br />
               Protestants of the province of Quebec re- 
               <br />
               fused to enter confederation until their 
               <br />
               educational rights were secured. Then Sir

               conferred on you by a statute of the local 
               <br />
               legislature. Sir Alexander Gait <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">replicdi</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> nm perfectly satisﬁed to take the word of 
               <br />
               you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> and believe that you will 
               <br />
               adhere to it. but times are ﬂeeting. lives are 
               <br />
               uncertain and a day may come when others 
               <br />
               will control the legislation of Quebec. and 
               <br />
               in that case what the local legislature- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gave</span> it can take away. and the minority 
               <br />
               may be deprived of the privileges granted 
               <br />
               to them. Then it was that Galt. as the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman said. drew with his 
               <br />
               own hand his famous clause. that if 
               <br />
               after confederation any right given to 
               <br />
