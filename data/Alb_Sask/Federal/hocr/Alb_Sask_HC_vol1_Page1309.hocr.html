               About the end of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">March,</span> I received from Mr.

               in one of the papers to the effect that the gov- 
               <br />

               the minister of that department might know 
               <br />

               <br />
               then placed the matter in the hands of my 
               <br />
               secretary. Owing to there being no minister in 
               <br />
               charge of the Department-of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior,</span> and 
               <br />
               to the deputy minister being absent, he had a 
               <br />
               little diﬂieulty in securing the information. He 
               <br />
               was ﬁnally informed that the matter was al- 
               <br />
               ready under contract. On April 14 I accordingly 
               <br />
               wrote a letter to Mr. Coatsworth apprising him, 
               <br />
               as I had been informed, that the McGregor- 
               <br />
               Banwell Fence Company, of Walkerville, had 
               <br />
               been awarded the contract <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sometime</span> before, 
               <br />
               and the preparation of the written agreement

               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> the hands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Justice Department. 
               <br />
               On the same day, and in answer to a similar 
               <br />
               request just received from the McGregor-Ban- 
               <br />
               well Fence Company, I wrote a letter giving 
               <br />
               them exactly the same information. Mr. Coats- 
               <br />
               worth wrote to me a further letter, dated April 
               <br />
               17, which I did not receive until my return to 
               <br />
               Ottawa after the Easter vacation. I replied to 
               <br />
               the same on April 27 along similar lines to my 
               <br />
               ﬁrst letter. Then when the question was asked 
               <br />
               in the House,‘ and answered by yourself, as Act— 
               <br />
               ing Minister of the Interior, I noticed the vari- 
               <br />
               ation between the information I had received 
               <br />
               and your answer. I asked my secretary to pro— 
               <br />
               cure that portion of the ‘Hansard’ covering 
               <br />
               the question and answer, and he reported to 
               <br />
               me that on looking for it he could not ﬁnd it 
               <br />
               therein. On making inquiries he learned it had 
               <br />
               been inadvertently omitted, but that the omis- 
               <br />
               sion would be remedied. On May 5, therefore, I 
               <br />
               wrote a third letter to Mr. Coatsworth, inform- 
               <br />
               ing him that the question had been asked in the 
               <br />
               House. and an answer given 'to the effect that 
               <br />
               no tenders had been invited for the work as 
               <br />
               yet, nor had any contract been made. On the 
               <br />
               same day I wrote the :McGregor—Banwell Fence 
               <br />

               chers in the Northwest Territories have 
               <br />

               on our side of the line so as to protect 
               <br />
               them against the incursions of American 
               <br />
               cattle. Some years ago the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cit-Minister</span> of

               in the estimates to build some twenty 
               <br />
               miles of fencing; but upon further con- 
               <br />
               sideration he found that that would be 
               <br />
               absolutely insuﬂicient and did not then 
               <br />
               pursue the matter further. From time to

               time, however, the builders of such fences 
               <br />
               were negotiated with in order to obtain 
               <br />
               from them quotations of prices, and amongst

               theirs was the last tender which was sub-

               tender—I think the posts; and the matter

               submitted to the Department of Justice a 
               <br />
               formal contract, supposing it would be 
               <br />
               awarded. The Department of Justice re- 
               <br />
               ported upon it, but rather suggested that 
               <br />
               such a fence ought to 'be built by the De- 
               <br />
               partment of Public Works <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after,</span> tenders 
               <br />
               had been invited, and the matter did not 
               <br />
               go any further. The secretary of the de~ 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pertinent,</span> Mr. Keyes—a very good ofﬁcer 
               <br />
               by the way—having referred the matter to 
               <br />
               the Department of Justice, assumed, when 
               <br />
               he received the letter from the Page Fenc- 
               <br />
               ing Company, that the contract had been 
               <br />
               awarded. In point of fact no award had 
               <br />
               been given, the parties were not communi- 
               <br />
               cated with, nothing was done, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mat—</span> 
               <br />
               ter rested there. So that in point of fact. 
               <br />
               when the question was asked of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gov</span> 
               <br />
               ernment by my hon. friend from Kent 
               <br />
               (Mr. Clements) I made inquiry of the ('le- 
               <br />
               partment and received the information I 
               <br />
               gave the House. I did not know anything 
               <br />
               of the matter, I did not know that there 
               <br />
               had been no contract awarded and no ten- 
               <br />
               ders invited. If hon. gentlemen will look 
               <br />
               into the estimates of this year, they will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd there an appropriation for the sum of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[$100,000</span> for the building of such a fence, 
               <br />
               and the policy will be discussed when that 
               <br />
               vote comes up. At present no contract 
               <br />
               has been given. the parties have not been 
               <br />
               so informed, and nothing has been done; 
               <br />
               and the answer I gave the other day is 
               <br />
               quite accurate.
