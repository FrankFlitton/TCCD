               <br />
               heard my hon. friend from Labelle express 
               <br />
               the desire that there should be in the new 
               <br />

               <br />
               not like that term as applied to Canada. 
               <br />
               An Anglo-French or an Anglo-German al- 
               <br />

               <br />
               not like to hear of it in Canada. When we 
               <br />
               speak of an Anglo—French alliance, it seems 
               <br />
               to me we speak of an agreement between 
               <br />
               two separate parties, and when we speak of 
               <br />
               such an agreement, we speak of something 
               <br />
               which may be entirely cancelled and made 
               <br />
               void. What I desire to see here is, not an 
               <br />
               Anglo-French or Anglo-German alliance. but 
               <br />

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. Before the amend- 
               <br />
               ment is put I would like to say two or three 
               <br />
               words. I have not been in favour of the 
               <br />
               sub—amendment that has just been disposed 
               <br />
               of for the same reason on account of which 
               <br />
               I am opposed to clause. 16. But I am bound 
               <br />
               to say that if I could have supported clause 
               <br />
               16 for the reasons which have been advanc- 
               <br />
               ed by hon. gentlemen on the treasury ben- 
               <br />
               ches. I would have been obliged to support 
               <br />
               this amendment; because I think the rea— 
               <br />
               sons in the one case are as conclusive as in 
               <br />
               the other. The right hon. gentleman last 
               <br />
               evening when he went beyond any argument 
               <br />
               yet given, accepted the amendment of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Saskatchewan (Mr. La- 
               <br />
               mont) because it continued a condition which 
               <br />
               now exists in the Territories, and which has 
               <br />
               been found satisfactory for a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> many 
               <br />
               years. I will not trouble the House with 
               <br />
               quoting his words, that is the effect of them. 
               <br />
               Those are exactly the reasons that have been 
               <br />
               put forward by my hon. friend from Jacques 
               <br />
               Cartier (Mr. Monk) and my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). The only distinc- 
               <br />
               tion between the two cases is the one 
               <br />
               put forward by the Prime Minister, and 
               <br />
               I think also by the Minister of Inland 
               <br />
               Revenue, which is, that the use of the 
               <br />
               French language in the courts of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories exists to-day, and has ex- 
               <br />
               isted under sections 101 and 133 of the 
               <br />
               British North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> Act. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«I</span> do not think 
               <br />
               that the courts of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               were established under section 101 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, and therefore 
               <br />
               in my opinion that argument falls to the 
               <br />
               ground. I will not elaborate that now, I 
               <br />
               may do so afterwards it it is necessary;

               main object in rising was to say that I 
               <br />
               think the Prime Minister, in his remarks 
               <br />
               this evening, has justiﬁed those who have 
               <br />
               argued in this House, and who have been 
               <br />
               much criticised for so arguing, that there 
               <br />
               was no compact by reason of which we 
               <br />
               should interfere with the control of the new 
               <br />

               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman, to whose remarks 
               <br />
               in that regard I listened with a great deal 
               <br />
               ot" attention, made it abundantly clear that 
               <br />
               the policy of the government with regard 
               <br />
               to schools did not depend upon any com- 
               <br />
               pact. His language was absolutely explicit 
               <br />
               so far as that is concerned. ”It is true that 
               <br />
               it directly opposite view has been expressed 
               <br />
               many times on the other side of the House. 
               <br />
               I need only refer to the argument of my hon.

               <br />
               people of the Northwest Territories; it is 
               <br />
               therefore a parliamentary compact, a com-

               pact made in 1875 by the enactment of a 
               <br />
               statute. The argument based on that, as I 
               <br />
               understand it, is that although the legisla- 
               <br />
               tion was temporary in its character, only 
               <br />
               to prevail while these Territories were to 
               <br />
               be governed as Territories, nevertheless 
               <br />
               there was a representation held out to the 
               <br />
               people who should go into them and that 
               <br />
               parliament is bound now to make good that 
               <br />
               representation. For reasons which I will 
               <br />
               not repeat, I have not been able to agree 
               <br />
               with that view. But I cannot distinguish be- 
               <br />
               tween a parliamentary compact created by 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875 and aparliamentary com- 
               <br />
               pact created by the Act of 1877. That is 
               <br />
               the view I would take if I adopted the argu- 
               <br />
               ment of hon. gentlemen opposite. If the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 constituted a compact which 
               <br />
               we are obliged to carry out, why does not 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875 constitute also a compact 
               <br />
               which we are obliged to carry out ? I have 
               <br />
               not been able to concur in the view that 
               <br />
               there is a compact; I have regarded both 
               <br />
               these matters as subjects proper to be dealt 
               <br />
               with by the peOple of the new provinces. 
               <br />
               My position with regard to the one is my 
               <br />
               position with regard to the other. Further
