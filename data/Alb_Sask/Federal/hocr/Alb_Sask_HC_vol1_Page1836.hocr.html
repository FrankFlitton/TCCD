               There was a lack of ﬁrmness at the begin— 
               <br />
               ning. It should have been distinctly stated 
               <br />
               that provincial rights in matter of education 
               <br />
               existed only under the express condition that 
               <br />
               the rights of the minorities should be re-

               Mr. Dalton McCarthy, and the Tories under

               vative members out of six to the federal

               ﬁrmness. But I come back to my argument. 
               <br />
               I have proved most conclusively that as- 
               <br />
               surances and promises had been given by 
               <br />

               The constitution granted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Manitoba</span> and 
               <br />
               to the Territories show that Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recogv</span>

               <br />
               faithfully. I am thus in the position to say

               that the dignity of the Crown is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">engﬁ-getl</span>
