               is far-reaching, a subject of great difference 
               <br />
               of opinion. It would be very instructive if 
               <br />
               this House could get a decisive and empha- 
               <br />
               tic expression in plain English as to just 
               <br />
               what that clause really means. Several 
               <br />
               members of this House, when the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman introduced the Bill, doubtless 
               <br />
               wondered whether the clause as originally 
               <br />
               framed and subsequently amended was pro- 
               <br />
               posed from a burning desire to do justice to 
               <br />
               the Doukhobors, to the Galicians, to the 
               <br />
               Scandinavians, to the Icelanders, to the 
               <br />
               Mennonites and possibly to the Mormons 
               <br />
               that are ﬁlling up the Northwest provinces. 
               <br />
               Was it for that purpose, and labouring under 
               <br />
               a keen sense of the injustice done to these 
               <br />
               denominations and sects, that the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman provides means for all time for 
               <br />
               separate schools? If so, Sir, he might have 
               <br />
               mentioned it. He might at least have 
               <br />
               consulted them and consulted his Minister 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior</span> who formulated and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gimm-</span> 
               <br />
               istered the policy which brought these dif- 
               <br />
               ferent sects into that country. Since the 
               <br />
               Bill was introduced we have seen some rea- 
               <br />
               son Why the Bill assumed this form. We 
               <br />
               have seen that with regard to certain clauses 
               <br />
               certain ministers of the Crown have not been 
               <br />
               consulted. Why? No explanation has been 
               <br />
