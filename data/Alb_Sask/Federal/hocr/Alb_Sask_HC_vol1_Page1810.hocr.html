               The statement is made that this steamship

               has been running with only one certiﬁed

               rectness of the allegations; but I have al-

               <br />
               setting forth all the facts. The steamer in 
               <br />
               question is a ferry boat which conveys cars 
               <br />

               Inter-colonial between Truro and Sydney.

               The conditions which prevail there now are

               the conditions which have prevailed for

               some time. I am not personally familiar

               Another question that, as I presume, would 
               <br />
               arise in connection with the matter, is how 
               <br />

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. If I may be per- 
               <br />
               mitted a word, I would say that if these 
               <br />
               regulations are necessary in the public in- 
               <br />
               terest in .the case of steainboats operated 
               <br />
               by private owners, one would think that 
               <br />
               they should be equally carried out. even 
               <br />
               though the letter of the law may not re- 
               <br />
               quire it, on boats which are operated by the 
               <br />
               government. A very large number of pas- 
               <br />
               sengers is carried <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*by</span> the boat, and some— 
               <br />
               times under very difﬁcult conditions, as 
               <br />
               the hon. minister k110ws. Therefore,1 Ishould 
               <br />
               think that this is a case in which not only 
               <br />
               the spirit, but the letter of the law should be 
               <br />
               can-led out In case of a serious accident, 
               <br />
               even if it did not result from failure to ob- 
               <br />
               serve the requirements of the law I men— 
               <br />
               tioned, it would be associated in the public 
               <br />
               mind with that failure; and it would be 
               <br />
               very unfortunate—of course the minister 
               <br />
               will agree—that such should be the case.
