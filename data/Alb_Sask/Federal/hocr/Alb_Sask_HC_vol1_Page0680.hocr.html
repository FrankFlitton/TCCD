               framed in the province of Manitoba within 
               <br />
               a year afterwards by the very men who 
               <br />
               were dealing with this Bill of Rights and 
               <br />
               who had received a report from these dele-

               would be strange it both these points could 
               <br />
               have got by chance into the Manitoba Act, 
               <br />
               an Act which was the result of elaborate 
               <br />
               negotiations with the delegates. The other 
               <br />
               thing is this: This Bill of Rights No. 3 
               <br />
               asks that the province shall be styled and 
               <br />
               known as the province of Assiniboia. Bill 
               <br />
               of Rights No. 4 suggested no name, merely 
               <br />
               that the province was styled the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba. Just in passing, let me refer

               <br />
               considered that the Manitoba Act gave to 
               <br />
               the minority their rights. I have always

               I do not know how authentic it is, but I am

               bound to consider that it is authentic—a

               Liberal friends were taking away the rights 
               <br />
               from the minority in that province. This 
               <br />
               letter is an unqualiﬁed opinion in regard to

               this letter—as I say I cannot vouch for

               its authenticity——from a work called ‘Krib’s
