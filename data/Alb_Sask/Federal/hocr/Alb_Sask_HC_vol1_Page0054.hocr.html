               <br />
               ary until the 15th March is a reasonable 
               <br />
               length of time to have the Bill before the

               <br />
               have asked for. Every day the feeling is 
               <br />
               intensifying. Every day the newspapers 
               <br />
               are instilling more and more into the 
               <br />
               minds of the people'that this is a measure

               which simply is set-ting creed against 
               <br />
               creed. Let us then face the issue straight 
               <br />
               and squarely. Every day’s delay is inten-

               sifying the feeling against the Bill, and 
               <br />
               that feeling has taken such root that I 
               <br />
               venture to-day that ten years hence will

               directly affected by this Bill, I do not see how 
               <br />
               I can remain silent in this discussion es- 
               <br />
               pecially in view of some of the remarks 
               <br />
               which have been made by the night hon. 
               <br />
               the First Minister. I rise to protest 
               <br />
               against the conduct of the administration 
               <br />
               in having framed this measure without any 
               <br />
               reference to, and in the absence of the 
               <br />
               minster who is charged by statute with 
               <br />
               the control and management of the affairs 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories, and for hav- 
               <br />
               ing introduced it in his absence. I may 
               <br />
               perhaps be permitted to draw the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of hon. members to the statute to 
               <br />
               which I refer. By section 3 of chapter 22 
               <br />
               of the Revised Statutes of Canada it is 
               <br />
               provided that the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               shall have the control and management of 
               <br />
               the affairs of the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               Why then should a measure of such vital 
               <br />
               importance to the people of that country 
               <br />
               have been framed and introduced without 
               <br />

               <br />
               clothed by statute with this particular 
               <br />
               duty. That needs explanation. No one 
               <br />
               can fail to see that there was no member 
               <br />

               than the hon. member for Brandon (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton) for there was no minister whose in- 
               <br />
               dividual responsibility in that matter was 
               <br />
               so great. It is a matter of common com- 
               <br />
               plaint that the affairs of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories can be given only a very small 
               <br />
               portion of the time which the ministers 
               <br />
               are able to spare from their respective de- 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That is a complaint that one often hears, 
               <br />
               and perhaps the reason is plain. There are 
               <br />
               matters pressing on the different ministers 
               <br />
               in their departments—matters near at hand 
               <br />
               —~i-n which they must be more interested 
               <br />
               than they are in the rights of the people 
               <br />
               living two or three thousand miles away. 
               <br />
               That it has been the practice in the past to 
               <br />
               consult the Minister of the Interior in regard 
               <br />
               to matters of much less importance regard- 
               <br />
               ing the administration of the affairs of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, I think cannot be 
               <br />
               denied. Looking at the correspondence 
               <br />
               which has been had between members of 
               <br />
               the legislative assembly and the federal 
               <br />
               government, it will be observed that near- 
               <br />
               ly all that correspondence has been carried 
               <br />
               on with the hon. member for Brandon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Sifton). I ﬁnd that on April 5th, 1901, he 
               <br />
               writes the Hon. F. W. G. Haultain in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span>

               nection with this matter, saying that busi-

               ness is so pressing upon the respective min-

               isters that the measure could not be brought 
               <br />
               down that session. Then, again, I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain was communicating with the
