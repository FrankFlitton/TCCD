               Mr. TAYLOR. :I oppose the Bill because

               1 have not said nor will I say one word 
               <br />
               against separate schools. I live in a town 
               <br />
               with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> of about 4,000, of Whom 
               <br />
               about one-third are French and Irish Ro- 
               <br />
               man Catholics. We have no separate school 
               <br />
               there. We had a separate school there 25 
               <br />
               or 30 years ago when it was a small village 
               <br />
               containing about 1,000 inhabitants. We 
               <br />
               then had a public school and a Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic separate school, but the Roman 
               <br />
               Oatholics themselves closed up their school, 
               <br />
               and ever since their children have been 
               <br />
               going to the public school. I have heard 
               <br />
               the archbishop of Kingston when laying a 
               <br />
               .c-orner stone, saying: We must have a 
               <br />
               separate school. But we cannot have one 
               <br />
               in Gananoque because his own people are 
               <br />
               better satisﬁed with the public school and 
               <br />
               they cannot establish a separate school be— 
               <br />
               cause the Roman Catholics themselves Will 
               <br />
               not have one in our town, and this is the 
               <br />
               history of Ontario generally, there are very 
               <br />
               few separate schools, because our public 
               <br />
               schools in Ontario are national, and not a 
               <br />
               word is said in them which is offensive to 
               <br />
               the religious opinions of any child attending 
               <br />
               them. It is not so with the public school in 
               <br />
               Quebec. No Protestant can send his child 
               <br />
               to the public school in Quebec on account 
               <br />
               of the religious teaching given there, but 
               <br />
               it is not so in Ontario and the Catholics 
               <br />
               know it, and they support and approve al- 
               <br />
               most unanimously the public schools of On— 
               <br />
               tario and send their children to them. I 
               <br />
               cannot approve of nor agree with the state- 
               <br />
               ment of the Minister of Finance and the eX- 
               <br />
               -Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton). I have 
               <br />
               made a proposition to let the lawyers on 
               <br />
               both sides of the House get together and 
               <br />
               frame an amendment embodying their 
               <br />
               speeches and I am satisﬁed if that is done, 
               <br />
               the Orangemen of Ontario will be satisﬁed 
               <br />
               with it because as I have said it is a pur - 
               <br />
               ly national school. Because these gentleme 
               <br />
               know that it means a great deal more than 
               <br />
               this is the reason why they are trying to 
               <br />
               force the measure through the House. But 
               <br />
               I propose opposing it because in my opin- 
               <br />
               ion it is unconstitutional and being un- 
               <br />
               constitutional I feel it to be my duty to 
               <br />
               vote against the Bill and in favour of the 
               <br />
               amendment of the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               (Mr. R. L. Borden) who as I stated before, 
               <br />
               is in my opinion the best legal authority we 
               <br />
               have in this country. In his speech he 
               <br />
               gives it as his opinion that the measure 
               <br />
               is unconstitutional and that the matter 
               <br />
               should be left to the provinces of Alberta 
               <br />
               and Saskatchewan to deal with exclusively.
