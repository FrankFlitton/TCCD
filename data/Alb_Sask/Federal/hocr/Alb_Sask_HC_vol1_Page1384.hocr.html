               <br />
               lowed that election to go by default. I

               would have thought that one of the notable

               events to which the lion. Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               might very well have called attention. There

               hon. Minister of Justice with which I am 
               <br />
               not inclined to agree, and that is the sug- 
               <br />
               gestion that it would not have been proper 
               <br />
               for him to have made this explanation on 
               <br />
               the second reading of the Bill. I think the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Justice could not have had 
               <br />
               in mind what took place in the debate when 
               <br />
               he made that statement, because, beginning 
               <br />
               with the right hon. Prime Minister and in- 
               <br />
               cluding, I think, every hon. gentleman on 
               <br />
               the other side of the House who spoke on 
               <br />
               the second reading, there was a prolonged 
               <br />
               discussion on clause 16 as amended com- 
               <br />
               pared with clause 16 as originally intro- 
               <br />
               duced. I thought I must be under a mis- 
               <br />
               apprehension for a moment and I looked up 
               <br />
               the speech delivered by my right hon. friend 
               <br />
               the First Minister in this House on the 22nd 
               <br />
               March, and I found, just exactly as I 
               <br />
               thought, at page 2924, that he began in this 
               <br />
               way :

               Now, Sir, a word as to the changes which we

               And he goes on to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discuss</span> that. The 
               <br />
               greater part of the speech of the hon. ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) was 
               <br />
               devoted to clause 16 as amended compared 
               <br />
               with clause 16 as originally drafted. The 
               <br />
               whole burthen of his speech was to show 
               <br />
               what in his estimation was the difference in

               clauses. Therefore, I cannot agree, with 
               <br />
               the view of my hon. friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thevMinister</span> of 
               <br />
               Justice in that regard ; but he did not see 
               <br />
               ﬁt to make that explanation, and I for one 
               <br />
               am quite prepared to assent to his suggest- 
               <br />
               ion that clause 16 shall stand over for the

               present upon the condition to which I 
               <br />
               have already referred. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has always been. most courteous in assent- 
               <br />
               ing to any proposition of that kind from 
               <br />
               this side of the House, and I think it is due 
               <br />
               to him under the circumstances which he 
               <br />
               has mentioned to assent to what he has 
               <br />
               himself suggested in that regard. I would 
               <br />
               like, however, to say that it may not be

               that the true facts ought to be laid before 
               <br />
               the House. They were statements made

               legislation in regard to education as they

               With time and consideration came wisdom.

               That resolution was put to the House and how 
               <br />
               did it result ? Six voted in favour of it, and 15 
               <br />
               against it. And there this agitation with re-

               <br />
               we have heard nothing of it since. And of 
               <br />
               course, the present Prime Minister of the 
               <br />
