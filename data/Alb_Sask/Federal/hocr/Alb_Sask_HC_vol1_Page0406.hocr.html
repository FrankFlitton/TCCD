               tempt to invade the autonomy of these new

               Mr. Speaker, since the opening of the pre- 
               <br />
               sent session this House has lost one of its 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minable</span> and prominent members, the late 
               <br />
               hon. member'for Centre Toronto, Mr. E. F. 
               <br />
               Clarke. He was prominent not only in 
               <br />
               this House but in the organization of which

               <br />
               nized as a very broad-minded man. It is 
               <br />
               fortunate. perhaps, that he has left his 
               <br />
               opinion with regard to this very subject.
