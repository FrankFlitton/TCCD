               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I thought it was so 
               <br />
               disgusting and discredi-table that it could 
               <br />
               not have appeared in ‘Le Canada.’ It 
               <br />
               seems to excite very much the risibili- 
               <br />
               ties of the hon. member for Montmagny 
               <br />
               (Mr. A. Lavergne) and the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Labelle (Mr. Bourassa).

               read it because I was asked to do so from 
               <br />
               the other side. I do not think the article in 
               <br />
               ‘Le Canada’ is materially different from 
               <br />

               <br />
               East Grey has just read. If any hon. gen-

               tlema-n opposite thinks it does differ, I will

               Mr. SPROULE. Notwithstanding the de- 
               <br />
               nials of the Minister of Inland Revenue, 
               <br />
               that the article never appeared in ‘Le 
               <br />
               Canada,’ he is mistaken, and it has been 
               <br />
               fairly translated. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Labelle has frequently designated the hon. 
               <br />
               member for East Grey in almost similar 
               <br />
               words. The Minister of Inland Revenue did 
               <br />
               not know what he was talking about and of 
               <br />
               course it was impossible that he could en- 
               <br />
               lighten the House. But it seems that this 
               <br />
               is even more reliable than the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man desired and notwithstanding the fact 
               <br />
               that supporters of the government could not 
               <br />
               have imagined for a moment that it was 
               <br />
               possible that it would appear in a govern- 
               <br />
               ment organ, it did appear in a government 
               <br />
               organ and they are obliged to admit it and 
               <br />
               cannot help it at the present time.

               <br />
               Labelle said that if this is to be a nation 
               <br />
               there must be one law for all. I agree with 
               <br />
               that exactly and will never dissent from it. 
               <br />
               We always stand for that—one law for all, 
               <br />
               equality before the law for all, equal 
               <br />
               rights for every religion in this country, but 
               <br />
               it is because we thin-k there is a desire to 
               <br />
               have one law for one class, and to have it
