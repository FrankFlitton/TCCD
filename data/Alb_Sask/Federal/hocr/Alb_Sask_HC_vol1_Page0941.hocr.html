               A great deal has been said about our 
               <br />
               school system in the province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from Dundas (Mr. Broder) 
               <br />
               quoted a speech made by the hon. the Min—

               <br />
               in which the minister criticised the 
               <br />
               separate schools then in existence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">irrtliat</span> 
               <br />
               province. But my hon. friend did not take 
               <br />
               the trouble—perhaps he did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know—to</span> 
               <br />
               explain the circumstances surrounding the 
               <br />
               delivery of that speech. Why. down in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec we are animated by a 
               <br />
               spirit of educational reform, and at that 
               <br />
               time the Minister of Justice was pleading 
               <br />
               for an increase in the educational grant and 
               <br />
               endeavouring to arouse a sentiment among 
               <br />
               the people in favour of a greater expenditure 
               <br />
               on education, in favour of paying the teach- 
               <br />
               ers higher salaries and building better school- 
               <br />
               houses. That was the object my hon. friend 
               <br />
               had in delivering that speech, and it is quite 
               <br />
               possible that his zeal in the cause of reform 
               <br />
               induced him to make the most of his case 
               <br />
               and perhaps even exaggerate the conditions. 
               <br />
               But what he was endeavouring to do was to 
               <br />
               get the Quebec government to spend more 
               <br />
               money and take every means possible to 
               <br />
               put our educational system there on the

               people of that province. as the Minister of

               Justice did to the people of the province of

               I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to refrain from making a 
               <br />
               contrast between the treatment accorded 
               <br />
               the minority in the province of Quebec and 
               <br />
               that accorded the minorities in the other

               provinces. In the province of Quebec the 
               <br />
               Protestant minority have not only been 
               <br />
               treated fairly but most generously. “7e are 
               <br />
               given more than our share of public money,

               guarantees have been carried out to their 
               <br />
               fullest extent. My hon. friend the Minister

               of Agriculture (Mr. Fisher), who is connect- 
               <br />
               ed with the system of Protestant education 
               <br />
               in that province, and my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               St. Antoine division (Mr. Amos). who also 
               <br />
               holds a high place in the educational system, 
               <br />
               both stood up a few days ago and explained 
               <br />
               how the minority have been treated in the _ 
               <br />
               province of Quebec; and I appeal to any 
               <br />
               man who listened tc them if their words 
               <br />
               did not carry the conviction that nothing 
               <br />
               could have been fairer or more just than the 
               <br />
               treatment there meted out to us. The re— 
               <br />
               sult is that everybody there is satisﬁed, and 
               <br />
               we never hear a word of complaint from 
               <br />
               any one. Take the Protestant press of 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec, and what has been 
               <br />
               its attitude during this debate ? Nearly all 
               <br />
               the papers have been enthusiastic supporters 
               <br />
               of the educational clause in the Bill before
