               <br />
               what has been already pointed out many 
               <br />

               borne out; having regard to the fact I

               am about to mention, namely, that the 01'-

               <br />
               particular passage to which I refer con- 
               <br />
               tains the Act of 1875 in so many words. I 
               <br />
               refer to section 41. It contains that Act with 
               <br />
               the exception of the provisions for assess-

               ment which are contained in other portions 
               <br />
               of the ordinance. Therefore, so far as the 
               <br />
               ordinances are concerned, you have in them 
               <br />
               all the effective portion of the Act of 1875, 
               <br />
               which concerns the protection of. the rights

               or the minority in respect of public schools. 
               <br />
               That makes it still more expedient that we

               my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views“</span> of the constitutional question be-

               ‘extent a constitutional question and has to

               be considered from that standpoint. Sec-

               <br />
               tion 16 were not in this Bill at all. If 
               <br />
               section 16 were omitted, section 93 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act would be appli-

               ﬁculty, a doubt arises as to whether section

               that in the ﬁrst provision of that section the 
               <br />
               words used are ‘ the rights and privileges in 
               <br />
               force in the province at the union.’ Techni- 
               <br />
               cally while these Territories may have prac-

               tically all the legislative powers of a pro- 
               <br />
               vince, they are not a province ;__ now 
               <br />
               within the meaning of section 93 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, and it was 
               <br />
               to avoid the difﬁculty that ‘I substituted 
               <br />
               in section 16 in the ﬁrst paragraph the 
               <br />
               word ‘territory’ for ‘province.’ Then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the}</span> 
               <br />
               other difficulty that would have arisen is 
               <br />
               what is meant by the words ‘ at the date of 
               <br />

               <br />
               doubt that the date of the union is the date
