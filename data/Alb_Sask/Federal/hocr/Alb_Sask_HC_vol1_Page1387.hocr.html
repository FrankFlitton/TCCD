               <br />
               borne out by the Regina ‘ Leader’ if it re- 
               <br />
               ported the debate in full—that Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               was referring to the system of grants, and 
               <br />
               that it was misleading the House to simply 
               <br />
               quote that sentence without showing the 
               <br />
               connection in which it was used. With re-

               the legislative assembly, I say that to quote

               one resolution and to omit to quote another

               the meaning of legislation, refusing to give 
               <br />
               information until the rest of the Bill is 
               <br />
               through. In-other words, he has pocketed 
               <br />
               the votes of all the gentlemen behind him 
               <br />
               as well as a number on this side of the 
               <br />
               House, on a resolution that is not compre- 
               <br />
               hended and be positively refuses up to date 
               <br />
               to tell us the meaning of it. I contend that 
               <br />
               this is not right. If the author of that 
               <br />
               legislation does not know the meaning of it 
               <br />
               who does? If the author of the legislation 
               <br />
               does know the meaning of it, it is his duty 
               <br />
               to explain it so that we may be not further 
               <br />
               misled. I had the pleasure of hearing the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance for a few moments this 
               <br />
               afternoon and he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">told</span> us that several events 
               <br />
               have happened recently, the principle of 
               <br />
               which was the return of the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior unopposed. The Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance might also have pointed to Centre 
               <br />
               Toronto. That is a good deal nearer Ottawa 
               <br />
               than Edmonton, and we had more time to 
               <br />
               get to Centre Toronto than to Edmonton. 
               <br />
               The government did not put up a candidate 
               <br />
               in Centre Toronto although there was not 
               <br />
               500 Conservative majority in that riding as 
               <br />
               a rule, whereas the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               had a solid 2,000-majority or more at his 
               <br />
               back. Further, they had the opportunity of 
               <br />
               being up there and of putting up a campaign 
               <br />
               that could not have been overcome in the 
               <br />
               time at the disposal of us on this side. If
