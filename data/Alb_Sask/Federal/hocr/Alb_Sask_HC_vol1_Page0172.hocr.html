               Before the Orders of the Day are called, 1

               would like to call the attention of the First

               Ontario (Mr. R. L. Borden), and not yet

               brought down, to which attention has been 
               <br />
               called on more than one occasion. Amongst

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asked</span> for the centres of population and the

               lands bonded for homestead purposes, the

               yet remains to be selected in the territory 
               <br />
               comprising those two provinces; the lands 
               <br />
               remaining invested in the Crown, a very

               important point if we are to take up the

               consideration of the ﬁnancial aspect of this

               condition of education in the Territories at 
               <br />
               present. This would include, of course, the 
               <br />
               number of schools—public schools, denomi-

               <br />
               was careful to say in that statement, a1- 
               <br />
               though brieﬂy, that the same thing did not 
               <br />
               apply to the other features of the Bill, or _ 
               <br />
               did not apply to its principles. because I had 
               <br />
               had an opportunity to give my advice to my 
               <br />
               colleagues upon the other portions of the 
               <br />
               Bill. Nevertheless some, as I think, rather 
               <br />
               ill-natured, comments were addressed to the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister in criticism of his alleged 
               <br />
               preparation of this Bill, or allowing it to be 
               <br />
               prepared, without consultation with or 
               <br />
               advice from the minister who must, under 
               <br />
               the circumstances, be supposed to have been 
               <br />
               in the best position to give him advice. 
               <br />
               These criticisms of which I speak are wholly 
               <br />
               without justiﬁcation in the facts of the case. 
               <br />
               The belief that the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               were to be given provincial autonomy is 
               <br />
               one that, in all the discussions which have 
               <br />
               taken place has, been forming itself not only 
               <br />
               in the minds of the members of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment. but in the minds of members of the 
               <br />
               House during the last few years. There 
               <br />
               may have been discussions in this House 
               <br />
               as to the particular time. But the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject</span> has been present to our minds.
