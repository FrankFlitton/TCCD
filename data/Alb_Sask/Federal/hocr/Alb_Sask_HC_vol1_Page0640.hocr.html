               the hon. gentleman has so habituated him—

               this nephew of his, that he cannot think

               of anything else. Is he like the third Na-

               <br />
               the only good thing that could be said 
               <br />
               of him was that he was the nephew of 
               <br />
               his uncle ? It seems to me that this possibly 
               <br />
               applies to the hon. gentleman. There was a 
               <br />
               part of his speech which was exceedingly 
               <br />
               good. It was the part in which he read 
               <br />
               long extracts from the speeches of his 
               <br />
               uncle and from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> even greater speeches 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend from North Toronto 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«Mr.</span> Foster). The hon. gentleman told us 
               <br />
               that he changed his speech and ,that he 
               <br />
               changed it since <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yesterday,</span> Does he want 
               <br />
               us to follow him ? He may change again 
               <br />
               to-morrow and very likely he will, but what 
               <br />
               struck me at the time was that if he had 
               <br />
               changed it more than he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did»</span> it would have 
               <br />
               been a better speech. I do not exactly know 
               <br />
               what my hon. friend is aiming at. Surely 
               <br />
               it could not be that in objecting to the

               <br />

               <br />
               that he has found out something that nobody 
               <br />

               of my hon. friend’s speech in reference 
               <br />
               to the hon. member for North Toronto, the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman who represents the riding 
               <br />
               in which he lives, would come to the con— 
               <br />
               clusion that from ﬁrst to last his object 
               <br />
               was to apply names to the Conservative 
               <br />
               party and to heap abuse upon my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from North Toronto. I do not think that 
               <br />
               my hon. friend (Mr. Foster) will suffer much 
               <br />
               from the statement of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe. That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thon.</span> gentleman 
               <br />
               had a twinge of conscience when he was 
               <br />
               talking. What was he afraid of ? He threw 
               <br />
               up his hands and prayed to Heaven that 
               <br />
               he might not inﬂame the passions of the 
               <br />
               people of the country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Is</span> there any danger 
               <br />
               of his inﬂaming the passions of the people 
               <br />
               of the country ? Is there any danger of 
               <br />
               many people reading his speech or taking 
               <br />
               cognizance of his doings ? He varies his 
               <br />
               speeches. He need not be afraid. He will 
               <br />
               never inﬂame the passions of anybody. But, 
               <br />
               what was the object of it all ?—the evident 
               <br />
               object was to do a party service for 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman whom he has 
               <br />
               served so faithfully during the whole period 
               <br />
               of this parliamentary career and a more 
               <br />
               truckling politician has never occupied a 
               <br />
               seat in this House than the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               during the time he has been here. He re- 
               <br />
               minded me of a gentleman, who, speaking 
               <br />
               to another, was advancing the theory that 
               <br />
               men are the opposite of their fathers, that 
               <br />
               they have the opposite traits, the opposite 
               <br />
               tendencies, peculiarities, &amp;c., and after 
               <br />
               having enunciated that principle he said: 
               <br />
               You never met my father. He was 
               <br />
               a very clever. a very brilliant and a ' 
               <br />
               very tine man. And. the other replied : <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No.</span>

               I never met your father, but on the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of opposites, I can imagine that your 
               <br />
               father was all you describe. I am quite 
               <br />
               willing to concede to the late <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dalton,</span> Mc— 
               <br />
               Carthy all reasonable credit and I imagine 
               <br />
               that probably if the principle, of opposites, 
               <br />
               just referred to holds good, I need say 
               <br />
               nothing further in favour of the late Dalton

               McCarthy—hon. gentlemen will be prepared
