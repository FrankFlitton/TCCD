               We are told that we must have public

               schools, because the settlers happen to 
               <br />
               come from across the boundary line, where 
               <br />
               a system of public schools exists. In other 
               <br />

               not discuss the school system as it exists 
               <br />
               in the United States, but I have enough 
               <br />
               pride in the institutions of my country to 
               <br />
               believe that our system is not inferior to 
               <br />
               theirs. I have enough patriotism to stand 
               <br />
               by the rights of a Canadian minority, even 
               <br />

               Sir, it has been suggested in the course 
               <br />
               of this debate that the Northwest Act of 
               <br />
               1875 provided only for a temporary state 
               <br />
               of things. There is no such declaration in 
               <br />
               the Act. Let me say, Sir, that the men who 
               <br />
               enacted that law had taken part in the 
               <br />
               battle for confederation. They knew what 
               <br />
               had been the stumbling block of the union 
               <br />
               and what compromise had been reached. 
               <br />
               They, therefore, deliberately pledged the 
               <br />
               faith, the honour of parliament, that as 
               <br />
               long as there would be a Catholic minority 
               <br />
               in the west it would be entitled to its 
               <br />
               schools. Thirty years have elapsed since 
               <br />
               1875. The separate school system has been 
               <br />
               adopted, and to—day we are told that those 
               <br />
               who have settled in the west with that 
               <br />
               guarantee should, do without it. The Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 was passed under Mr. Mackenzie’s 
               <br />
               government, and it was supported by Sir 
               <br />
               John Macdonald. It was amended in 1882 
               <br />
               under a Conservative administration. and 
               <br />
               the separate school system was maintained.

               guage of the ‘Globe’, such is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">language</span> 
               <br />
               of the Toronto ‘News.’ For my part, I 
               <br />
               would trust, and I do trust, the western 
               <br />
               people as well as the eastern people; but 
               <br />
               the present issue has been made a religious 
               <br />
               one. The protests which have been made 
               <br />
               from the pulpit, the petitions which have 
               <br />
               been sent to this House, all bear the mark 
               <br />
               of religion. We have had petitions from 
               <br />
               the Orange Order, from the Baptists, the 
               <br />
               Presbyterians, the Methodists; and there 
               <br />
               is between the opponents of the separate 
               <br />
               schools and the opponents of the public 
               <br />
               schools such a wide breach that, if left to 
               <br />
               the popular vote in the west, it would be 
               <br />
               impossible to bridge the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty.</span> Those 
               <br />
               who sincerely believe in the separate school 
               <br />
               system would soon come to grief, because 
               <br />
               their opponents are unquestionably the 
               <br />
               majority. Besides the opposition to the 
               <br />
               separate schools seems to be doctrinal. and 
               <br />
               I do not see how you could reconcile both 
               <br />
