               Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. Yes; it is 
               <br />
               sometimes necessary to go outside the re-

               <br />
               me to return to the real issue. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman from North Toronto (Mr. Foster) 
               <br />
               spoke of the Quebec compact, which is to 
               <br />
               be found in the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               and declared that that compact,' crys- 
               <br />
               tallized into the Confederation Act, did 
               <br />
               no more than secure 
               <br />
               to the minorities in the provinces 
               <br />
               Quebec and Ontario. He denied that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> 
               <br />
               other part of this Dominion was entitled to 
               <br />
               separate schools under that Act. Let me 
               <br />
               remind him that he gave the contrary view 
               <br />
               to this House nine years ago. Then he was 
               <br />
               arguing in favour of the constitution. Then 
               <br />
               everything outside the constitutional argu- 
               <br />
               ment was, in his judgment, out of order. 
               <br />
               When the hon. member for East Grey <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Sproule) ventured to interject something 
               <br />
               that did not appear to have any strict bear- 
               <br />
               ing on the constitution, he was immediate- 
               <br />
               ly rebuked by his colleague from North 
               <br />
               Toronto. He was immediately told by him 
               <br />
               that the subject was one solely of the true 
               <br />
               construction of the constitution. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Today</span> he 
               <br />
               tells us that under the British North Ameri-

               ca Act, and the compact out of which it 
               <br />

               <br />
               as reported in ‘Hansard,’ page <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3476,</span> he 
               <br />
               made use of the following language :

               The ﬁrst question then for me to solve when 
               <br />
               I approach the consideration of this subject is 
               <br />
               this: Is there any compact; or agreement ar- 
               <br />
               rived at in this country and embodied in the 
               <br />
               constitution under-which we live which has 
               <br />
               ﬁrst to be considered before we can give our 
               <br />
               decision upon this question ? The answer is 
               <br />
               plain and deﬁnite. There is a compact in the 
               <br />
               constitution of the confederation; there is a 
               <br />
               second compact in the constitution of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               ratiﬁed by the British parliament, and under 
               <br />
               which she became a part of the Dominion.

               Then he proceeded to say, ln answer to 
               <br />
               an interruption by the late Mr. Wallace :

               <br />
               ceed I will answer that question in due course, 
               <br />
               and I will answer it thoroughly. Arising out of 
               <br />
               long years <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> sectarian and religious strife 
               <br />
               under united Canada, opinions and convictions 
               <br />
               in reference to this matter became gradually 
               <br />
               modiﬁed, and when the representatives of the 
               <br />
               four provinces came together at Quebec to take 
               <br />
               up, discuss and settle articles of confederation. 
               <br />
               these convictions rapidly and deﬁnitely resolved 
               <br />
               themselves into the determination that it should 
               <br />
               be laid down in the constitution of the country 
               <br />
               that whatever rights and privileges religious 
               <br />
               minorities had in the provinces at the time of

               gentlemen that the proposed legislation 
               <br />
               would be a violation of provincial rights. 
               <br />
               But there can be no violation of a right 
               <br />
               until that right is created. First you must 
               <br />
               show that the province has a right, and then 
               <br />
               that the right which it possesses, is being 
               <br />
               violated. The ﬁrst question in my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judg‘</span> 
               <br />
               ment, therefore, is: What are the rights _ 
               <br />
               of a province when it is created ? 
               <br />
               There we immediately enter upon debat- 
               <br />
               able ground, because there are two con- 
               <br />
               ﬂicting views as to how a province may 
               <br />
               derive its constitutional power and rights. 
               <br />
               If I understand my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, his contention is 
               <br />
               that the moment a territory acquires pro- 
               <br />
               vincial status, that moment it automatical- 
               <br />
               ly becomes possessed of certain rights un- 
               <br />
               der the British North America Act, that it 
               <br />
               inherits these rights that moment without 
               <br />
               more being done, without any act on the 
               <br />
               part of the Dominion parliament or the 
               <br />
               Dominion government, and without any im— 
               <br />
               perial legislation—the moment you give the 
               <br />
               provincial status to a territory, that mo- 
               <br />
               ment, according to the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion, it acquires its provincial charter, and 
               <br />
               its rights are there set forth or may be 
               <br />
               found. He takes the literal interpretation 
               <br />
               and makes that the rock of the constitution. 
               <br />
               He would have us believe that the rock of 
               <br />
               the constitution is the letter and not the 
               <br />
               spirit of the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               Here we see the lawyer—he looks to what 
               <br />
               is nominated in the bond. I care not, he 
               <br />
