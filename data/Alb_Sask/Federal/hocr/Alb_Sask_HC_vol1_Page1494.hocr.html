               Mr. P. TALBOT. I would like to draw 
               <br />
               attention to a source of revenue which 
               <br />
               has attracted little notice, and that is our 
               <br />
               school lands. According to estimate, we 
               <br />
               have at least eleven million or twelve mil- 
               <br />
               lion acres of school lands which in time 
               <br />
               will be sold and the money held in trust 
               <br />
               by the Dominion government .and on that 
               <br />
               money we will be paid three per 
               <br />
               cent. yearly, every half year. The 
               <br />
               policy has been to hold these lands until 
               <br />
               they are worth $7 to $10 an acre. We will 
               <br />
               have, therefore, ten million acres <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> 
               <br />
               will be eventually sold at $10 an acre, or 
               <br />
               $100,000,000, on which we will receive an 
               <br />
               annual income of three per cent. or three 
               <br />
               million dollars per year. That amount,

               along with what is arranged in this Bill 
               <br />
               would be sufﬁcient for the new provinces.

               Mr. SPROULE. I doubt whether these 
               <br />
               school lands will realize very much more 
               <br />
               than We got from the old school land grant 
               <br />
               ‘of Ontario. In Ontario. when we add to 
               <br />
               the revenues from school lands what is re- 
               <br />
               quired to meet the expenditure on educa- 
               <br />
               tion, education becomes a pretty expensive 
               <br />
               burden on the people. In Manitoba they 
               <br />
               have been trying from time to time to get 
               <br />
               the use of the capital of the school lands 
               <br />
               fund and have frequently expressed great 
               <br />
               dissatisfaction because the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment would not give more than the in- 
               <br />
               terest I think the Dominion government 
               <br />
               are right because they hold these lands 
               <br />
               in trust. But I am merely pointing out 
               <br />
               that the interest on the sales of these 
               <br />
               lands is very much too small for the needs 
               <br />
               of that province for educational purposes. 
               <br />
               It is quite possible that there will be a 
               <br />
               similar experience in the new provinces.
