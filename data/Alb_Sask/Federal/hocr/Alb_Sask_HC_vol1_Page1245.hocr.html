               vince of Ontario, and even the province of 
               <br />

               lands to these various provinces. or he will 
               <br />
               have to refuse them their lands. If he hands

               refuses to hand over the domain to Ontario, 
               <br />

               pensation for these lands. Moreover, you

               will have the unique spectacle of Ontario 
               <br />
               owning all its public domain save the portion 
               <br />
               of Keewatin reserved by the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. If you hand over to Manitoba the

               domain in that portion of the territory given 
               <br />

               <br />
               not owning the 7 3,000 miles comprised with- 
               <br />

               l‘O—night he tells us that the provincial 
               <br />
               government, in order to get ready money, 
               <br />
               might sell the lands at an inferior price—— 
               <br />
               quite a contrary argument to the one he used 
               <br />
               on introducing the Bill. At that time he told 
               <br />
               us that, under the pressure of ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               stringency, the provinces might increase the 
               <br />
               price of the land so much as to discourage 
               <br />

               <br />
               give the land away practically for nothing.

               den) asked the Prime Minister it‘ he could 
               <br />
               not give us some estimate of the value of
