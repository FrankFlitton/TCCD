               <br />
               tumbling the other day. In 1896 he was the 
               <br />
               most eloquent champion of minority rights, 
               <br />
               not merely because they were guaranteed 
               <br />
               by the constitution, but because they were 
               <br />
               right and because majorities should be fair 
               <br />
               and just to minorities. He made one of 
               <br />
               the most moving <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and'eloquent</span> speeches ever 
               <br />
               delivered in this House along those lines. 
               <br />
               If those principles were sound then they 
               <br />
               are right to-day. But the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster) had the audacity to rise in his

               <br />
               tions of 1896 took place and the Liberals 
               <br />
               were returned to power. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so,’</span> my arguments

               ought to have had with the people ; and the 
               <br />
               same was repeated in 1900 and again in 
               <br />
               1904; and therefore I am going to swallow 
               <br />
               my principles. I am going over to the other 
               <br />
               side. Well, if that logic were sound, the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman ought to come clean over 
               <br />

               of Canada groaned under a bad policy and 
               <br />
               a worse administration. He knew that four 
               <br />
               or ﬁve years before 1896, the people of 
               <br />

               ship of the right hon. Prime Minister (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) is taking to-day. Every- 
               <br />
               body who is familiar with the history of 
               <br />
               this country knows that to be the case. But, 
               <br />
               as I say, it is not for me to advise them— 
               <br />
               this is their funeral. But I do say that in 
               <br />
               a country situated as this is, no man can 
               <br />
               rise to the highest position in the councils 
               <br />
               of the nation unless he is broad enough to 
               <br />
               stand up in this House and everywhere and 
               <br />
               plead for equal rights for all the people. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, I promised to be brief, and I have - 
               <br />
               already spoken longer than I intended. But, 
               <br />
               before I sit down, I would like to make one 
               <br />
               appeal in contrast and in contradistinction to 
               <br />
               some of the appeals that have been made. 
               <br />
               I would appeal to the sense of fairness of 
               <br />
               the Protestant people of Canada. As one 
               <br />
               of themselves and as representing an ele- 
               <br />
               ment treated most generously by a Catholic 
               <br />
               and French Canadian majority, I would like 
               <br />
               to ask them if we should be outdone in the 
               <br />
               desire to live and let live, if we should be 
               <br />
               outdone in the desire to manifest Christian 
               <br />
               charity and Christian toleration, which, after 
               <br />
               all. are the best justiﬁcation for the Protest— 
               <br />
               ant religion. I would like to ask them, with 
               <br />
               all these facts before them, if they are going 
               <br />
               to be scared, and if they are going to have 
               <br />
               their prejudices aroused, and if they are 
               <br />
               going to refuse to do what is right simply 
               <br />
               because for partisan purposes the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive party chooses to make sectarian appeals 
               <br />
               and stir up sectional strife. Well, I do not 
               <br />
               know that I should say for party purposes 
               <br />
               for one can hardly know which is the party,- 
               <br />
               and which is the rump. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               At any rate, what stands for the great 
               <br />
               Conservative party to-day, for the sake of 
               <br />
               making a little political capital, takes its 
               <br />
               stand against a proposition so eminently fair 
               <br />
               which is based upon the constitution and up- 
               <br />
               on inherent rights. Now it seems to me that 
               <br />
               they are barking up the wrong tree. Pre- 
               <br />
               judices may be aroused for a little time,
