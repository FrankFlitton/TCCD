               Mr. SCOTT. That the Liberal candidates 
               <br />
               were asked as to what their action would 
               <br />
               be if returned to parliament on the matter

               must trust to the government. I make this

               was going to Regina a week later, I never 
               <br />
               heard the question mentioned in the whole 
               <br />
               of my campaign. The question was never 
               <br />
               put to me; I never gave an answer in 
               <br />
               regard to this question. Everybody knew 
               <br />
               that the Northwest Territories were to be 
               <br />
               granted autonomy very early in the new 
               <br />
               parliament and no Roman Catholic or Pro- 
               <br />
               testant ever came to me privately or ever 
               <br />
               put the question at a public meeting or 
               <br />
               asked me in any way, prior to the 3rd 
               <br />
               November, what my action would be in that 
               <br />
               regard. This is further proof of the most

               convincing nature, it any were needed be—

               yond what I have already given to the

               not asking for any more freedom in regard

               Mr. SCOTT. Some hon. gentlemen ap- 
               <br />
               pear to be very much concerned about the 
               <br />
               meaning of the new section 16, about the 
               <br />
               meaning of the Bills as they at present 
               <br />
               stand. The hon. member for Calgary (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy), the other evening, expressed 
               <br />
               what he considered a/doubt about it and 
               <br />
               this doubt was repeated last night by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Qu’Appelle (Mr. Lake). 
               <br />
               They are doubtful whether any change has 
               <br />
               been made in the Bills. I am not very much 
               <br />
               concerned with ﬁlle meaning Of the original 
               <br />
               section 16, because we are not dealing with 
               <br />
               that. But, of course, we are very much 
               <br />
               concerned with the meaning of the Bills in 
               <br />
               the shape in which they are going to be 
               <br />
               adopted, we hope. I would ask the House 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’just</span> for a moment to try and wipe away 
               <br />
               some of the technical and constitutional rub— 
               <br />
               bish with which some hon. members seek 
               <br />
               to confuse our minds. The main question 
               <br />
               as presented by the original section 16 had 
               <br />
               reference to the provision for the distribu- 
               <br />
               tion of the money to all classes of schools. 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst place the right was given to 
               <br />
               minorities to establish separate schools and 
               <br />
               in the next place it was provided that an 
               <br />
               equitable division of the funds should be 
               <br />
               granted to them. There was no connecting 
               <br />
               link, so it appeared to us, which would keep 
               <br />
               the separate schools under state control as 
               <br />

               they are at the present time. The new 
               <br />
               section 16 simply validates and keeps in

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'hon.</span> friend from Calgary advanced the 
               <br />
               contention that these ordinances which,

               when they were of questionable validity, 
               <br />

               acquiring unquestioned validity effect the

               restoration of the ecclesiastical school. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that the proposition only needs 
               <br />
               to be stated clearly to constitute its own 
               <br />
               answer. The right to separate schools is 
               <br />
               very clearly laid down in section 41 of ordin-
