               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{.</span> L. BORDEN. Before we begin, I 
               <br />
               might say to the hon. the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior that the information which I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> 
               <br />
               received, with regard to a portion at least 
               <br />
               of what I have asked, is not of very much 
               <br />
               use. What I asked for was the estimated 
               <br />
               population of each constituency <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'as</span> on the 
               <br />
               1st of July, 1905. What I have got is a 
               <br />
               statement from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,.</span> census, which I-could 
               <br />
               have made out myself, of the population oi 
               <br />
               each constituency in 1901.

               Mr. OLIVER. I asked the Census Com- 
               <br />
               missioner for such an estimate and he said 
               <br />
               he could not give me an estimate that would 
               <br />
               be of any value.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I was not depend-

               ing altogether upon the Census Commis- 
               <br />
               sioner. As the government were delimiting 
               <br />
               certain constituencies, I presumed they 
               <br />
               would have an estimate of the population. 
               <br />
               because I thought that the delimitation 
               <br />
               must have proceeded upon an estimate of 
               <br />
               some kind as to the population of each con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               given in the census and thought it had 
               <br />
               already been given. It may be of some 
               <br />
