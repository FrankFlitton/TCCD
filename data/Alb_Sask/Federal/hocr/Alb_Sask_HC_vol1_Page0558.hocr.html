               His Excellency, Monseigneur Sbarretti. I

               make no criticism upon His Excellency in 
               <br />

               no criticism upon them for courteously ac- 
               <br />
               cepting that invitation. Let us consider, 
               <br />
               however, how far the situation had devel- 
               <br />
               oped up to that time. Legislation in regard 
               <br />
               to the schools in the Northwest was about 
               <br />
               being brought down; it even then had just 
               <br />
               been brought down by the administration— 
               <br />
               or at least by a portion of the administra- 
               <br />
               tion, because two members of the adminis- 
               <br />
               tration had not been consulted. I will cor- 
               <br />
               rect myself and say that legislation had 
               <br />
               been brought down by the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               in the name of the whole administration. 
               <br />
               but with the authority of only a part of 
               <br />
               the administration. It is true that we had 
               <br />
               very direct avowals from the Minister of 
               <br />
               Agriculture and from the Postmaster Gen- 
               <br />
               eral yesterday, that they were thoroughly 
               <br />
               familiar with the terms of the legislation 
               <br />
               as originally brought down and that they 
               <br />
               thoroughly approved of it as originally 
               <br />
               brought down. I am making no criticism 
               <br />
               so far as they are concerned, because the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister certainly had their appro- 
               <br />
               val and the approval of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Customs, but he had not the approval of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance nor of the Minister 
               <br />

               I notice that my hon. friends opposite 
               <br />
               cheer very much the statement of His Ex— 
               <br />
               cellency that ‘Catholics in any territory 
               <br />
               which might be annexed to Manitoba would 
               <br />
               naturally object to losing the right they 
               <br />
               had to separate schools, and to be sub- 
               <br />
               jected to the educational conditions which 
               <br />
               existed in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Manitoba)</span> That is what they 
               <br />
               cheer, as I understand. I am amazed at 
               <br />
               these hon. gentlemen. The other day we 
               <br />
               had the ex-Minister of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior</span> rise 11] 
               <br />
               his place and publicly thank the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister, without Whose aid, he said, 
               <br />
               the Catholics of Manitoba could not have 
               <br />
               been deprived of those rights—publicly 
               <br />
               thanked the right hon. gentleman for having 
               <br />
               come to the aid of the majority in Maui- 
               <br />
               toba and prevented the Conservative gov— 
               <br />
               ernment from restoring to the minority those 
               <br />
               rights of which they had been deprived. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">_The</span>

               right hon. gentleman has declared this to 
               <br />
               be a happy solution of a difﬁcult situation; 
               <br />
               but hon. gentlemen opposite cheer the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ut-</span> 
               <br />
               terance which I have just quoted. Their 
               <br />
               attitude is a little incomprehensible to my— 
               <br />
               self, and I think it must be incomprehensible
