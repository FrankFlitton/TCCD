               hon. friend the leader of the opposition made

               Mr. A. K. MAGLEAN. I submit that if 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman’s words have any mean- 
               <br />
               ing, the interpretation I have placed upon 
               <br />
               them is a fair one. Now the hon. member 
               <br />
               for East Simcoe (Mr. Bennett) also complains 
               <br />
               that the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) 
               <br />
               has not made his address, I presume, upon 
               <br />
               the legal aspect of the measure. The argu- 
               <br />
               ment of the Minister of Justice is in the Bill; 
               <br />
               where everybody can read it. But the hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
               <br />
               has given no legal opinion on this measure— 
               <br />
               absolutely none. And I submit that there are 
               <br />
               very few hon. members on the opposition 
               <br />
               side who have given such an opinion. The 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition has stated that he 
               <br />
               stands by the constitution, but he has not 
               <br />
               endeavoured to explain what the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion is, he has not uttered a single word 
               <br />
               which would make clear what the effect of 
               <br />
               this Bill would be legally or what would be 
               <br />
               the effect if the constitution were applied. 
               <br />
               So, upon that score, I think my hon. friend 
               <br />
               has not very much reason to complain con- 
               <br />
               cerning the delay of the speech of the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of Justice.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The attitude assumed by the opposition 
               <br />
               on this question is a strange one. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve it is not a fair one. For instance, the 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Simcoe stated that 
               <br />
               he would support the amendment of the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition on several grounds. 
               <br />
               There is only one ground upon which a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of this House can intelligently support 
               <br />
               that amendment, and that is upon the con- 
               <br />
               stitutional ground. The leader of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition stated that the educational clauses 
               <br />
               constitutionally were ultra vires. Therefore 
               <br />
               he moved the amendment. He deliberately 
               <br />
               stated in this House, and stated more than 
               <br />
               once, that it was not a question of separate 
               <br />
               schools or national schools. But the hon. 
               <br />
               member for East Simcoe declared a moment 
               <br />
               ago that he was going to support the amend- 
               <br />
               ment because he was opposed to separate 
               <br />
               schools. The same remarks might be made 
               <br />
               regarding the speeches of all those hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen opposite who have spoken on the 
               <br />
               measure. And what has been the result ? I 
               <br />
               submit that the result has been the creation 
               <br />
               of an agitation in the country that is most 
               <br />
               undesirable. I say that this agitation is 
               <br />
               largely due to the fact that the Conservative 
               <br />
               party as represented in this House to-day 
               <br />
               has no policy and the members have been 
               <br />
               permitted to go here, there and everywhere. 
               <br />
               One hon. member was allowed to make 
               <br />
               one statement, and another hon. member a 
               <br />
               different statement. There were just two 
               <br />
               ways to deal with this issue. It could pos- 
               <br />
               sibly be argued fairly on constitutional 
               <br />
               grounds, or it could be dealt with as _a 
               <br />
               matter of public policy. And the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion, I contend should have taken one or 
               <br />
               other of these grounds. But they agreed 
               <br />
               to go every man for himself, upon the 
               <br />
