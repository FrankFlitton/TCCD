               It seems to me that we can dismiss that at

               these local municipal divisions about which 
               <br />
               there has been so much discussion in con-

               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman (Sir Wi'l-frid 
               <br />
               Laurier) seems to base his argument 
               <br />
               largely on the list of those who have voted. 
               <br />
               If I look at that list I ﬁnd the arrangement 
               <br />
               of constituencies quite as unsatisfactoryas

               some acquaintance with this subject in the 
               <br />
               session of 1903, when I acted upon a com— 
               <br />
               mittee to which was entrusted the duty of 
               <br />
               reporting the distributing of ridings in all

               <br />
               a matte1 of dispute, I never heard in the 
               <br />
               committee any suggestion that we should 
               <br />
               proceed upon the basis of those who have 
               <br />
               voted in any particular riding. We proceed- 
               <br />
               ed always upon the basis of population, and 
               <br />
