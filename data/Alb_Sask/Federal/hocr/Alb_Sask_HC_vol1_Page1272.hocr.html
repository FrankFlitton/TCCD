               ing now on the general question of the 
               <br />
               boundary, and I am stating the case on be-

               half of the inclusion of the district of Atha-

               for its inclusion, and no reason has been 
               <br />
               shown why the 69th parallel is not a reason- 
               <br />
               able and proper boundary on the north. The 
               <br />
               Grand Trunk Paciﬁc is surveyed to pass 
               <br />

               <br />
               baska in the Peace river region; and by 
               <br />
               reason of the location of the surveyed line 
               <br />
               within reasonable distance of the navigable 
               <br />
               waters of Peace river, we have every reason 
               <br />
               to believe that the construction of the Grand 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               that the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway has been 
               <br />
               running through these present Territories 
               <br />
               for twenty years during which they still 
               <br />
               have been Territories. As regards repre— 
               <br />
               sentation in the Dominion, provision can 
               <br />
               still be made for representation here. Atha- 
               <br />
               baska can be given a seat in this House 
               <br />
               just as well as the Yukon, so that there 
               <br />
               is every provision for its representation. 
               <br />
               But there may be other reasons why Atha- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liaska</span> is brought in now and they may

               develop later. They may have a political

               aspect. He has not made good his plea 
               <br />
               for the inclusion of this country at present. 
               <br />
               It cannot be on the ground of representa- 
               <br />
               tion, because there cannot be provision made 
               <br />
               for representation both from the local and 
               <br />

               ing it into the new province. Athabaska 
               <br />
               should be kept as it is as the basis of a new

               province to the north rather than be in- 
               <br />
               cluded in the two new provinces. If, at a

               future day, we saw ﬁt to bring them in, 
               <br />
               they could be brought in on the present 
               <br />

               <br />
               under the same administration, will tend to 
               <br />
               the disadvantage of the people both of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Al-</span> 
               <br />
               berta and of Athabaska. There is every 
               <br />
               reason why there should be a community

               of administration between these two parts 
               <br />
               of the same country. The trade of the whole 
               <br />
               district of Athabaska is done with Edmonton 
               <br />
               and is connected directly with that of north- 
               <br />
               ern Alberta. There is no reason at the

               trict of Alberta. There is every reason why 
               <br />
