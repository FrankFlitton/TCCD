               On another occasion, many years ago, the 
               <br />
               Episcopalians of Montreal found themselves

               making some very doubtful political cap- 
               <br />
               ital ? Let me remind those who are sowing 
               <br />
               the seeds of discord in this young country of 
               <br />
               ours, that after the seed-time comes the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">har—</span> 
               <br />
               vests, and I, for one, shudder to realize what 
               <br />
               a harvest must come from the sowing of such 
               <br />
               seed. 
               <br />

               I notice that the hon. the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition conﬁned himself very closely to 
               <br />
               the constitution, and in- his closing remarks 
               <br />
               said that on the rock of that constitution 
               <br />
               he would take his stand. Well, Mr. Speak- 
               <br />
               er, as far as I am concerned, I would go 
               <br />
               much further back than the British North 
               <br />
               America Act and deal with this question 
               <br />
               on the basis of Christianity—on that con- 
               <br />
               stitution which was given to us over 1,800 
               <br />
               years ago. By that constitution and on 
               <br />
               that Rock of Ages, from which we were 
               <br />
               taught the principle of peace on earth and 
               <br />
               good will to our fellow <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men.</span> and mankind 
               <br />
               in general, and which warrants us in re- 
               <br />
               cognizing the conscientious scruples of our 
               <br />
               neighbours and teaches us not only to be 
               <br />
               just, but generous to all minorities—it is 
               <br />
               on that constitution and that Rock of Ages 
               <br />
               I am prepared to take my stand. As far 
               <br />
               as I can judge. the positions taken by the 
               <br />
               government and the opposition differ in this 
               <br />
