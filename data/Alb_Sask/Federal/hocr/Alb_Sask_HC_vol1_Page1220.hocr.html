               it strike the Minister Of the Interior then 
               <br />
               that in handing that land over to Quebec, 
               <br />
               to administer there would likely be a con- 
               <br />
               ﬂict between the provincial and the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion authorities in carrying out the im- 
               <br />
               migration policy. I say that that objection 
               <br />
               does not hold, and I say further that I do not 
               <br />
               believe there is a member from the North— 
               <br />
               west Territories sitting on that side of the 
               <br />
               House who in the west and until he came 
               <br />
               to this parliament, did not advocate that 
               <br />
               the lands in these provinces belong to the 
               <br />
               provinces absolutely and that the provincial 
               <br />
               government should administer them. I may 
               <br />
               be speaking in error, but if so I am subject 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">correction,</span> I know that the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Western Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) has for 
               <br />
               years advocated not only on the public 
               <br />
               platform, but in his paper the Regina "Lead- 
               <br />
               er,’ that these lands belong to the bro- 
               <br />
               vince and should be administered by the 
               <br />
               province. That is the position he took and 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Assiniboia (MP- 
               <br />
               Turrll’t‘) has made a similar statement. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Strathcona (Mr. Talbot) 
               <br />
               I think has made similar statements, but 
               <br />
               now they come down here to this par 1a- 
               <br />
               ment and the only reason I have yet heard
