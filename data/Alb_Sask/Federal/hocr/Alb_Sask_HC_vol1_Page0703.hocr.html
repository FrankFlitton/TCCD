               friend, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding)

               stated a. moment ago, and stated very truly, 
               <br />
               that in future years, when the province of

               easier <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> it to dispense with this assistance

               settlers have to struggle everywhere, now is 
               <br />
               the time when this assistance should be given. 
               <br />
               We believe it is better to take the money lying

               idle in the Dominion treasury to assist the

               against the province. They succeeded in 
               <br />
               discovering that in years gone by, in 1878 
               <br />
               or 1879, the province had been loaned the 
               <br />
               sum of $30,000 and therefore, without con- 
               <br />
               sulting Manitoba in any way they deducted 
               <br />
               that $30,000 from the balance due to Mani— 
               <br />
               toba which they had no right to do. I am 
               <br />
               not a lawyer and this is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> legal question, 
               <br />
               but I may say that the province of Manl— 
               <br />
               toba contends that this money should have 
               <br />
               been taken out of the ﬁrst money derived 
               <br />
               from the sale of these lands, and the Dom— 
               <br />
               inion government claims that it should not. 
               <br />
               However, if the little province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               wants to get justice in this case as in others, 
               <br />
               I suppose it will have to go to the courts. 
               <br />
               I would repeat that the amount allowed 
               <br />
               for government, $50,000 a year is inadequate, 
               <br />
               is not nearly sufﬁcient to conduct the aﬂiairs 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"oi?</span> Manitoba and I feel justiﬁed in making 
               <br />
               the demands I have made, that in connection 
               <br />
               with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">readjustment</span> which is now taking 
               <br />
               place that province should receive an in- 
               <br />
               crease by way of allowance for govern- 
               <br />
               ment. .

               Now we come to the question which is 
               <br />
               causing so much excitement at the present 
               <br />
               moment, that is the extension of the bound- 
               <br />
               ary of Manitoba. Sir, if I may use a slang 
               <br />
               expression I might say: Would it not give 
               <br />
               you a chili? 'No, that is not the proper 
               <br />
               expression. I should say that if the light 
               <br />
               that has been thrown upon this subject is 
               <br />
               true and we have every reason to believe 
               <br />
               it is true, it should set on ﬁre every pat-
