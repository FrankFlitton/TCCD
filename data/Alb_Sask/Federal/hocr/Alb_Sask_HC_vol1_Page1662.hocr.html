               <br />
               an average of 1,540. The 11 constituencies 
               <br />
               numbered from 8 to 18 have a voting popu-

               <br />
               population of 5,902, giving an average to 
               <br />

               <br />
               have an average of about 1,200. Now let us

               <br />
               If you add 400 for the electors in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Athabaska,</span>

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Well,;</span> there may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘be</span> some justiﬁcation for

               That, I repeat once more, is the best possible

               ment should act upon that principle which 
               <br />
               they lal-d down in 1899, and should leave the 
               <br />
               delimitation of these divisions to a tribunal 
               <br />
               Which will have an opportunity and means 
               <br />
               of making the necessary investigation, in 
               <br />
               order that justice may be done to all parties 
               <br />
               in that province.

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. We stated 
               <br />
               upon introducing this Bill, and we have re- 
               <br />
               peated it over and over again, that we have 
               <br />
               endeavoured to obtain some idea of what 
               <br />
               the population is at the present time in the 
               <br />

               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distribution.</span> We have stated that we 
               <br />
               have taken several sources of information, 
               <br />
               the vote registered, the vote polled, the cen- 
               <br />
               sus, the post ofﬁces, the school districts and 
               <br />
               the local improvement districts. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) Ibases the whole 
               <br />
               of his argument upon two of these sources 
               <br />
               of information, upon the vote recorded and 
               <br />
               the vote registered. But, there is another
