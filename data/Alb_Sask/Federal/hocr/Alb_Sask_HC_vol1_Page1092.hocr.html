               client about his religious belief before he 
               <br />
               would do anything for him. As we expect 
               <br />
               all our young people who go out in the world 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               for this ﬁght, we ought to prepare them all 
               <br />
               together. In fact, I go so far as to say 
               <br />
               that I think even the sexes should not be 
               <br />
               kept apart in school. When I went to school 
               <br />
               down here on Le Breton Flats—for I was 
               <br />
               born in this town, then called Bytown-there 
               <br />
               were _no separate schools here, except one 
               <br />
               somewhere in lower town. The boys and 
               <br />
               girls all went to school together, and friend- 
               <br />
               ships were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vformed</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then‘</span> which have lasted 
               <br />
               through life. Those who went to that school 
               <br />
               have to-day all a warm feeling for each 
               <br />
               other; but those who went to the separate 
               <br />
               school in lower town—and there were very 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few—were</span> to us as aliens and foreigners. 
               <br />
               On my return to this city after twenty years 
               <br />
               absence, I could not receive a warmer wel- 
               <br />
               come from any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,of</span> my own relatives than I 
               <br />
               have received from some of the Roman Ca- 
               <br />
               tholics with whom I went to that school; 
               <br />
               and I felt almost as warmly t0wards them 
               <br />
               as to my own kin. I could name a number 
               <br />
               of men who went to that school, and I do 
               <br />
               not think one of them is a worse Catholic 
               <br />
               or a worse Protestant from having been 
               <br />
               educated side by side in the same room. 
               <br />
               Although this is my personal belief, I am a 
               <br />
               Liberal—a Liberal in more ways than in 
               <br />
               name—and I wish every person to enjoy 
               <br />
               his own opinion. I know that a great many 
               <br />
               of my fellow men do not believe as I do 
               <br />
               on this question, and I am quite willing 
               <br />
               that they should enjoy their belief and act 
               <br />
               accordingly. There are a great many Pro- 
               <br />
               testant clergymen nowadays who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> cla- 
               <br />
               mouring for more religious education in the 
               <br />
               public schools. We hear of it every year 
               <br />
               at all their public gatherings. At their sy- 
               <br />
               nods, their general assemblies and their con— 
               <br />
               ferences, there is nearly always some deli- 
               <br />
               verance made On this question, demanding 
               <br />
               more religious teaching in the schools; but 
               <br />
               it has been a question to me how we could 
               <br />
               accomplish anything of this kind and please 
               <br />
               all these bodies and at the same time please 
               <br />
               our Catholic brethren. I am sorry to say 
               <br />
               that the Roman Catholics can get on more 
               <br />
               easily in that respect than the Protestants 
               <br />
               can. It is a hard thing to say, but it is 
               <br />
               true all the same. Now, I think the educa- 
               <br />
               tional clauses of these Autonomy Bills solve 
               <br />
               this problem to a great extent. The half 
               <br />
               hour of religious teaching every day after 
               <br />
               half-past three o’clock can be conducted ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the wishes of the trustees, which 
               <br />
               will depend a great deal on the wishes of 
               <br />
               the people themselves. That is one way to 
               <br />

               have been miseonstrued, and in a great

               many instances I believe purposely miscon- 
               <br />
               strued. Many petitions have come in here 
               <br />
               professing to be in favour of provincial 
               <br />
               rights ; but it is a peculiar thing that in not 
               <br />
               one of these petitions, so far as I have seen 
               <br />
               them, was any reference made to anything 
               <br />
               in regard to which provincial rights were 
               <br />
               being invaded except the schools—not a 
               <br />
               word about the public lands, although any 
               <br />
               one who has read the British North America 
               <br />
               Act knows that the public lands belong to 
               <br />
               the provinces as exclusively as education. 
               <br />
               The people have also been allowed to go on 
               <br />
               the idea that it is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">old,</span> separate schools 
               <br />
               such as we have in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ontario</span> and Quebec that 
               <br />
               are being established by these Bills. I do 
               <br />
               not think that is the right thing to do. I 
               <br />
               think the members of this House who sent 
               <br />
               out the headings for these petitions should 
               <br />
               have seen to it that the people understood 
               <br />
               what they were signing. I do not believe 
               <br />
               that outside of the Orange body one man in 
               <br />
               twenty who signed those petitions would 
               <br />
               have signed them had he understood what 
               <br />
               the Bills were meant to do. I have had let- 
               <br />
               ters from some of my constituents, and I 
               <br />
               have seen some curious scraps in the papers; 
               <br />
               and just to let you see what peculiar ideas 
               <br />
               some people have on this question, I am go-

               <br />
               most too good to keep. The following, from

               In reply to your request for my views upon 
               <br />
               the Autonomy Bill as it aiîects the educational 
               <br />
               standing of the new provinces, I would denounce 
               <br />
               it in the strongest terms possible. I believe 
               <br />
               it to be the most serious retograde movement 
               <br />
               that has arisen within this fair Dominion of. 
               <br />
               ours for many decades. Now at least the critics 
               <br />
               will cease to cry that we Orangemen have no 
               <br />
               work to do. I'can see just one possible bless— 
               <br />
               ing arising out of this unworthy attempt to 
               <br />
               force separate schools upon the district con- 
               <br />
               cerned, and that is, that Orangemen from ocean 
               <br />
               to ocean should be so roused that the order 
               <br />
               will receive an impetus such as it needs, and 
               <br />
               after the conﬂict enter upon a period of growth 
               <br />
               hitherto unapproached. This is not a question 
               <br />
               of party politics, nor yet of anti-papery; it is 
               <br />
               a direct assault at the foundation of our liberty 
               <br />
               and rights. It is very evident that Sir Wil- 
               <br />
               frid Laurier has sold himself and his country 
               <br />
               to the Roman Catholic church, and in return 
               <br />
               has received his return to power <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with,</span> such an 
               <br />
               overwhelming majority. There is no denying 
               <br />
               the fact that we have been deceived ; the time 
               <br />
               is short; we must ﬁght like men, with the 
               <br />
               spirit of our noble ancestors. The victory may 
               <br />
               long be delayed, but we shall win. In the 
               <br />
               name of the God of battles have we unfurled 
               <br />
               our banners; this is His ﬁght, and with a prayer 
               <br />
               upon our lips let us face the foe, ﬁght honour— 
               <br />
               ably and doubt not; we shall win such a vlc— 
               <br />
               tory as shall make history and wonderfully 
               <br />
               advance the cause of religious liberty. Let us 
               <br />
               remember Sir Richard Grenville and his little 
               <br />
               ship ‘Revenge,’ as, wounded in the side and 
               <br />
