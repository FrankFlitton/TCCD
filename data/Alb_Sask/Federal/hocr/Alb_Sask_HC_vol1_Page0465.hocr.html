               House. \Viih regard to the system of 
               <br />
               schools in the province of Quebec, I must 
               <br />
               say that when we look at the facts and 
               <br />
               results of those schools, we have nothing 
               <br />
               to be ashamed of. I think our system of 
               <br />
               schools can compare with any other system 
               <br />
               in the Dominion of Canada. If I remember 
               <br />
               rightly. the system of schools in the pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec took the ﬁrst prize at the 
               <br />
               World’s Fair of 1893 at Chicago, and I think 
               <br />
               it was awarded some medals at the World's 
               <br />
               Fair in Paris in 1900; and I may say this, 
               <br />
               in answer to a reverend gentleman—I think- 
               <br />
               it was Dr. Salton—who, speaking in Ottawa, 
               <br />
               said that the morality of Quebec was lower 
               <br />
               than that of any other province of the Do— 
               <br />
               minion. -

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Let me give you a few statistics, showing 
               <br />
               the proportion of convictions in each pro- 
               <br />
               vince. In British Columbia we had ”one con- 
               <br />
               viction <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to.every</span> 56 inhabitants; in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories one in every 77 ; in Ontario 
               <br />
               one in 114 ; in Manitoba one in 115 ; in New 
               <br />
               Brunswick one in 144; in Nova Scotia one 
               <br />
               in 154. And in that fear-fully backward pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec, we have only one convic- 
               <br />
               tion in every 176 inhabitants. May I then 
               <br />
               be permitted to say that our province can 
               <br />
               not be so very far behind in the race, judg- 
               <br />
               ing by the statistics under this head. Then 
               <br />
               if we take the expenditure since 1900, we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the province of Quebec is, in the 
               <br />
               matter of expenditure on public education, 
               <br />
               far ahead of any province in the Dominion. 
               <br />
               If my hon. friend denied that, I have the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures right here. But I shall not weary 
               <br />
               the House by going into them. I may say 
               <br />
               too that the number of illiterates has de- 
               <br />
               creased in the province of Quebec in a pro— 
               <br />
               portion far greater than in any other pro- 
               <br />
               vince of the Dominion; and I am sorry to 
               <br />
               say that in that province, where we have 
               <br />
               abolished separate schools, the province _ot‘ 
               <br />
               New Brunswick, the number of illiterates 
               <br />
               has increased. If my hon. friends from East

               we are not afraid to go to the province of
