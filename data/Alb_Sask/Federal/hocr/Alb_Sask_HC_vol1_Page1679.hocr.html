               before the House the reason we have 
               <br />
               thought it desirable to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> to the govern- 
               <br />
               ment the suggestions that are contained in 
               <br />
               this amendment. We think these sugges- 
               <br />
               tions are very fair, and I place them be- 
               <br />
               fore the government in the hope that the 
               <br />
               government may accept them. Since I spoke 
               <br />
               on Tuesday night the ﬁgures have been 
               <br />
               handed down on both sides. We have each 
               <br />
               made our independent calculations and a 
               <br />
               comparison between these calculations is 
               <br />
               now rendered possible. It is in conse- 
               <br />
               quence easy for us to arrive at what may 
               <br />
               be the basis of our calculation. If the 
               <br />
               First Minister will be good enough to fol- 
               <br />
               low me for just a moment I think 1 can 
               <br />
               make clear the purpose of this amendment. 
               <br />
               The calculations that were made by the 
               <br />
               government as to the number of votes polled 
               <br />
               011 the 3rd of November last for the eleven 
               <br />
               constituencies south of Red Deer, gives 10.- 
               <br />
               566 votes polled; the calculations which the 
               <br />
               opposition made from the same sources of 
               <br />
               information but by independent action, gives 
               <br />
               the number of votes polled in these eleven 
               <br />
               southern constituencies as 10,701. The dis- 
               <br />
               crepancy between the two is but 135 votes; 
               <br />
               the government gives 135 less votes in these 
               <br />
               southern constituencies than the opposition 
               <br />
               make out—regarding Red Deer as neutral 
               <br />
               and therefore omitted. In this calculation 
               <br />
               at least both sides are practically in agree- 
               <br />
               ment. As to the eleven northern constitu- 
               <br />
               encies, the government ﬁgures give 9,553 
               <br />
               votes and the opposition ﬁgures ~give 9,259. 
               <br />
               The government ﬁgures give 294 to the 
               <br />
               north in excess of what the ﬁgures give. 
               <br />
               We are prepared to accept the government 
               <br />
               ﬁgures in the case of Red Deer, namely 
               <br />
               843 as the number of votes polled in that 
               <br />
               constituency. The total number of votes 
               <br />
               polled in the twenty-three constituencies 
               <br />
               according to the government ﬁgures is 20.- 
               <br />
               962, while the total number polled according 
               <br />
               to the opposition ﬁgures is 20,663, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> diiïer— 
               <br />
               ence of about 300. Probably both calcul- 
               <br />
               ations are slightly in error, because it has 
               <br />
               been an exceedingly difﬁcult task to take 
               <br />
               out the electors range by range and section 
               <br />
               by section and put them on the proper side 
               <br />
               of the line. We may agree I think upon 
               <br />
               admitting in a general way that the eleven 
               <br />
               southern constituencies" polled 10,600 votes 
               <br />
               and the eleven northern constituencies 9,400 
               <br />
               or 20,000 in all with Red Deer omitted. That 
               <br />
               is the mean between the estimate of the 
               <br />
               government and the estimate of the opposi— 
               <br />
               tion, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and“</span> it is so near to either of these 
               <br />
               that it is practically safe for calculation.
