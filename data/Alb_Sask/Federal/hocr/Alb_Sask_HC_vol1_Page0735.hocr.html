               served that that which is not true cannot 
               <br />
               be made true by legislation; and also that 
               <br />
               no legislature ought to be asked .to pass 
               <br />
               legislation of this description. The truth is 
               <br />
               that the government ﬁnds itself compelled 
               <br />
               to adopt this utterly illegal and senseless 
               <br />
               course to effect an object which, without 
               <br />
               adopting such course, it admits it could 
               <br />
               not effect. If this legislation is passed, 
               <br />
               manifestly it must be confirmed in Eng- 
               <br />
               land. The hon. member for Brandon 
               <br />
               foreshadowed that as being the intention of 
               <br />
               the government. It seems to be a most 
               <br />
               extraordinary proposal for any government 
               <br />
               to submit to this parliament legislation which 
               <br />
               it must admit, and which, by the mouthpiece 
               <br />
               of one of its late colleagues, it admits, is 
               <br />
               totally inoperative, in fact is ultra vires, 
               <br />
               and as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such.</span> could not be enforced even if 
               <br />
               passed. It would appear that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advocates</span>

               submit to the imperial parliament the entire

               katchewan is undoubtedly the fact, that 
               <br />
               the people of the Territories have from the

               Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the imposi-

               tion of separate schools upon the population 
               <br />

               <br />
               of that land, in my humble opinion, have 
               <br />
               a constitutional right under section 93 to 
               <br />
               exclusively to legislate upon the subject 
               <br />
               of education. This does not appear to 
               <br />
               me to be a question of the merits or de- 
               <br />

               pears to me that the government case is

               largely given away. Undoubtedly that legal

               <br />

               <br />
               the weary waste of verbiage with which 
               <br />
               this House has been daily deluged during 
               <br />
               the past three weeks, relating to the work

               seems to me that this legal question abso- 
               <br />
               lutely must be decided, and the decision 
               <br />

               mier. If the government were able to point

               to any competent decision,—~it must neces- 
               <br />
               sarily be the decision of a court of last re— 
               <br />
               sort in this realm—if they were able to 
               <br />
               point to any such decision, our diﬂ‘iculties 
               <br />
               would be removed; but in the absence of 
               <br />
               any such decision it appears to me to be 
               <br />
               child’s play to force these Bills through this 
               <br />
               parliament without any decision upon that 
               <br />
               subject. We have to look to the future of 
               <br />
               our great country. It appears to me, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, that we need not inquire with too 
               <br />
               great nicety whether by possibility this 
               <br />
               parliament may have the power to enact 
               <br />
               legislation such as that now submitted be- 
               <br />
               cause Canada is under no obligation, moral, 
               <br />
               legal or other, to any one, to experiment 
               <br />
               with her constitution. If doubts do exist on 
               <br />
               that score, and they do exist. then I say 
               <br />
               it would be our legal duty, our duty in 
               <br />
               justice and in equity to give full force 
               <br />
               to the doctrine of provincial rights leaving 
               <br />
               the new provinces educationally absolutely 
               <br />
               free. A free people may be trusted to 
               <br />
               be both just and generous. A restricted 
               <br />
               people will probably act as Manitoba acted. 
               <br />
               Having pointed out, Mr. Speaker, the 
               <br />
               dicta of a number of the members of the 
               <br />
               cabinet it plainly appears that they fail- 
               <br />
               ed to agree in their views upon this school 
               <br />
               question. except as to the necessity of 
               <br />
               saving this government. But, is it not 
               <br />
               possible, Mr. Speaker, that we may ﬁnd 
               <br />
               the true reason why the government insists 
               <br />
               upon forcing separate schools upon the new 
               <br />
               provinces in the utterances of the hon. Min- 
               <br />
