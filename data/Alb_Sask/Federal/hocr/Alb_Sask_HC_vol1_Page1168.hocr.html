               of the soil, as I hope we are, is not one

               national school good enough for all who

               are brothers of the soil? That is a con-

               sideration that animates the people of the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario, and are they to be 
               <br />
               insulted and condemned as illiberal if they 
               <br />
               thinlr, as the great majority of them do, 
               <br />
               that those who are sons of the soil, who 
               <br />
               are brothers of the soil, are good enough 
               <br />
               to go to one national school and be educated 
               <br />
               together? That idea is prevalent throug- 
               <br />
               out the province of Ontario. We have a 
               <br />
               separate school system there, but people are 
               <br />
               gradually abandoning it. They. see these 
               <br />
               separate schools promote disunion rather 
               <br />
               than peace and harmony—and yet the latter 
               <br />
               consideration has been used as an argu- 
               <br />
               ment for their existence. Under a national 
               <br />
               school system the people who come into 
               <br />
               this country are going to become just as 
               <br />
               good Canadians as foreigners who come 
               <br />
               into the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> become good Ameri- 
               <br />
               cans. The foreigner who comes to the United 
               <br />
               States seeks to be naturalized, and being 
               <br />
               naturalized, he wishes his children to be- 
               <br />
               come sons of the soil. That is the great 
               <br />
               characteristic of the United States. People 
               <br />
               come in there from all other countries and 
               <br />
               become brothers, they become uniﬁed.

               But in this country at present, and for a 
               <br />
               good many years past, we have been trying 
               <br />
               to evolve unity out of two races by adopting 
               <br />
               the worst possible we could, that of main- 
               <br />
               taining two distinct and separate systems. 
               <br />
               Not satisﬁed with possessing that system 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec, the people of that 
               <br />
               province, as I think most ungenerously, are 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'trying</span> to impose it upon the people of the 
               <br />
               west. I say to the province of Quebec : You 
               <br />
               have your institutions, you have your laws, 
               <br />
               you have your language, you have your 
               <br />
               school system; be content with that and 
               <br />
               enjoy it if you wish. In Ontario we have 
               <br />
               a dual school system, and we do not pro- 
               <br />
               pose to interfere with it. We say to Que- 
               <br />
               bec : Keep what you have, let the people of 
               <br />
               the west elect what system they will have 
               <br />
               in regard to education. Is there anything 
               <br />
               incendiary in the people of Ontario saying 
               <br />
               that? Has the province of Ontario any 
               <br />
               interest in that great west ?
