               we will proceed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{to</span> discuss the question

               whether or not we have the constitutional 
               <br />
               power to pass this Bill. With regard to 
               <br />
               this question of constitutional powers, we 
               <br />
               must not forget one thing: Section 91 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act determines 
               <br />
               what are the powers of the federal parlia- 
               <br />
               ment; section 92 deals with the powers of 
               <br />
               the local legislatures ; section 93 deals with 
               <br />
               the powers of the local legislatures in re- 
               <br />
               gard to education, but at the same time 
               <br />
               gives the federal parliament a certain con- 
               <br />
               trol over that subject; section 95 places 
               <br />
               some subjects. like agriculture, under the 
               <br />
               control of both ’the provincial legislatures 
               <br />
               and the federal parliament. Now, it has 
               <br />
               been asserted time and again that this legis- 
               <br />
               lation is an infringement upon provincial 
               <br />
               rights. I say with regard to education that 
               <br />
               it is not a question of provincial rights. It 
               <br />
               is not a question whether the province will 
               <br />
               have an absolute right or not, such as it 
               <br />
               has in regard to the matters embodied in 
               <br />
               section 92; but it is purely and simply a 
               <br />
               question of minority rights. It is a ques- 
               <br />
               tion whether the minority shall enjoy the 
               <br />
               rights and privileges which are guaranteed 
               <br />
               by the constitution or rights and privileges 
               <br />
               which they may acquire under the consti-

               tution.

               Mr. BRODEUR. Certainly. If there is

               legislation which is going to bring peace 
               <br />

               <br />
               by this parliament, the present is that legis— 
               <br />
               lation. I am glad that my hon. friend has 
               <br />
               drawn my attention to that point. Now, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, in 1875 this parliament passed a 
               <br />
               law providing that Catholic and Protestant 
               <br />
               minorities in the Northwest should have the 
               <br />
               right to establish such schools as they 
               <br />
               thought ﬁt. There was no objection to that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">law];</span> why ? Sir John Macdonald was then 
               <br />
               the leader <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the opposition in this House, 
               <br />
               and why did he not object‘to the establish- 
               <br />
               ment of separate schools in the Northwest ? 
               <br />
               Because he remembered the promise he had 
               <br />
               made in 1869 to those minorities. He re- 
               <br />
               membered that he, Lord Strathcona and the 
               <br />
               imperial government and Archbishop Taché 
               <br />
               had promised that the rights of the minori- 
               <br />
               ties in the Northwest should never be dis— 
               <br />
               turbed; and, faithful to his word, he did 
               <br />
               not object to that legislation, and the rights 
               <br />
               of the minorities were preserved. In 1880- 
               <br />
               this parliament re—enacted most of the law 
               <br />
               which was passed in 1875. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) was then in 
               <br />
               the House, and I see by the Debates of that 
               <br />
               day that he made a speech—not on that 
               <br />
               question ; oh, no ; but he made a speech on 
               <br />
               some other question which was brought up- 
               <br />
               on the same day on which the Bill was 
               <br />
               under consideration. Let ussee what was
