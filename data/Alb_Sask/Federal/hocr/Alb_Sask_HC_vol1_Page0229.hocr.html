               narrowness of the English-speaking people

               of Canada to say that I come from the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario. We had a general 
               <br />
               election for the local legislature there a few 
               <br />
               weeks ago and I might say to my hon. 
               <br />
               friend that the city of Toronto sent a Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic representative to that legislature 
               <br />
               and that Roman Catholic has the hon-

               our of a seat in Mr. Whitney’s cabinet 
               <br />
               at this moment. And may I be permitted 
               <br />
               to remind my hon. friends of the French 
               <br />
               nationality that for the ﬁrst time in the

               <br />
               town, Mr. Speaker, has been recognized by 
               <br />
               the putting into ofﬁce of the Hon. Dr.

               Mr. Whitney’s cabinet. And of course I 
               <br />
               need not refer to my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               South Toronto (Mr. Claude Macdonell), who 
               <br />
               sits on this side of the House, as 
               <br />
               another example of the generosity of the

               English speaking people of that important

               <br />
               those legal questions and I thought I would 
               <br />
               look up the history of the hon. gentleman 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnd on examination that my hon. friend had 
               <br />
               one special Act of parliament passed in his 
               <br />

               <br />
               study law in that province. Then on fur- 
               <br />
               ther examination, I ﬁnd another special 
               <br />
               Act of parliament passed for the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman to allow him to pass an examination 
               <br />
               that he has never yet passed and he has not 
               <br />
               to this date practised law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(in</span> his own pro—

               opinion on these legal questions in competi- 
               <br />
               tion with the opinion of the distinguished 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden). 
               <br />
               On <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">February</span> 21, the right hon. the Prime
