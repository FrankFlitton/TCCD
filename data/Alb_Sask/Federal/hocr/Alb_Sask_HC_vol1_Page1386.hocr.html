               Mr. Roblin says regarding school grants, that

               on the Dominion government for money to pay 
               <br />

               have led you to imagine. We get a certain

               <br />
               word that was said by Mr. Haultain in that

               speech in regard to schools, and the burden

               of the whole argument was with reference

               <br />
               brought to notice, that gentleman’s speech 
               <br />
               will have very little weight in this House ot: 
               <br />
               in the country. The member for St. John 
               <br />
               (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">IStockton)</span> pretty well demolished the

               <br />
               and I think I have shown what reliance can

               be placed upon at least two of the state— 
               <br />
               meuts which he made as statements of fact.
