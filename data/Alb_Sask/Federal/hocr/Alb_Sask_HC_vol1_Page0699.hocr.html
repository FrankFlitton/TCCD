               ince of Manitoba has been no mean con- 
               <br />
               tributor to the exchequer of the Dominion, 
               <br />
               and if you will take the trouble to turn up 
               <br />
               the facts you will ﬁnd that we are today 
               <br />
               contributing over a million and a half doi-

               lars annually. Therefore, I claim that we 
               <br />
               should get increased subsidies from this gov-

               ernment, and more especially should we get 
               <br />
               them because We have been totally divested 
               <br />
               of our public domain. Manitoba at the time 
               <br />
               of confederation had lands of wide area and 
               <br />
               very valuable. These should be handed over 
               <br />
               to the province and the province should 
               <br />
               have its own public domain, and if you will 
               <br />
               follow closely the British North America 
               <br />
               Act you will ﬁnd that it is according to the 
               <br />
               spirit of that Act that the public lands 
               <br />
               should be handed over to the province. As 
               <br />
               evidence of this take the little province of 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island which had no public 
               <br />
               lands and received the sum of $800,000 in 
               <br />
               lieu thereof, whereas Manitoba only receives 
               <br />
               annually the paltry sum of $100,000 for all 
               <br />
               its public domain. Why should the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba not be given its lands? What 
               <br />
               argument can be adduced why that prov- 
               <br />
               ince and the other provinces in the west 
               <br />
               as well should not own their own public 
               <br />
               domain. True, we had the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) the other night trot- 
               <br />
               ting out the old argument which I thought 
               <br />
               had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> relegated to the background. He 
               <br />
               said this government had to construct the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway for Manitoba and 
               <br />
               the west. I do not think there is an hon.

               gentlemen in this House who will not admit 
               <br />
               frankly that‘the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               is a road entirely of a national character in 
               <br />
               which all the provinces derive beneﬁt. But 
               <br />
               who paid for the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway? 
               <br />
               Sir, the little province of Manitoba and the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories have paid nearly

               <br />
               lands were exempted from taxation. How 
               <br />
               have the other provinces been dealt with as 
               <br />
               regards the Canadian Paciﬁc <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway?</span> Take 
               <br />
               for example the province of British Colum- 
               <br />
               bia. That province is receiving annually 
               <br />
               for the right of way the sum of $100,- 
               <br />
               000, the same amount as Manitoba is re- 
               <br />
               ceiving for the total conﬁscation of all its 
               <br />
               public lands. Therefore, I do not think 
               <br />
               there is any justiﬁcation for the argument 
               <br />

               What is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> public domain of the province 
               <br />
               worth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today?</span> Let me call to your attention 
               <br />
               a few facts which will show the revenue 
               <br />
               derived from the public domain by the other 
               <br />
               provinces. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">In</span> the year 1903 the province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               Ontario received $2,440,549.91 as revenue 
               <br />
               from its public lands, woods and forests. 
               <br />
               The province of Quebec received $1,447,- 
               <br />
               294.24 from the same source. Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               received $600,000 from its crown lands and 
               <br />
