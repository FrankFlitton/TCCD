               hon. members of this House that the last

               three lines of that clause do away with all

               <br />
               date of the admission to the union. If the

               province of Alberta had been a province 
               <br />

               man in this House who will say that the

               provision of section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act would not apply? I cannot 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conceive</span> of any answer to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument.</span> that 
               <br />
               if you apply this draft clause to these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, you apply to them section 93 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, unless, in some 
               <br />
               other part of the enactment, you speciﬁcally 
               <br />
               take it away. That is my argument. I say 
               <br />
               that if you give them that clause which, in 
               <br />
               all fairness and justice, you must, following 
               <br />
               the precedent of Manitoba, Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> Columbia, you do away 
               <br />
               with any argument as to whether it was a 
               <br />
               province or a territory, and also with any 
               <br />
               argument about the date of admission to the 
               <br />
               union. Is there anybody who will say that 
               <br />
               they have not now by law these rights and 
               <br />
               privileges ? Admit these two points, and 
               <br />
               you admit the whole of my argument—the 
               <br />
               conclusion seems to me to be absolutely in- 
               <br />
               evitable. But what ’I say further is that 
               <br />
               you have a little phrase in that clause that 
               <br />
               does protect you, if you admit the ﬁrst part 
               <br />
               of my argument, which is that we have 
               <br />
               plenary power, as we have, I think, under 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1871, that 
               <br />
               phrase says ‘as varied by this Act’ ; and 
               <br />
               you must vary this Act if you want to get 
               <br />
               away from section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act of 1867. I say, and say it

               if you have one national school system it is 
               <br />
               in the best interest of the country. I would 
               <br />
               be disposed to recognize all conscientious 
               <br />
               beliefs. But coming to this question as I do, 
               <br />
               I cannot reach any conclusion but that it is 
               <br />
               best that there should be one school system. 
               <br />
               Therefore, I hold that parliament should 
               <br />
               vary by this Act the application to these

               I am sure that 
               <br />
               even if you do give the power to the prov- 
               <br />
               ince, in all probability you will have some 
               <br />
               kind of a separate school system. But what 
               <br />
               harm would there be in leaving it to them? 
               <br />
               If you adopt the clause I suggest you are 
               <br />
               not legisl—ating to take away separate 
               <br />
               schools; you leave it beyond the shadow of 
               <br />
               a doubt to them to do as they please about 
               <br />
               separate schools. You make your legisla- 
               <br />
               tion clear and you avoid litigation.

               If that argument is not logical, I am far 
               <br />
               astray. The only answer to it that I can see 
               <br />
               is the argument of policy, the argument of 
               <br />
               toleration and moderation that was made 
               <br />
               in 1896. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">am</span> prepared to admit that my 
               <br />
               hon. friends who argue in favour of this 
               <br />
               clause as it is now amended are honest in 
               <br />
               their conviction that it is in the best interest 
               <br />
               of the country to try to quiet matters. But, 
               <br />
               on the other hand, I do not thin-k that quiet 
               <br />
               would result from the legislation they sug- 
               <br />
               gest. I am one of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> who think that if 
               <br />
               you follow the course here proposed you are 
               <br />
               more likely to stir up strife than if-you do 
               <br />
               what I suggest. I had a Scotch grand- 
               <br />
               mother, though I have an Irish name, and 
               <br />
               I can well believe that this is a case in 
               <br />
               which, if you are to grasp the thistle, it is 
               <br />
               best to grasp it ﬁrmly. If, in dealing with 
               <br />
               this matter as the Prime Minister proposes, 
               <br />
               we do not promote moderation and tolera-
