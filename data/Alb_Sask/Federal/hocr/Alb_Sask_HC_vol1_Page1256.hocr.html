               the question of an international fence, pro- 
               <br />
               bably 800 miles in length, is one of rather 
               <br />
               more importance than the question of the 
               <br />
               amount of a contract let by this govern- 
               <br />
               ment. Surely that is a contract that should 
               <br />
               not be let without the knowledge of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister. It is a question that has 
               <br />
               probably been the subject of negotiations 
               <br />
               with the states to the south of us; it cer- 
               <br />
               tainly should be if it has not been. It a 
               <br />
               work of that kind can be let without the 
               <br />
               knowledge of the Prime Minister, then the 
               <br />
               door is open to all manner of very doubtful 
               <br />
               transactions in connection with any depart- 
               <br />
               ment of the government. The wire fencing 
               <br />
               along the boundary between Switzerland and 
               <br />
               Italy is regarded as so important that sen- 
               <br />
               tries are placed to walk up and down on 
               <br />
               either side of it. And there are hanging 
               <br />
               bells to give notice to these sentries if there 
               <br />
               is any attempt to break through this fence. 
               <br />
               Of course, I do not pretend that anything of 
               <br />
               that kind will be required with us. But it 
               <br />
               shows that it is a question of such impor- 
               <br />
               tance that it should all be carried out with 
               <br />
               the thorough understanding of the state 
               <br />
               oiﬁcers, so that there may be no question 
               <br />
               o_f the boundaries. And, if such a transac-

               Mr. DAVID HENDERSON. I certainly 
               <br />
               agree with everything that the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for West Toronto (M-r. Oslër) has said. 
               <br />
               And I will go further. I think it is very 
               <br />
               unfortunate—and the matter has occurred 
               <br />
               more frequently of late with relation to 
               <br />
               public works—that the department ofﬁcials 
               <br />
               should be allowed such great latitude in 
               <br />
               deciding the expenditures to be made upon 
               <br />
               various public works of this country. In- 
               <br />
               stead of taking the instructions of the min- 
               <br />
               ister to erect a public building for a certain 
               <br />
               sum, the ofﬁcials of the department seem 
               <br />
               to be left practically uncontrolled to say 
               <br />
               what the cost of any public work shall be. 
               <br />
               I have had occasion, time after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time,-to</span> 
               <br />
               draw attention to this matter. _And the 
               <br />
               course I have suggested at different times 
               <br />
               has been approved, especially by the late 
               <br />
               Hon. Mr. Sutherland, when Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works. That gentleman stated that 
               <br />
               he approved of my plan that the ofﬁcials of 
               <br />
               the government should be limited to a cer- 
               <br />
               tain sum of money for the erection of a 
               <br />
               public building, after parliament has de- 
               <br />
               cided that that building shall -be erected. 
               <br />
               But here we have a case where not only

               <br />
               the construction of this fence? It parlia- 
               <br />
               ment voted the money, I would like to 
               <br />
               know when that vote passed. I have no 
               <br />
               recollection of any vote of this House for 
               <br />
               the erection of such a fence. Of course. if 
               <br />
               there has been a vote, I presume, that 
               <br />
               would be a direction to the department to 
               <br />
               carry out the work. But, if my recollection 
               <br />
               is accurate—and I think it is—no appropria- 
               <br />
               tion has been made for this purpose. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve, from all that has been learned from 
               <br />
               this brief discussion, that some ofﬁcial in 
               <br />
               the department has undertaken to concur 
               <br />
               in the desire of some contractor to get a 
               <br />
               big contract without even waiting for the 
               <br />
               appropriation by parliament to sanction it, 
               <br />
               and without the minister at the head of 
               <br />
               the department having approved of it. 
               <br />
               Whether it was in the Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior or the Department of Public Works, 
               <br />
               I do not know. I should think it would 
               <br />
               be for the Department of Public Works to 
               <br />
               erect this fence. We have nothing before 
               <br />
               us to show that the Department of Public 
               <br />
               Works was ever consulted in the matter or 
               <br />
               that it sanctioned this expenditure in any 
               <br />
               way. So far as the facts are before us. it 
               <br />
               would seem to be one of those cases where 
               <br />
               departmental oﬂicials have assumed to do 
               <br />
               something they had no authority to do, to 
               <br />
               expend public money, while we, the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House, to a certain extent, 
               <br />
               along with the government are held res- 
               <br />
               ponsible. How are we to limit the expen- 
               <br />
               diture of this country if an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> of the 
               <br />
               government is to have power to direct ex- 
               <br />
               penditures beyond that of the head of the 
               <br />
               department, or even that of the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister, and without consulting parliament ? 
               <br />
               I think the time has come when the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister should put his foot down on such 
               <br />
               a practice, and that he should administer 
               <br />
               a severe rebuke to any colleague of his or 
               <br />
               any ofﬁcial under the government who 
               <br />
               would undertake to do such a thing. Now, 
               <br />
               this is not a small matter. The hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for West Toronto (Mr. Osler) said it 
               <br />
               would cost $100,000 at least. I have no 
               <br />
               hesitation in saying that if a proper fence 
               <br />
               were constructed there it would cost not 
               <br />
               less than a quarter of a million dollars. 
               <br />
               Eight hundred miles of fencing, would 
               <br />
               mean 256,000 rods. To construct a fairly 
               <br />
               good, substantial fence and provide <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posts</span> 
               <br />
               such as ought to be provided in a case of
