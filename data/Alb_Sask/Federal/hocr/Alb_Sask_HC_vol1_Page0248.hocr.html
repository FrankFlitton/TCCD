               Sir, as I said a minute ago, the ﬁrst im- 
               <br />
               portant Bill in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">relation</span> to education in 
               <br />
               Great Britain was introduced in 1870. For 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst time parliament passed a measure 
               <br />
               making provision for a ‘sufﬁcient, efﬁcient 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">land</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buitable’</span> elementiary education; but 
               <br />
               mark well, it was understood that the work 
               <br />
               of efﬁcient voluntary schools should not be 
               <br />
               hampered, but that their efforts should be 
               <br />
               supplemented. In those days there were 
               <br />
               men like my hon. friend from Grey who 
               <br />
               opposed denominational schools. Here is 
               <br />
               the answer which Mr. Gladstone gave to 
               <br />
               their opposition:

               Can it be said that the prevalence of denom- 
               <br />
               inationalism in those schools <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at.</span> the present 
               <br />
               moment is generally felt to be a grievance ? 
               <br />
               On the contrary, is it not the case that every- 
               <br />
               body and every section are telling as con- 
               <br />
               tinually that the religious diﬂiculty directly 
               <br />
               you came to Practice becomes insigniﬁcant. 
               <br />
               and that it is a difﬁculty made for parlia- 
               <br />
               ment and for debate rather than on which 
               <br />
               would be felt within the walls of the schools ? 
               <br />
               Now I come to denominational, or as I shall 
               <br />
               call them, voluntary schools and if I am told 
               <br />
               that an overwhelming majority of voluntary 
               <br />
               schools are denominational, I think I can draw 
               <br />
               a lesson from that fact, which is that it shows 
               <br />
               what a powerful agency we have to do our bid- 
               <br />
               ding, to perform much of our work for us, if 
               <br />
               only we will not obstruct it. We are as much 
               <br />
               convinced as he is that with respect to these 
               <br />
               voluntary schools, the duty of the state is to 
               <br />
               make use of them for the purposes of secular

               <br />
               of the objects of the Bill was to include in
