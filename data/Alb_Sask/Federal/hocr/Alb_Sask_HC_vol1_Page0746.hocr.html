               Mr. SPRUULE. If the Intercolonial Rail-

               <br />
               is the policy of the government with regard 
               <br />
               to extending that railway westward in order

               <br />
               explicable that the government, after taking 
               <br />
               the position they took a year ago in regard 
               <br />
               to the extension of the Intercoionial Rail— 
               <br />
               way westward should now do the very thing

               that they opposed a year ago and yet be
