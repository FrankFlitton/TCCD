               I would like, Mr. Speaker, to refer to a 
               <br />
               remark made by the hon. member for Jac- 
               <br />
               ques Cartier (Mr. Monk). That hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man said that the Finance Minister was a 
               <br />
               good swimmer, but that he had to be thrown 
               <br />
               into the water. The ex-Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior, I understand, is also fond of the 
               <br />
               water. When he resigned his seat he was 
               <br />
               pulling with both oars to the rescue of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights. He started up stream with 
               <br />
               his faithful band of Northwest members, 
               <br />
               the people on the shore applauding; put soon 
               <br />
               the clouds began to lower, the ex-minister 
               <br />
               and his companions began to weary in well 
               <br />
               doing, very soon they began to pull with 
               <br />
               one oar taking back water with the other, 
               <br />
               and the only excuse the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex:-minister,</span> the 
               <br />
               captain of this brave enterprise, had to give 
               <br />
               us was that there must be peace, and the 
               <br />
               adventure, if carried out, might cause mu-

               er, Peace! That hon. gentleman, by-hil 
               <br />
               actions, has done more to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">create.</span> distur-

               bance in this country than any other man

               has ever done on the ﬂoor of this House. 
               <br />
               Had that hon. gentleman been true to his 
               <br />
               principles, had he advocated those principles, 
               <br />
               and had the Northwest members stood true 
               <br />
               to him, he, along with the Finance Minister, 
               <br />
               and the men from the east, could have held 
               <br />
               up this government and forced them to eli- 
               <br />
               minate those educational clauses from the 
               <br />
               Bill. Secta-rian peace! Is it true that we 
               <br />
               cannot have sectarian peace unless sepa- 
               <br />

               <br />
               do you ﬁnd it so complete as in the United

               States, where the children of all creeds 
               <br />
               study side by side in peace and harmony? 
               <br />
               We are asked to vote for these clauses in 
               <br />
               the name of peace and harmony, without 
               <br />
               which we are promised endless trouble. If 
               <br />
               the government will blot out these educa- 
               <br />

               When the Prime Minister compared Ca- 
               <br />

               was due to the national school system of 
               <br />
               the United States. The right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man must be aware that the public schools

               of the maritime provinces, Ontario and Brit-

               not receive religious instruction, therefore

               <br />
               ground. It has been my privilege to in—

               say they are far from being godless schools.

               extremely important character and will

               stand the fullest discussion. The govern-
