               the extension of the boundaries of that 
               <br />
               province was hung up as the price of the

               surrender of the educational liberties of 
               <br />
               that province. If there is anything clear 
               <br />
               and patent, it is that the settlement of the 
               <br />
               boundaries of Manitoba was held back 
               <br />
               until negotiations could be conducted and 
               <br />
               an opportunity given to secure remedial 
               <br />
               legislation. Hon. gentleman may laugh, bIIt 
               <br />
               I ask them is it or is it not a fact that the 
               <br />
               Papal ableg-ate spoke of the extension of 
               <br />
               the boundaries of the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               at the same time that he wasne gotiating 
               <br />
               with the Attorney General of that province 
               <br />
               for remedial legislation ? We knew that to 
               <br />
               be the case, and hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               are trying to screen themselves behind the 
               <br />
               Papal ablegate. Why did they not go to 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister of this country and ask 
               <br />
               for that remedial legislation? There is 
               <br />
               to—day a justiﬁcation for such legislation in 
               <br />
               connection with the province of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               The constitution reads that way, and we 
               <br />
               have been told by all the authorities that 
               <br />
               the law sanctions it. Then if hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite believe in that remedial legis- 
               <br />
               lation, they should get it by way of their 
               <br />
               party and not through negotiations with 
               <br />
               the Papal ablegate. The Papal ablegate, so 
               <br />
               leng as he conﬁnes himself to discharging 
               <br />
               the functions of his ofﬁce in connection with 
               <br />
               his church, may remain here as long 
               <br />
               as he pleases without objection from any- 
               <br />
               body. But the people of Ontario who are 
               <br />
               being maligned as illiberal and intolerant, 
               <br />
               do object to any foreign representative be-

               most of all interfering with the settlement 
               <br />
               of our educational matters. Have people

               all know a good deal of the past and go 
               <br />
               back to it, and reading this Syllabus and

               I was going to refer to the position of my

               right hon. friend the leader of the House. 
               <br />
               and I shall only say this. There is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> 
               <br />
               in the province of Ontario that when he got 
               <br />
               their support in 1896 as standing out against 
               <br />
               the coercion of Manitoba, in some way he 
               <br />
               deceived them. I regret to say that the 
               <br />
               man who occupies the high position of 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of this country is regarded 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day,by</span> the people of a large section of 
               <br />
               this country and the people of my own 
               <br />
               province as having deceived them by this 
               <br />
               change of policy which has taken place. 
               <br />
               He opposed coercion then and he advocates 
               <br />
               it to-day. To-day he refuses to give the 
               <br />
               people of the west a single voice in the 
               <br />
               settlement of the school question. He has 
               <br />
               deceived the people of the west, and I leave 
               <br />
               him in their hands. Where are we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> 
               <br />
               and what is the upshot of it all ? We are 
               <br />
               on the eve of a great struggle in this coun- 
               <br />
               try which nobody <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wiﬁies</span> to see. It is only 
               <br />
               beginning. We know what is likely to come 
               <br />
               to pass. We know, from the speech of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Inland Revenue (Mr. Brodeur), 
               <br />
               that there will be litigation out of this le— 
               <br />
               gislation if it ever carries, that there will 
               <br />
               be a demand for remedial legislation. We 
               <br />
               know also that there will be a certain 
               <br />
               amount of opposition in the west and a 
               <br />
               refusal to comply with that demand. There 
               <br />
               will be an appeal to imperial England. 
               <br />
               Imperial legislation will be asked. We will 
               <br />
               be kept in this House this session for 
               <br />
               months yet talking over these Bills.
