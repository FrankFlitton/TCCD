               Before I conclude, I desire, Sir, to put 
               <br />
               myself personally on record as being strong- 
               <br />
               ly in favour of religious instruction in the 
               <br />
               schools. I hold that opinion myself, and it 
               <br />
               is the opinion of the church to which I be- 
               <br />
               long. I believe it is good for Catholic chil- 
               <br />
               dren; I believe it is good for the children 
               <br />
               of all religious beliefs, that religion should 
               <br />
               have a place in the schools. I believe that 
               <br />
               the character of the child can be better 
               <br />
               moulded in the love and fear of God than 
               <br />
               by any other training. I believe that you-th 
               <br />
               is the proper time to inculcatethe knowledge 
               <br />
               between right and wrong. But, Sir. I do not 
               <br />
               believe that this Bill would conserve that 
               <br />
               great principle. I believe that the law ex- 
               <br />
               isting to-day in the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               gives the minority of that country rights 
               <br />
               at least equal to those embodied in the 
               <br />
               Bill. I fear that there will be retaliation 
               <br />
               against the enactment of this measure, and 
               <br />
               I believe that if this Bill were never enacted 
               <br />
               the legislatures in the new provinces would 
               <br />
               at once have a revision and consolidation of 
               <br />
               their laws. and in that revision and con- 
               <br />
               solidation they would have inserted the re- 
               <br />
               enactment of these school ordinances, which, 
               <br />
               after all, is all that this measure provides 
               <br />
               for. I believe that for all time to come the 
               <br />
               minority would be under the protection of 
               <br />
               section 93 of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act; and I believe, Sir, that the minority in 
               <br />
               these provinces would in future stand a 
               <br />
               better chance of obtaining concessions from 
               <br />
               the majority, and that there would be great- 
               <br />
               er amity and greater harmony among the 
               <br />
               people of that country if they were left to 
               <br />
               themselves to settle whatchr differences 
               <br />
               might arise. And if these Bills should ul- 
               <br />
               timately be held to be ultra vires, what a 
               <br />
               spectacle will be witnessed. The feeling 
               <br />
               that prevails here to-day, if it has not al- 
               <br />
               ready extended to that country, will certain- 
               <br />
               ly spread there, and mutual distrust and 
               <br />
               mutual ill-will may arise. Taking it all in 
               <br />
               all, I believe that lt is best that the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces should be left to themselves to legis- 
               <br />
               late on the subjects mentioned in the amend- 
               <br />
               ment proposed by the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion. It is my opinion that the Catholics in 
               <br />
               the Northwest, will in the end be granted 
               <br />
               greater rights and more extended privileges 
               <br />
               if that amendment is acted upon. The 
               <br />
               minority in Canada do not want to wrest 
               <br />
               from the majority anything more than they 
               <br />
               are by law entitled to obtain, and the law 
               <br />
               is there for the protection of minorities and 
               <br />
               majorities alike. There is no church ; there 
               <br />
               is no organization. civil or religious, ex-

               îSfÎng in the world today which obeys the 
               <br />
               laws of the various countries in which it 
               <br />
               is established than does the Catholic church. 
               <br />
               Throughout the civilized world the Catholic 
               <br />
               church is planted and is ﬂourishing, and I 
               <br />
               challenge a denial of my statement, that no 
               <br />
               matter what the law may be, no organized 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Catholic church. I believe that the 
               <br />
               minority in Canada will be willing to take 
               <br />
               what the law gives them and what the cou- 
               <br />
               stitution guarantees them, and that is what 
               <br />
               they will get under the amendment of the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition. Just one word in 
               <br />
               conclusion. It is not a question of separate 
               <br />
               schools or no separate schools; it is ﬁrst 
               <br />
               of all a constitutional question. and, for the 
               <br />
               reasons I have given, I believe that the con— 
               <br />
               stitution as it stands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> must in the end

               he applied to these new provinces. When I 
               <br />
               say it is not a question of separate schools, 
               <br />
               or no separate schools I say so for this 
               <br />
               additional reason: that the establishment 
               <br />
               of separate schools is a matter that is al- 
               <br />
               ready concluded, because the history of the 
               <br />
               question in the United States, in Great Bri— 
               <br />
               tain and elsewhere is that if the minority 
               <br />
               wants separate schools they will have them, 
               <br />
               and the question is simply a matter of whe- 
               <br />
               ther the minority are going to pay taxes for 
               <br />
               their own schools and taxes for the public 
               <br />
               schools, or whether they will have their 
               <br />
               schools separate and apart, as we have 
               <br />
               them in the province of Ontario, and as we 
               <br />
               would have them in the new provinces of

               Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that this ques- 
               <br />
               tion is being debated in rather a peculiar 
               <br />
               manner. As I understand, on the second 
               <br />
               reading of a Bill the main principle of the 
               <br />
               measure is discussed; but in this case we 
               <br />
               have been discussing one clause almost al- 
               <br />
               together. However, I suppose that must be 
               <br />
               right, for we have heard no objections made 
               <br />
               to it so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far;</span> Before I go any further, I 
               <br />
               want to deﬁne my position personally with 
               <br />
               regard to the educational clauses of this 
               <br />
               Bill, around which the whole debate has 
               <br />
               centred. Personally, I have no use for sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools. As I understand it, our pub- 
               <br />
               lic school system exists for the purpose 
               <br />
