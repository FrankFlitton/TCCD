               Rt. Hon. Sir WI-LFRID LAURIER (Prime 
               <br />
               Minister). I have to inform the House, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, that I have just received a tele- 
               <br />
               gram informing me of the death of Mr. 
               <br />
               Sutherland, Minister of Public Works. I 
               <br />
               have to say to the House that personally in 
               <br />
               losing Mr. Sutherland I lose one of the truest 
               <br />
               friends I ever 'had, and I know that the 
               <br />
               House loses one of its most valued mem- 
               <br />
               bers. I will meet, I am sure, the feelings 
               <br />
               of the House if I endeavour to say that the 
               <br />
               House should express its sympathy in its 
               <br />
               bereavement in some suitable manner, and 
               <br />
               I do not know that that can be done in any 
               <br />
               other way than by the House adjourning to 
               <br />
               attend his funeral. Therefore, I will move 
               <br />
               that when this House adjourns to—morrow 
               <br />
               it stands adjourned until Monday next, so 
               <br />
               as to permit members to attend the funeral 
               <br />
               of Mr. Sutherland.
