               <br />
               powers of investment of capital are largely 
               <br />
               regulated by the corporate powers given to

               incorporation of no trust company that I

               much the argument I made at ﬁrst. The 
               <br />
               Bill, by this, expressly says that it is danger- 
               <br />
               ous to join insurance business and trust 
               <br />
               business together. Somebody wants to get 
               <br />
               a certain power, and has pressed for it. 
               <br />
               That power is given in the Bill, but we feel 
               <br />
               that we must guard ourselves to some extent 
               <br />
               at least, and so we add this clause to say 
               <br />
               that insurance shall only be done as pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               as plainly as can be, that it is dangerous to 
               <br />

               have a right to pass any law here which 
               <br />
               would grant larger powers to any corpor- 
               <br />
               ation than they enjoy under provincial Acts. 
               <br />
               I know well that in our Quebec code 
               <br />
               there is a provision denying the corporations 
               <br />
               the exercise of certain powers, and in this 
               <br />
               Bill it is provided that such corporation 
               <br />
               may exercise those powers, which is cer— 
               <br />
               tainly contrary to the disposition of our law. 
               <br />
               I am inclined to think also that we would 
               <br />
               have no right to give a corporation certain 
               <br />
               civil rights which they cannot exercise un- 
               <br />
               der the laws of the provinces; otherwise 
               <br />
               those powers that we give those corpor- 
               <br />
               ations would be absolutely contrary'to the 
               <br />
               law. The only power we can exercise is 
               <br />
               to form a corporation, but that corporation 
               <br />
               must exercise its civil rights under the laws 
               <br />
               of the province, and I think this provision 
               <br />
               is a very good one.

               Minister. I do not think it wise that we 
               <br />
               should be guided here by the Companies 
               <br />
               Acts in any province. Is not that covered 
               <br />
               by the fact that, I think, every company 
               <br />
               of this sort has to take out a license before 
               <br />
               it can do business in another province? 
               <br />

               cense in the province of Quebec, the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec won’t give it a license un- 
               <br />
               less it restricts its powers to make them 
               <br />
               conform with the laws of Quebec. In On- 
               <br />
               tario the same way, they won’t give you 
               <br />
               a license except to carry out business sub-

               ject to their rules. It seems to me that

               covers the point.
