               Mr. Speaker, education was assigned to 
               <br />
               the provinces. Let any necessary agitation 
               <br />
               in respect to education, in respect to the 
               <br />
               rights and powers of legislatures with re- 
               <br />
               gard to education, be conﬁned to provincial 
               <br />
               limits. That is the true solution of the 
               <br />
               question. Let the Dominion interfere 
               <br />
               and the agitation will be widespread. My 
               <br />
               proposition is to let the people settle the 
               <br />
               question for themselves, and the agitation 
               <br />
               if any—and I do not believe there will be 
               <br />
               any considerable agitation—will be conﬁned 
               <br />
               within narrow limits, and, in the end, will 
               <br />
               be settled by some reasonable compromise, 
               <br />
               because, after all, we can always safely 
               <br />
               trust to the good sense of the people in 
               <br />
               this regard. As I said before, I ﬁrmly be- 
               <br />
               lieve that if this question had been left to 
               <br />
               the people of the new provinces, they would 
               <br />
               have dealt, and they will deal, fairly with 
               <br />
               the minority. But we must not oppress or 
               <br />
               coerce any part of the people to provide 
               <br />
               safeguards that have not a warrant in the 
               <br />
               constitution. The constitution of Canada 
               <br />
               does not always protect minorities by any 
               <br />
               deﬁnite safeguards. There are nearly 50,- 
               <br />
               000 Nova Scotian electors who, at the last 
               <br />

               <br />

               argue for separate schools. It is not for

               me to determine that question for the peo-
