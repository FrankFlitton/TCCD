               I have no more to say at present. 
               <br />
               I trust that my right hon. friend will 
               <br />
               recede a little from the position which 
               <br />
               he took the other day, and that he will give 
               <br />
               us some reason for the very extraordinary 
               <br />
               course which he has pursued in the intro- 
               <br />
               duction of this Bill, that he will perhaps 
               <br />
               be good enough to advise us, although he 
               <br />
               has not seen ﬁt to do so up to the present 
               <br />
               time, whether or not any amendments to 
               <br />
               the Bill have been under the consideration 
               <br />
               of the government. Whenever I have asked 
               <br />
               that question before, my right hon. friend 
               <br />
               has told me with a great air of wisdom 
               <br />
               that amendments can be made to any Bill. 
               <br />
               Nearly all of us on this side of the House 
               <br />
               were aware of that before the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman told us. There may have been 
               <br />
               one or two hon. gentlemen to whom that 
               <br />
               came as a refreshing piece of news, but 
               <br />
               nearly all of us were aware of it before. 
               <br />
               That was not the question I asked. The 
               <br />
               question I asked and to which I have a 
               <br />
               right to get an answer is this: Has the 
               <br />
               government under consideration at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time any amendments to the Bill 
               <br />
               which was brought down in such extra-

               my right hon. friend will be good enough

               copy of a journal which is sometimes sup-

               posed to be in the secrets of the govern-

               tain statements that have an ofﬁcial in-

               ing from the Montreal organ of a member 
               <br />
               of. the administration, gives currency to a 
               <br />
               rumour that some question or questions in 
               <br />
               connection with this Bill are to be sub- 
               <br />
               mitted for the consideration of the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court. If my right hon. friend’s view, ex- 
               <br />
               pressed when he introduced this Bill, is a 
               <br />
               sound one—and I presume it was not taken 
               <br />
               without due consideration—of course it 
               <br />
               would not be necessary to submit any ques- 
               <br />
               tion to the court, but perhaps he may have 
               <br />
               had new light on the subject since he made 
               <br />
               his speech. However that may be, I do re- 
               <br />
               spectfully ask the Prime Minister to give 
               <br />

               <br />
               to all these matters, and especially to 
               <br />
               inform us why it was that he did not see

               the extract <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after»</span> extract which my hon. 
               <br />
               friend has read, and the innuendo after 
               <br />
               innuendo which he has given utterance to, 
               <br />
               my hon. friend has come to the conclusion 
               <br />
               that this Bill has been too hastily prepared. 
               <br />
               As an evidence of this hasty preparation he 
               <br />
               tells us that the Bill though given a ﬁrst 
               <br />
               reading on the 21st of February has not yet 
               <br />
               been called for second reading. It is true 
               <br />
               that we have not yet moved the second 
               <br />
               reading of the Bill, and it makes my heart 
               <br />
               sink within me to think that whenever we 
               <br />
               defer to the wishes of my hon. friends on 
               <br />
