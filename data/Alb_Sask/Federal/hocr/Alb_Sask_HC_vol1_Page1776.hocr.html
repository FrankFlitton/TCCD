               The second subsection of section 93 of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               after the law of 1875 was adopted this par-

               <br />
               tion. They laid aside, as is well known,

               I suppose nobody will deny that the inten- 
               <br />
               tion at that time was that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholic</span>
