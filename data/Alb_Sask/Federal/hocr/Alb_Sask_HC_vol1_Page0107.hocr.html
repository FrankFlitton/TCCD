               Mr. ROBERT STEWART (Ottawa). Up 
               <br />
               to the present moment we have heard 
               <br />
               nothing from the promoter of the Bill as to 
               <br />
               the reasons why he asks this House to pass 
               <br />
               it. As one of the representatives of the city 
               <br />
               of Ottawa I wouid like to hear from him 
               <br />
               why he asks for this legislation, which, to my 
               <br />
               mind, is an invasion of the rights of the 
               <br />
               municipality. In such an important matter 
               <br />
               as this I really think that the promoter of 
               <br />
               the Bill ought to give us some reasons why 
               <br />
               he thinks we should pass it. I may say that 
               <br />
               since this Bill was in committee before a 
               <br />
               very numerously signed petition has been 
               <br />
               sent in protesting against the passing of the 
               <br />
               Bill, a petition signed by .over 2,000 rate— 
               <br />
               payers of the city of Ottawa. I mention this 
               <br />
               as showing the very strong feeling that ex- 
               <br />
               ists in the city against this Bill; and yet in 
               <br />
               face of this fact. and in face of the fact that 
               <br />
               this Bill seems to call for the abolition of the 
               <br />
               competition which exists to-day, we are 
               <br />
               still without any reasons given by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro»</span> 
               <br />
               moter of the Bill why it should pass.
