               are not at all the kind of school laws that 
               <br />
               the people particularly of Ontario have in 
               <br />
               their minds. I think, if I am allowed to do 
               <br />
               so, I am justiﬁed in charging the opposition 
               <br />
               in this House and I will go further and say 
               <br />
               that I think I am justiﬁed in charging the 
               <br />
               newspapers, particularly those published in 
               <br />
               Toronto, with the responsibility to a very 
               <br />
               large extent for the feeling that prevails 
               <br />
               to-day throughout the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               on this question. The minds of the people 
               <br />
               of Ontario have been poisoned by misrepre- 
               <br />
               sentation as to what the real conditions are 
               <br />
               and as to what the intentions of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment are in connection with this legislation. 
               <br />
               The idea which has taken hold of the minds 
               <br />
               of the people of Ontario is an exaggerated 
               <br />
               one. They have the idea that it is the in- 
               <br />
               tention of- the government to establish in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories schools of the 
               <br />
               character that we had in the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba before 1890 ; that is to say, schools 
               <br />
               entirely under the control of the church. 
               <br />
               Under the law which prevailed in Manitoba 
               <br />
               prior to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1890'there</span> was a Catholic school 
               <br />
               board. I may say that the members of that 
               <br />
               board were practically priests and some 
               <br />
               prominent members of the church. They 
               <br />
               controlled the schools and those who were 
               <br />
               employed as teachers were nuns and priests; 
               <br />
               in fact, they had scarcely a properly quali- 
               <br />
               ﬁed teacher in their schools in Manitoba 
               <br />
               previous to 1890. The idea that the people 
               <br />
               of Ontario have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> is that it is the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment’s intention to establish Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic church controlled schools entirely 
               <br />
               free and independent of the state. That is 
               <br />
               the idea that the people of Ontario have in 
               <br />
               their minds but the fact is that the condi- 
               <br />
               tions which have been reported to them do 
               <br />
               not really exist. It is hardly necessary for 
               <br />
               me to repeat what this school law really is. 
               <br />
               If this Bill goes through it will establish not 
               <br />
               what I claim are separate schools. In fact, 
               <br />
               the name ‘separate’ should hardly have 
               <br />
               been used in connection with them. We pro— 
               <br />
               pose to continue in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories what they have already got—Catholic 
               <br />
               public schools and Protestant public schools, 
               <br />
               schoolS, no matter whether they are Catho- 
               <br />
               lic or Protestant, which are public schools 
               <br />
               and which are free to all classes of children, 
               <br />
               having the same text books, the same quali- 
               <br />
               ﬁed teachers, under the same control, and 
               <br />
               that control entirely in the hands of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment and not in any way connected with 
               <br />
               the church. I feel as strongly on this ques- 
               <br />
