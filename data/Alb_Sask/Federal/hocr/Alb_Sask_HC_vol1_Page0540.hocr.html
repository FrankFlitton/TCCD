               have to take exception to that view of the

               I have heard some hon. gentlemen on the

               other side of the House say that the pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               trol of their lands. Very true, Mr. Speaker ; 
               <br />
               but the provinces of Ontario and Quebec 
               <br />
               should not be considered from the same 
               <br />
               point of view as the Northwest provinces, 
               <br />
               and I will tell you why. Because there are 
               <br />
               in those two provinces immense timber 
               <br />
               limits. from which they derive a very large 
               <br />
               revenue. In the province of Quebec. during 
               <br />
               the last year, I .think the revenue accruing 
               <br />
               from the Crown lands amounted to $600,- 
               <br />
               GOO—not from the sale of lands. but from 
               <br />
               the stumpage only. The situation is not the 
               <br />
               same in the Northwest Territories.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There .is another point of View from which 
               <br />
               I think we should withhold the lands from 
               <br />
               the new provinces, that is the national point 
               <br />
               of view. In stating this opinion, I may be 
               <br />
               taxed by some hon. gentlemen with being 
               <br />

               ing; but let me say frankly what I think. 
               <br />
               It is obvious to every one who observes the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories to-day that the loyal 
               <br />
               sentiment which prevails there is pure, 
               <br />
               deep and large, as the stately rivers which 
               <br />
               lun over the endless prairies. But who 
               <br />
               knows what will be the immigration of

               <br />
               not a complete remedy. lbut certainly a

               the educational clause of this Bill,_ it is a

               very burning question and a question of

               clauses of this measure have already been 
               <br />
