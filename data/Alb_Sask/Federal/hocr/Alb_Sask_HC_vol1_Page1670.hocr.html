               <br />
               By reason of the population? Not at all, but 
               <br />
               by reason of the immense amount of wealth, 
               <br />
               as he put it, .that was invested in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> 
               <br />
               enterprises in that portion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Althabaska.</span> 
               <br />
               As a result he concluded, and no doubt Ed- 
               <br />
               monton approved of his conclusion, to cut 
               <br />
               Athabaska in two and give it two represen- 
               <br />
               tatives. That is what they did, that was the 
               <br />
               starting point. Then they said: We will 
               <br />
               divide the other portions of Alberta into 
               <br />
               twenty-three districts. That is what they 
               <br />
               did. Then the next move was this : Calgary 
               <br />
               polling the largest vote of any place in Al- 
               <br />
               berta. they cut that vote out. Why ? Because 
               <br />
               it was the largest vote polled in Alberta. 
               <br />
               Then they come up to Edmonton where there 
               <br />
               was not so large a vote, and they cut that 
               <br />
               out. In order to do what ? To divide that 
               <br />
               portion of the territory north of Red <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Deer,</span> 
               <br />
               township 38 into a certain number of consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies, according to the number of votes 
               <br />
               polled less those in Edmonton. And the 
               <br />
               same rule applied to the south. And'it was 
               <br />
               by these means that the hon. gentlemen put 
               <br />
               thirteen representatives in the north and 
               <br />
               twelve in the south. Now if there was no 
               <br />
               government seat to be chosen these arrange- 
               <br />
               ments would have no importance. But they 
               <br />
               knew there was to be a government seat 
               <br />
               chosen, and they wished to procure a repre- 
               <br />
               sentation that would decide where the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment seat should be situated. And that 
               <br />
               is what these gentlemen had in view at the 
               <br />
               time they made this schedule, there is no 
               <br />
               question about it. Now if the First Minister 
               <br />
               wanted to be fair, what would he have said? 
               <br />
               He would have said that previously to the 
               <br />
               introduction of this Bill on the 21st of 
               <br />
               February these schedules must be prepared. 
               <br />
               as the schedules are prepared in connection 
               <br />
               with every other Bill when it is introduced. 
               <br />
               But in the preparation of these schedules 
               <br />
               what course must he pursue in order to do 
               <br />
               justice to all classes in Alberta ? And what, 
               <br />
               would my right hon. friend have said then 
               <br />
               to the member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Edmonton</span> and the mem- 
               <br />

               <br />
               defeated candidates for Calgary and Al- 
               <br />
               berta, and you four gentlemen between you 
               <br />
               map out what the different constituencies 
               <br />
               ought to be in Alberta, and when you do that 
               <br />
               I will embody it in this Bill and submit it 
               <br />
               to parliament, and we will have a fair repre-

               Deer or any other place is selected as the

               but it is of some inter-est to me 'to know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>

               created by any legislation passed by this 
               <br />
               House. A good deal has been said about 
               <br />
               those newspapers from which quotations 
               <br />
               have been read. My hon. friend from Cal— 
               <br />
               gary quoted some statements made by the 
               <br />
               Liberal press of Calgary. I can understand 
               <br />
               that and I shall not be inﬂuenced by what 
               <br />
               the Liberal or the Conservative press says 
               <br />
               in the city of Calgary because I look upon 
               <br />
               them as prejudiced and biased witnesses 
               <br />
               as I do upon the Tory newspaper which is 
               <br />
               edited in Edmonton, and which has express- 
               <br />
               ed its approval of the distribution which 
               <br />
               favours the establishment of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment’s seat in Edmonton. These newspapers 
               <br />
               have no inﬂuence on me because they are pre- 
               <br />
               judiced witnesses, but it is interesting to 
               <br />
               note what the press of Medicine Hat, Leth— 
               <br />
               bridge and other places that have no idea 
               <br />
               of getting the government seat have to say. 
               <br />
               South of Red Deer the press complain of 
               <br />
               this division but north of Red Deer the press 
               <br />
               are satisﬁed. On the south side there are 
               <br />
               Liberals and Conservatives opposed to this 
               <br />
               division because they have not been treated 
               <br />
               with that spirit of fairness which the right 
               <br />
               hon. premier ought to have displayed to- 
               <br />
               wards them. Does the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               believe that we have no reason for com- 
               <br />
               plaint ? I believe we have every reason to 
               <br />
               complain because this is not merely a ques- 
               <br />
               tion of the selection of the government seat. 
               <br />
               If we are giving these people representation 
               <br />
               it should be so carefully given to them that 
               <br />
