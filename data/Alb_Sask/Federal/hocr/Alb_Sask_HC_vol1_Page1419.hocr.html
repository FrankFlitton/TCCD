               Protestants and Catholics in this country,

               any man on account of the altar before

               constitution of this country guaranteed sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools to the minority, there is no 
               <br />
               man in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«House</span> who would hold up his

               hands more readily than myself to support 
               <br />
               them in that right. But as the debate pro- 
               <br />
               gressed, after the First Minister had taken 
               <br />
               his seat and the hon. leader of the opposi— 
               <br />
               tion had made his address, I noticed that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance in his speech, took an 
               <br />
               altogether different course. The right hon. 
               <br />
               the First Minister said he was standing on 
               <br />
               the rock of the constitution, and took the 
               <br />
               ground that separate schools were guaran- 
               <br />
               teed to the minority of this country. If that 
               <br />
               were true, I would be prepared to support 
               <br />
               the government. But they have virtually

               member for Haldimand that Edmonton is 
               <br />
               the only constituency west of Lake Superior 
               <br />
               in which a Liberal could have been elected 
               <br />
               at this time. It was currently reported in 
               <br />
               the corridors of this House and throughout 
               <br />
               Ontario that the hon. member for Western- 
               <br />
               A-ssiniboia (Mr. Scott) was the gentleman 
               <br />
               assigned to that position, and I feel con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdent without his declaration, that he would 
               <br />
               to-day be occupying it if the government 
               <br />
               had had any hope of being able to carry his

               Mr. GÙNN. I feel conﬁdent that the hon.

               gentleman would have made a ﬁrst-class 
               <br />

               <br />
               word to say against the hon. gentleman who 
               <br />
               at present occupies that position. I have 
               <br />
               every conﬁdence that he will administer the

               <br />

               province as the largest tax—paying province 
               <br />
