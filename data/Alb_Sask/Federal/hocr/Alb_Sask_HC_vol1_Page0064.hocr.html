               Now, Mr. Speaker, although I am new in 
               <br />
               this parliament, I am not very new in the 
               <br />
               matter of years, and I am not very new in 
               <br />
               my knowledge of the political aspect of 
               <br />
               this country and of my friends who sit on 
               <br />
               the other side of the House. Living so 
               <br />
               near as I do to the hon. member for Bran- 
               <br />
               don (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">RSifton),</span> we became to same extent 
               <br />
               at least chums—I do not know if that is a 
               <br />
               parliamentary expression, but it is at all 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">events</span> a somewhat endearing term. I do 
               <br />
               not suppose the hon. gentleman (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               wants my sympathy, but I cannot help be- 
               <br />
               ing a little sensitive for him and I feel very 
               <br />
               deeply the manner in which he was treated 
               <br />
               in connection with this Bill. Some time 
               <br />
               ago, when we asked the First Minister as 
               <br />
               to when the member for Brandon might be 
               <br />
               expected back, we were told he was in the 
               <br />
               south for his health. Soon after that Bill 
               <br />
               was introduced, and from a health point of 
               <br />
               view it was very unfair to compel the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior to make such a break 
               <br />
               neck journey to Ottawa, and after getting 
               <br />
               here to force him to rush out on the street 
               <br />
               to ascertain what were the contents of the 
               <br />
               Autonomy Bill which had been introduced 
               <br />
               to parliament. The Prime Minister told us 
               <br />
               10—day that the member for East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule) had asked for three weeks’ delay 
               <br />
               between the ﬁrst and second readings of 
               <br />
               this Bill, but hon. gentleman will remember 
               <br />
               with what derisive cheers from the gov- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ernment</span> supporters that request of the 
               <br />
               member for East Grey was met at the time. 
               <br />
               The three weeks asked for by the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Grey have passed and although 
               <br />
               this House of Commons has not been 
               <br />
               very busy, we are still waiting for the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">second</span> reading. To-day the honoured leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition endeavoured to get some 
               <br />
               information from the premier as to when 
               <br />
               the second reading would be moved, and 
               <br />
               when that request was made a gentleman 
               <br />
               on the Liberal benches remarked: You will 
               <br />
               know soon. Well, I for one, would like to 
               <br />
               know how long that ‘soon’ is. We have 
               <br />
               the information now that the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man (Mr. Sifton) was not consulted as to 
               <br />
               this Bill, that the Minister of Finance was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\</span> not consulted either, and that Mr. Haultain, 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister of the Territories was 
               <br />
               not consulted as to the educational clauses. 
               <br />
               The Prime Minister tried to make out that 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain had been consulted, but I

               <br />
               far as we know at present, the Minister of 
               <br />

               consulted on this matter. Right here I 
               <br />
               would like to say that this afternoon 
               <br />
               during the discussion of this great question, 
               <br />
               not one member from the Northwest Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories supporting the government was in 
               <br />
               his place in the House. I do not know all 
               <br />
               these members and that statement may not 
               <br />
               be correct, but I am told that it is a fact. 
               <br />
               Any way, whether they were here or not 
               <br />
               they were absolutely silent on the question 
               <br />
               and I suppose the inference is they are 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with what has occurred. I have 
               <br />
               not such a deep interest in the other mem-

               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) and there- 
               <br />
               fore I am not so concerned in the fact that 
               <br />
               the others were not consulted about this 
               <br />
               matter, but I really do feel chagrined that 
               <br />
               the Minister of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior</span> should have 
               <br />
               been so slighted. There are other gentle—
