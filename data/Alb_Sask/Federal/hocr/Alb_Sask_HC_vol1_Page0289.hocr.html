               no one could see it. The object of that

               <br />
               a stone; he is not giving you any measure

               that will meet the views and feelings and

               perhaps the prejudices of the people of 
               <br />
               Quebec ; he is deceiving you, and I want to 
               <br />
               convince the member for Labelle of that 
               <br />
               fact, and I trust to his being a missionary 
               <br />
               to disseminate that doctrine in Quebec, and 
               <br />
               to stir up the good people of the province 
               <br />
               to demand more from Sir Wilfrid Laurier, 
               <br />

               <br />
               say: If you give this measure to the Terri-

               other provinces that do not enjoy it are 
               <br />
               entitled to it. He appeals to the Territories

               to make it a great political question; and 
               <br />
               at the same time he appeals to the minori-

               ties in the other provinces, saying to them : 
               <br />
               The minority in the new provinces have got 
               <br />
               something—you demand it too. He thus 
               <br />
               appeals to one class and another—to the 
               <br />
               French. Catholics of Quebec, to the Irish 
               <br />
               Catholics in another province, to the Pro-

               <br />

               <br />
               as taking a higher view of the duties of 
               <br />

               Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. I only plead 
               <br />
               that if the other 212 members of this House 
               <br />
               were as blind as myself, I am in very excel- 
               <br />
               lent company. May I not ask, after this 
               <br />
               question has been debated for three hours 
               <br />
