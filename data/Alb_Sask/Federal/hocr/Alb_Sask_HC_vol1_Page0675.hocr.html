               _In practice, trouble never arises; we have

               no trouble in the west in that way, the

               ferent days for giving religious instruction 
               <br />
               for the different denominations. The trus- 
               <br />
               tees have in all cases for years been able 
               <br />
               to come to an agreement. No separate 
               <br />
               schools, either Protestant or Roman Catho— 
               <br />
               lic, have been organized for the last three 
               <br />
               or four years, and even some that we had 
               <br />
               previous to 1901 have become disorganized. 
               <br />
               In 1901, there were 14 Roman Catholic sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools in the Northwest Territories; 
               <br />
               to—d-ay there are only 10. We in the west 
               <br />
               were boasting that we had solved this vexed 
               <br />
               problem. The Roman Catholic laity are 
               <br />
               perfectly satisﬁed, as far as I can learn, 
               <br />
               and there is no complaint from the Protest- 
               <br />
               ant majority. We are bringing together the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,Protestant</span> and Roman Catholic children for 
               <br />
               the purpose of secular education to an extent 
               <br />
               never before known anywhere in Canada. 
               <br />
               Some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.ask</span> the question: have you separate 
               <br />
               schools at all ? To these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'I</span> would say that 
               <br />
               as far as secular education is concerned, 
               <br />
               we have not, and for sectarian education 
               <br />
               we have. Now, J. think that is right. It 
               <br />
               leaves the secular education with the state 
               <br />
               and the sectarian education, where it be- 
               <br />
               longs, with the church and with the home. 
               <br />
               If this plan which has worked so successful- 
               <br />
               ly in the west for years be not adopted, what 
               <br />
               alternative have we? We are asked by 
               <br />
               some to refer the matter to the courts and 
               <br />
               to allow them to decide what is the right 
               <br />
               of the minority. Now, it is just possible, in 
               <br />
               my mind, that the courts may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decide,</span> that 
               <br />
               the minority are entitled to the rights 
               <br />
               which they had by the provisions of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories Act of 1875, and if 
               <br />
               that were the case, we would have saddled 
               <br />
               upon us a dual system of schools which 
               <br />
               would be as unsatisfactory to the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic minority as it would be to the 
               <br />
               Protestant majority. Personally, I prefer to 
               <br />
               take no risks, especially since granting What 
               <br />
               is asked does not interfere with the useful- 
               <br />
               ness of our present school system. Then 
               <br />
               We are asked by others to leave this ques- 
               <br />
               tion entirely with the new provinces. For 
               <br />
               my part, I would be quite willing to do 
               <br />
               this. I feel sure that the governments in 
               <br />
               the provinces would be sensible enough to 
               <br />
               continue the present system, in fact, I have 
               <br />
               heard nearly all the members of the pre- 
               <br />
               sent legislature of the Northwest Territor- 
               <br />
               ies express themselves as opposed to making 
               <br />
               any change. The premier of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories quite recently said that if he 
               <br />
               had the power to-morrow he would not 
               <br />
               change the present system. But we all 
               <br />
               know how at any time an agitation may be 
               <br />
               started and how the minority might then 
               <br />
               be deprived of the privileges which they 
               <br />
               have. If that were the case, we would 
               <br />
               then be confronted by a serious evil. If

               <br />
               feature is that since the government did not

               strongly in favour of the state having abso-

               of totally abolishing separate schools. If 
               <br />
               separate schools were abolished in the new 
               <br />
               provinces by law we might have a condition 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> similar to that which exists in the 
               <br />
               maritime provinces. We were told a few 
               <br />
               evenings ago by the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               (Mr. Fielding) the condition that exists in 
               <br />
               those provinces. In localities where there is 
               <br />
               a considerable number of Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               separate schools do exist by practice if they 
               <br />
               do not by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lawl</span> There you ﬁnd Roman

               <br />
               ant children in another; you ﬁnd Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic teachers in one school and Protest-

               <br />
               separate schools there by practice if not by 
               <br />
               law. Now to my way of thinking our 
               <br />
               system is far ahead of that. Some have 
               <br />
               compared the action of the federal govern- 
               <br />
               ment in this case to the action or the federal 
               <br />
               government in 1896. But I do not think the 
               <br />
               cases are at all similar. Then the federal 
               <br />
               government tried to force an obnoxious law 
               <br />
               upon an unwilling people ; now the federal 
               <br />
               government is merely asking the Northwest 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">continue</span> a system that passed its 
               <br />
               legislature unanimously and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> accept- 
               <br />
               ed by the people and has proved for 
               <br />
               years to be thoroughly efﬁcient. And. 
               <br />
               further, it is a law which, we all 
               <br />
               admit, the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest’l‘erritories</span> 
               <br />
               would themselves adopt if it were left 
               <br />
               to their own free choice. I have no hesita- 
               <br />
               tion in saying—and I say it after an experi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               education inferior to none in Canada. And 
               <br />
               I Wish to say further that our system is 
               <br />
               more thoroughly a national system than 
               <br />
               even that of the United States. Our gov- 
               <br />
               ernment has absolute control of the secular 
               <br />
               education of a larger percentage of the 
               <br />
               children than has the government of any 
               <br />
               state of the American union, where they 
               <br />
               boast of their national schools. Let me 
               <br />
               quote an extract from a standard work.
