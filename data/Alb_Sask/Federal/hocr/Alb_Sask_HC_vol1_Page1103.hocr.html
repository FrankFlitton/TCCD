               Let me refer to one or two matters which

               niford evidence that this is the policy of 
               <br />
               the opposition. Take the land clause of the 
               <br />
               Bill. Now, the speech of the hon. leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition on that clause of the Bill oc- 
               <br />
               cupies a very small space in ‘Hansard.’ Sure— 
               <br />
               ly it was a very important matter. The ques- 
               <br />
               tion of provincial rights might have been 
               <br />
               as easily raised in reference to the land 
               <br />
               clause as to the educational clauses. And 
               <br />
               the people of this country, I can quite un—

               way parliament should deal with the public 
               <br />
               lands. The reason. I suppose, why we had 
               <br />
               no petitions in reference to the land clause 
               <br />

               <br />
               cord to play upon as the educational clauses. 
               <br />
               I have a word or two to say about the con- 
               <br />
               duct of the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sprouule)</span> in reference to this measure. I am 
               <br />
               not going to say that the hon. gentleman is 
               <br />
               not conscientious in the position he takes 
               <br />
               on the educational clauses of the Bill. His 
               <br />
               conduct in 1896 lends <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strength</span> to the posi- 
               <br />
               tion he takes upon this occasion. But I 
               <br />
               think he has had his weather eye open for 
               <br />
               his party. Now, I very seldom tell a story, 
               <br />
               and a story is never improved by my telling 
               <br />
               it. But the conduct of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey on this occasion reminds me of 
               <br />
               a story of Max O'Rell‘s designed to illu— 
               <br />
               strate a phase of the Scotch character. He 
               <br />
               was seeking to show how close the minis- 
               <br />
               ters of the old school regarded themselves 
               <br />
               in their relations to the deity. An old Pres- 
               <br />
               byterian minister desiring <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> a certain day 
               <br />
               that the wind should blow got down upon 
               <br />
               his knees and prayed ‘Oh Lord, give us 
               <br />
               a wind ; not a rantin’ tantin,’ tearin’ wind, 
               <br />
               but a nice, gentle winnin‘ wind.’ It hap- 
               <br />
               pened that at that moment a breeze came 
               <br />
               up, which‘blew the parsons manuscript off 
               <br />
               the table and scattered the leaves over the 
               <br />
               room, whereat he said: ‘Now, Lord, this 
               <br />
               is ridiculous.’ I think the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey was praying for an agitation, not 
               <br />
               a ‘nice, gentle agitation ’ but a ‘real rantin‘ 
               <br />
               tantin,’ tearin’ agitation.’ And when the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) blew 
               <br />
               in here to-day, the hon. member for East 
               <br />
               Grey must have said, ‘Brethren this is 
               <br />
               ridiculous.’ The hon. member (Mr. Sproule) 
               <br />
               is at the head of an organization. Con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cerning</span> that organization of course I have 
               <br />
               nothing to say. But I would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> this

               My contention in this respect is con- 
               <br />
               ﬁrmed, I think, by the fact that down in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec we ﬁnd a Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive political club, known as the Jacques

               Cartier Club, issuing a letter to a diﬁ'erent 
               <br />
               class of people altogether, asking them to 
               <br />
               oppose the administration for the reason 
               <br />
               that the educational clauses of the Bill do 
               <br />
               not go far enough. Now I say that the

               effect of these petitions was bad for this 
               <br />
               country. They created an agitation. In

               <br />
               musket and ﬁght for provincial rights. Of 
               <br />
               course, nothing happened. It affected many 
               <br />
               newspapers in this country. For instance,

               such a low tone of discussion of a public 
               <br />
               issue, they must bear responsibility for 
               <br />
               what they say. Now that extract from 
               <br />
               the Hamilton “Spectator" was read in this 
               <br />
               House by the Minister of Customs some 
               <br />
               two or three weeks ago. The leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition and the hon. member for West 
               <br />
               Toronto (Mr. Osler) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attempted</span> to apologize 
               <br />
               for this statement of the Hamilton ‘Spec— 
               <br />
               tator.’ But we ﬁnd immediately a Toronto 
               <br />
               paper coming to the support of the Hamil- 
               <br />
               ton ‘Spectator.' I wish to read something 
               <br />
               from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Toronto</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Telegra‘m'</span> in reference 
               <br />
               to that :
