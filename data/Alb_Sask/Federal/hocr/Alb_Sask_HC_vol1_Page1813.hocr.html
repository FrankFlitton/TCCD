               <br />
               We all remember that great event on the 
               <br />
               Plains of Abraham when the soldiers of

               world; the English and the French, who, 
               <br />
               since 1759, have livedhappily together, as

               by degrees through the history of our coun— 
               <br />

               <br />
               signiﬁcance to that of which I have spoken. 
               <br />
               More than that; there was a time when 
               <br />
               some English politicians. sent out here as 
               <br />
               governors, tried to crush one of the two 
               <br />
               partners- who were building up the nation 
               <br />
               on the north shore of the St. Lawrence. 
               <br />
               What was the result of it? Every man 
               <br />
               who knows the history of this country has 
               <br />
               in his mind just now the constitution of 
               <br />
               1841. Was it not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adopted</span> to crush the 
               <br />
               French Canadian element? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘It</span> was. Did it 
               <br />
               succeed? No, on the contrary, probably 
               <br />
               the most brilliant and most useful part of 
               <br />
               our history dates from 1851 and continues 
               <br />
               until the great coalition of 1854. ’l‘alk about 
               <br />
               the abstract letter of the constitution ! Let 
               <br />
               us rather study the minds of those who 
               <br />
               framed the constitution of this country, let 
               <br />
               us go back to 1854, when, after struggling 
               <br />
               for years and years, two men, prompted by 
               <br />
               Providence, one from Ontario and one from 
               <br />
               Quebec, one a French Canadian, having the 
               <br />
               respect of his compatriots, another am Eng-

               said about this famous clause 93 of the

               British North America Act in regard to 
               <br />
               schools. The province of New Brunswick. 
               <br />
               of which my hon. friend from Gloucester 
               <br />
               (Mr. Turgeon) was speaking with so much 
               <br />
               eloquence last night, and the province of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia were not, as he said, bound by

               section 93 of the British North America Act,

               and he said that the new provinces should 
               <br />
               not be bound. There is a great deal of dif- 
               <br />
               ference there. It is true that Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               and New Branswick were not bound by 
               <br />
               that clause. Quebec and Ontario alone 
               <br />
               were bound, but if you recall the spirit 
               <br />
               which animated the men who were at the

               <br />
               Canadian people. These promises were 
               <br />
               made by England at ﬁrst, and afterwards 
               <br />
               by those in Canada who controlled the desti- 
               <br />
               nies of the nation. I have often heard it

               at all events it is true that French Canada 
               <br />

               <br />
               for the sake of argument I will admit that 
               <br />
               French Canada was conquered by England
