               <br />
               do not believe that the Prime Minister and 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior have any 
               <br />
               solid foundation for their contention, 
               <br />
               that the geographical conditions of the 
               <br />
               north should be taken into considera-

               tion as against the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greater</span> population 
               <br />
               Of the south. As the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior knows, from 1887 up to last 
               <br />
               November, almost the whole of the new pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Alberta was represented by one 
               <br />
               member in this parliament, and the hon.

               gentleman himself has represented it for 
               <br />
               the last eight years. If there is a good 
               <br />
               reason why we should have two members 
               <br />
               for that northern country to-day, there must 
               <br />
               be very good reason to say that we have 
               <br />
               been very badly represented for the last

               manent settlement in that country. I do 
               <br />
               not think the stock interests are very great— 
               <br />
               in fact, I know they are not. [[ have not been

               <br />
               formation from men who travelled that 
               <br />

               <br />
               Edmonton {Mr. Oliver.) It is a moving 
               <br />
               population. The Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver) has said that, according to the pres—

               ent regulations of the department, squatters' 
               <br />
               rights are not protected in unsurveyed terri- 
               <br />
               tory. The surveyed territory, I believe, ex- 
               <br />
               tends only about 50 miles from Edmonton. 
               <br />
               Therefore. the population outside of that

               limit is not of a permanent characer.

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HE‘RRON.</span> That is not borne out by 
               <br />
               experience in my country. Previous to 
               <br />
               about 1889, squatters' rights were recog— 
               <br />
               nized, but about that time notices were 
               <br />
               scattered broadcast that they would not be 
               <br />
               longer protected. I know many cases of 
               <br />
               people having been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">removed:</span> and denied 
               <br />
               redress because of the notice having been 
               <br />
               given that they were no longer protected.

               not of a very permanent character. A fair

               estimate of the number of voters in that

               districts i-n the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">south.</span> Take, for instance,
