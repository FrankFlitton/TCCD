               lt is amazing that to some men experience 
               <br />
               brings no wisdom. There is Mr. George Brown 
               <br />
               who used to ride so high a Protestant horse 
               <br />
               in the old days in Upper Canada. He wound 
               <br />
               up his agitation against separate schools by 
               <br />
               guaranteeing their continued eitistence and 
               <br />
               support by means of a clause of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act based upon one of the 
               <br />
               resolutions of the Quebec conference to which 
               <br />
               hc was a consenting party. By their North- 
               <br />
               west Territories Bill the present government 
               <br />
               provide that separate schools may be estab- 
               <br />
               lished in those Territories. The proposal we 
               <br />
               regard as eminently wise, and with the ex- 
               <br />
               perience which he had had, Mr. Brown should 
               <br />
               have been the last man to oppose it. Yet he 
               <br />
               had not only opposed the principle itself, but 
               <br />
               appealed to the British North America Act as 
               <br />
               containing sound legal objections to the course 
               <br />
               proposed to be taken by the government. He 
               <br />
               said: He thought this provision was quite 
               <br />
               contrary to the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               Nothing was more clear than that each pro- 
               <br />
               vince should have absolute control over edu- 
               <br />
               cation. He thought that was the only prin- 
               <br />
               ciple on which this Union Act could continue. 
               <br />
               If the Dominion government interfered with 
               <br />
               local matters We should get into inextricable 
               <br />
               confusion with the provinces. The safe way 
               <br />
               for us was to let each province suit itself in 
               <br />
               such matters. This country was ﬁlled by peo- 
               <br />
               ple oî all classes and creeds, and there would 
               <br />
               be no end of confusion if each class had to 
               <br />
               have its own peculiar school system. It had 
               <br />
               been said this clause was put in for the pro- 
               <br />
               tection of the Protestants against the Catho-
