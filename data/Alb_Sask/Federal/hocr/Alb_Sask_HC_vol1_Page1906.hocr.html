               Let nie ask another question of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend. If there is one thing which ought 
               <br />
               to be held to be a right of the people of the 
               <br />
               province, it is that the French language 
               <br />
               should be used in the debates of the legis— 
               <br />
               lature and in the courts of justice. This 
               <br />
               proposition will not be denied, and in that 
               <br />
               respect the contention of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               (Mr. Monk) cannot be maintained unless he 
               <br />
               can base his claim upon the ground of con- 
               <br />
               stitutional right. True, he has attempted 
               <br />
               to do so, but he has failed in his attempt 
               <br />
               to show that the French people in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories can claim the right of the 
               <br />
               use of their language upon any authority 
               <br />
               in the British North America Act or upon 
               <br />
               any reasons which are to be found in the 
               <br />
               history to which allusion has been made. 
               <br />
               If the French people of the Territories can- 
               <br />
               not claim this right upon any constitutional 
               <br />
               ground, upon what ground can they claim 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'it</span> ? It is perhaps worthy of remark that 
               <br />
               although the French language exists to—day 
               <br />
               as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial,</span> language in the Northwest 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> in the courts of law, if I am cor— 
               <br />
               rectly informed there has not been a single 
               <br />
               document in the French language entered in 
               <br />
               a court of justice there for the last ﬁfteen 
               <br />
               years. nor a single word of French spoken 
               <br />
               in the courts. That is not to be wondered 
               <br />
               at when we remember that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> the popu- 
               <br />
               lation of French origin in the Northwest Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories is almost inﬁnitely small, not more 
               <br />
               than 4 per cent. If the French people in the 
               <br />
               Territories were in the same position to-day 
               <br />
               as they were in 1877 : if there were as many 
               <br />
               who speak the French language as there are 
               <br />
               who speak the English language, then I 
               <br />
               could understand my hon. friend arguing 
               <br />
               from the point of view of utility and senti- 
               <br />
               ment. But. if it be true that according to 
               <br />
               the last census there were altogether 200,000 
               <br />
               people in the Northwest Territories. and 
               <br />
               only 8,000 of them who spoke the French 
               <br />
               language, then I say it cannot be argued in 
               <br />
               the name of justice that they have the right 
               <br />
               to the official use of that language. For my 
               <br />
               part, proud as I am of my French origin, I 
               <br />
               could not, claim in the name of justice and 
               <br />
               fair-play that right, in view of the fact <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂlat</span> 
               <br />
               there is such a small proportion of French— 
               <br />
               speaking people in those Territories. In- 
               <br />
               deed, if we look at the statistics. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> 
               <br />
               would be more justice for the French Gan- 
               <br />
               adians in the state of Massachusetts to 
               <br />
               claim the right to use their language in the 
               <br />
               legislature at Boston, because the number of 
               <br />
               French Canadians in Massachusetts is 
               <br />
               greater in proportion to the total population, 
               <br />
               than is the number of French-speaking peo- 
               <br />
               ple in the Northwest Territories to the total 
               <br />
               population there. In 1877 it was said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that»</span> 
               <br />
               there were as many who spoke the French

               language as there were who spoke the 
               <br />
               English language in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. Thirty years after, in 1890, Mr. 
               <br />
               Dalton McCarthy proposed to abolish the

               <br />
               vote with me on this occasion as he voted 
               <br />
               with me then.

               how he will'vote. What did I vote for on

               that occasion, and what did my hon. friend 
               <br />
               vote for? He voted that the legislature 
               <br />
               should have the power to deal with the 
               <br />

               <br />
               Is my hon. friend to-day less disposed to 
               <br />
               give that power to the new [provinces than 
               <br />
               he was to give it to the legislature of the

               Territories in 1890 ? In 1890 my hon. friend
