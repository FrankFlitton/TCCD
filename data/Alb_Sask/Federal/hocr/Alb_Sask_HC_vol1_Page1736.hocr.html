               <br />
               thought myself I might suggest some ver- 
               <br />
               bal changes. Section 16, with regard to edu-

               <br />

               <br />
               ment of the Act. Then I wanted to have 
               <br />
               section 22 reconsidered, that is the Hudson 
               <br />

               able to the leader of the opposition, I will 
               <br />
               take that up now. Section 22 as it now 
               <br />
               reads contains some words at the end to

               My hon. friend will remember that this 
               <br />
               provision is intended to give effect to an 
               <br />
               agreement made between the imperial au- 
               <br />
               thorities and the Canadian government at 
               <br />
               the time the lands of the Hudson Bay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com«</span> 
               <br />
               pany were acquired. The provision then 
               <br />
               made was that no law would be passed 
               <br />
               which would in any way aﬁeet the condi— 
               <br />
               tions of that agreement. The representatives 
               <br />
               of the Hudson Bay Company say that the 
               <br />
               words to which I have just referred would 
               <br />
               be a change in the agreement, and they ask 
               <br />
               that these words be struck out. I do not 
               <br />
               think that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> affect the Hudson Bay 
               <br />
               Company’s position at all, but as they ob- 
               <br />
               ject to them, and as it is made a condition 
               <br />
               of the transfer by the imperial authorities, 
               <br />
               perhaps we had better adhere strictly to 
               <br />
               the terms of the original agreement. I

               50 of the Revised Statutes in all Acts amended 
               <br />
               thereof, are hereby repeal-ed as respects said

               That, I think, might make unnecessary 
               <br />
               the concluding three lines of the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman's amendment. But I will com- 
               <br />
               municate this section to him, and he may 
               <br />
               see how far it will be necessary to make 
               <br />
               the change. The ﬁrst part of his amend- 
               <br />
               ment meets my View, but the three last lines 
               <br />
               might be unnecessary in view of this new 
               <br />
               clause I have suggested. I intended to add 
               <br />
               another section to clause 15 in respect to 
               <br />
               criminal procedure in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. As my hon. friend is aware, in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories the criminal proced- 
               <br />
               ure differs somewhat from the procedure in 
               <br />
               other parts of the Dominion and in order 
               <br />
               to cover the point I think this proviso may 
               <br />
               be useful. I will consider that also.
