               Manitoba were the most valuable lands in

               idea. Before dealing with the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               side of the question, I would like to say that

               come to the little province of Manitoba and

               examine them for himself. 'Dhe trouble

               sport, let him bring a gun and a good dog.

               year was $454,557.33, which is $15,978.41 less 
               <br />
               than estimated. This amount was deducted on 
               <br />
               account of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inspection</span> of swamp lands, and 
               <br />
               this year there is a further reduction of $6,000 
               <br />
               for the same purpose. I hope this is the last 
               <br />
               we shall see of a reduction on account of 
               <br />
               swamp lands inspection. The costly system 
               <br />
               practiced for the last eight or nine years has 
               <br />
               been done away with, and the selection will be 
               <br />
               done under an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efﬁcient</span> system, which I think 
               <br />
               will result in the selection of the lands at 
               <br />
               one-tenth the cost and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one—tenth</span> the time 
               <br />
               of the old system. I think it is really too bad 
               <br />
               the way the province has been charged in this 
               <br />
               matter, and I inrtend .to make a charge against 
               <br />
               the Dominion government, and I hope the prov- 
               <br />
               ince will be recouped.

               Altogether $86,000 has been deducted as the 
               <br />
               cost of the swamp lands inspection. We have 
               <br />
               been sometimes charged with not living <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Within</span>

               that since 1890, 850,845'52 acres have been

               acres have been actually handed over to the
