               At that time, the school question was 8. 
               <br />
               live issue and was a subject of great anxiety 
               <br />
               for Catholics over the whole world. Look

               into the newspapers of those days. Mr.

               Speaker, and you will ﬁnd the proof of that 
               <br />
               statement. In the United States, in the 
               <br />
               state and the city of New York especially, 
               <br />
               Catholics were energetically vindicating 
               <br />
               their rights. An Oblate priest, the Reverend 
               <br />
               Father Warren, was anathematizing Catho- 
               <br />
               lic parents who sent their children to public 
               <br />
               schools. Those sermons had been comment- 
               <br />
               ed upon in the European, American and 
               <br />
               Canadian press. We were ourselves, in 
               <br />
               Canada, greatly agitated over the New 
               <br />
               Brunswick school legislation of 1871. That 
               <br />
               question had been discussed in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“House</span> 
               <br />
               for three consecutive sessions. It was used 
               <br />
               as a political machine in the prevince of 
               <br />
               Quebec, by the Ultramontane school, by 
               <br />
               Messrs. Langevin, Masson, Baby and Mous- 
               <br />
               seau. The representatives of the people 
               <br />
               felt the necessity of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">putting.</span> an end to 
               <br />
               national and religious strife, if the federal 
               <br />
               system, then at its inception and based on 
               <br />
               good faith, was to be maintained. That is 
               <br />
               why the school legislation relative to the 
               <br />
               Northwest was carried through this House 
               <br />
               post haste. In the Upper House, the Bill 
               <br />
               Was carried by a vote of 24 against 22, on 
               <br />
               an amendment moved by the hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Aikens, exactly to the same effect as that 
               <br />
               of the hon. leader of the opposition. But 
               <br />
               the question was such a burning one, the 
               <br />
               public mind was so deeply agitated over 
               <br />
               the school legislation of New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               and the stand taken by the Hon. George 
               <br />
               Brown was so uncompromising. that such 
               <br />
               legislation could not pass unnoticed by the 
               <br />
               public press.

               In recalling the discussion to which this 
               <br />
               question gave rise thirty years ago, in the 
               <br />
               newspapers, I think I am supplying fresh

               argument in support of this Bill, further 
               <br />
               proof that the Bill et 1875. in the minds of 
               <br />
               its promoters, was to settle the question 
               <br />
               once for all. Then, it should be remembered 
               <br />
               that, at the time, those who had taken an 
               <br />
               active part in bringing about confederation 
               <br />
               were still in public life. Scarcely eight 
               <br />
               years had elapsed since the passing of the 
               <br />
               compact, and the spirit of conciliation 
               <br />
               which inSpired the fathers of confederation 
               <br />
               had not vet completely died away. I shall 
               <br />
               show that the law of 1875 was approved in 
               <br />
               Ontario and in Quebec by the two leading 
               <br />

               one of the most important that has been sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to parliament since the union. We 
               <br />
               take it there is no serious intention of asking 
               <br />
               the House to accept this measure this ses- 
               <br />
               sion. Its importance is so great, that to at- 
               <br />
               tempt to pass it into law at the fag end of a. 
               <br />
               session, when members are impatient to get 
               <br />
               to their homes, and intolerant therefore of de- 
               <br />
               bate, would be a great mistake. But its in- 
               <br />
               troduction has been a wise proceeding, as it 
               <br />
               will give ample time for its fair and full con- 
               <br />
               sideration before another session. The Bill 
               <br />
               seeks to ﬁx the constitution which is to gov- 
               <br />
               ern these vast territories in the future. Sir 
               <br />
               John Macdonald, Without committing himself 
               <br />
               directly to the opinion, expressed some doubts 
               <br />
               as to whether this is a. wise proceeding. His 
               <br />
               suggestion was that it would be better that 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada should keep within 
               <br />
               its control the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">determination</span> in the future of 
               <br />
               the precise form of government suited to these 
               <br />
               Territories as they became more developed, 
               <br />
               and as population ﬂowed into them. There is 
               <br />
               doubtless some force in the view, but upon 
               <br />
               consideration it will be found, we think, Mr. 
               <br />
               Mackenzie has adopted the wise course. Look- 
               <br />

               the Northwest there can be little doubt of the 
               <br />
               importance of having the character of the in-
