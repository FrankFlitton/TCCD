               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. What do these

               <br />
               gest that there is something behind? They 
               <br />
               seek to prove their case by the words of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Apostolic</span> delegate, and I give them his 
               <br />
               words making clear his own meaning. It 
               <br />
               would be, politically expedient. Why? On 
               <br />
               account of any action to be taken here? 
               <br />
               No, but because the people in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories who were aiïected would 
               <br />
               have no objection to be taken into the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba. That is all there is in 
               <br />
               the matter. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yet,</span> in the face of a statement 
               <br />
               so obvious as this, you have the leader of a 
               <br />
               great party doing his best to show that 
               <br />
               there was something hidden on the par-t of 
               <br />
               the government of Canada in this matter. 
               <br />
               A few moments ago my hon. friend said 
               <br />
               that we would ﬁght this question out else- 
               <br />
               where. I accept that challenge without any 
               <br />
               qualification. We will light out this ques- 
               <br />
               tion in this House. We will ﬁght it out else- 
               <br />
               where. We will ﬁght it out on the' charge 
               <br />
               that hon. gentlemen opposite have brought 
               <br />
               to the attention of the House. I have no 
               <br />
               fear about the result. This is not the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time</span> in the thirty years of my experience 
               <br />
               that I have seen the Tory party playing 
               <br />
               this part of endeavouring to arouse the pre- 
               <br />
               judices of the people. We shall meet again 
               <br />
               and shall discuss this question elsewhere. 
               <br />
               In the meantime, I accept the challenge of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend that we are responsible to 
               <br />
               the people; and that responsibility we shall 
               <br />
               not decline, but shall meet it in due time.

               was going to bring this new and unheard-of 
               <br />
               and unexpected question before the House.

               And this great, strong man of battle for 
               <br />
               thirty years endeavoured to make a little

               cheap capital against my hon. friend the

               <br />
               a want of courtesy. But, as he thinks it

               over the right hon. gentleman will remember

               that yesterday my hon. friend the leader of

               the opposition gave notice that he would 
               <br />
               again discuss this matter. And the reason 
               <br />
               he did not so fully discuss it yesterday was 
               <br />
               that there had been no word uttered by 
               <br />

               there was very much in that matter of lack

               such pains to deny yesterday. He took

               great pains to deny absolutely and categori-

               gether of secondary importance. For in- 
               <br />
               stance he made a point against the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers because he said that they had 
               <br />
               not been invited on the initiative of the Do- 
               <br />

               <br />
               in Ottawa with reference to the extension 
               <br />
               or the boundaries. Neither did Mr. Rogers’ 
               <br />
               statement declare that the invitation was on 
               <br />
               the initiative of the Dominion government. 
               <br />
               It might have been implied from that letter 
               <br />
               that it was or it might not, but in all con— 
               <br />
               science what difference did it make whether 
               <br />
               the invitation went from my right hon.

               <br />

               facts of the case go what difference did it 
               <br />
               make ‘? Butthere was a very authoritative, 
               <br />
               a very absolute and a very much cheered

               that ﬁrst statement made by Mr. Rogers.

               He thought he had triumphantly ﬂoored his
