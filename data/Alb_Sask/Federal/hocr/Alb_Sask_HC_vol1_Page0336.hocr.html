               <br />
               section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">](‘î</span> preserves, in my opinion. What we 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics hold as part of our relig— 
               <br />
               ious faith—religious instruction in the 
               <br />
               Schools. 1 need not say that I am a believer 
               <br />
               in that doctrine, that I am in that respect, 
               <br />
               altogether at one with the church to which 
               <br />
               I belong. And it is a gratiﬁcation to me 
               <br />
               to know, and I feel fortified to know, that 
               <br />
               there are many great men, not only in this 
               <br />
               country, but in the mother country and 
               <br />
               elsewhere, not professing the religion to 
               <br />
               which I am attached, who also believe in 
               <br />
               the necessity of religious instruction in the 
               <br />
               Schools. I say that section 16 is altogether 
               <br />
               justified under the letter and spirit of our 
               <br />
               constitution. I say also, and I shall en- 
               <br />
               deavour to demonstrate it, that, on grounds 
               <br />
               of highest public policy, the enactment of 
               <br />
               section 16 is altogether expedient and is 
               <br />
               rendered absolutely necessary. We know 
               <br />
               the rights which are preserved by section 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">115.</span> If separate schools are allowed, I care 
               <br />
               not whether they are called denominational 
               <br />
               schools or whatever name may be given to 
               <br />
               them. To my mind there is nothing in 
               <br />
               the name, or very little—it is altogether in 
               <br />
               the principle, a principle which is sanction- 
               <br />
               ed, admitted, and perpetuated by section 16, 
               <br />
               insisting on the right or privilege of the 
               <br />
               minority to give religious instruction in the

               1901 which have been passed pursuant to 
               <br />
               that statute. My hon. friend the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition devoted a large portion of 
               <br />
               his speech to demonstrate as a legal pro- 
               <br />
               position that the statute of 1875 could at 
               <br />
               any time have been repealed and that it 
               <br />
               could be repealed to-day. He cited the 
               <br />
               authority of Sir John Thompson and others 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">support</span> of that contention. I do not 
               <br />
               think that any lawyer will dispute that. 
               <br />
               It is quite clear and must be clear to any 
               <br />
               lawyer that the Act of 1875 could have been 
               <br />
               repealed and that it could be repealed now 
               <br />
               at this very moment. But, Sir, it has not 
               <br />
               been repealed. It is in existence to-day. 
               <br />
               The ordinances which have been made in 
               <br />
               pursuance of that statute are in existence

               <br />

               <br />
               The'word ‘province‘ in section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">H:;</span> means 
               <br />
               the province, not before. but the province
