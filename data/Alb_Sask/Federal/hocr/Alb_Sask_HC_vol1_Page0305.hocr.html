               The Minister of Finance wants it to be 
               <br />
               known that when he talks about this mat-

               ter he discusses it from the point of view 
               <br />
               of common sense. But the Postmaster Gen- 
               <br />
               eral takes a higher ground. He sets him- 
               <br />
               self up on the pedestal of a statesman and 
               <br />
               tells us that he looks at this matter from 
               <br />
               a statesmanlike point of view and wants 
               <br />
               to have the question settled in a statesman- 
               <br />
               like way and not in a legal way. He evi- 
               <br />
               dently does not believe that legality and 
               <br />
               statesmanship ought to go hand in hand in 
               <br />
               any properly constituted country, but he 
               <br />
               will no doubt ﬁnd that if the pE‘Ople can 
               <br />
               only have a chance to see that their wishes 
               <br />
               are fulﬁlled, these two essentials will be

               another as the Postmaster General thinks 
               <br />
               they ought to be. Well, this statesmanlike 
               <br />
               Postmaster General or postmaster-general— 
               <br />
               like statesman—you can put it either way 
               <br />
               you like—says that because the British North

               tween different provinces, therefore the 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament has the right to 
               <br />
               change that Act as it pleases. I am not 
               <br />
               quite sure whether the Postmaster General 
               <br />
               ' is not labouring under the delusion that he 
               <br />
               is really in London, England, tO-day, and 
               <br />
               not in Ottawa, because he does not seem 
               <br />
               able to distinguish between the powers of 
               <br />
               the Dominion parliament and the imperial 
               <br />
               parliament. But he cannot produce, nor

               <br />
               though they be—produce any Act of the 
               <br />
               Dominion which has ever undertaken to say 
               <br />
               that the British North America Act shall

               mean something different to what it really 
               <br />

               <br />
               Bill new before us is the ﬁrst measure in 
               <br />
               which any attempt was ever made 
               <br />
               by the Dominion parliament to change 
               <br />
               the wording and the meaning of an Impe- 
               <br />
               rial Act. Not a single Act of a Dominion 
               <br />
               parliament has even been drawn which. has 
               <br />
               undertaken to say that the British North 
               <br />
               America Act shall be read as containing 
               <br />
               language <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> from what it really does 
               <br />
               contain. Surely the First Minister must 
               <br />
               have known that the British North Amer— 
               <br />
               ica Act did not give him the right to impose 
               <br />
               these restrictions on these provinces about 
               <br />

               undertaken by this measure to amend the 
               <br />
               Act of Confederation. No hon. gentleman

               America Act shall be taken to mean other 
               <br />
               words or something else diiferent entirely 
               <br />
               from what they express. When we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               the First Minister declaring that what he 
               <br />
               is about to do, he could only do under the 
               <br />
               authority given him by the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, and then resorting to the 
               <br />
               expedient of changing the language of that 
               <br />
               very Act which gives him the authority, 
               <br />
               his case is a very doubtful one indeed. It 
               <br />
               really amounts to this that he is interfering 
               <br />
               with the document which the other man 
               <br />
               signed. One man gives another a power 
               <br />
               of attorney. The question then comes up 
               <br />
               whether that power of attorney gives the 
               <br />
               right to do certain things, and in order to 
               <br />
               remove any doubt or diﬂiculty the attorney 
               <br />
               says: I will take my pen and change the 
               <br />
               language of the document, and then I Will 
               <br />
