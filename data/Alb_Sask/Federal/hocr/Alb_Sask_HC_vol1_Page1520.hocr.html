               about a minute or two to get in his ques—

               tion. Do I understand the matter right if 
               <br />
               I state it this way ? Under the Act of 1875, 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholics if they were a ma-

               <br />
               If they were a minority they had a right 
               <br />
               to have a school as laid down in the law. 
               <br />
               Now, under section 16. No. 1, these two 
               <br />
               rights are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perpetuated</span> But clause 16, No.

               minority the right they had under the Act 
               <br />

               the Galician, or Hungarian or Polish ma-

               <br />
               The majority might put in incompetent

               is a wide power. The Mormon majority in

               <br />
               under this clause, always subservient to and 
               <br />
               determined by the general laws, rules and 
               <br />
               regulations which establish and perpetuate 
               <br />
               the school system. That is the point that 
               <br />
               puzzles me as a layman. If that is the inter- 
               <br />
               pretation, namely, that such schools ‘ as they 
               <br />
               think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tilt’</span> refer to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\the</span> matters of quality, 
               <br />
               discipline, order and everything which is 
               <br />
               taught in them, you would reduce the whole 
               <br />
               matter to an absurdity. So it seems to me 
               <br />
               the common sense principle of interpretation 
               <br />
               is not in respect of quality, but in re- 
               <br />
               spect of what I have spoken about in regard 
               <br />
               to the question of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘schools.</span> ,Now does the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice think that if the Poles 
               <br />
               were in a majority, that under the Act of 
               <br />
               1875, and that law still has power, they 
               <br />
               could by a majority erect and establish such 
               <br />
               a school ‘as they think ﬁt,’ saying that it 
               <br />
               shall be taught by a Polish teacher, who 
               <br />
               need not have a diploma, who need not have 
               <br />
               attended a normal school, who need not 
               <br />
               teach more than two hours a day, who need 
               <br />
               not do any of these things, and yet that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> 
               <br />
               could avail themselves of the privileges of 
               <br />
               pay which go along with the erection and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conduct</span> of a school, and be a part of the 
               <br />
               system which is in vogue ? Does he «think 
               <br />
               they can do that ? He does not, I do not 
               <br />
               think he can, then I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«think</span> he will have to 
               <br />
               modify his interpretation of the phrase ‘ such 
               <br />
               a school as they think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁt?</span> That is the prac- 
               <br />
               tical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulty</span> that suggsets itself to my 
               <br />
               mind. But legal interpretations are some- 
               <br />
               times wonderful things, and I do not know 
               <br />
               whether I am right or wrong. But I think 
               <br />
               mine is the common sense opinion.
