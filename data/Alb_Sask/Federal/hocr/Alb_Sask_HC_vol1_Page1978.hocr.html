               I now ask the House to consider the in- 
               <br />
               trinsic merits of this question. There is a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railway</span> mileage involved in the two provin- 
               <br />
               ces of 750 miles, with six divisional points. 
               <br />
               Assume that this has a taxable value of 
               <br />
               $100,000 for each three miles—and it is 
               <br />
               stocked and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bonded</span> for $193,500 for each 
               <br />
               three miles—and you have a total taxable 
               <br />
               value of $25,000,000 to-day. A tax of 5mills 
               <br />
               on the dollar—which is only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> of 1 per cent, 
               <br />
               would amount to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$125,000</span> per annum. But 
               <br />
               it is not particularly for to-day or for the 
               <br />
               immediate future that we are concerned. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Today</span> it is the custom at least in the newer 
               <br />
               parts of the country, to give aid to railways 
               <br />
               'ather than to levy taxation upon them. It 
               <br />
               is to the future that we have to look. If 
               <br />
               that property is worth .. 25,000,000 to—day. it 
               <br />
               will be \vorth——everybody will admit—some 
               <br />
               day, $100,000,000. While it is not our policy 
               <br />
               to tax railways <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> yet when more stable 
               <br />
               conditions come and the country is more 
               <br />
               fully developed it will be fair that railway 
               <br />
               properties equally with the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">properties</span> 
               <br />
               shall contribute toward the cost of school, 
               <br />
               municipal and general government. I say 
               <br />
               that the loss involved to these two new 
               <br />
               provinces if they should be subjected to 
               <br />
               perpetual inability to tax this property is a 
               <br />
               loss simply beyond calculation. The ex- 
               <br />
               emption of the land is the least momen-

               <br />
               is still serious enough. I will give the House
