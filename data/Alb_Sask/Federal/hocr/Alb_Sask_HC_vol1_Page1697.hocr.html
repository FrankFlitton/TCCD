               Prime Minister also takes the post oﬂice as 
               <br />
               an indication. To show the absurdity of that

               contention it is only necessary to quote the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               last, is one of the arguments why they 
               <br />
               are giving more representation to the north 
               <br />
               than to the south, and they want to give two

               <br />
               That shows how absurd their contention is,

               to say nothing at all of the political pull that

               why ? The Prime Minister explains why. 
               <br />
               In his speech, on page 8006, he says :

               something of that character. If they are

               Now 
               <br />
               we have at the present time six members 
               <br />

               <br />
               redistribution made in this House in 1903. 
               <br />
               There are six members of the local territorial 
               <br />
               assembly north of township 38, and there are 
               <br />
               nine south of that line. Now why is this 
               <br />
               proportion disturbed ? Not because there 
               <br />
               has been a greater inﬂux of population north. 
               <br />
               because there has not been; and if there 
               <br />
               has not been a greater inﬂux north of town- 
               <br />
               ship 38. why then has this proportion been 
               <br />
               disturbed? And yet, owing to the fact that 
               <br />
               there are only six seats north and nine south, 
               <br />
               we should have a larger number given to the 
               <br />
               south. The population has gone in since the 
               <br />
               redistribution was made by this government, 
               <br />
               and notwithstanding this large population 
               <br />
               that is in the south in excess of that in the 
               <br />
