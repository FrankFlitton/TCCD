               tions were intended to be in favour of a 
               <br />

               <br />
               the fact that he did not take that resolution 
               <br />
               some eight years ago, in 1896 or 1897, when 
               <br />
               we were informed by a ﬂourish of trumpets 
               <br />
               that a newpolicy was to be introduced, that 
               <br />
               business was to be done on business prin- 
               <br />
               ciples, that the minister of each department 
               <br />
               was to have a wide range of freedom and 
               <br />
               be responsible for the work of his depart-

               <br />
               time, I think a fair examination of the re- 
               <br />
               cords will show that this country has lost 
               <br />
               hundreds of thousands of dollars by the 
               <br />
               fatal mistake of dissolving the bond of

               <br />
               but in hundreds of instances. In fact, it

               has been raised to the standard of the usual 
               <br />
               and common in some of the departments

               all the ministers attached to it by their 
               <br />
               authorization. My right hon. friend is per- 
               <br />
               fectly right in saying that Mr. Robinette or 
               <br />
               any other party worker has a perfect right 
               <br />
               to attach himself to a company and to 
               <br />
               tender for public works. So he has, but if 
               <br />
               there is any strong party friend joined to 
               <br />
               a concern, corporation or otherwise, who 
               <br />
               outside of public tender privately solicits 
               <br />
               work from a department or from the 
               <br />
               government, the very fact that such a per- 
               <br />
               son is attached to it, and the implication 
               <br />
               that favours might be done for him, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should»</span> 
               <br />
               make the government all the stronger in 
               <br />
               insisting on legality being observed and pub- 
               <br />
               lic tenders being called for. It is impossible 
               <br />
               to take too much care in the matter of the 
               <br />
               expenditures of public money, and if there 
               <br />
               is one thing that this government has been 
               <br />
               lax in since 1897, it has been in not taking 
               <br />
               proper care in the expenditure of public 
               <br />
               money. What came up today and what 
               <br />
               came up yesterday and the day before, and 
               <br />
               What will probably cime up almost every 
               <br />
               day so long as we remain in session, will be 
               <br />
               instances of this same utter carelessness as 
               <br />
               to what the law lays down, or what the 
               <br />
               proper practice of parliament has been and 
               <br />
               ought to be, taking economy and honesty 
               <br />
               of the expenditures into account. I am 
               <br />
               glad that the Prime Minister, after eight 
               <br />
               years, has had the lesson so thoroughly 
               <br />
               pressed upon him that he has made the re— 
               <br />
               solve to limit these free colts in the separ- 
               <br />
               ate departments, to put a bridle upon them, 
               <br />
               and to teach them that the collective wis- 
               <br />
               dom of the whole cabinet is a wise check 
               <br />
               upon the individual wisdom of each member 
               <br />
               in charge of a department. I do not see 
               <br />
               how ministerial responsibility and the proper 
               <br />
               expenditure of public money can be carried 
               <br />
               on without that. So long as the First Min- 
               <br />
               ister persists in his new plan, new to the 
               <br />
