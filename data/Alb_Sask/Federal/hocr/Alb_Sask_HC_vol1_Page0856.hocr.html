               inlons, but it occurred to me that it might 
               <br />
               relieve to a large extent the impression 
               <br />
               which exists in the province of Ontario as 
               <br />
               to the nature of the schools which we pro- 
               <br />
               pose by this Bill to perpetuate in the west. 
               <br />
               For days and weeks some of the members 
               <br />
               of this House, assisted by a section of the 
               <br />
               public press, have delayed the despatch of 
               <br />
               public business, and are promoting an in- 
               <br />
               jurious agitation throughout the Dominion 
               <br />
               over this educational question, and why ? 
               <br />
               What prompts them to do it? Surely it 
               <br />
               cannot be anything else but the knowledge 
               <br />
               that in the past discussions on matters of 
               <br />
               this kind stirred up ill-feeling in this coun- 
               <br />
               try have stirred up sectarian strife and com- 
               <br />
               motion and that the stirring up of strife 
               <br />
               and commotion may bring about political 
               <br />
               results unobtainable by methods more hon- 
               <br />
               ourable and more patriotic. In the main 
               <br />
               this commotion has been conﬁned to the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario. I do not know that 
               <br />
               that should afford me, coming from that 
               <br />
               province, any very great satisfaction; 
               <br />
               rather the reverse, but it is quite true that 
               <br />
               this commotion has been conﬁned to On- 
               <br />
               tario and to one section of Ontario. It 
               <br />
               is also a fact that the head and front of 
               <br />
               this agitation is the newspaper press of 
               <br />
               the city of Toronto, and this very fact may 
               <br />
               induce hon. gentlemen here coming from 
               <br />
               other provinces in the Dominion to conclude 
               <br />
               that the population of Ontario as a whole is 
               <br />
               convulsed over this matter and that the 
               <br />
               people ot“ Ontario are sitting up all night 
               <br />
               devising ways and means of combatting 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation.</span> By no means. Let me 
               <br />
               assure my fellow-members from other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces that such is not the case. The only 
               <br />
               part of our population in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario that is really excited over these Bills 
               <br />
               is the city of Toronto. Toronto newspaper- 
               <br />
               doin particularily is working overtime in the 
               <br />
               eﬁort to create and fan into ﬂame those 
               <br />
               slumbering passions that it might be well to 
               <br />
               let lie. But, let me assure my hon. friends, 
               <br />
               and particularly my hon. friends from the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec, that Toronto is not On- 
               <br />
               tario and that the voice of Toronto is not the 
               <br />
               voice of Ontario. It has been said in times 
               <br />
               of crises that Paris was accustomed to speak 
               <br />
               for all France. Toronto has no such au- 
               <br />
               thority to speak for the province of Ontario. 
               <br />
               We of the province of Ontario, let me say, 
               <br />
               are profoundly thankful too that such is 
               <br />
               the case. Let me assure my hon. friends 
               <br />
               from the province of Quebec and from the 
               <br />
               maritime provinces that there is a large 
               <br />
               silent, solid section of the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario, particularly in the rural parts, who 
               <br />
               are not of the mind of Toronto in this mat- 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matters</span> too. I say from positive knowledge 
               <br />
               having visited several parts of Ontario 
               <br />
               since this trouble, if I may so term it, began,

               our Toronto press—have come to the con- 
               <br />
