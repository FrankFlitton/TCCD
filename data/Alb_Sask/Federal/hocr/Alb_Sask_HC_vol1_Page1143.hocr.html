               Now, I ask, was this accidental? I say no. 
               <br />
               That Act was contested and scrutinized in 
               <br />
               every line. If I recollect aright the British 
               <br />
               North America Bill was printed ﬁve times, 
               <br />
               and on every occasion it was thoroughly scru- 
               <br />
               tinized and contested. There were men on 
               <br />
               both sides of the question. Quebec was 
               <br />
               strongly represented by men who had the 
               <br />
               interest of separate schools at heart. I 
               <br />
               think it is not too much to say that those 
               <br />
               gentlemen would have given a very careful 
               <br />
               attention to everything that might possibly 
               <br />
               alfect the rights of their friends in the 
               <br />
               Territories; and yet, with all that care 
               <br />
               and oversight, there is not one word put in 
               <br />
               section 93 or its subsections relating <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tovil‘er-</span> 
               <br />
               ritories; and why ? For the very reason, 
               <br />
               the principle, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> runs through <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> whole 
               <br />
               of section 93 and its subciauses; because a 
               <br />
               territory has no representative; it has no 
               <br />
               power; it could not bind itself. A province 
               <br />
               could pass laws and could repeal or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alter</span> the 
               <br />
               laws, but they wanted to lay down the rule 
               <br />
               that a province having once given privileges 
               <br />
               in the nature of separate schools or re- 
               <br />
               ligious education, should be debarred from 
               <br />
               ever withdrawing them, or, where they had 
               <br />
               the power of repeal, as in some cases they 
               <br />
               had, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.to</span> repeal, or almendment, the pri- 
               <br />
               vileges so granted should be affected, 
               <br />
               or if by any act of authority, they 
               <br />
               should be affected, then in such cases 
               <br />
               the Dominion should have the power 
               <br />
               to grant remedial laws. But no such 
               <br />
               application of the principle is made to a 
               <br />
               territory or to anything that occurs during 
               <br />
               the territorial period. There is no pretense 
               <br />
               from ﬁrst to last that anything done on 
               <br />
               behalf of a territory by the Dominion shall 
               <br />
               bind it when it becomes a province. There 
               <br />
               is an absolute exclusion of everything re- 
               <br />

               <br />
               93 and its snbclauses. But it is quite 
               <br />
               clear to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\my</span> mind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the moment any pro-

               be that under the conditions only one of the

               I think it may be useful, even after all the 
               <br />
               discussion we have had, if I should refer to 
               <br />
               the circumstances in which the several pro—

               and how this clause 93 and its subclauses 
               <br />
               affected them. The four original provinces 
               <br />
               in confederation were the two Canadas, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">A</span> and New Brunswick and Nova Sco- 
               <br />
               tia. Ontario and Quebec (the two Can- 
               <br />
               adas) were in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> position from

               any other. Both those provinces had,

               tablished separate schools. It was therefore 
               <br />
               considered right and just that those who had 
               <br />
