               In 1875, when the Dominion parliament 
               <br />
               passed the Northwest Territories Act. 
               <br />
               was provided that the minorities, whether 
               <br />
               Catholic or Protestant, would have the right 
               <br />
               to establish separate schools and would not 
               <br />
               be called upon to pay taxes for any others 
               <br />
               but such schools. That was the only pro- 
               <br />
               vision contained in that Act. In 1884, the 
               <br />
               legislature organized a system of education, 
               <br />
               similar, or almost similar, to that of the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec, and comprising, more 
               <br />
               particularly, a council divided into two 
               <br />
               boards, the one Catholic and the other Pro- 
               <br />
               testant. In 1888, the ordinances of 1884 were 
               <br />
               consolidated by the legislature. 
               <br />

               However, in 1892. these ordinances of 
               <br />
               1884-88, were repealed by the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories legislature. The council of edu— 
               <br />
               cation was to be no longer divided into a 
               <br />
               Catholic and Protestant board, and was re- 
               <br />
               duced to the mere rank of a consulting 
               <br />
               body. The new ordinance provided at the

               same time that teaching in the said schools 
               <br />

               <br />
               1 of section 83 provided that school com-

               missioners might have elementary courses 
               <br />
               taught in the French language. Catholics 
               <br />
               endeavoured to have that ordinance dis- 
               <br />
               allowed by the Dominion government. who 
               <br />
               had authority to do so ; however, the latter, 
               <br />
               by Order in Council dated February 5th, 
               <br />
               1894, on the recommendation of Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson, then Prime Minister and Minis-

               <br />
               ordinances of 1892 and 1893. Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson’s recommendation stated that the 
               <br />
               facts brought to the knowledge of the Gov- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ‘rant the disallowance of these ordinances.

               The latter provided that the council of edu-

               cation would no longer be divided into two 
               <br />
               boards and put the whole school system 
               <br />
               under the control of a single member of the

               wan and that of Alberta. These two Bills
