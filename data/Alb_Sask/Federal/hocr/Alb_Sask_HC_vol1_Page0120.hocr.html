               We should be prepared to listen to all that 
               <br />
               may be said and to make an honest effort

               to meet the views of those who differ from 
               <br />
               us in opinion. We should aim as far .as

               possible to have a system brought

               <br />
               the principle of separate schools. I regret 
               <br />
               that such a large number of my fellow 
               <br />
               citizens in Canada are obliged to take the 
               <br />
               view, conscientiously as they say and as I 
               <br />
               believe, that they cannot support a system 
               <br />
               of free common schools. I think it would be 
               <br />
               a great thing for our country if in the 
               <br />
               growth that is now coming so rapidly upon 
               <br />
               us, our children of all races and sections and 
               <br />
               creeds could meet from day to day and 
               <br />

               <br />
               we could happily agree upon such a policy it 
               <br />
               would do much for the grander upbuilding 
               <br />
               of the country of which we are so proud. I

               things as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they,</span> are. We have to recognize

               on that question; do not think as the 
               <br />
               majority of Protestants think. What then? 
               <br />
               Shall we say that they are in the minority 
               <br />

               cent, and therefore, we will be indifferent _to 
               <br />
               them ? No, Mr. Speaker, you cannot govern 
               <br />
               Canada by any such rule as that. Let us 
               <br />
               remember that the Roman Catholics are 
               <br />
               not in a minority everywhere; there is 
               <br />
               one great province in whichour Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic brethren are in the majority, 
               <br />
               overwhelmingly in the majority. Suppose 
               <br />
               we insisted upon this doctrine of pro-

               as was argued to—night, what would be the 
               <br />
               condition of our Protestant brethren in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec? Suppose that un-

               my hon. friend the Prime Minister has 
               <br />
               shown, in preparing the constitution of con-

               nority elsewhere should ask to receive con—

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There are three great lines of thought to— 
               <br />
               day on the question of public education. 
               <br />
               One, held by a great many people, is that 
               <br />
               the secular system of education is the only 
               <br />
               system which we should have in the public 
               <br />
               schools. There are many people, altogether 
               <br />
               Protestants I think, who claim that it is 
               <br />
               useless to introduce anything like religion 
               <br />
               into the schools, and that all we can do is 
               <br />
               to devote ourselves to secular education. 
               <br />
               The second line of thought is that which is 
               <br />
               held by a large number of the advocates 
               <br />
               of what may be called national schools. 
               <br />
               These people think that with secular edu- 
               <br />
               cation you may associate a certain degree 
               <br />
               of what may be properly called religious 
               <br />
               instruction; that you may say to the 
               <br />
               teacher: thou shalt not teach the ‘isms’ 
               <br />
               of any denomination, but you may and you 
               <br />

               Well, Mr. Speaker, if under a system of

               the very best kind of religion. However that 
               <br />
