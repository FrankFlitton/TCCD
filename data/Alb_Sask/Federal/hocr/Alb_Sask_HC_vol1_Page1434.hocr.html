               of dealing with the cash on hand that the

               <br />
               gory. If our contention on the subject is 
               <br />
               correct the absolute power to legislate, 
               <br />
               even when they do wrong in reference to

               property is given to the province after we

               constitute a province, and my contention is 
               <br />
               that under the British North America Act 
               <br />
               —although this differs entirely from the 
               <br />
               opinion of the Minister of Justice—they 
               <br />
               have the right to grant a province any 
               <br />
               power to legislate which they like under 
               <br />
               the Imperial Act of 1871. My contention 
               <br />
               is that when we constitute a province all 
               <br />
               jurisdiction over civil rights and property 
               <br />
               goes to the province, and that notwithstand- 
               <br />
               ing the contract made by the Dominion

               was that certain rights were guaranteed 
               <br />
               to the company. Now, in my judgment to 
               <br />
               permit these provinces to violate the con- 
               <br />
               ditions of that deed would be absolutely as

               Mr. HAGGART. There is no doubt 
               <br />
               about that ; that does not enter into my ar- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gument.</span> at all. If they repudiate they do 
               <br />
               wrong, as for instance, if the province 
               <br />
               would choose to tax lands exempt under 
               <br />
               an agreement between the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway and the Dominion authority. I 
               <br />
               am only talking about the point that when 
               <br />
               you constitute a province with full power 
               <br />
               they have all the jurisdiction over all the 
               <br />
               civil property, and as Mr. Blake said speak- ' 
               <br />
               ing upon this subject before they have as- 
               <br />
               sumed the toga virilis they are full grown 
               <br />
               and they have the right to do wrong if 
               <br />
               they like; the power is with them and no 
               <br />
               exemption made by any legislation that we 
               <br />
               pass here will have weight with the pro- 
               <br />
               vince to which we grant autonomy as they 
               <br />
               have full authority over civil rights and 
               <br />
               property.

               Mr. LANCASTER. With regard to what 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has just said I think he 
               <br />
               is justiﬁed. I believe speaking for myself 
               <br />
               that the province would be doing wrong it 
               <br />
               it repudiated that contract, but I do not know 
               <br />
               if the Minister of Justice has considered it 
               <br />
               in this view. At the time when that bargain 
               <br />
               was made. the other contracting party, be it 
               <br />
               the Hudson Bay Company, the railway com-
