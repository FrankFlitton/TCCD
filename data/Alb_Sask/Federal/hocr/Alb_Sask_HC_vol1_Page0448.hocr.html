               the British North America Act were binding 
               <br />
               on Prince Edward Island (when it was 
               <br />
               coming in, or on British Columbia when 
               <br />
               it came in ? Nothing of the kind. They 
               <br />
               could make such provisions as they thought 
               <br />
               proper, and is it not right, when it is only 
               <br />
               this parliament that has the responsibility 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today—for</span> there is no provision by which 
               <br />
               an address can come from the Territories. 
               <br />
               so that this is a one-sided negotiation, so to 
               <br />
               speak, and we take the full responsibility 
               <br />
               in this House for what this constitution 
               <br />
               will be—that we should be told that the 
               <br />
               constitution that would not stand in the 
               <br />
               way of the admission of New Brunswick or 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island, or any other pro- 
               <br />
               vince, into confederation, must prevent us 
               <br />
               from making such terms and stipulations as 
               <br />
               we think are proper and right in bringing in 
               <br />
               new provinces from the west. I do not think 
               <br />
               that, as the leader of the opposition himself 
               <br />
               would say, it is either law or logic or sound 
               <br />
               argument to say that we have not as free 
               <br />
               a hand in making a province under the 
               <br />
               terms of the Act as we would have under 
               <br />
               the conditions which we could place in an 
               <br />
               Order in Council and man address from an 
               <br />
               existing provincial entity. I submit. Mr.
