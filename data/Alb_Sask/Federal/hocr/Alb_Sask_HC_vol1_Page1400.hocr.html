               Mr. PATERSON. Evidently we had not

               an opportunity of testing it there, but we 
               <br />

               said in reference to Mountain would be 
               <br />
               found in the district of Edmonton. But it 
               <br />
               appears they were not found there and that 
               <br />
               is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[place</span> we should have found them.

               <br />
               is no use of trying to minimize the result 
               <br />
               of this election. There was a great desire

               Mr. SPROULE. I just wish to say a few

               words in reply to the hon. gentleman (Mr.

               that. Perhaps it is. At any rate I choose

               to say something in reply to him as well

               siring to abuse the people of Edmonton, 
               <br />
               and to say that in my judgment there was 
               <br />
               not one word said in reference to the peo-
