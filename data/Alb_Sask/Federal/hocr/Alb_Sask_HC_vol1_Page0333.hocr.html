               words he uttered, is entirely opposed to the

               My hon. friend from Peel (Mr. Blain), in

               from Peel forgot one thing, however, when 
               <br />
               he spoke of the generosity of Ontario, he 
               <br />

               generosity of the Conservatives of Ontario. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend said that only lately there 
               <br />
               was an election in the province of Ontario, 
               <br />
               and the Prime Minister of the day had said 
               <br />
               that if he came into power he would see 
               <br />
               that every nationality and creed would be 
               <br />
               represented in his government. What did

               he do when called on to form an adminis-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saying</span> this to show that the Conservative

               party has traditions of which it may well 
               <br />
               be proud, and that it stands by those tra- 
               <br />
               ditions. _There may be in our party some 
               <br />
               gentlemen who have ideas different from 
               <br />
               the others. but the party as a whole has 
               <br />
               a history of which it may well be proud. 
               <br />
               We cannot say the same of the other party. 
               <br />
               We know that if hon. gentlemen opposite

               have stood upon any platform in the past, 
               <br />
               it has been only to get into power. ’i‘heir 
               <br />
               traditions are all new; they have never 
               <br />
               been in use yet. In 1896. the Liberal party

               dangerous questions, national or religious, 
               <br />

               Something has been said, unfortunately,

               been written in the papers against the

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> on both sides, and I was proud

               that creed speaking of the hierarchy in most

               eulogistic terms. Let me say that. although 
               <br />
               we have had this measure before the House 
               <br />
               for over a month, I have never received a 
               <br />
               letter or word of communication of 
               <br />
               any kind regarding il. from any bishop 
               <br />
               or priest, and I know a great many. 
               <br />
               What does that prove? It shows,

               not that the Catholic clergy are not 
               <br />
               interested, but that they have too much deli- 
               <br />
               cacy and too much sense of their own dig—

               to do so, to advise a member of parliament 
               <br />
               as to what course he should follow. Our 
               <br />

               <br />
               if my remarks have been long and tedious. 
               <br />
               it is because I wish to put on record in

               ‘Hansard’ what I consider necessary to

               enable them to know who are those by

               whom they have been deceived. We have
