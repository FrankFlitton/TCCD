               East Assiniboia (Mr. Turrift), <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then</span> a member

               administration that everything that had to

               do with education should be shut out of the

               <br />
               hand with the matter of education. In 
               <br />
               view of that point, 1 think that hardly all

               <br />

               <br />
               the prayer of the petitions had been granted, 
               <br />
               I think these gentlemen would have been 
               <br />
               in nearly the same position as the amend- 
               <br />
               ment of the leader of the opposition would 
               <br />
               place them in. Apparently, their opinions 
               <br />
               have changed. But it did not stop at the 
               <br />
               point I have indicated. In the following 
               <br />
               session of the legislative assembly, they 
               <br />
               repeated their prayer. And the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Edmonton and the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Assiniboia supported that contention, 
               <br />
               that education should be left entirely to the 
               <br />
               provinces. Now, apparently, they have 
               <br />
               changed their mind as they did with regard 
               <br />
               to the land policy. Now. Mr. Speaker, in 
               <br />
               proceeding to discuss these educational 
               <br />
               clauses of these Bills, I cannot say that I 
               <br />
               shall be able to show, but shall contend, 
               <br />
               that the amendments presented ‘to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this!</span> 
               <br />
               House to-day do not differ in the slightest

               the amendment and the original Bill let

               What followed the passage of this law ? 
               <br />
               There was established in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories a. complete dual system of schools.

               This system went on for some time in the 
               <br />
               Territories. and then the legislature began to 
               <br />
               interfere and to curtail the privileges of the 
               <br />
               separate schools. This curtailment proceeded 
               <br />
               from time to time until the year 1892 when 
               <br />
               what was known as the dual system was entirely 
               <br />
               swept away and that system which we have in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, substantially as we 
               <br />
               have at present, was established.

               So there is a vast difference in the views 
               <br />
               taken by the right hon. the First Minister 
               <br />
               and the member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton). 
               <br />
               There is a vast difference between the rights 
               <br />
               conferred under the Act of 1875 and under 
               <br />
               the ordinances according to the member for 
               <br />
               Brandon. The hon. member for Brandon 
               <br />
               has compared these rights and further says 
               <br />
               that these rights were conferred under the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 and that the local ordinances 
               <br />
               curtailing them were unconstitutional and 
               <br />
               ultra vires. He will not consent to the pre- 
               <br />
               servatlon of the conditions which are in— 
               <br />
               violable, but he will agree to perpetuate the 
               <br />
               curtailed rights, although he intimated that 
               <br />
               such an invasion was an illegal and uncon-
