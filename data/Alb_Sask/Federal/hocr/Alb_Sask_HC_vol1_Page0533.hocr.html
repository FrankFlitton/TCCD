               <br />
               discussion is one of the most important 
               <br />
               measures that have come before this House 
               <br />
               since I have had the honour of a seat in it, 
               <br />
               and I feel that it is my duty to have some— 
               <br />
               things to say upon it, representing as I do 
               <br />
               one of the old rural constituencies of the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario. For many years no Bill 
               <br />
               has attracted so much public attention as 
               <br />
               this Bill, perhaps more especially because of 
               <br />
               the school clause contained in it. But be- 
               <br />
               fore I come to the school clause, I want to 
               <br />
               say a few words about the division of the 
               <br />
               Territory <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> has been made by the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment. In the ﬁrst place, I think the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, before the last general election, 
               <br />
               fully intended to divide the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories and give them provincial autonomy, 
               <br />
               and it seems to me that it was their duty 
               <br />
               to have said something to the public on the 
               <br />
               subject, so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the public would have had 
               <br />
               some understanding of the measure, instead 
               <br />
               of having to go it blind, as they did on that 
               <br />
               occasion. I am quite sure that if the de- 
               <br />
               tails of the Bill had been known to the peo- 
               <br />
               ple, there-are a good many constituencies 
               <br />
               both in the province of Ontario and in the 
               <br />
               western country that would have been very 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂferently</span> represented in this House from 
               <br />
               what they are now. There was some cor- 
               <br />
               respondence, I believe, with Mr. Haultaln, 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister of the Territories, but, 
               <br />
               so far as I have been able to learn, there 
               <br />
               was not one word in that correspondence 
               <br />
               with reference to the details of the Bill. 
               <br />
               although there was a promise that at this 
               <br />
               session of parliament a Bill would be in- 
               <br />

               postage stamp on the map of Canada. I 
               <br />
               have heard accusations made against the

               but a good deal has been said about the 
               <br />
               course pursued by Manitoba with regard to

               ince of Manitoba should be enlarged and 
               <br />
               very greatly enlarged. If the government 
               <br />
               had considered Manitoba and the North- 
               <br />

               <br />
               them into two provinces instead of three, 
               <br />
               it would have been a far better arrange-

               Not only that, but they would not have 
               <br />
               been unduly large if we had made two

               <br />
               500,000 miles, and if we added to them the 
               <br />
               73,000 miles that Manitoba contains, that 
               <br />
               would simply make 573,000 miles altoge- 
               <br />
               ther. Divide that by two, and you would 
               <br />
               have two provinces, each with 286,500 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">miles,</span>

               has 372,620 miles, Quebec, which has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">351,:</span> 
               <br />
               878, and Ontario, 260,862 miles. You can 
               <br />
               easily see, therefore, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{if</span> the government 
               <br />
               had taken into consideration the desirabil- 
               <br />
               ity of having only two provinces instead of 
               <br />
               three, neither of the two would have been 
               <br />
               unduly large. Then consider what an 
               <br />
               amount of money would have been saved 
               <br />
               by this means. In fact, the complaint in 
               <br />
               this country for a great many years has 
               <br />

               as strong, or even stronger in this House, 
               <br />
               than they are now, as three separate pro- 
               <br />
               vinces each with its own administration. 
               <br />
               When dealing with the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, the government should have had a 
               <br />
               view to the future and have taken warn- 
               <br />
               ing by the experience of the maritime pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. Instead of having the small pro- 
               <br />
               Vince of Manitoba and two other large pro— 
               <br />
               vinces, we could then have two fairly large 
               <br />
               provinces. But in consequence of the pol- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">icy</span> of the government, the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba will always be inferior to the 
               <br />
               others.
