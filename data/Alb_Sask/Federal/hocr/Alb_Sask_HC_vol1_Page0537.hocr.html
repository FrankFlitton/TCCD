               That is another reason he gave for sup-

               case. I said in the beginning that this

               <br />

               public meetings all over this country in 
               <br />
               the near future. There was a large public 
               <br />
               meeting in Toronto a few days ago, a good 
               <br />
               many speakers took part, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\I</span> judge from

               occupied the chair at that meeting is a Lib-

               things, Mr. Caldecott must not be blamed 
               <br />

               we would have had no Liberal government

               ihe wording of the clause without changing 
               <br />
