               to me that the British North America Act

               that we had the British North America Act

               <br />
               it as we should rely upon our constitution. 
               <br />
               It does seem to me that it is ignoring and 
               <br />
               overriding that Act because the Bill in its 
               <br />
               very terms does proceed to amend the 
               <br />
               British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> America Act in vital points.

               lion. gentlemen opposite may be whether 
               <br />
               it is their intention to ask the imper-

               do not think it will be seriously contend-

               of eminent counsel whom I have consulted 
               <br />
               is worth anything, then I say the Act is 
               <br />
               ultra vires. I have consulted counsel who 
               <br />
               will probably be concerned in this case if 
               <br />
               it ever reaches the courts and I believe I 
               <br />
               am correctly informed by counsel as to 
               <br />
               what will be in all likelihood the result of 
               <br />
               this legislation. The hon. Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Fielding) also went on record as 
               <br />
               against the constitution as follows: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I do not propose to go into that constitutional 
               <br />
               question, not because I say it should not receive 
               <br />
               any consideration, but because I say it is not 
               <br />
               the great question involved, and I prefer to go 
               <br />
               on and deal with the practical questions which 
               <br />
               are before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.</span> If it is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«constitutional</span> ques—

               tion above all others, then, perhaps the best 
               <br />
               thing we can do will be to request the legal 
               <br />
               members of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{this</span> House to adjourn to the Rail-
