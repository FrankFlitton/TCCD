               as old a settlement as the district he is

               speaking about. He proposes to take the

               district of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lumvsden,</span> which polled a vote 
               <br />
               last fall considerably larger than the votes

               polled in some of these four districts which 
               <br />
               he has taken under his care, and which

               has so large an area that you could put

               almost the whole of those four districts

               <br />
               those four districts of his, and he proposes

               to take twenty-one townships just south of 
               <br />
               Regina, the most thickly settled in the

               district of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lumsdien</span> ; and he calls that fair.

               He calls that leaving undisturbed the old

               settled areas. I have occupied the attention 
               <br />
               of the committee a great deal longer than 
               <br />

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. The curious part 
               <br />
               of the schedule proposed for the new pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Saskatchewan is that every one of 
               <br />
               the arguments made by hon. gentlemen on 
               <br />
               the other side of the House, and especially 
               <br />
               by the Prime Minister and the Minister of. 
               <br />
               the Interior, in the case of Alberta, is ab- 
               <br />
               solutely destructive of ‘the schedule now 
               <br />
               proposed. In Alberta reliance was placed 
               <br />
               by this side of the House upon the federal 
               <br />
               distribution of 1903. A resolution based 
               <br />
               upon it was voted down. The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man who has just spoken relies upon it in 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan. Reliance was placed by the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister and the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior on the principle that electors in rural 
               <br />
               constituencies should have a greater voice 
               <br />
               in the legislature than those in urban con- 
               <br />
               stituencies. That principle has been shown 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ngtppelle</span> to have 
               <br />
               been entirely cast aside in the proposed dis- 
               <br />
               tribution. Reliance was then placed on the 
               <br />
               voters’ lists, coupled with information de- 
               <br />
               rived from the number of schools, the num- 
               <br />
               ber of post ofﬁces, and the number of home- 
               <br />
               stead entrles. If you take the voters’ lists, 
               <br />
               the schools, the post ofﬁces and the home- 
               <br />
               stead entries, you will ﬁnd that this pro- 
               <br />
               posed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distribution</span> cannot be sustained as

               <br />
               Qu’Appelle (Mr. Lake) has gone over the 
               <br />
               whole subject so thoroughly that not very 
               <br />
               much needs to be said in addition. Let us 
               <br />
               just take two illustrations—the district <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> 
               <br />
               Humboldt and the district of Souris. You 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that by the census of 1901 there ' 
               <br />
               were 582 souls in Humboldt and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5,704</span> in 
               <br />
               Souris, or nearly ten times the population 
               <br />
               in the one that is contained in the other. 
               <br />
               Each one of these is given a member. If 
               <br />
               you eliminate the Indians, you ﬁnd the com- 
               <br />
               parison still worse. Humboldt had in 1901 
               <br />
               a population of 271 souls and Souris a popu- 
               <br />
               lation of 5,704. Each one of these districts 
               <br />
               is now entitled to a representative. Take 
               <br />
               the votes recorded—178 in Humboldt, 2,554 
               <br />
               in Souris; votes registered, 298 in Humboldt, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3,348</span> in Souris. Between these two ex- 
               <br />
               tremes you have every possibly variety of 
               <br />
               constituency that can be imagined, both as 
               <br />
               regards area and population. Another prin— 
               <br />
               ciple which has been absolutely cast to the 
               <br />
               winds is the supposed principle, relied upon 
               <br />
               in the case of Alberta, that the area was to 
               <br />
               be taken into consideration—that a consti- 
               <br />

               <br />
               a comparatively small population. Well,
