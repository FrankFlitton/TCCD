               As a Conservative of the school of Lafon- 
               <br />
               taine and Baldwin, I wish to enter my pro- 
               <br />
               test against these attacks and insults on 
               <br />
               the part of certain Ontario Conservative 
               <br />
               newspapers. Quite as deplorable as this 
               <br />
               campaign carried on in Ontario, are the 
               <br />
               efforts made by the Liberal papers in Que- 
               <br />
               bec to indispose the French and Catholic 
               <br />
               population of that province against the Con— 
               <br />
               servative party. I protest against such con- 
               <br />
               duct on the part of both. I am acquainted 
               <br />
               with the political history of our country, 
               <br />
               especially within the last thirty or forty 
               <br />
               years. and I suppose every hon. member in 
               <br />
               this House is also acquainted with it. Well, 
               <br />
               that history shows that the Conservative 
               <br />
               party was formed through the union of the 
               <br />
               English-speaking Tories of Ontario and of 
               <br />
               the French—speaking Liberals of Quebec. It 
               <br />
               is through that alliance that this country has 
               <br />
               been built up within the last thirty years 
               <br />
               and has reached its present status. Present 
               <br />
               day politicians should be satisﬁed thereby 
               <br />
               that the best policy to follow is that which 
               <br />
               makes for the union Cf all nationalities and 
               <br />
               all creeds in a common eiÏort to ensure the 
               <br />
               greatness and prosperity of our country, 
               <br />
               Canada. They should be satisﬁed that no 
               <br />
               party will ever gather, in appeals to reli- 
               <br />
               gious and racial passions and prejudices, 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient strength to enable it to control and 
               <br />
               manage public affairs in this country.

               the establishment of separate schools. I

               must state at the same time that I have not
