               instructions that the chief architect of the

               <br />

               The chief architect of the department con-

               sulted with the city engineer of Ottawa and

               accepted the exact speciﬁcation made by that

               made some remarks in regard to the value

               <br />
               sense, it has nothing to do with it. The 
               <br />
               government is paying for the pavement. 
               <br />
               But the hon. member for Victoria and Hali- 
               <br />
               burton (Mr. Sam. Hughes) stated that the

               that all the residents on the street, not be- 
               <br />

               for this pavement with practical unanimity

               and petitioned for no other, is a pretty good 
               <br />
               indication that that pavement must have 
               <br />
               merit. It is quite true that it is to all intents 
               <br />
               and purposes a free gift by the government 
               <br />
               at least the government have undertaken 
               <br />
               to care for that street, but it was quite in 
               <br />
               accordance with their privilege to have 
               <br />
               petitioned for any other kind of pavement

               been put down in London and in Toronto 
               <br />

               have it torn up for the purpose of laying this

               city to immediately lay the water pipe; 
               <br />

               man of the water commissioners, and was

               Every one knows how these petitions are
