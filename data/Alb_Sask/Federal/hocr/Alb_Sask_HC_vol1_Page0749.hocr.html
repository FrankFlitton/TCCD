               as the Northwest ordinances are concerned, 
               <br />
               there is very little to harp upon, and any 
               <br />
               person who reads the Act and brings any 
               <br />
               intelligence whatever to bear upon the 
               <br />
               matter, must be very narrow-minded in- 
               <br />
               deed if he cannot see that the Act 
               <br />
               is drawn upon broad, liberal grounds 
               <br />
               to which all classes of people in this 
               <br />
               country may readily subscribe.

               There is another point to which I wish to 
               <br />
               draw attention. iThere are two important 
               <br />
               results which will follow in regard to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">establishment</span> of these schools; the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               of these is that in the west no class of the 
               <br />
               people in any district will have any induce- 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,ment</span> to establish voluntary or denomina- 
               <br />
               tional schools, which will not be under state 
               <br />
               control in matters of secular education. 
               <br />
               There is. therefore, in the new provinces 
               <br />
               little inducement for Iany class of people to 
               <br />
               establish denominational schools: in fact, 
               <br />
               there is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically</span> no inducement for them 
               <br />
               to do so. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The second advantage is that no class of 
               <br />
               people will have any inducement in any 
               <br />
               district <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> establish voluntary schools or 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">denominational</span> schools for the purpose of 
               <br />
               receiving religious instruction, and thereby 
               <br />
               be forced to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.pay</span> a double tax, that is the 
               <br />
               cost of voluntarily maintaining his denomi- 
               <br />
               national schools and also the enforced pay- 
               <br />
               ment of public school taxes. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               These are two distinct advantages that 
               <br />
               apply to the schools in the Northwest, and, 
               <br />
               therefore, I say that whoever conceived and 
               <br />
               designed that Act certainly conceived and 
               <br />
               designed it upon broad and liberal prin- 
               <br />
               ciples, upon principles which would give 
               <br />
               every possible encouragement to every 
               <br />
               class of people, no matter from What land 
               <br />
               they may come, to locate in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories with the knowledge that when 
               <br />
               they came to that land they came to a land 
               <br />
               of freedom, justice and toleration, a land 
               <br />
               where their children could receive a secular 
               <br />
               education under the control of the state, and 
               <br />
               where, if they particularly desired to have 
               <br />
               religious instruction, one half hour a day 
               <br />
               would be set apart in order that their.chil— 
               <br />
               dren might be taught their particular faith. 
               <br />
               The very :best proof that these laws have 
               <br />
               been satisfactory in the Northwest lies in 
               <br />
               the fact that we have had no agitation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> 
               <br />
               the repeal of the ordinances. We have not 
               <br />
               had the Northwest Territories in past ses-

               right to repeal the school ordinances. Every- 
               <br />
               thing has gone on in peace and harmony, 
               <br />
               so far as their educational system and the 
               <br />
               working of their schools is concerned. In 
               <br />
               addition to that, we ﬁnd that the people of

               the Northwest have been taking up land

               rapidly, people have been pouring into that

               country, and those who have gone in there 
               <br />

               fact that the population of the Northwest
