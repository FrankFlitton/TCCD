               designation would be to call this class of

               Now, there is no question in my mind but 
               <br />
               that the church is entirely without control 
               <br />
               over the schools except from half—past three 
               <br />
               to four o’clock. Were it otherwise, I would 
               <br />
               not be prepared to 'support the provision. 
               <br />
               The reason I accept the provision in the 
               <br />
               Bill as amended is that it is clear and 
               <br />
               deﬁnite, and we know exactly what we are 
               <br />
               getting. That is the advantage of the 
               <br />
               amended Bill over the other. The other 
               <br />
               was not clear. in my opinion; but this Bill 
               <br />
               is clear, and it establishes in the new prov- 
               <br />
               inces about to be formed a system of 
               <br />
               schools which is in fact superior to any 
               <br />
               other system of schools in Canada at the 
               <br />
               present time. and admitted to be so by our 
               <br />
               friends on the other side of the House.
