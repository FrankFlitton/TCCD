               that tenritory, there has been an increase

               of white settlers. The increase in the 
               <br />
               number of whites was from 242 to 3,400 
               <br />
               between the years 1901 and 1905; that is 
               <br />
               to say, that the number of whites in that 
               <br />
               country is fourteen times as great as it was. 
               <br />
               Taking that ﬁgure, it must be assumed that 
               <br />
               there has been an immigration into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Atha-</span>

               1901. Now, 11 would like to know whether

               the hon. minister can furnish us with any 
               <br />
               information which is likely to convince 
               <br />
               this House that such a large immigration 
               <br />
               went into that country every year within 
               <br />
               the last four years. First of all, what time

               do the immigrants for Athabaska and Peace 
               <br />

               Mr. OLIVER. They do not use wagons

               Mr. LAKE. Well, we will say sleighs if 
               <br />
               it suits the hon. gentleman better. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman apparently is not prepared to 
               <br />
               give any facts to substantiate his ﬁgures. 
               <br />
               He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expects</span> this committee and parliament

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> accept his estimate of 5,000 simply on 
               <br />
               an opinion expressed by some unknown 
               <br />
               gentleman. _I think it is due to this House 
               <br />
               that it should have something more before 
               <br />
               it than simply telling it that is must accept 
               <br />
               that estimate of population and that it must 
               <br />
               give two members to represent that dis- 
               <br />
               trict because in the hon. minister’s opinion 
               <br />
               there are something like 5,000 whites and 
               <br />
               half—breeds in that country. Since the 
               <br />
               House adjourned .this afternoon I have 
               <br />
               been looking into a few of the census ﬁg- 
               <br />
               ures. We have had quoted to us on two or 
               <br />
               three occasions the census of 1901 and it 
               <br />
               seems to‘ me that there are some interesting 
               <br />
               deductions to be obtained from these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁgures</span> 
               <br />
               For instance, I looked into the population 
               <br />
               of Alberta as given in the census of 1901 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> estimated population to the 1st of 
               <br />
               July of the present year. a few days hence, 
               <br />
               and I found that the population has in- 
               <br />
               creased nearly four times or 392 per cent. 
               <br />
               I work it out in this way: The total popu- 
               <br />
               lation of 1901 was 65,876. We will a‘dd 
               <br />
               the. estimated population in the Medicine 
               <br />
               Hat district from the new province of Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan amounting to about 3.000. I 
               <br />
               think Medicine Hat itself had about 2,000 
               <br />
               of that population. Now. we have to de- 
               <br />
               duct from that the Indians who have not 
               <br />
               been immigrating into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(this</span> country and 
               <br />
               whose population, as I think it Will be
