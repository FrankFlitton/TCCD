               stitutional. If it is not constitutional, it 
               <br />
               cannot be either wise or practical. In say-

               ing this, I speak for three or four thousand 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic inhabitants in the fair 
               <br />
               county of Lincoln, and I speak for the Pro- 
               <br />
               testants as well. The Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               thinks that this educational section of the 
               <br />
               Bill cannot be supported on constitutional 
               <br />
               ground. He thinks, according to his speech, 
               <br />
               that the law is also against the government 
               <br />
               if they undertake to force this legislation 
               <br />
               through, for he says : I will not discuss it, 
               <br />
               I will let the lawyers discuss it. But does 
               <br />
               he say he will leave it to the new provinces 
               <br />
               to do as they like ? Oh, no ; but he says: 
               <br />
               I will butt in and take the provinces by the

               legal question. I think he ought to wait

               until the jury comes in; I think he ought

               we have a right to interfere with the pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               about the provinces having a right to deal 
               <br />
               with this question of separate schools. Now. 
               <br />
               if separate schools can be dealt with, as it 
               <br />
               is adlnitted they can be, by the provinces, 
               <br />
               why not let them deal with it? Nobody 
               <br />
               suggests on either side of this House that 
               <br />
               these new provinces of Alberta and Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan cannot deal with the question of 
               <br />
               separate schools as soon as this Act is pass- 
               <br />
               ed in any way that they like; the whole 
               <br />
               dispute is as to whether there is power in 
               <br />
               the Dominion parliament to deal with the 
               <br />
               subject. But there is no question about the 
               <br />
               fact that the provinces can do it if the Do- 
               <br />
               minion parliament does not interfere. Now, 
               <br />
               have hon. gentlemen made a good case for 
               <br />
               separate schools or have they not? I am 
               <br />
               not going to discuss that question. I believe 
               <br />
               in provincial rights. If this question was 
               <br />
               up in the province of Ontario I would claim 
               <br />
               the right to record my vote upon it, and in 
               <br />
               the same manner I do not wish to take 
               <br />
               away the right of the people of the North 
               <br />
               west Territories to record their votes on the 
               <br />
               subject if they want to. I am willing to give 
               <br />
               my fellow—countrymen in the Northwest Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories the same right to do their own vot- 
               <br />
               ing on this school question that I claim for 
               <br />
               myself. So in regard to every other ques-

               tion, they should be treated in the same 
               <br />
               way. Can it be suggested that if this was 
               <br />
               not an educational and, incidentally, a re- 
               <br />

               ing of the constitution to interfere with the

               <br />
               Everybody knows that if this was not a ques—

               those provinces, that we should undertake to 
               <br />
               throttle them in regard to their right to say 
               <br />
               what system of education they shall have. 
               <br />
               Of course, if we are going to give provin- 
               <br />
               cial autonomy to the Northwest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories,</span> 
               <br />
               let us give them something that will be 
               <br />
               autonomy, and not a mere pretense. 
               <br />
               Why are the government dealing with this 
               <br />
               question of provincial autonomy ? Does the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister believe that these provinces 
               <br />
               have reached the stage where they are en- 
               <br />
               titled to have autonomy? If he says they 
               <br />
               are entitled now to have autonomy on all 
               <br />
               the subjects mentioned in the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then</span> are they not entitled to 
               <br />
               exercise the same judgment with regard to 
               <br />
               education? If they have bra-ins and in- 
               <br />
               telligence enough, if they are far enough 
               <br />
               advanced to deal with all the other subjects 
               <br />
