               the construction of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">In-tercovlonial</span> Railway

               have heard it suggested in this House. I 
               <br />
               think, that there had been an omission on 
               <br />

               provinces without their consent—there can 
               <br />
               be no question about that. There was 
               <br />
               no province at the time, there was no repre— 
               <br />
               sentative body in the Territories, and 
               <br />
               there was no representation of the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories in this parliament. Therefore, it ap- 
               <br />
               pears to me that, as it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> the Dominion 
               <br />
               itself which made the contract, it is the 
               <br />
               Dominion which is responsible to the Can- 
               <br />
               adian Paciﬁc Railway Company for the 
               <br />
               beneﬁts which that company were to re- 
               <br />
               ceive on the completion of their share of 
               <br />
               the contract. I think, therefore, that it is 
               <br />
               only fair that the Dominion, at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time, should assume that burden itself 
               <br />
               and relieve the people of the Northwest 
               <br />

               from it. As has been pointed out in the

               statement which I have just read, the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span> Paciﬁc Railway. They are also

               line constructed in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the line constructed in British Columbia. I 
               <br />
               fail to see why, in addition to all this, this 
               <br />
               burden caused by the exemption from tax- 
               <br />
               ation should be placed upon the people of 
               <br />
               the Northwest. And it is a burden. With 
               <br />
               reference to the exemption of taxation on 
               <br />
               the land grant, I think we have a very 
               <br />
               strong claim to relief upon the Dominion 
               <br />
