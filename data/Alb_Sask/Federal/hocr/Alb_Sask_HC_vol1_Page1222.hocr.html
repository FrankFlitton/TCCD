               what is the difference between the original

               before this debate is through. I believe

               that the people of the west want to control 
               <br />

               <br />
               land, and I believe they are quite compe-

               tent to control and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administer</span> both. Hon.

               gentlemen opposite are on record as having 
               <br />
               taken that view in the old days, but it is 
               <br />
               not their View to—day; and I trust that the 
               <br />
               members from the west will give this 
               <br />
               country a better reason for their submission 
               <br />
               than any they have so far given. I trust 
               <br />
               they will be able to give a better reason 
               <br />
               for consenting _to have the new provinces

               <br />

               <br />
               would be an easy matter for the provinces

               to base a system on which they could raise

               <br />
               the strength of their land grant. They go

               t‘o the province of Ontario and their note 
               <br />

               Nova Scotia and raise money in the same

               there is a Conservative government in

               <br />
               security, is endorsed for $1,000,000. If these 
               <br />
               railway promoters can have their notes 
               <br />
               endorsed and financed in this way, surely 
               <br />
               these great provinces about to be erected 
               <br />
               in the west could evolve a ﬁnancial policy 
               <br />
               based on their lands which would give 
               <br />
               them ready money, and they would then 
               <br />
               enjoy the income that would naturally 
               <br />
               come from those lands. Speaking from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> 
               <br />
               Dominion point of view and as a citizen 
               <br />
               of Ontario, I could justify the policy of 
               <br />
               the Dominion holding on to these lands; 
               <br />
               but how a member .from the Northwest 
               <br />
               can advocate any such policy I am at a

               loss to understand. This is but another

               Mr. SCOTT. It is perfectly true that the

               entirely relieved of responsibility for that

               <br />
               a little more than a year ago. Let me quote 
               <br />
               a part of that statement, which, perhaps he 
               <br />
