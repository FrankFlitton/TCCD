               <br />
               Our policy, the policy of the Liberal party, 
               <br />
               was absolutely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clear;</span> it was not necessary

               the spirit; our policy was to give effect to 
               <br />
               the legislation introduced in 1875 by the

               is that Mr. Sifton was not consulted about 
               <br />
               this Bill. Mr. Speaker, I have little to add 
               <br />
               to what I have already said incidentally on 
               <br />
               that subject. I can say now that Mr. Sif- 
               <br />
               ton handed to me personally a draft Bill 
               <br />
               as prepared by those who represented the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, and that on that 
               <br />
               Bill were notes written in his own hand- 
               <br />
               writing with respect to this question of 
               <br />
               schools, which I understood is the only 
               <br />
               question that we differed about. I have 
               <br />
               the notes here, which I will read:

               Beyond that, I never had a conference 
               <br />
               with Mr. Sifton, beyond that, he is in no 
               <br />
               respect responsible for section 16 of this

               Bill. Now I have endeavoured at all times 
               <br />
               to shut my eyes and to close my ears to 
               <br />
               the idle chatter which we hear in the

               <br />
               ignore the professional maliguer who goes 
               <br />
               about for the purpose of endeavouring to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">create</span> disturbances between friends. So 
               <br />
               far as I am concerned—I speak out openly, 
               <br />
               I have nothing to hide. nothing to be afraid 
               <br />
               of, either here or outside—I say that the 
               <br />
               honest differences that have existed, if any 
               <br />
               have existed, between Mr. Sifton and my- 
               <br />
               self with respect to this Bill, are differences 
               <br />
               which any two self-willed and perhaps 
               <br />
               rather strong-minded men might have. 
               <br />
               But they have never extended beyond that, 
               <br />
               and any man who says they have, any man 
               <br />
               who, either in this House or out of it. says 
               <br />
               anything to the contrary, says what he 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knows</span> to be untrue.

               Now there is another point to which I 
               <br />
               wish to refer. A criticism has been offer- 
               <br />
               ed as to the composition of the subcom- 
               <br />
               mittee that was appointed by the govern- 
               <br />
               ment to confer with the representatives of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories with respect to 
               <br />
               the provisions of this Bill. I would like to 
               <br />
               say that it is somewhat embarrassing to 
               <br />
               answer the charge that a man should not 
               <br />
               be Minister of Justice, or form part of 
               <br />
               that committee because he happens to be 
               <br />
               a Roman Catholic. The Prime Minister was 
               <br />
               a member of that committee. Was it im- 
               <br />
               proper that the Prime Minister should be 
               <br />
               a member of this important subcommittee?
