               matters very little whether it is a few more

               or a few less; the general result is about 
               <br />
               the same. The question at issue is not be- 
               <br />
               tween several constituencies, but between 
               <br />
               northern Alberta and southern Alberta. 
               <br />
               Now, the vote cast at the Dominion election 
               <br />
               in the province of Alberta, not including the 
               <br />
               district of Athabaska, amounted to practi- 
               <br />
               cally _21,000. giving 12 constituencies in the 
               <br />
               south, including Red Deer, although part 
               <br />
               of it is north of the line mentioned. That 
               <br />
               is, 11,406 votes in the 12 southern constitu-

               votes, exclusive of the district of Athabaska. 
               <br />
               Now, we say that the greater area of the

               northern part of the old district of Alberta, 
               <br />

               <br />
               Athabaska, and the prospective increase of
