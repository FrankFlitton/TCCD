               <br />
               Greenway the guarantee that the great 
               <br />
               party he led in this country would stand 
               <br />
               by him resisting a settlement of that 
               <br />
               question. And now what do we ﬁnd? 
               <br />
               Well, it reminds me of an anecdote. And, 
               <br />
               perhaps we have been too serious in this 
               <br />
               debate, so, this anecdote may not be out 
               <br />
               of place. There were two ministers, one 
               <br />
               very successful in his vocation and the 
               <br />
               other unsuccessful. The second man went 
               <br />
               to his successful neighbour to ask the secret 
               <br />
               of his success. And the other man said, 
               <br />
               'You don’t know how to ﬁsh. When I go 
               <br />
               ﬁshing, I take a delicate hook, a slender 
               <br />
               line and a long pole; and I put on a nice 
               <br />
               bait and let it down into the water where 
               <br />
               the sun can shine upon it, and I catch 
               <br />
               ﬁsh. But when you go ﬁshing, you take 
               <br />
               a beam for a pole, a pot—hook for a book, 
               <br />
               a scorpion for bait and you bring it down 
               <br />
               into the water ker-slash!——‘ Bite or be 
               <br />
               damned.’ And that is what the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has done in this case. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lie</span> was 
               <br />
               ﬁshing in 1896, and he had the nice deli- 
               <br />
               cate hook, the slender pole, the twinkling, 
               <br />
               line and the enticing bait. And he caught 
               <br />
               ﬁsh—he got into power. But now he is in 
               <br />
               power, and he brings the bait down upon 
               <br />
               the water ker—slash!——bite or be damned; 
               <br />
               that is what he says to the west. There 
               <br />
               are no ‘sunny ways’; the sun has set so 
               <br />
               far as these thin-gs are concerned. It is 
               <br />
               a most unfortunate thing for our country 
               <br />
               that this question has been thrown into the 
               <br />
               political arena. It is against the interest 
               <br />
               of the schools and the harmony of our peo- 
               <br />
               ple. And the right hon. gentleman is not 
               <br />
               excusable upon the ground that he was not 
               <br />
               aware of what would take place. He re- 
               <br />
               ferred to it in the speech with which he in- 
               <br />
               troduced the Bill. I quote from the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman's speech on the 21st of Feb- 
               <br />

               speak about and I do not intend to speak 
               <br />
               long. There has been a great deal said 
               <br />
               about the intolerance of Ontario. Ontario 
               <br />
               has a broader tolerance than the men who 
               <br />
               accuse her of intolerance and I will prove 
               <br />
               it. In the ﬁrst place, take the public 
               <br />
               school of Ontario; the public school of 
               <br />
               Ontario is a school that any man’s child 
               <br />
               may go to, Catholic or Protestant. Can you 
               <br />
               say that about the majority school in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec? As a matter of fact 
               <br />
               the school nearest the public school of On— 
               <br />
               tario is the Protestant school of Quebec 
               <br />
               and the Catholic school of Quebec is not a 
               <br />
               school that a Protestant can very well send 
               <br />
               his child to. And they say : What business 
               <br />
               has Ontario to talk about this question 
               <br />
               which affects the west ? Well, there has 
               <br />
               been a good deal said by some of our French 
               <br />
               friends on the opposite side of the House 
               <br />
               about the intolerance of Ontario, about at— 
               <br />
               tacking their religion and all that. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) in- 
               <br />
               voked the whole history of his church in 
               <br />
               this discussion. He went back to the mis- 
               <br />
               sionaries of 250 years ago and invoked their 
               <br />
               whole history in the discussion of this 
               <br />
               question and in reference to their schools 
               <br />
               as well. If there is any criticism upon this 
               <br />
               proposition it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i‘ll</span> becomes him or any of his 
               <br />
               friends to get up and speak of intolerance 
               <br />
               on the part of anybody. I ﬁnd that in the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario ﬁfty per cent of the 
               <br />
               English Catholic children are attending the 
               <br />
               public schools. That proves two things—— 
               <br />
               that the English Catholic people are satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed largely with the public schools of On- 
               <br />
               tanio, and further that they receive treat- 
               <br />
               ment that is satisfactory to them in these 
               <br />
               schools or their children would not be there. 
               <br />
               In many instances the most active, ener- 
               <br />
               getic and efﬁcient trustees, secretaries and 
               <br />
               workers in the interest of public schools are 
               <br />
               the English Catholics of Ontario. I can 
               <br />
               speak of my own town of ‘Morrisburg. Per— 
               <br />
               haps there is not a town of its size in On- 
               <br />
               tario that has a collegiate institute of 
               <br />
