               see that any blame is to be connected with

               ﬁt to consult His Excellency on a question 
               <br />

               so, I would like to know when that consulta—

               tion took place. Did they consult him be- 
               <br />
               fore they introduced clause 16 of the ori-

               did they consult him afterwards when the

               <br />

               Mr. BERGERON. My hon. friend had 
               <br />
               better settle that with his bishop. This 
               <br />
               brings us to the question at issue; this 
               <br />
               is why there is a delegate here. so that 
               <br />
               the bishop cannot condemn the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, and I understand now why he 
               <br />
               is so anxious that the delegate should stay 
               <br />
               here. He would rather be in the hands of 
               <br />
               that delegate—for whom I have the deep- 
               <br />
               est respect—than in the hands of his bishop 
               <br />
               in Quebec, who would remind him of the 
               <br />
               letter written in 1896. We might as well 
               <br />
               admit at once that the action of the Liberal 
               <br />
               party in 1896 was the initiation of the 
               <br />
               question which we are discussing in this 
               <br />
               House to-day. .

               Mr. Speaker, this is a heritage of the 
               <br />
               Liberal party that we are having to-day. 
               <br />
               We have heard my hon. friend from Pictou 
               <br />
               (Mr. Macdonald), and my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs, with his beautiful 
               <br />
               voice, speaking of having peace in Canada, 
               <br />
               and my hon. friend the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               says that religiously we have peace in Can- 
               <br />
               ada. These hon. gentlemen have a most 
               <br />
               extraordinary way of bringing peace to the 
               <br />
               country; peace with the bishops and 
               <br />
               clergy, by having here a delegate from 
               <br />
               Rome, who says to them, Gentlemen, not 
               <br />
               another word; peace for the minority of 
               <br />
               Manitoba by not giving them what they 
               <br />
               wanted, and leaving them still under the 
               <br />
               foot of the majority of that province. That 
               <br />
               is the kind of peace the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man gave to them after promising in Que- 
               <br />
               bec that he would do more for them than 
               <br />
               the remedial Bill would do. Would we 
               <br />
               have in Canada to-day His Excellency, ot“ 
               <br />
               whom so much has been said, if the minor—
