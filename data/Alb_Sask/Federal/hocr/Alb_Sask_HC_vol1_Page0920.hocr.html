               Wilfrid Laurier) who leads the govern-

               <br />
               things from the right hon. gentleman. If 
               <br />
               we go back to 1896, we ﬁnd that he took

               <br />
               find the right hon. gentleman. as the leader

               were, across the path of his own people’s

               interests and hindering the government of

               that 'day from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carrying</span> out what was 
               <br />
               known as the Remedial Order. Now, I 
               <br />
               will say that whether it was advisable to 
               <br />
               act as the government acted at that time 
               <br />

               <br />
               and according to the best legal authorities 
               <br />
               the country could produce. And when the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />
               took the position he did. and went through 
               <br />
               this country. as he did. speaking to the 
               <br />
               electors, not only of Ontario but of other 
               <br />
               parts of the Dominion, he led the country 
               <br />
               to expect that in the future these issues 
               <br />
               would not be raised. Now, I had the good

               <br />
               plain Mr. Laurier. in the town of Morris- 
               <br />
               burg, in which I live. He carried on an 
               <br />
               Ontario campaign, and he did my town the 
               <br />
               honour—I do not know whether it was be- 
               <br />
               cause I iived there—to open that campaign 
               <br />
               with a speech made in that town. And he 
               <br />
               was accompanied by no less a personage 
               <br />
               than Sir Richard Cartwright. I listened 
               <br />
               attentively to the right hon. gentleman on 
               <br />
               that occasion and I have taken the trouble 
               <br />
               since to look up the report of his remarks. 
               <br />
               He condemned the government of the day

               cated certain ‘sunny ways’ if you please. 
               <br />
               And he told the people a fable, and no 
               <br />
               doubt. he will recall that fable. It was 
               <br />
               the fable of the contest of the sun and the 
               <br />
               wind. Meeting a traveller in the road, the 
               <br />
               wind said. ‘I will wager that I will make

               <br />
               but the more he raged and blew the tighter 
               <br />
               the man buttoned his coat. And when the

               <br />
               and glow and everything grew warm. And 
               <br />
               ﬁrst the man unb-uttoned his coat, but as 
               <br />
               he grew warmer and began to perspire he 
               <br />
               took the coat off altogether. And that is 
               <br />
               the way the party of the right hon. gen-

               <br />
               to which I refer was made on the 8th of 
               <br />
               October, 1895, and it was published in the
