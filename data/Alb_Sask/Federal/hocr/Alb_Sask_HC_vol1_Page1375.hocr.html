               !Justice agrees with me or not, I say that 
               <br />
               common sense demands that the explanation 
               <br />
               of the main feature of the Bill should have

               been given in the discussion on the second 
               <br />
               reading. Take, for instance, the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Centre York (Mr. Campbell). His 
               <br />
               constituents wrote asking what the Bill 
               <br />
               meant. It was as plain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“as</span> day to that 
               <br />
               hon. member and he told them what it 
               <br />
               meant._ Yet, the provisions of the Bill as 
               <br />
               it was then before us would not at all

               <br />

               lt is treating parliament with contempt, I 
               <br />
               say, to leave it in the dark for such a length

               of time upon so important a matter. And 
               <br />
               now we are told the Minister of Justice is 
               <br />
               not ready to give an explanation because he 
               <br />
               has not his papers with him. For my part 
               <br />
               I am disposed to give him every opportunity 
               <br />
               tn make his explanation. But, if the min- 
               <br />
               ister cannot explain, I feel like calling upon 
               <br />
               the hon. member of Centre York (Mr. Camp- 
               <br />

               <br />
               stituents, he has explained it even to the 
               <br />
               ministers of the Gospel in this constituency. 
               <br />
               He ought to explain it to the House.
