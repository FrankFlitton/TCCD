               would speak so lightly. I would suggest as

               ister excused the delay in introducing this 
               <br />
               Bill in previous sessions on the ground that 
               <br />
               there was to be a new election, that there 
               <br />
               would be increased representation of the

               members from the Territories. There has

               been a new election, and there is now an

               gentleman did not avail himself of the ad—

               consulted were not consulted on the edu- 
               <br />
               cational clause. All the other clauses ap- 
               <br />
               parently were discussed but this clause 
               <br />
               was put to one side, it was shirked because 
               <br />
               apparently it was known that those who 
               <br />
               were most interested would most strongly 
               <br />
               object to it. The Prime Minister of the

               Territories, Mr. Hanltain, was not consulted. 
               <br />
               Surely the right hon. gentleman who leads 
               <br />
               this House (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) acted dif- 
               <br />

               that hon. gentleman with such discourtesy.

               Surely the way to bring about conciliation 
               <br />
               and the way to effect peace would have 
               <br />
               been to consult with the man who was the

               have been impossible to force that Bill upon 
               <br />

               <br />
               be forced to accept it rather than to bolt. 
               <br />
               One of these ministers did accept, the other 
               <br />

               divided into provinces, restriction should 
               <br />
               be placed upon that territory and a res- 
               <br />
               triction should be placed upon Manitoba as

               far as her boundaries are concerned, if she 
               <br />
               did not accept separate schools as desired.

               That, Sir, is the reason why there has been 
               <br />
               such an arousing of feeling in Ontario and 
               <br />
               in the west. It is a feeling that the peo- 
               <br />
               ple have been deceived and that this is an 
               <br />
               attempt to force upon these new Territories 
               <br />
               that which they do not want, that which 
               <br />
               by right they ought to settle among them- 
               <br />
               selves, and to force upon Manitoba a res-

               triction of her area as a punishment for 
               <br />
               her rebellion of 1896. The Prime Minister, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and,</span> I think, the Minister of Justice both 
               <br />
               made the statement that they thought the 
               <br />
               school clause as embodied in this Bill was 
               <br />
               merely conﬁrming exactly what the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories now have. If that was the case it 
               <br />
               would surely have been easy to make that 
               <br />
               statement plain without putting in an elab- 
               <br />
               orate clause which has caused so much 
               <br />
               trouble, so much excitement and so much 
               <br />
               distrust. The Prime Minister in referring 
               <br />
               to separate schools contrasted the separate 
               <br />
               schools with the godless schools of the other 
               <br />
               side of the line, gave credit to these sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools for the difference in the 
               <br />
               morals of this country and the morals of 
               <br />
               the people to the south of us. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.If</span> that was 
               <br />
               the case he certainly had not in view the 
               <br />
               separate schoolas it is now said to exist 
               <br />
               in the Northwest, merely a secular school 
               <br />
               with half an hour at the end of the day 
               <br />
               for religious instruction if the children wish 
               <br />
               it. The separate schools he must have had 
               <br />
               in view were separate schools, religious- 
               <br />
               schools, pure and simple, or the reference 
               <br />
               which he made was of no value. It has 
               <br />
               been said that there has been an active 
               <br />
               canvass by fanatics to raise the excitement 
               <br />
               of the people of the west. There has been 
               <br />
               no such thing. The excitement, the meet- 
               <br />
               ings, the feeling that has been aroused 
               <br />
               there is a feeling that has sprung up spon- 
               <br />
               taneously among the people. One of the 
               <br />
               results of that feeling was the meeting at 
               <br />
               Massey Hall. That meeting was organized 
               <br />
               by friends of the right hon. gentleman and 
               <br />
               organized in his interests. So much was 
               <br />
               that the case that not one of the Toronto
