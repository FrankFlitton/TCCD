               have had two provinces that for size, fer- 
               <br />
               tility, and undoubted possibilities would be 
               <br />
               unparalleled in the world. I belieVe it was 
               <br />
               coming to Manitoba and I would like to 
               <br />
               take up a little time to—night in telling you 
               <br />
               Why I believe it was coming to Manitoba. 
               <br />
               Some hon. gentlemen have compared Maui- 
               <br />
               toba to a postage stamp. Well, What is a 
               <br />
               postage stamp? A postage stamp occupies 
               <br />
               a very small space on the corner of a letter. 
               <br />
               but it is the postage stamp that makes the 
               <br />
               letter go. There is no‘ question about that. 
               <br />
               I can prove beyond a doubt that Manitoba 
               <br />
               has made that great western country go. 
               <br />
               It has been the port bf entry and it has been 
               <br />
               the experimental farm for the whole North- 
               <br />
               west. I see upon the other side of the 
               <br />
               House the hon. member for Winnipeg (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bole), and it I am not mistaken he will 
               <br />
               bear out what I have to say. I claim that the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada had the right to ex- 
               <br />
               tend the borders of Manitoba, and being 
               <br />
               from Manitoba and being particulaly inter- 
               <br />
               ested in that country which has been my 
               <br />
               home for about 22 years, I am sure hon. 
               <br />
               members of the House will excuse me if 
               <br />
               I try to prove why we should have our ter- 
               <br />
               ritory extended westward. As I said before, 
               <br />
               it has been the great experimental farm. 
               <br />
               Twenty-ﬁve years ago our hon. friends op- 
               <br />
               posite did not have very much use for Mani- 
               <br />
               toba and the west. They absolutely opposed 
               <br />
               any expenditure of money in that country. 
               <br />
               They opposed to the hilt the building of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. I assure you, Sir, 
               <br />
               that the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway has done 
               <br />
               great things for that country notwithstanding 
               <br />
               the fact that freights were high in those 
               <br />
               early times. Perhaps they had to be high 
               <br />
               because the country was sparsely settled 
               <br />
               and they had to go all around the north 
               <br />
               shore of Lake Superior before they reached a 
               <br />
               country that would give them any business. 
               <br />
               I would like to call the attention of the 
               <br />
               House, because I am exceedingly anxious 
               <br />
               to prove what I say, re the opinions ex- 
               <br />
               pressed in former times by leaders of 
               <br />
               the Liberal party as to the value of that 
               <br />
               country. It was only the untiring energy 
               <br />
               of men like Sir Charles Tupper who never 
               <br />
               gave up, that carried through the great 
               <br />
               project of the building of the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway. We heard the hon. Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Customs (Mr. Paterson) in loud 
               <br />
               tones the other night announce the prosper- 
               <br />
               ity of this country, but I say, without fear 
               <br />
               of contradiction in this House, that it that 
               <br />
               western country is prosperous to—day it is 
               <br />
               due to the Liberal—Conservative party. When 
               <br />
               these hon. gentlemen talk about the pros— 
               <br />
               perity of the country it reminds me very 
               <br />
               much of the time when we were boys on the 
               <br />
               farm. One boy would crawl under the barn 
               <br />
               and the other would go and ﬁnd a hen’s 
               <br />
               nest. When he had found the hen’s nest we 
               <br />
               would run .to our mother and say: Look at 
               <br />
               the hen’s nest we have found. The boy who 
               <br />
               had crawled under the barn and had noth- 
               <br />
               ing to do with the ﬁnding of the hen’s nest

               land is not worth now any more than it was

               at the time the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway

               <br />
               for less than $10 an acre. But what position 
               <br />
               did the leaders of these hon. gentlemen take 
               <br />
               when Sir Charles Tapper was trying to put

               As you know the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               were to receive 20,000 acres of land per

               the House will accept that calculation. 1

               <br />
               that these 1,700,000 acres are worth $2 an 
               <br />
               acre to this country. Even valuing them at 
               <br />

               They proceeded to the consideration of the

               question as to what would be the position

               of the road when it was completed. You
