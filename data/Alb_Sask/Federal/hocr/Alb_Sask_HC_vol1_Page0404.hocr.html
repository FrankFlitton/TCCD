               Mr. SPROULE. I understood the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman to say earlier in the debate that 
               <br />
               during the election the question was not 
               <br />
               brought up or discussed, nor was there any 
               <br />
               truth in the statement that the government, 
               <br />
               through Mr. Sifton, had requested the peo- 
               <br />
               ple to trust the government and they would 
               <br />
               do the best for them. I understand him to 
               <br />
               say there was no such statement made dur— 
               <br />
               ing the election.

               Mr. SCOTT. I say that the question was 
               <br />
               never presented to me, and I met Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Haul-</span> 
               <br />
               tnin himself twice, once at Medicine Hat

               and again at Moose Jaw, and he never asked 
               <br />
               me any question about it. Nobody asked 
               <br />
               me anything about it.

               Mr. SPROULE. Will my hon. friend 
               <br />
               allow me to refresh his memory ? The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman lives in Regina. That is in his 
               <br />
               riding. The Manitoba ‘Free Press’ ot 
               <br />
               October 20, 1904—during the time the elec- 
               <br />
               tions were going on—reports Mr. Sifton as 
               <br />
               having spoken at Regina as follows. After 
               <br />
               referring to the question of annexation to 
               <br />
               Manitoba, Mr. Sifton said :

               I believe that Haultain has further suggested 
               <br />
               that I should be asked to state what the policy 
               <br />
               of the government would be with regard to 
               <br />
               public schools. I do not believe that Haul- 
               <br />
               tain is doing the people of the Territories any 
               <br />
               service when he makes suggestions of that 
               <br />
               kind. Any man of ordinary intelligence in 
               <br />
               public life, and Mr. Haultain is a. man of more 
               <br />
               than ordinary intelligence, knows full well that 
               <br />
               one member of a government consisting of 
               <br />
               fourteen members would not come here and 
               <br />
               without consulting his colleagues, undertake 
               <br />
               to bind them and the parliament of Canada on 
               <br />
               questions of such importance. Therefore the 
               <br />
               suggestion is made in a spirit of mischief. Let
