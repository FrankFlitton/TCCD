               to be burdensome to the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories, it should negotiate with 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> sur- 
               <br />
               render of any rights which it may have 
               <br />
               as to exemptions. We all know, because 
               <br />
               we have heard from the west year after 
               <br />
               year, about the grievance that exists there 
               <br />
               in regard to these exemptions. There is the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, the wealthiest 
               <br />
               corporation in this country. It_is paying 
               <br />
               large dividends on its stock. It is making 
               <br />
               handsome proﬁts every year. It is the 
               <br />
               richest corporation we have in Canada. The 
               <br />
               company has great possessions in the shape 
               <br />
               of lands in the west on which it pays no 
               <br />
               taxes. The poor settler in the west is pay- 
               <br />
               ing his taxes while the Canadian Pacino 
               <br />
               Railway pays no taxes. Grant that the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway has a right; if 
               <br />
               that right could be commuted and if these 
               <br />
               lands could he immediately made subject 
               <br />
               to taxation an effort should be made to 
               <br />
               abolish this exemption. In the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario we know what tax exemptions 
               <br />
               are. They are an enormous burden on 
               <br />
               the people who have to pay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxes.</span> In 
               <br />
               the city of Toronto there are millions 
               <br />
               and millions of dollars worth of property 
               <br />
               of the most valuable kind which is increas- 
               <br />
               ing in value every day and which is yet un- 
               <br />
               taxed. It is relieved from taxation by rea- 
               <br />
               son of exemptions granted years and years 
               <br />
               ago. We have had some of these exempt- 
               <br />
               ions removed. We have given a great deal 
               <br />
               of attention to the question of exemption 
               <br />
               from taxation'in the province of Ontario.
