               I point out to him that where the Intercolo—

               the Railway Commission, and therefore the 
               <br />
               analogy which he seeks to establish 
               <br />
               does not seem to hold good. I still do not 
               <br />
               understand how the Railway Commission is 
               <br />

               that portion of the line from Parry Sound 
               <br />
               to Montreal. My hon. friend says that the 
               <br />
               reason why the government proposes to 
               <br />
               make this leased line—because it is in effect 
               <br />
               a leased line from Montreal to Parry Sound 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">——-su1bject</span> to the jurisdiction of the Railway 
               <br />
               Commission, so far as it is operated by tli'e 
               <br />
               lntercolonial Railway, is because there is 
               <br />
               competition over the same line by a private 
               <br />
               company, a railway company which owns 
               <br />
               that line. I pointed out to him, and I do 
               <br />
               not think he has answered it, that the 
               <br />
               question of competition does not depend 
               <br />
               upon running over the same line of rails. 
               <br />
               There is as much competition, and 
               <br />
               as strong competition, perhaps, if you 
               <br />
               have the competing line operating over 
               <br />
               different rails; so there does not seem to 
               <br />
               be any good reason, on that ground for 
               <br />
               adopting the course which he says the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment is about to pursue. I must confess 
               <br />
               that it seems to me that the government 
               <br />
               proposals at the present time are in an ex- 
               <br />
               ceedingly crude condition, or else my hon. 
               <br />
               friend has not taken the trouble to explain 
               <br />
               them very carefully to the committee.

               Mr. EMMERSON. It may be my fault or

               it may be the hon. gentleman’s fault if there 
               <br />
               is a misunderstanding. The pOSition of the

               line from Ste. Rosalie junction to Montreal 
               <br />
               is very differentfrom the one now proposed ; 
               <br />
               there it is ﬁxed in advance. The rates are 
               <br />
               apportioned under an agreement, the 
               <br />
               running of trains is all ﬁxed, and all these

               things are arranged in a more deﬁnite way

               future. There is a ceitain fixed rental paid.

               The proposal with 1espect to the line fiom 
               <br />
               \Iontieal to Georgian bay is very different. 
               <br />
               There the two lines will come in competi- 
               <br />
               tion, and the question of running on the 
               <br />
               tracks will be determined by the commis- 
               <br />
               sion. That is aheady dete1mined with re- 
               <br />
               spect to the G1and Trunk f1om Mont1eal to 
               <br />
               Ste. Rosalie. The rates should be unifo1m,

               way it seems to me that a greater p1otec-

               tion is given to the export trade of Canada

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">EMMERSOKN.</span> Both statements made 
               <br />
               by me were correct, and they are not in-
