               given to the majority and to the minority

               go to that extent. I ask the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, because we want to deal frankly 
               <br />
               with each other in these matters, whether 
               <br />
               he appreciates my contention; in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               part of the section you deal only with se-

               <br />
               school only where they are in the minority. 
               <br />
               Now, so far as the Catholics are concerned 
               <br />
               you desire to go further and provide 
               <br />
               that the power to regulate religious instruc-

               from the Catholics where they happen to

               would be keeping better within the lines 
               <br />
               of the Act. We have an Act which con- 
               <br />
               templates a dual system of minority and 
               <br />
               majority schools, and as the Act stands 
               <br />
               with the amendment originally proposed, it 
               <br />
               seems to me we have conserved to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">min-</span> 
               <br />
               ority where that minority is a minority in 
               <br />
               a district all those things which the min- 
               <br />
               ority .has at the present time. With this 
               <br />
               additional amendment we will ﬁnd ourselves 
               <br />
               in this position that under the Act as we 
               <br />
               now have it the majority, whatever that 
               <br />
               majority may be, has also the same right 
               <br />
               in respect to religious instruction that the 
               <br />
               minority has got and what is intended, it 
               <br />
               seems to me is to conﬁrm to that majority the 
               <br />
               same rights and privileges as the minority 
               <br />
               has in a school district, whether that ma— 
               <br />
               jority be Protestant or Catholic.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. Yes; that is ex-

               actly my view of it, but what I am sug- 
               <br />
               gesting is that in respect of schools in any

               there-is no reason why you should limit the

               powers of the province in that respect.
