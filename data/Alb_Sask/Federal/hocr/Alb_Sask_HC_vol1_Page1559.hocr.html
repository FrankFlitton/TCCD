               suit in proving our contention, namely, that

               nated against. As I pointed out, on the

               vote enumerated on the list, if you take the 
               <br />

               ary, it will be found, totalling them up and

               comparing them with the eleven seats north

               after Red Deer, excepting Peace river and 
               <br />

               <br />
               stituencies in the south than for the eleven

               in the north. As has been already pointed 
               <br />
               out, a large number of settlers who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span>

               no votes, the inﬂux of settlement has been

               south, and the southern country suffers in 
               <br />
               comparison with the north by reason of the 
               <br />
               settlers not being there long enough to 
               <br />
               qualify and have their names put on the 
               <br />

               apparent to anybody who considers the

               matter at all that the inﬂux of population 
               <br />
               has been largely to the south. I need only 
               <br />
               point out one instance in connection with 
               <br />
               that southern irrigation block, and that is 
               <br />

               this—there was a population last fall of

               2,500 people and yet less than 200 names 
               <br />
               appear on the enunierator‘s list. People

               who went in there a couple of years ago 
               <br />
               were not in the country a sufﬁcient

               length of time to enable them to be placed

               Now, let us make some comparisons be-

               tween the constituencies in the south and 
               <br />
               those in the north. Take, for example, the 
               <br />
               city of Calgary, with 2.184 votes polled, and 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               in Calgary as compared with only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1.699</span> in 
               <br />
               Edmdnton. The same representation is 
               <br />
               given to both. Compare the constituency of 
               <br />
               I‘1ncher Creek, with 1,678 names on the list, 
               <br />
               with its coal niines at Frank. Blairmore and 
               <br />
               Coleman, and a ranching and farming coun-

               <br />
               as to where the permanent settlement is.

               I venture to state that there is not in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               that requires special representation. If you 
               <br />
               look at the map you will observe how the 
               <br />
               constituencies of the south are permitted to 
               <br />

               tuency, Stony Plain, is added in this unsur- 
               <br />
               veyed country, in which there is practically 
               <br />
               no permanent settlement. There is no rea- 
               <br />
               son why that constituency could not be re— 
               <br />
               presented, as it always has been, by parties 
               <br />
               living farther east or by one of the members 
               <br />
               for Edmonton. In that connection, I may 
               <br />
               say that I observe in the local papers that 
               <br />
               two, if not three, citizens of Edmonton have 
               <br />
               already been nominated for three constituen- 
               <br />
               cies in the north—Messrs. Cross and Boyle 
               <br />
               and another-showing that that section of 
               <br />
               the country could be properly looked after 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> a member residing at or near Edmonton. 
               <br />
               Take the constituency of High River in the 
               <br />
               south, with 1,605 names on the list, and with 
               <br />
               the thriving villages of High River, Oko- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i‘oks,</span> Nanton and Cayley, and with two

               banks chartered at High River and at Oko- 
               <br />
               tcks, and compare that with St. Albert, with 
               <br />
               only 950 names on the list. What I have 
               <br />
               said with regard to the land not being sur- 
               <br />
               veyed in the constituency of Stony Plain 
               <br />
               applies equally to the constituency ot St. 
               <br />
               Albert, showing that there is a lack of. per- 
               <br />
               manent settlement there. Contrast Medicine 
               <br />
               Hat, in the south, with 1,640 names on the

               <br />
               on the list. In comparing these two 
               <br />
               constituencies I desire to point out that the 
               <br />
               old consituency of Medicine Hat has been 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enlarged</span> by the addition of at least forty 
               <br />
               townships, for no reason presumably but 
               <br />
               that it is in the south ; because no person 
               <br />
               could contend that there has not been a con- 
               <br />
               siderable development and inﬂux of popula- 
               <br />
               tion into that constituency since the distri- 
               <br />
               bution of seats by the local assembly in May, 
               <br />
               1902. I have already pointed out that no 
               <br />
               additional representation is given in the 
               <br />
               constituencies of Cardston, Lethbridge or 
               <br />
               Medicine Hat, all of which happen to 
               <br />
               be in the southern part of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince; that no parallel case has been 
               <br />
               pointed out in the north; that then addi- 
               <br />
               tional representation has been given all 
               <br />
               along the line, constituencies being cut in 
               <br />
               two when there has been absolutely no 
               <br />
               necessity for it. In giving the calculations 
               <br />
               which I read a few moments ago, I omitted 
               <br />
               the constituencies of Athabaska and Peace 
               <br />
               River, for no other reason than that there 
               <br />
               was no vote cast there in the last election. 
               <br />
               There has never been an election there, and 
               <br />
               it was utterly impossible for anybody to 
               <br />
               make a calculation which would be at all 
               <br />
               authentic or deﬁnite. For that reason I pre- 
               <br />
