               <br />
               Montmagny (Mr. Armand Lavergne) this 
               <br />
               afternoon asked a question as to whether 
               <br />
               parliament had not the right to implant the 
               <br />
               French language in the new province. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir;</span> 
               <br />
               I answer to my hon. friend that I do not 
               <br />
               recognize that parliament has that right to 
               <br />
               implant the French language in those new 
               <br />
               Territories. Parliament may have the 
               <br />
               power to do so. but I deny that it has the 
               <br />
               right. Parliament has the power to do 
               <br />
               everything, but I deprecate the day when 
               <br />
               the French people of this country shall ask 
               <br />
               parliament to anything that they have the 
               <br />
               power to do if they have not at the 
               <br />
               same time the right to do it. These are the 
               <br />
               reasons for which I ask that this motion 
               <br />
               shall not be granted. These are the reasons 
               <br />
               why I say in the presence of friends and 
               <br />
               foes. in the hearing of the people in all parts

               of Canada and especially in the province of

               ister of Inland Revenue to prove that article 
               <br />
               7 of the Bill of Rights constituted a solemn 
               <br />

               ment how is it now that we are told there 
               <br />
               is no such pledge, that there. is no such 
               <br />
               agreement. that that Bill of Rights meant 
               <br />
               nothing as far as the preservation of the 
               <br />
               language of the minority is concerned. It 
               <br />
               is either one or the other, either the Bill of 
               <br />
               Rights meant something and then the whole 
               <br />
               Bill of Rights meant something, either 
               <br />
               clause 7 covering separate schools was 
               <br />
               guaranteed by this parliament or not. We 
               <br />
