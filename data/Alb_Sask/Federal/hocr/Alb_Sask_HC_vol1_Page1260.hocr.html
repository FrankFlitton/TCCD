               lt is a very fortunate thing that we have 
               <br />
               some active business men in this country 
               <br />
               like the Page Wire Fence Company, prepar— 
               <br />
               ed to intervene when a scheme like this is 
               <br />
               being put through, because it might not have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> brought before the House but for the 
               <br />
               timely intervention of those gentlemen and 
               <br />
               the information which they have given to 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from West Kent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mt.</span> Clem- 
               <br />
               ents). if some of our hon. friends are Will- 
               <br />
               ing to lay all kinds of crimes and misde- 
               <br />
               meanours at the door of hte Department of 
               <br />
               the Interior, I will say to them‘that that 
               <br />
               department has not a monopoly of them. 
               <br />
               We have these dredging matters to which 
               <br />
               I am going to refer again and I may say 
               <br />
               that only a day or two since <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> got some 
               <br />
               information about another dredging plant. 
               <br />
               Who own these dredging plants throughout 
               <br />
               Ontario to-day? Are they practical con- 
               <br />
               tractors ? Not one of them. Hangers-on, 
               <br />
               political judges and I am going to say to 
               <br />
               the House that in order to mislead and 
               <br />
               to delude the public a fraud is resorted to 
               <br />
               in making returns to the department at To- 
               <br />
               ronto as to who the stockholders of these 
               <br />
               companies are. This is to cover up their 
               <br />
               tracks, and yet the hon. acting Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works (Mr. Hyman) the other day 
               <br />
               got up here and asked the House and mY' 
               <br />
               self to accept his statement that he did not 
               <br />
               know that Mr.-McKay, of Owen Sound, was 
               <br />
               interested in a dredge and that Mr. McKay 
               <br />
               had never sent him notice of it. We all 
               <br />
               know that Mr. McKay is considerable of a 
               <br />
               traveller both on land and sea. We know 
               <br />
               that Mr. McKay’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">primary</span> business in com- 
               <br />
               ing to Ottawa must be to see whether or
