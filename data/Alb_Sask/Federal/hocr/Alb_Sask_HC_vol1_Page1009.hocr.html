               who did not know Dr. Robertson, but who 
               <br />
               had perhaps heard of him, that he was a 
               <br />
               broad—minded man, a man who could take 
               <br />
               a broad view of all questions. From. the 
               <br />
               year 1882 .to 1902, I have followed every 
               <br />
               one of Dr. Robertson’s reports presented to 
               <br />
               our church. I have followed these reports 
               <br />
               for twenty years, I have carefully looked 
               <br />
               into them, I have been myself a delegate 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘to</span> the assemblies of the Presbyterian 
               <br />
               church and I know that Dr. Robertson’s re- 
               <br />
               ports were full of information and dealt 
               <br />
               in the most comprehensive manner with the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. When I mention 
               <br />
               the fact that in all these reports I failed 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd one single word in twenty years 
               <br />
               against these schools in the Northwest it 
               <br />
               should have great weight with Protestants 
               <br />
               all over this country. If there was any- 
               <br />
               thing wrong with these schools in 1882, 
               <br />
               would not a broad—minded man like Dr. 
               <br />
               Robertson, whose life work was in the 
               <br />
               Northwest, have mentioned it in his ﬁrst 
               <br />
               report? Would he not have mentioned it 
               <br />
               in his second report, or would he not. in 
               <br />
               the twenty reports that he presented to 
               <br />
               the general assembly. have had something 
               <br />
               to say regarding that question ? I have a 
               <br />
               great many of these reports ,here. He gives 
               <br />
               ﬁrst a general sketch of the character and 
               <br />
               resources of the country and then he goes 
               <br />
               into the question as. it appeared at that 
               <br />
               time. of the economic and social develop- 
               <br />
               ment of the Northwest and his ﬁrm belief 
               <br />
               at that time was that the west was to be 
               <br />
               one of the most important parts of our 
               <br />
               land; it was to be one of the parts of our 
               <br />
               land that would contain more people than 
               <br />
               even the grand province of Ontario. He 
               <br />
               believed the day was coming when mil- 
               <br />
               lions would live .in peace and luxury in 
               <br />
               that country. In giving his opinion on 
               <br />
               all these things he was always pressing 
               <br />
               for men and money to help on the work 
               <br />
               of the church and I am glad to say. now 
               <br />
               that that great man is gone. that he was 
               <br />
               broad minded enough to ﬁnd no fault with 
               <br />
               any other church in all the reports he made 
               <br />
               to our church.
