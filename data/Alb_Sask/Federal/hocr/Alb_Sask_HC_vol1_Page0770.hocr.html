               attention of the House for any length of 
               <br />
               time. I would like probably on a further 
               <br />
               stage of the Bill to say a few words in re- 
               <br />
               gard to the question of Dominion lands, and 
               <br />
               perhaps in regard to the question of the

               boundaries of the provinces which are here

               the House and the country has been riveted

               presentative of the Protestant minority in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec it is especially right

               The existence of the Protestant minority 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec is probably the 
               <br />
               direct cause of the introduction of the separ- 
               <br />
               ate school provisions into the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, and the principle of which 
               <br />
               has been perpetuated when other provinces 
               <br />
               were afterwards admitted into the Do- 
               <br />
               minion or when provinces were created 
               <br />
               within the Dominion. It was due to Mr. 
               <br />
               Galt, the special representative of the Pro- 
               <br />
               testants of Quebec, that eXceptions were 
               <br />
               made in the control of educational matters 
               <br />
               given to the provinces under the British 
               <br />
               North—America Act. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Mr.</span> Galt insisted that 
               <br />
               the Protestants of Quebec should have a 
               <br />
               guarantee of their rights as a minority, and 
               <br />
               naturally that guarantee was extended to 
               <br />
               the other provinces in which there were 
               <br />
               separate schools established at the time of 
               <br />
               their entry into the union. Later on I shall 
               <br />
               deal with the question of separate schools 
               <br />
               per se, and I shall state why I believe in 
               <br />
               separate schools in our Dominion, and why 
               <br />
               I think the Protestants of this country 
               <br />
               generally should stand by the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority of Quebec in this matter, as they 
               <br />
               did in the negotiations which led up to the 
               <br />
               confederation compact of 1867. However, 
               <br />
               Sir, this is not the only issue which has 
               <br />
               been brought forward in this discussion. 
               <br />
               1Some who are bold and frank in the ex- 
               <br />
               pression of their opinions, have declared 
               <br />
               against separate schools in toto, others have 
               <br />
               hidden themselves behind the cry of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights and have attempted in this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way</span> to abolish the principle of separate 
               <br />
               schools in so far as it may be embodied in 
               <br />
               this Autonomy Bill. The amendment of the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition would leave this 
               <br />
               question in the hands of the two provinces.

               While. under ordinary circumstances, and 
               <br />
               by the Confederation Act, education in gen-

               <br />

               it seems to me that when we discuss any 
               <br />
               question of provincial rights we must take 
               <br />
               just as much account of the exception that 
               <br />
               is made as of the general statement that to 
               <br />
               the provincial authorities belongs the juris- 
               <br />
               diction on education. I believe that in con— 
               <br />
               sidering the principles of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enception</span> is just as strong- 
               <br />
               .ly embodied, and is just as important a part 
               <br />
               of that Act, as is the statement that the 
               <br />
               provincial authorities should control educa- _ 
               <br />
               tional matters. I am not a lawyer; I do 
               <br />
               not want to discuss this matter from a legal 
               <br />
               and constitutional aspect, I probably am not 
               <br />
               capable of doing so; but the fact that one 
               <br />
               is not a lawyer is no very great disability 
               <br />
               in this particular case, because we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the lawyers differ very materially. Hardly 
               <br />
               a constitutional point has arisen in this de- 
               <br />
               Ibate which has not elicited diverse views 
               <br />
               from eminent lawyers, and under these cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances I do not know that I, as a lay- 
               <br />
               man, need shrink from discussing the con- 
               <br />
               stitutional question. But, Sir, I believe it 
               <br />
               is more in the interest of the question at 
               <br />
               issue, and more in the interest of the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the country at large, that theSe points 
               <br />
               should not be dealt with from any technical 
               <br />
               or purely legal aspect, but that they should 
               <br />
               be dealt with on the broad principles of 
               <br />
               justice and equity ; the principles upon 
               <br />
               which our confederation is based, and upon 
               <br />
               which we have existed as a confederation 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">siuCe</span> 1867. The British North America Act 
               <br />
               itself asserts the principle of separate 
               <br />
               schools in a limited degree as applying to 
               <br />
               the four original provinces of confederation. 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island and British Columbia 
               <br />
               afterwards came into confederation, and the 
               <br />
               principles and the provisions of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act were made to apply to 
               <br />
               these provinces, for, as they had at the time 
               <br />
               of their entry into the Dominion no system 
               <br />
               of separate schools, there was no necessity 
               <br />
               for any precise speciﬁcation with regard to 
               <br />
               the educational clauses of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act in relation to them. When 
               <br />
               Manitoba was created a province there was 
               <br />
               a special provision inserted into section 93 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act to pro- 
               <br />
               vide, as it was thought at the time, for the 
               <br />
               peculiar conditions in Manitoba, and direct- 
               <br />
               ly pointing to the endorsement and the con- 
               <br />
               tinuance of the principle of separate schools 
               <br />
               found in the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               It is true that this intention was imperfectly 
               <br />
               carried out ; it is true. the provisions of the 
               <br />
               Manitoba Act were not speciﬁc enough ap- 
               <br />
               parently to accomplish the object its fram- 
               <br />
               ers had in View. That was attended by dis- 
               <br />
               astrous results to the minority in Manitoba, 
               <br />
