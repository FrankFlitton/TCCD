               Mr. Campbell, manifested no indignation. 
               <br />
               or at least the indignation was bottled up six 
               <br />
               weeks nearly before we heard anythingabout 
               <br />
               it. And yet these very gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               are the men who talk about this govern— 
               <br />
               ment having something to do with the 
               <br />
               gentleman who occupies a high position 
               <br />
               in connection with one of the churches of 
               <br />
               the land. My hon. friend from East Grey 
               <br />
               does not think that the ablegate drew up 
               <br />
               these clauses himself, and the only one- 
               <br />
               he could think of was the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice, and when the Minister of Justice did 
               <br />
               not rise at once to contradict him—the Min— 
               <br />
               ister of Justice would be on his feet all the 
               <br />
               time if he tried to keep contradicting all 
               <br />
               the suspicious of the member for East 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Grey—the</span> hon. gentleman took it for grant— 
               <br />
               ed that the charge was proven, till the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice thought it worth while 
               <br />
               to tell him that he was altogether mistaken. 
               <br />
               The member for East Grey wants to know 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lwho</span> drew the clauses. I cannot tell. I

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> a more natural conclusion to arrive at that

               <br />
               tice, who knew nothing about it at all. 
               <br />
               But talking about interviewing people and 
               <br />
               talking about rumours, with which the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition and his friends 
               <br />
               deal so largely. When the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition got the emphatic denial 
               <br />
               of the Prime Minister yesterday, the best 
               <br />
               thing left for him to say, as he thought, 
               <br />
               :was: well, this thing has been rumoured 
               <br />
               and why didn’t the Prime Minister deny it 
               <br />
               sooner? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">That</span> was a mighty poor refuge 
               <br />
               for the leader of the opposition to seek. 
               <br />
               But, I think there were some rumours a 
               <br />
               couple of years ago when the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition and his band of trained followers 
               <br />
               made an excursion out west to tl'y and 
               <br />
               capture the votes of the people. The mem- 
               <br />
               ber for East Grey was With the party, and 
               <br />
               rumour had it that when they got to Win— 
               <br />
