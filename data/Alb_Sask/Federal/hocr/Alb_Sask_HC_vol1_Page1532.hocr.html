               difﬁculty is that you have a Protestant

               <br />
               and Presbyterians and Methodists, making 
               <br />
               up the minority forming a school that is 'a

               separate Protestant school, how are you

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">school</span> ? Because the tenets of these three

               the legislation of this country, whether it

               has been Dominion or provincial legislation, 
               <br />
               denominational schools have been conﬁned 
               <br />
               to two classes of His Majesty’s subjects, 
               <br />
               that is the Protestants on the one hand and 
               <br />
               the Catholics on the other. That is the only

               because the words ‘ denominational schools ’ 
               <br />
               is used in a general sense as far as Pro- 
               <br />
               testants are concerned. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               must admit that the expression ‘denomin- 
               <br />
               ational sghools’ was a distinction between 
               <br />
               Protestant and Catholic schools, exclusive— 
               <br />
               ly, and I say all through our legislation they 
               <br />
               have been treated as such. Nobody has 
               <br />
               ever thought in speaking of denominational 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               other sect, separate schools, it has always 
               <br />
               been a separation as between Protestants
