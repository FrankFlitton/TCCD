               not bring down the number of the school

               <br />
               to the census of 1901. I think the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior will agree with me that it 
               <br />
               is no index to the number of people in the

               try. In other words the stream of im- 
               <br />
               migration varies. The minister himself 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gave</span> us an instance-the other day of a

               was an exceptionally large stream of

               immigration going in. I therefore can- 
               <br />
               not see that the census ﬁgures of 1901 are 
               <br />
               any more indication as to the proportion-

               a clerk in the Agriculture Department 
               <br />
               here without going into the country at all. 
               <br />
               The reason I say that is because the dif- 
               <br />
               ference between <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:the</span> votes polled and the 
               <br />
               census population in some constituencies 
               <br />
               is very‘ startling. In Rosebud there were 
               <br />
               733 votes polled, and in the census of 
               <br />
               1.001 only 1,036 people; evidently that 
               <br />
               township has increased very rapidly. In 
               <br />
               High River, the one next to it, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vgtes</span> 
               <br />
               polled were 1,021 and the census popula- 
               <br />
               tion in 1901, 2,472, showing “that it had 
               <br />
               not increased nearly as fast as Rosebud. 
               <br />
               In the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same‘way</span> I might go down the 
               <br />
               list and ﬁnd many other discrepancies ot' 
               <br />
               a similar nature. It therefore seems to 
               <br />
               me that, in View of the fact that the 
               <br />
               NOrthwest has been growing so rapidly 
               <br />
               and that the growth in different sec- 
               <br />
               tions has not been equal, it is absolutely 
               <br />
               impossible to form any judgment what— 
               <br />
               ever from the census of 1001 as to the 
               <br />
               number of people in the different sections 
               <br />
               of the proposed province of Alberta to- 
               <br />
               day. I submit that there are only two 
               <br />
               sets of ﬁgures that are of any value to any

               of people in that province to-day and the 
               <br />
               chief one is the voters’ list of last fall

               and to a certain extent the number of 
               <br />
               votes cast. Any other ﬁgures, it seems 
               <br />
               to me, are absolutely useless and only 
               <br />
               tend to confuse the minds of hon. gentle-
