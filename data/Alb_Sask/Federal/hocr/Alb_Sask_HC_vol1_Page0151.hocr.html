               Mr. PATERSON. I am not arguing the 
               <br />
               legal point with the hon. gentleman, I am 
               <br />
               simply pointing out that the best legal 
               <br />
               minds we have in the country do not agree. 
               <br />
               Now there was a very large meeting held 
               <br />
               in the city of Toronto last Monday, in Mas- 
               <br />
               sey Hall. The multitude assembled were 
               <br />
               evidently deeply moved by the subject of 
               <br />
               discussion, namely, the educational clauses 
               <br />
               of this Bill. There was present a legal 
               <br />
               gentleman whose standing in the profession 
               <br />
               I do not know ; I see he is a King’s Counsel, 
               <br />
               and I have no doubt he is a gentleman pos— 
               <br />
               sessed of legal knowledge. Evidently he 
               <br />
               felt warmly on this subject, for he moved 
               <br />
               a resolution protesting against the passage 
               <br />
               of the Bill. In the resolution which was 
               <br />
               to be forwarded to the Prime Minister he 
               <br />
               proposes one of three different courses in 
               <br />
               dealing with this question. I am taking 
               <br />
               now the report of the meeting published in 
               <br />
               the Toronto ‘World,’ which I presume will 
               <br />
               be accepted by hon. gentlemen opposite. 
               <br />
               In speaking to his resolution he replied to 
               <br />
               the arguments of the Prime Minister as to 
               <br />
               the bearing of section 93 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. He said that if what 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister had contended was true, 
               <br />
               then there was no necessity to do anything 
               <br />
               further. Then he considered what Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               tain had contended for, and could not agree 
               <br />
               with that. The third view, and the one that 
               <br />
               was likely, from his own opinion, to prevail 
               <br />
               was that under the British North America 
               <br />
               Amendment Act of 1871, power was vested in 
               <br />
               the Dominion parliament to deal with this 
               <br />
               educational question in the constitution of 
               <br />
               the new provinces, as it saw ﬁt; and, said 
               <br />
               he, that is the supreme reason why we want 
               <br />
               to speak out now, because that power is 
               <br />
               in the hands of the Dominion parliament, 
               <br />
               and if they exercise it now it is irrevocable 
               <br />
               for all time to come. The legal gentleman 
               <br />
               to whom I refer was Mr. Thomson, K.C., of 
               <br />
               Toronto. Hon. gentlemen may read his 
               <br />
               opinion for themselves. Now amidst all 
               <br />
               these conﬂicting opinions as to whether we 
               <br />
               have this power, the leader of the opposi— 
               <br />
               tion proposes to leave this question un- 
               <br />
               settled. no one knowing Where they are, 
               <br />
               nothing deﬁnite, the country to be left in 
               <br />
               a turmoil in reference to this matter for a 
               <br />
               long time to come. If there is such a divi- 
               <br />
               sion among the legal gentlemen, may not the 
               <br />
               same doubt exist in the Supreme Court, the 
               <br />
               same doubt in the Privy Council ? And all 
               <br />
               this time you have the delay. What shall

               gave, as far as I understood them, the dif—

               doubts, speaks of the necessity for further

               consideration and hints that it is possible 
               <br />
               it may be necessary, in order to supple—

               templated that parliament had powers in

               this matter and that view, in my humble
