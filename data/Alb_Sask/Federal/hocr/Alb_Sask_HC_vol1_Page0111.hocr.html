               is to keep within its terms, the proper course 
               <br />
               is simply to provide that the general pro-

               visions of the British North America Act

               to the new provinces. It is the only course 
               <br />
               to pursue, and I stated a moment ago, what 
               <br />
               I now repeat that if the government

               of this country, instead of embarking 
               <br />
               on their present course had simply con- 
               <br />
               ﬁned themselves to a proposal of that 
               <br />
               kind, protecting the rights of all parties 
               <br />
               under the constitution, as it was originally 
               <br />
               framed, there would have been no arousing 
               <br />
               of passion, or prejudice, or strife, and this 
               <br />
               difﬁcult and delicate question could, I think, 
               <br />
               have been settled without any such discord 
               <br />
               as that which we have unfortunately known

               spoken of, why is it necessary to distort, to

               <br />
               to follow a course which arouses passion, 
               <br />
               discord and discontent. Let the rights of 
               <br />
               all be governed according to the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion, and no injustice will be done; and, 
               <br />
               more than that, no injustice will be felt.

               The right hon. gentleman and his colleagues

               have been advocates of provincial rights, 
               <br />
               champions of conciliation, in the past, and 
               <br />
               after all conciliation is better than coercion. 
               <br />
               The Prime Minister has laid that principle 
               <br />
               down many times, and I am sorry he has
