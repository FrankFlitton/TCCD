               the right hon. gentleman proposed to give

               <br />
               with education. On the eve of an election, 
               <br />
               when the right hon. gentleman wanted to

               secure for his candidates in that country the 
               <br />
               votes of the people, he tells them that he 
               <br />
               will consider the question of provincial au— 
               <br />
               tonomy. Did he hint for one moment that 
               <br />
               he only intended to giVu them a partial 
               <br />

               that can be given to a people in a measure 
               <br />
               of autonomy '? No, he told the people that 
               <br />
               he would give them provincial autonomy, 
               <br />

               <br />
               result of his statement was that the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of provincial autonomy was not an 
               <br />
               issue in the elections in the Territories. be-

               cause Conservatives as well as Liberals 
               <br />
               were pledged to grant the Territories self—

               government and to create them into new 
               <br />
               provinces. The right hon. gentleman had a 
               <br />
               decided advantage when he succeeded in 
               <br />
               getting that question out of the political 
               <br />
               arena during the political campaign and 
               <br />
               allowing the electors to decide 011 other 
               <br />
               issues altogether. I do not like to use an 
               <br />
               expression that might seem unkind, but 
               <br />
               I am bound to say that the right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman certainly did mislead the people 
               <br />
               of the west. Not only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did</span> he mislead those 
               <br />
               in authority there, but he misled the en— 
               <br />
               tire electorate, by leaving them under the 
               <br />
               impression that they were going to get 
               <br />
               their fullest rights as citizens and free men 
               <br />
               unrestricted and untrammelled. It is not 
               <br />
               using too strong a term when I say that 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman, wittingly or un- 
               <br />
               wittingly, misled the people of that great 
               <br />
               country on the eve of the general elections, 
               <br />
               and the result was that the right hon. gen-

               <br />
               Bill, and in this House and inthe country 
               <br />
               we speak of it as an autonomy Bill. That 
               <br />
               is entirely a misnomer; it is not an auto- 
               <br />
               nomy Bill. To use an illustration we some- 
               <br />
               times speak of a joint stock company and 
               <br />
               after it we ﬁnd the word ‘limited ;’ so in 
               <br />

               <br />
               tonomy Bill we should call it an autonomy 
               <br />
               Bill limited. I confess that I am surprised 
               <br />
               to hear so many people speaking of this as 
               <br />
               an autonomy Bill when as a matter of 
               <br />
               fact it is only limited autonomy. In 1875 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories were organized 
               <br />
               under an Act of this parliament and were 
               <br />
               given what we call a territorial charter. 
               <br />
               Under that charter they were enabled to 
               <br />
               administer their local aﬁairs, to construct 
               <br />
               bridges, to administer their educational af- 
               <br />
               fairs in a limited way, and to do what is 
               <br />
               generally done by any provincial govern— 
               <br />
               ment. The Territories were not then given 
               <br />
               the full status of a provincial government. 
               <br />
               I do not think it is seriously contended by 
               <br />
               any one in this House or out of it that that 
               <br />
               Territorial Act was ever intended to be per- 
               <br />
               manent. I apprehend that those who sat 
               <br />
               in this House in 1875 realized the fact that 
               <br />
               that law would only remain in force until 
               <br />
               these Territories were divided into pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, and that when that time came then 
               <br />
               the Territorial Act would be wiped out and 
               <br />
               the new constitution take its place. We can 
               <br />
               all realize that this was the object of the par— 
               <br />
