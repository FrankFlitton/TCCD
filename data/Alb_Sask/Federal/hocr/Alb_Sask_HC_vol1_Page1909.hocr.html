               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BOURAJSSA.</span> That is what I said,. 
               <br />
               but a year later another imperial statute 
               <br />
               declared that, for the purposes of the union, 
               <br />
               Rupert’s Land shall include that country 
               <br />
               and the whole of the Territories. As a. 
               <br />
               matter of fact, Rupert’s Land is named in 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. but it is de- 
               <br />
               ﬁned in the letters patent granted by Charles 
               <br />
               the Second to the Hudson Company: and 
               <br />
               the limit of Manitoba, as created a province- 
               <br />
               by this parliament in 1870, had nothing to 
               <br />
               do with the Rupert’s Land as deﬁned by 
               <br />
               the letters patent granted by Charles the 
               <br />
               Second two centuries previous. It was 
               <br />
               never imagined then that the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada would subsequently carve a pro-

               vince out of that territory to be called 
               <br />
               Manitoba and set limits to it. As stated 
               <br />
               by the right hon. the First Minister this

               <br />
               Rupert’s Land formerly included all the
