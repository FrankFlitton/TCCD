               United States government asking them to

               pay part of the cost of this fence ? They 
               <br />
               certainly should pay part of the cost of that 
               <br />
               fence. The fence will not only require to 
               <br />
               be built but to be maintained; from time 
               <br />
               to time it will no doubt be broken down, 
               <br />
               800 miles of fence will not stand for ever. 
               <br />
               and it appears to me that this government 
               <br />
               should ask the United States in all fairness. 
               <br />
               as our neighbours, friendly, and as jointly 
               <br />
               interested in the territory, that they should 
               <br />
               pay a fair share of the fence that is to be 
               <br />
               erected. I commend this point to the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of the government and I trust that 
               <br />
               if it is due to us that the United States pay 
               <br />
               a part of the cost, they will see that the 
               <br />
               United States do pay a part both of the 
               <br />
               cost of construction and the cost of main- 
               <br />
               tenance, inasmuch as the fence is really

               an international boundary.

               Mr. W. H. BENNETT. The other day, in 
               <br />
               discussing the question of dredging I made 
               <br />
               a statement—and I have no reason to take 
               <br />
               it back in consequence of anything that has 
               <br />
               been said since—that in certain departments 
               <br />
               of the government, so far as the riding I 
               <br />
               represent is concerned. the public is of 
               <br />
               opinion that common honesty is not ex- 
               <br />
               pected, and common honesty would be at a 
               <br />
               premium. That seems to be the ditﬁcultyin 
               <br />
               this matter. Now the secretary of the de- 
               <br />
               partment, Mr. Keyos, is to be dragged in as 
               <br />
               a scapegoat, and after the statement has 
               <br />
               been made in the House, and after this 
               <br />
               gentleman gives a written and explicit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁ-</span> 
               <br />
               cial letter that a contract has been made, 
               <br />
               then we are told to-day that no contract has 
               <br />
               been made. I do not know Mr. Keyes, but 
               <br />
               I can only say that it is a great draught 
               <br />
               on any man’s imagination to believe that 
               <br />
               a gentleman occupying the responsible posi- 
               <br />
               tion of sectrenary of the department goes 
               <br />
               and makes large contracts of a quarter 
               <br />
               of a million dollars without the assent 
               <br />
               of the minister. and without conference 
               <br />
               with him. But Mr Keyes cannot back 
               <br />
               out of it so easy, and the department can- 
               <br />
               not back out of it so easy, because there is 
               <br />
               correspondence to-day on the ‘Hansard’ to 
               <br />
               which -I must now revert. I regret that 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker is in the chair, because of neces- 
               <br />
               sity his name is brought into the discussion.

               under date April 8th, a letter signed by Mr. P.

               Mr. Speaker. must have gone to the depart-

               and I do not believe, if Mr. Speaker did

               write that letter to this ﬁrm. that he had; 
               <br />
               concocted it out of his own mind, that the

               Speaker had drawn on his imagination to 
               <br />
               that extent. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that you 
               <br />
               went to the department, I believe that you 
               <br />
               found there the secretary of the department, 
               <br />
               or whoever was in charge of this matter, 
               <br />
               and that the gentleman in charge informed 
               <br />
               you exactly what Mr. Keyes had written 
               <br />
               before, namely, that the contract had been 
               <br />
               made. But here is the striking feature in 
               <br />
               connection with this whole deal—because it - 
               <br />
               is a deal—it never would have leaked out 
               <br />
               had it not been for this ﬁrm. It is only in 
               <br />
               ridings represented by hon. gentlemen on 
               <br />
               this side of the House that many matters 
               <br />
               are likely to come to the front, because when 
               <br />
               a riding is not represented on this side of the 
               <br />
               House the chances are that matters go with— 
               <br />
               out comment in those ridings. Why, to 
               <br />
               give this Department of the Interior all the 
               <br />
               brunt of that crooked work is unfair when 
               <br />
               you take it in connection with other depart- 
               <br />
               ments, and more particularly when the past 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior has been either

               and I am not saying the Department of the
