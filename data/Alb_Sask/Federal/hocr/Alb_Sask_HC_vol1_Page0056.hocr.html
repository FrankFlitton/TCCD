               at any length into the suggested dividing

               feel that I would be remiss in my duty if 1 
               <br />
               did not point out some of the objections that 
               <br />
               are coming from that country in regard to 
               <br />
               this proposed divided line. This line, I may 
               <br />
               say, is placed right in the heart of the ranch- 
               <br />
               ing country. I have in my hand a map pub- 
               <br />
               lished by the Department of the Interior. 
               <br />
               and on which the ranching country in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories is shown, and from 
               <br />
               which it can be seen that but a very small 
               <br />
               portion of the ranching country is to be 
               <br />
               placed in the eastern province of Saskatche— 
               <br />
               wan. The objection to that division is that 
               <br />
               the ranching country in that eastern pro- 
               <br />
               vince will have such small representation 
               <br />
               in the local House that its demands and its 
               <br />
               needs may not receive the recognition which 
               <br />
               they deserve. The people inhabiting that 
               <br />
               district have realized this, and so they sent 
               <br />
               their resolution of protest down to their 
               <br />
               representative in this House. Another ob-

               jection which may seem of small concern to 
               <br />
               the people of the east, but which is very im— 
               <br />
               portant to the people of the west, is that 
               <br />
               by placing a portion of the ranching terri- 
               <br />
               tory in the eastern province there is a possi- 
               <br />
               bility that there will be a conﬂict in the 
               <br />
               branding laws, which would undoubtedly 
               <br />
               lead to great inconvenience.

               <br />
               the Prime Minister when introducing the 
               <br />
               Bill discussed the question as to whether 
               <br />
               or not it was advisable to give Manitoba, 
               <br />
               with a population then of 10,000 a provin- 
               <br />
               cial status in 1870, and he suggested that 
               <br />
               it would have been better to allow them 
               <br />
               to mature by gradual process. If that view 
               <br />
               were sound in regard to Manitoba is it not 
               <br />
               equally applicable to—day to this great 
               <br />
               northern country? Is .there any great de- 
               <br />
               mand from that northern country to be in- 
               <br />
               cluded in any province ? I believe that they 
               <br />
               need and are entitled to the establishment 
               <br />
               of courts of law and a further measure of 
               <br />
               civil justice, but I have not heard there is 
               <br />
               any demand for autonomy in the district 
               <br />
               of Athabaska. Would it not be just as 
               <br />
               logical to add the Yukon to British Colum- 
               <br />
               bia or to add Keewatin to Ontario or to 
               <br />
               add Ungava to Quebec. as to add the dis- 
               <br />
               trict of Athabaska to the western province 
               <br />
               and extend that territory to the north? 
               <br />
               There is this additional objection: that 
               <br />
               under the proposed autonomy Bill the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces have no interest in the lands, mines, 
               <br />
               or minerals, and that is an important con- 
               <br />
               sideration when we are dealing with this 
               <br />
