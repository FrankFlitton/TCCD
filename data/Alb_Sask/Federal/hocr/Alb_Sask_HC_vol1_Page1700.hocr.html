               <br />
               these things apply equally well at the pres- 
               <br />
               ent day as in former times. The concession 
               <br />
               has been made by the opposition during this 
               <br />
               discussion that Athabaska should get at 
               <br />
               least one member. When the debate com- 
               <br />
               menced four days ago, gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               contended that Athabaska should not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative,</span> but that the boundaries of 
               <br />
               St. Albert <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and.</span> Sturgeon should be extended 
               <br />
               north to the limits of Athabaska and Mac- 
               <br />
               kenzie, and that Athabaska should be in- 
               <br />
               cluded in these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituencies.</span> That was the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁmt</span> proposition made by gentlemen on the 
               <br />
               other side. They have evidently now come 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that this would not be fair 
               <br />
               to the people now in Athabaska as well as 
               <br />
               to people who are going into that Territory, 
               <br />
               and who have their GWn interests and their 
               <br />
               own requirements, and whose voice should 
               <br />
               be heard in the legislature of the province. 
               <br />
               The point now is whether Athabaska should 
               <br />
               have one member or two. If we look at the 
               <br />
               population alone I grant that one member 
               <br />
               ought to be enough, but if you look at the 
               <br />
               peculiarities of the geographical conditions, 
               <br />
               I leave it to the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               himself and to his friends behind him to 
               <br />
               say whether or not it is fair that you should 
               <br />
               have only a single <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative</span> for that 
               <br />
               immense territory in which there are at 
               <br />
               present no lines of communication, in which 
               <br />
               the settlements are centred upon the Peace 
               <br />
               and the Athabaska rivers, and between 
               <br />
               which two rivers so far as I know there is 
               <br />
               no direct communication. Under such cir- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cumstances</span> I ask if it would be reasonable 
               <br />
               to give only one representative-to the dis- 
               <br />
               trict of Athabaska. I do not pronounce 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">categorically</span> on the question; I am willing 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> listen to argument, but again I repeat 
               <br />
               that unless I am greatly mistaken no one 
               <br />
               would begrudge two members to the district 
               <br />
               of Athabaska, but for the fact that the 
               <br />
               capital has to be selected and the gentlemen 
               <br />
               from Calgary seem to think that if Atha- 
               <br />
               baska is given two representatives instead 
               <br />
               of one, Calgary has no chance of being the 
               <br />
               capital. My hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
               <br />
               suggests <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">new</span> that we should adopt another 
               <br />
               method of division and take as a basis the 
               <br />
               four federal electoral districts of Calgary, 
               <br />
               Alberta, Saskatchewan and Strathcona, giv- 
               <br />
               ing six members to one, and three members 
               <br />
               to another, and ﬁve members to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">another.</span> 
               <br />
               Why not give six members to the other in- 
               <br />
               stead of ﬁve. I do not know how that 
               <br />
               would work out. If you gave six members 
               <br />
               to these districts, you might also have to 
               <br />
               give six to the others ; .but it seems to me 
               <br />
               that the best thing to do is not to do that in 
               <br />
               advance, but to take up the constituencies 
               <br />
               as they are on the map, one after another, 
               <br />
               and see whether they are fair or not, and, if 
               <br />
               they are :not fair, to try to rectify them.

               that the question of the capital does not

               if there were no question of the capital 
               <br />

               territory which is to form part of the new 
               <br />
               province of Alberta. I do not like the word 
               <br />
               ‘begrudge,’ I am not begrudging anything; 
               <br />
               I am proposing to allot to every man in the

               province of Alberta, so far as we can reason- 
               <br />
               ably do it, the same voice in the legislature 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> every other man has. My right hon. 
               <br />
               friend talks of a concession having been 
               <br />
               made. I thought I had made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myself</span> reason- 
               <br />
               ably clear. I stated Over and over again 
               <br />
               that I did not think there was any evidence 
               <br />
               before this committee that would justify the 
               <br />
               conclusion that there are 5,000 people in 
               <br />
               that unorganized territory. I am of that 
               <br />
               opinion still. But we have got past that, 
               <br />
               not as a matter of fact, but for the purpose 
               <br />
               of this argument. I am taking the estimates 
               <br />
               made by the members of the administration 
               <br />
               themselves, and I am pointing out that 245.— 
               <br />
               000 people are to have a representation of . 
               <br />

               <br />
               sentation of 2. Can we concede for a

               moment that there are conditions which 
               <br />

               provision in this Bill that the members

               represent them, although residing at Ed-

               monton. What advantage or necessity is 
               <br />
               there in having two. representatives instead of

               population of 5,000 or 6,000 scattered over a 
               <br />
               thousand miles of that territory, would you

               give them three or four or ﬁve members be- 
               <br />
               cause the territory would be so much larger? 
               <br />
               I have never heard of such an argument be- 
               <br />
               fore. My right hon. friend refers to the 
               <br />
               illustrations given by the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, and talks about Quebec West 
               <br />
               and Yale-Caribou. We are not discussing 
               <br />
               Quebec West or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yale-Cari‘boo.</span> I assume

               that there were conditions that made it
