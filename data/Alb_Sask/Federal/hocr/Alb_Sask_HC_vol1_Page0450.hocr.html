               At this point I wish to look a little closely

               at the meaning of this language so far as 
               <br />
               education is concerned. Hon. members who 
               <br />

               particular friends of the Northwest, have 
               <br />
               nothing to say against this draft Act, so 
               <br />
               far as I can understand. They say there 
               <br />
               are terms in the proposed Act of the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) which bring 
               <br />
               the separate schools into effect in the North- 
               <br />
               west. and they declare they are not in fav- 
               <br />
               our of such a policy. At the same time, I 
               <br />
               do not think they have anything to say 
               <br />
               against this draft Act of Mr. Haultain’s. 
               <br />
               If you examine this clause closely you will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd what Mr. Haultain means is that what- 
               <br />
               ever is in existence in the Territories to- 
               <br />

               had been a law in force in 1867, the time of 
               <br />
               confederation. What is the law in force in 
               <br />
               the Territories? Is not the Act of 1875 as 
               <br />
               much in force to-day as it was when it was 
               <br />
               passed? It has not been repealed. The 
               <br />
               fact that ordinances have been based upon 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               not take away the validity of the Act. That 
               <br />
               Act created separate schools, and that is 
               <br />
               the Act which Mr. Haultain says is to be 
               <br />
               continued in force as if had been passed in 
               <br />
               1867. That is the effect of what Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               tain proposes, as I understand it. And while 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposed to the government 
               <br />
               are unwilling to take separate schools from 
               <br />
               us, they are ready to swallow them bolus 
               <br />
               bolus when offered by Mr. Haultain. I am

               <br />
               the right thing in recognizing the conditions 
               <br />

               I have pointed out the different conditions

               <br />

               <br />
               20 deals with the school question. So it is 
               <br />
               precisely the same as the Act now before 
               <br />

               <br />
               necessary to point out—the ideas which pre-

               vail in connection with this constitution 
               <br />
               which was given to the Territories in 1875. 
               <br />
               It has been observed here by the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Marquette that nothing that Alex. 
               <br />
               Mackenzie and Edward Blake, and old men 
               <br />
               of that kind said should not receive very 
               <br />
               much attention. I do not regard Hon. Ed- 
               <br />
               ward Blake‘s views on constitutional ques- 
               <br />
               tions in that way. I think that Mr. Blake 
               <br />
               was a big man on constitutional questions 
               <br />
               in 1875; I think he has been a big man on 
               <br />
               constitutional questions every year since, 
               <br />
               and I believe he is a big man on constitu- 
               <br />
               tional questions to-day; and for that reason
