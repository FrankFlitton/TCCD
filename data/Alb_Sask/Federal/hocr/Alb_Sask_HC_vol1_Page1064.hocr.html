               Bill discussion in a way that was most dia- 
               <br />
               bolical. The facts have already been fully 
               <br />
               given by the right hon. First Minister, but 
               <br />
               they will bear repeating. M1. Rogers begged 
               <br />
               an interview of the government on the 
               <br />
               boundary question and afterwards published 
               <br />
               a statement intended to lead the public to 
               <br />
               believe that he came to Ottawa at the soh— 
               <br />
               citation of the right hon. First Minister. 
               <br />
               He and Mr. Campbell urged on the premier 
               <br />
               and his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">associates</span> the extension of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba’s boundaries to the westward and to 
               <br />
               Hudson bay. Naturally they were in- 
               <br />
               formed that it could not possibly be done 
               <br />
               unless the other provinces were ‘consulted in 
               <br />
               regard to the question. The hon. the Post- 
               <br />
               master General (Sir William Mulock) was 
               <br />
               very emphatic in the statement that no ex- 
               <br />
               tension of their territory should take place, 
               <br />
               and that Ontario must be heard on this im- 
               <br />
               portant question as it had rights in this 
               <br />
               matter. The hon. Postmaster General in— 
               <br />
               sisted upon this province being heard while 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers. in the meantime, insisted that 
               <br />
               Ontario had no rights in the matter. But 
               <br />
               the hon. Postmaster <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General,</span> as the repre- 
               <br />
               sentative of this province, stood ﬁrm on this 
               <br />
               question, as he always stands on every 
               <br />
               question which is for the beneﬁt of the 
               <br />
               country. He withdrew from the conference 
               <br />
               and the matter was at an end. Now, the 
               <br />
               plotting began. The Manitoba delegate 
               <br />
               waited on the Papal ablegate and got him. 
               <br />
               no doubt 'at his suggestion, to put into 
               <br />
               writing his wishes in regard to the educa- 
               <br />
               tion of the minority in the province of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba. This private document, of which the 
               <br />
               government had no knowledge until it was 
               <br />
               made public by Mr. Rogers, was used to 
               <br />
               make political capital in the interests of 
               <br />
               Dominion Conservatives and they made a 
               <br />
               useless effort to lead the public to believe 
               <br />
               that they were promised that if they would 
               <br />
               grant the wish of the ablegate their bounti- 
               <br />
               aries would be extended. While all this 
               <br />
               was taking place no doubt the delegates 
               <br />
               were thinking of the words of the Post- 
               <br />
               master General that no extension could take 
               <br />
               place, and also of the words of the right 
               <br />
               hon. First Minister in introducing the Bill 
               <br />
               on February 21st when he said that no ex- 
               <br />
               tension could take place until the sister pro- 
               <br />
               vinces were consulted on this matter. The 
               <br />
               right hon. Prime Minister at this time said 
               <br />
               that he had the authority of his colleagues 
               <br />
               to make that announcement. The provinces 
               <br />
               of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan must meet here and decide on the im- 
               <br />
               portant question of the division of this par- 
               <br />
               ticular territory in the interests of all the 
               <br />
               people connected with the question. Yet, 
               <br />
               in the light of these statements made to the 
               <br />
               Manitoba delegates in private conference 
               <br />
               and from the ﬂoor of this House, they had 
               <br />
               the stupid impudence to insinuate that the 
               <br />
               government were prepared to make a 
               <br />
               crooked deal with them. Their plot had not 
               <br />
               even the merit of cleverness.
