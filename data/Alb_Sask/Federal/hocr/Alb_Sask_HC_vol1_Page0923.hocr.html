               -the right hon. gentleman in Manitoba, and 
               <br />

               lynchings is the part of the country that 
               <br />
               did not have a public school at all until 
               <br />

               <br />
               they burned witches 250 years ago. They 
               <br />
               burned witches long after _ that in some 
               <br />
               other countries, but the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> did

               ing witches there they had no public school 
               <br />
               in that country. They were religious zeal-
