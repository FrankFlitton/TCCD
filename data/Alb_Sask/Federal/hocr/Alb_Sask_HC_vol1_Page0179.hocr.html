               What would that preserve? First of all, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, it would preserve everything 
               <br />
               that is set out in chapters 29, 30 and 31 of 
               <br />
               the ordinances ; there cannot be any possible 
               <br />
               doubt about that. In the next place, it 
               <br />
               might preserve everything that is set out 
               <br />
               in section 14 of the Act of 1875. It might, 
               <br />
               and it might not. It might be held by a 
               <br />
               court that the privileges held by law at the 
               <br />
               union were the privileges de facto possessed 
               <br />
               under the ordinances as they existed at the 
               <br />
               union, and the court might refuse to go 
               <br />
               back to the provisions of the Act of 1875. 
               <br />
               It is evident that there was a doubt about 
               <br />
               this, because the Bill re—enacts clause 14 
               <br />
               of the Act of 1875, and thus it is revived, 
               <br />
               crystallized and made absolutely certain. I 
               <br />
               have pointed out to you what Mr. Forget, 
               <br />
               Mr. Justice Rouleau, Archbishop Taché, Sir 
               <br />
               John Thompson, and Mr. Haultain, thought 
               <br />
               as to the Act of 1875. It is the fact that 
               <br />
               under the Act of 1875, a complete dual sys- 
               <br />
               tem of clerical schools was established in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, and it is the fact 
               <br />
               that legal authorities, like my friend Mr. 
               <br />
               Iianltain, a quotation from whom I could 
               <br />
               read if I saw ﬁt, like Sir John Thompson, to 
               <br />
               whom the matter was referred, thought that 
               <br />
               when those privileges were curtailed and 
               <br />
               taken away, they were taken away in de— 
               <br />
               ﬁance of the clause of the Act of 1875 
               <br />
               which we ﬁnd in substance in clause 16 of 
               <br />
               the Bill before the House. Therefore we 
               <br />
               should have the privileges by this Act re- 
               <br />
               tained as they are in chapters 29, 30 and 31, 
               <br />
               of the ordinance of 1901 and as they are in 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875.

               would be impossible for us to pass that

               <br />

               of public lands that are in the public school 
               <br />

               ever, and would compel the legislatures of 
               <br />

               age of that Bill in the terms in which it 
               <br />
               was placed before the House by my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). I have 
               <br />
               nothing more to say with regard to that. 
               <br />

               <br />
               speak of it, but there are occasions on which 
               <br />
               people have to do things which constitute 
               <br />
               a very unpleasant necessity.
