               <br />
               do not recognize in the majorit' and that 
               <br />
               is the right to bring compulsion to bear 
               <br />
               upon me in a matter of conscience. If

               there are three or four men against me I 
               <br />

               in conclusion that in view of all the facts 
               <br />
               we should give to the minority in the North—

               <br />
               the shadow of justice, not the mere form of 
               <br />
               liberty. We are told that there are only 
               <br />
               ten or twelve separate schools in the North— 
               <br />

               <br />
               it‘ there was only one separate school in the

               that we should give right to those to whom

               friend from Labelle who has been attacked

               <br />
               been loyal to the British Crown. When the 
               <br />
               English Protestant minority of Quebec in 
               <br />
               1776 did not know which way to turn, 
               <br />
               when as we say in French, they did not 
               <br />
               know Whether to cry ‘Vive la Ligue’ or 
               <br />
               ‘Vive Le Roi,’ the great grandfather of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend was on the side of the British 
               <br />
               Crown and against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the-</span> American rebels 
               <br />
               and with another French Canadian, La- 
               <br />
               mothe, he carried despatches from Montreal 
               <br />
               through the American lines to the English 
               <br />
               general in Quebec. Another of my fellow— 
               <br />
               countrymen, Bouchette, brought the English 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governor</span> into the besieged city of Quebec. 
               <br />
               Ever since those days in 1760 when Canada 
               <br />
               was ceded to the British Crown we have 
               <br />
               kept our compact faithfully, and I main— 
               <br />
               tain that we have a right to claim that 
               <br />
               justice should be done to us as we have de- 
               <br />
               served. In ﬁnishing my speech, which I can- 
               <br />
               not help but feel has been too lengthy, I de- 
               <br />
               sire to make a comparison. Not far from 
               <br />
               here is the great river St. Lawrence which 
               <br />
               Separates us from the Anglo-Saxon Republic 
               <br />
               to the south. Sweeping past the foot of 
               <br />
               the hill upon which this building stands is 
               <br />
               the Ottawa river which separates the French 
               <br />
               province of Quebec from the English pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario. These two rivers con- 
               <br />
               verge near the city of Montreal and for a 
               <br />
               long time their waters run together With- 
               <br />
               out mixing. On the one side we have the 
               <br />
               dark coloured waters of the Ottawa river 
               <br />
               and on the other the silvery, bright waters 
               <br />
               or the (St. Lawrence. They ﬂoat together 
               <br />
               to a common destiny. Is not that the image 
               <br />
               of this Dominion of ours ? We have two 
               <br />
               nations ﬂoating together, not mixing the 
               <br />
               one with the other; on the one side the 
               <br />
               French race, on the other side the English 
               <br />
               nation, on the one side the Protestant creed, 
               <br />
               on the other side the Catholic creed. Well, 
               <br />
               Sir, could we not model this country after 
               <br />
               these beautiful rivers of ours ? Could we 
               <br />
               not together ﬂoat away to a common destiny 
               <br />
               without mixing, Without amalgamating the 
               <br />
               one with the other, and if we do I predict 
               <br />
               for this country, which is my country and 
               <br />
               to which I am as loyal as any man, a glor- 
               <br />
               ious destiny and in the name of nations a. 
               <br />
               giorious immortality.
