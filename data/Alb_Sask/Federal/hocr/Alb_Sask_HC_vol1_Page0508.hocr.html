               that we discussed this at some length, in

               Rogers advanced the claim on behalf of 
               <br />

               seemed to be a very strong objection to 
               <br />
               that. We told Mr. Rogers iii-fact: that 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">claim</span> had been considered by the

               government of Sir John Macdonald in 1884 
               <br />
               and had not been granted ; that the reasons 
               <br />
               which existed in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1884</span> for refusing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span>

               er of Manitoba were far stronger to-day 
               <br />
               than they were then; that at that time 
               <br />
               that part of the Territories was in its 
               <br />
               infancy, but that at present it had 
               <br />
               a considerable population. as advanc- 
               <br />
               ed as the population of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               That there was the objection further: 
               <br />
               that the elegislature of the Territor- 
               <br />
               ies had protested against its being 
               <br />
               annexed to Manitoba, and therefore we did 
               <br />
               not see how it was possible to grant that 
               <br />
               part of the prayer of the province of Maui- 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the district of Saskatchewan, We said 
               <br />
               to Mr. Rogers and to his colleague, Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell: we do not know that there is 
               <br />
               any objection to granting you the upper 
               <br />
               portion of the district of Saskatchewan; 
               <br />
               it is true that we understand there is an 
               <br />
               objection raised, but it is a question which 
               <br />
               can be discussed later on; at all events, 
               <br />
               we do not intend to introduce this part of 
               <br />
               the territory of Saskatchewan into the 
               <br />

               <br />
               for further discussion.

               When it came to a discussion on the ex-

               <br />

               General, who was with me then, at once 
               <br />
               took strong objections to that claim of Mani— 
               <br />
               toba. He stated that in his opinion it 
               <br />
               would not be fair to the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               that that claim should be considered unless 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario had an opportunity 
               <br />
               to discuss it with the province of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               That was on the 17th of February. I do 
               <br />
               not remember that I said to Mr. Rogers and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,Mr.</span> Campbell that if they were to wait for 
               <br />
               some days we would again send for them

               and be in a position to give them an answer.

               What I distinctly remember stating, as it 
               <br />
               was my duty to do, was that their represen—

               tations would be brought to the attention of 
               <br />

               get an answer at an early date. More

               <br />
               reasons which I have just given, that we had 
               <br />
               reserved the northern portion of the district 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatchewan</span> for future action, and that 
               <br />
               with regard to extending the boundaries of 
               <br />

               ion that the province of Ontario and the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec should be consulted. 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers heard this statement, and, there- 
               <br />
               fore, knew what was the policy of the gov-

               This shows one thing, that this policy of 
               <br />
               ours was settled then and there, without in-

               ness according to our lights. We told the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba that we could not ex-

               took our stand before this House and main- 
               <br />
               tained it. But we stated we were prepared 
               <br />
               to consider the claim of the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba for extension northward towards 
               <br />
               Hudson bay in connection with the claims 
               <br />
               of the new province of Saskatchewan and 
               <br />
               the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Since 
               <br />
               that time we have embodied these views in 
               <br />
               a Minute of Council, which has been com- 
               <br />
               municated to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Manitoba government. 
               <br />
               There is no difference between the Minute 
               <br />
               of Council and the statement I made on the 
               <br />
               floor of this House on the 21st of February 
               <br />
               except this, that in the Minute of Council. 
               <br />
               after having given the matter due considera- 
               <br />
               tion, we take the view that there is no rea- 
               <br />
               son for calling the province of Quebec to 
               <br />
               that conference, because it is not sufﬁcient-

               ly interested lin the matter; but we declare 
               <br />
               our readiness, immediately after the creat-

               ion of the new provinces, to have a confer-
