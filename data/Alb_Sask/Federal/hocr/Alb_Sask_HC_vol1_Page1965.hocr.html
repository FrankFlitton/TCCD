               propose to follow this matter very much 
               <br />
               further. I do not think that the argument 
               <br />
               made by the hon. members for Western As- 
               <br />
               siniboia and Saskatchewan have added any-

               thing to the information of members of this

               <br />
               the case they started out to prove in any 
               <br />

               <br />
               lations as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prospective</span> populations and 
               <br />
               so on. In reference to the accusation made 
               <br />
               against me that I wish to deprive the new- 
               <br />
               comers of their right to representation, that 
               <br />
               is absolutely incorrect. Incoming American 
               <br />
               citizens were especially mentioned in this 
               <br />
               connection by the hon. member for Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan (Mr. Lamont). These American 
               <br />
               citizens have not settled in one corner of the 
               <br />
               country, but have spread everywhere. They 
               <br />
               have come in very largely into my own 
               <br />
               neighbourhood. Within a very few miles of 
               <br />
               me there are a considerable number of 
               <br />
               American citizens who were not entitled to 
               <br />
               vote at the last election. A great many of 
               <br />
               these American citizens. men of means, 
               <br />
               have determined to settle in the districts 
               <br />
               which have proved their capacity for grow- 
               <br />
               ing grain. They have not struck into the 
               <br />
               remote districts where it is not ﬁnally estab- 
               <br />
               lished that wheat can be proﬁtably grown. 
               <br />
               A very large proportion of the best class of 
               <br />
               these new-comers have settled in the older 
               <br />
               districts, where they know they can make 
               <br />
               a success of farming. I propose that all 
               <br />
               should be treated alike, both those who go 
               <br />
               into the north and those who go into the 
               <br />
               south—all should be given their fair share 
               <br />
               of representation.

               ought to be made of Assiniboia to serve 
               <br />
               their purposes. They feel themselves at the

               <br />
               them, and they have sent down a great

               <br />
               think is fair. These four districts on the

               Mr. LAKE. But they are over the aver- 
               <br />
               age for the whole province of Saskatchewan.

               The only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerence</span> between my hon. friend 
               <br />
               (Mr. Scott) and myself is that I suggest 
               <br />
               that he should get this extra seat from the 
               <br />
               three constituencies which now group around 
               <br />
               Regina—Lumsden, Regina and South Re— 
               <br />
               gina—and that he should redistribute these 
               <br />
               seats. The average for these seats is 1,344 
               <br />
               as against an average in the constituencies 
               <br />
               he proposes to cut up of 1,554. I contend 
               <br />
               that it would be very much easier and a 
               <br />
               much more suitable and fairer distribution 
               <br />
               to do as I suggested—to make the new Soo 
               <br />
               district out of a portion of the present dis- 
               <br />
               trict of South Regina, adding to it a por-
