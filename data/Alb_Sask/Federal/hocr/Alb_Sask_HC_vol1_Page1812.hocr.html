               <br />
               adian, as a man who holds different ideas 
               <br />
               probably from most of the members of this 
               <br />
               House, I say that the French Canadian race 
               <br />
               would stand higher to-day than it does it 
               <br />

               joyment of all the rights to which they 
               <br />
               are entitled. That, to my mind, would be 
               <br />
               a better proof of the position which my com- 
               <br />
               patriots occupy in the confederation. These 
               <br />
               things show that some individuals are men 
               <br />
               of talent, but where is the race? A few 
               <br />
               of them shine, but where is the French 
               <br />
               Canadian race in the province of Manitoba? 
               <br />

               in the Northwest Territories after this law is 
               <br />
               passed? It seems to me that I am giving 
               <br />
               some food for reﬂection to the Solicitor Gen- 
               <br />
               eral. which he will have to mention if he 
               <br />
               speaks again on this question. Now, Sir, 
               <br />
               it seems to me that we are confronted by 
               <br />
               two propositions very clear and distinct; the 
               <br />
               position taken by my hon. friend the leader 
               <br />
               of the Conservative party, which is, as he 
               <br />
               says, to stand by the constitution, by clause 
               <br />
               93 of the British North America Act. and 
               <br />
               the position of my right hon. friend the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, who also says he wants to stand 
               <br />
               by the constitution, though at the same time 
               <br />
               he proceeds to amend it. The leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition says: We must leave everything 
               <br />
               to the provinces, without saying whether 
               <br />
               they shall have separate schools or not; we 
               <br />
               will have nothing at all to do with the 
               <br />
               schools, whatever they are. Well, that may 
               <br />
               be good policy,’but I do not think it is, 
               <br />
               and have shown it by my vote. I am very 
               <br />
               sorry to differ from my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, but I am bound to 
               <br />
               do so.

               tion 93 of the British North America Act

               <br />
               that section would leave the new provinces

               opinion as to that, but whatever the result

               in that way, and if I am to judge by the 
               <br />
               remarks which were made by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend I will still persist in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understanding</span> 
               <br />
               it i-n that way. It seems to me that his 
               <br />
               remarks went to show that he had nothing 
               <br />
               at all to say in regard to the kind of schools 
               <br />
               that they should have. I heard him say 
               <br />
               that if it suited the local legislature of these 
               <br />
               provinces to enact a separate school law, he 
               <br />
               would have nothing at all to say again-st 
               <br />
               it. Of course, this would fall under the 
               <br />
               principle of autonomy. Well, that is the posi— 
               <br />
               tion of my hon. friend. Although I do not 
               <br />
               agree with it, I want to say that it is a man- 
               <br />
               ly position whether it is good or bad. We 
               <br />
               know where he is. But, that is the posi- 
               <br />
               tion of my right hon. friend the leader of 
               <br />
               the government (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). The 
               <br />
               position of my right hon. friend is a mix- 
               <br />
               ture. He wants to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stand</span> on the constitu-

               tion as much as he can, but at the same 
               <br />
               time he wants to do something else. I 
               <br />
               think he was right when he propOSed un— 
               <br />
               der the lirst clause 16 to apply something 
               <br />
               else to this question than the provision in- 
               <br />
               volved <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. I voted for that. That 
               <br />
               was a plain, clear proposition. But we shall 
               <br />
               see later-on why he made that proposition. 
               <br />
               This amendment which is now before us 
               <br />
               means nothing at all. It is neither standing 
               <br />
               by the constitution as deﬁned by section 93 
               <br />
               nor does it recognize the rights of or do 
               <br />
               justice to the minority in these two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. It is opportunism. Will you have 
               <br />
               it whi.te?—there it is. ,Will you have it 
               <br />
               black?—I am giving it to you under clause 
               <br />
               93 of the British North America Act. That 
               <br />
               is why the amendment which I intend to 
               <br />
               propose calls things by their names. Some 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen from the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec will later on say and write in their 
               <br />
               papers that they are in favour of granting 
               <br />
               separate schools to the minority in the 
               <br />
               Northwest. But, if they are they will 
               <br />
               have to vote for the amendment which I 
               <br />
               propose, and not for the proposition 
               <br />
               which has been placed before the com- 
               <br />
               mittee by the government. Why was 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend prompted to do 
               <br />
               something for the minority? I want to 
               <br />
               give him the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">credit</span> of saying <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> he did 
               <br />
               intend to be just to the minority. That 
               <br />
               brings me to say why I look upon this 
               <br />
               question—I am always tempted to speak of 
               <br />
