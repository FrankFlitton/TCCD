               it issued by the Attorney General of the

               interview with the ablegate? If we are

               going to have any oﬂicial statement as to

               of religious discord fanned in this country 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hey</span> our hon. friends opposite, at least we

               should expect them to start this ﬂame ago-

               iug by some facts based upon the state-

               <br />
               took part in the interview. Why, Sir, my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the leader of the opposition is 
               <br />
               too good a lawyer—and we recognize him 
               <br />
               in our province as a good lawyer—he is 
               <br />
               too good a lawyer not to know that hear- 
               <br />
               say testimony is not worth anything, and 
               <br />
               the statement of Mr. Rogers upon which 
               <br />
               all this ﬂame of religious discord is to be 
               <br />
               started up is the worst kind of hearsay 
               <br />
               testimony, it is testimony that my learned 
               <br />
               friend, if he were a judge, would not listen 
               <br />
               to for one moment, and would reject it it 
               <br />

               Now the result is that We have all this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">excitement</span> based upon what ? Upon a state-

               <br />
               No, Sir, mark that. While we have been 
               <br />
               discussing in this House and the news- 
               <br />
               papers have been discussing for days cer-

               tain alleged facts in regard to certain things, 
               <br />
               no public man has yet ventured to state 
               <br />
               that he knows anything of these things of 
               <br />
               his own knowledge. But we have this hear- 
               <br />
               say statement, and hearsay statements as 
               <br />
               well as any other old statement are sulﬁcient 
               <br />
               material just now for certain gentlemen to 
               <br />
               fan a flame of religious discord. We have 
               <br />
               in addition to the statement two insinu- 
               <br />
               ations. The ﬁrst insinuation is that Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid wanted time to enable the invita- 
               <br />
               tion of the Papal ablegate to be acted upon. 
               <br />
               Well, now, what do we ﬁnd ? We ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the interview with the premier of this coun- 
               <br />
               try took place on February 17, we find 
               <br />
               that the interview with the ablegate took 
               <br />
               place on February 23. In the meantime the 
               <br />
               policy of the government had been formu-
