               As has already been said by the premier

               <br />
               so. The two rivers offer means of com-

               <br />
               The Peace River is a country of great agri- 
               <br />
               cultural possibilities and of great agricul- 
               <br />
               tural prospects and looking to the develop- 
               <br />
               of that northern country it would be most 
               <br />
               manifestly unfair that the representation

               <br />
               we are about to create a local govern- 
               <br />
               ment for that province, and it is essen- 
               <br />
               tial that we should provide for a fair re— 
               <br />
               presentation of the popular will in this new 
               <br />
               legislature we are about to call into being. 
               <br />
               It is for this ostensible object that the 
               <br />
               government has submitted the schedule we 
               <br />
               are now discussing; and in criticising the 
               <br />
               schedules and the method of their prepara- 
               <br />
               tion, the opposition are acting strictly with- 
               <br />
               in their duty. We propose what we believe 
               <br />
               to be a much fairer method. We on this 
               <br />
               side demand that this question he left to a 
               <br />
               commission of judges, who shall arrange the 
               <br />
               boundaries of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituencies,</span> and we do 
               <br />
               this in the belief that thereby the people 
               <br />
               will be satisﬁed and the ends of justice 
               <br />
               achieved. As I have said, the opposition 
               <br />
               criticise. in the ﬁrst place, the method by 
               <br />
               which this schedule was prepared and sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to this House. We have the plan, 
               <br />
               we have the schedule, but there is no 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial authorization of any kind. We do not 
               <br />
               know whence it came, as far as that is in- 
               <br />
               dicated by anything on the face of it at 
               <br />
