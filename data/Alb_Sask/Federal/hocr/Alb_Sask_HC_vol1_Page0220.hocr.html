               <br />
               and years they rebelled against the Crown

               <br />
               issued an annexation manifesto. Some

               French Canadians signed it and others were 
               <br />
               disposed to sign it. Again came the ob-

               noxious power of the hierarchy who told 
               <br />

               on when Confederation was being discussed 
               <br />
               it was not entirely acceptable to the people 
               <br />
               of Quebec. They had some suspicion of 
               <br />
               the treatment they might receive at the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the future. Again the hierarchy stood up

               <br />
               arguments against the domination of the 
               <br />
               priests, against the power of the hierarchy, 
               <br />
               but what has been their aim and object ? 
               <br />
               it has always been to throw down the 
               <br />
               British ﬂag; and the great grievance they 
               <br />
               have against the bishops is that the bishops 
               <br />
               prevented us from joining the United States 
               <br />
               in 1774, again in 1812, and opposed the re- 
               <br />
               bellion of 1837, supported British supremacy 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1849</span> and induced us to accept confede- 
               <br />
               ration. When newspapers in Ontario are 
               <br />
               ﬁlling their sheets with attacks and insults 
               <br />
               on the hierarchy they are simply insulting 
               <br />
               the men who, for 100 years have been the 
               <br />
               bulwark of British government in Canada. 
               <br />
               If there was any sincerity in these men, 
               <br />
               who are the great apostles and preachers 
               <br />
               ot loyalty, they should feel ashamed of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               tholic bishops of Canada, because when 
               <br />
               they attack the hierarchy they attack the 
               <br />
               party that has always stood by the British

               <br />
               has always stood by the ﬂag that has given

               <br />

               <br />
               should endeavour to know the convictions 
               <br />
               of their hearts and to learn their thoughts ? 
               <br />
               Sir, there is no solid ground left for those 
               <br />
               who are opposing this legislation as far as 
               <br />
               school matters are concerned. There is 
               <br />
               just one ground; it may be a good one for 
               <br />
               some. but on the whole it is not a lasting 
               <br />
               one : and that is the right of might. If the 
               <br />
               rule is to be laid down that there is to be 
               <br />
               one law to protect the Protestant minority 
               <br />
               of the province of Quebec, and that the same. 
               <br />
               law shall not apply to Catholic minorities 
               <br />
               elsewhere. so far, so good! But let men be 
               <br />
               strong enough to stand up here and say: 
               <br />
               ‘No, the (‘atholics of the. western provinces

               root of this question of legislation. There

               <br />
