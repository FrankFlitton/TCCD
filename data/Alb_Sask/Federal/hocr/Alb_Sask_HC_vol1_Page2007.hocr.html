               present time, and, under the terms of the

               Bill. that law would be continued until 
               <br />
               altered by the provincial legislature. The 
               <br />
               law was enacted in 1891. Previous to 1891 
               <br />
               the scope of the law was Wider. The French 
               <br />
               language had the same status as the Eng-

               This. amendment, passed in 1891, permits

               the assembly of the Territories to regulate 
               <br />

               <br />
               the English language. It has done so. Under

               this amendment, if adopted by the House, 
               <br />
               the legislatures of the two provinces would 
               <br />
               be free to regulate their own proceedings

               <br />
               Act of 1871, is that that Act clearly gives us

               the creative power. It enables us to decree the 
               <br />
               establishment of a province, to constitute it 
               <br />

               The hon. member therefore stated that, 
               <br />
               in his opinion, this parliament has not the 
               <br />
               right to change the provisions of the con- 
               <br />
               stitution, nor to alter it in any way, when 
               <br />
               we apply it to these western territories ; all 
               <br />
               that which we could do, to his mind, was 
               <br />
               merely to create those provinces, to deﬁne 
               <br />
               and limit their powers, and that from the 
               <br />
               moment we have deﬁned their powers, the 
               <br />
               federal parliament has exhausted its own 
               <br />
               legislative power. Such is the theory advo- 
               <br />
               cated by the hon. gentleman. If the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Jacques Cartier decided to vote 
               <br />
               for clause 16. such as proposed by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. it is because that principle was 
               <br />
               consecrated and recognized by the constitu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               tleman himself, and that he considered it 
               <br />
               opportune to remove all doubts. But the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman is not the only one to claim 
               <br />
               that this parliament had not the right to

               In speaking of the position taken by my 
               <br />
               leader, I wish to say openly that, to my mind, 
               <br />
               he made an admirable speech to which nobody 
               <br />
               can take exception. We may not all share the 
               <br />
               conclusions to which he came, but every man 
               <br />
               on this side, and I believe on the other side as 
               <br />
               well is convinced that the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion spoke in all sincertity without any bias, 
               <br />
               and inﬂuenced solely by a desire for the wel- 
               <br />
               fare of Canada. So much is that the case, that 
               <br />
               if in that amendment of his, ten words were 
               <br />
               struck off at the end. I would be disposed to 
               <br />
               support it. And in doing so I would be stand— 
               <br />
               ing on a good principle, namely, provincial au-
