               of which I have read. I say that the French

               people of the province of Quebec stand to 
               <br />
               lose more than any other people in this

               most zealous people in this whole Dom- 
               <br />
               inion to live up to that compact. If they 
               <br />
               do not, it will be as one of them said, a rope 
               <br />
               of sand—this is their OWn argument—and it 
               <br />
               may be a rope of sand, too early for them if 
               <br />
               they insist on breaking down the constitu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               on violating the sacred principle under

               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederation</span> and no other. If we

               <br />
               these two provinces to—day, who will say

               that they will not invoke the English-speak- 
               <br />
               ing element all over the country to inter-

               fere with the rights of the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec to—morrow ? Who will say that 
               <br />
               the people of these two provinces will not 
               <br />
               petition parliament to interfere with the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec? Have they not as 
               <br />
               good a right to do that as the 41,000 people 
               <br />
               from Quebec to petition it to interfere with 
               <br />
               the rights of these two new provinces ? And 
               <br />
               who can say that it will not be done? I 
               <br />
               say this because the French people of the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec should be the most zeal— 
               <br />
               ous to support this principle of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion under which we live to-day; and yet 
               <br />
               they are trying to break it down. If they 
               <br />
               succeed in breaking it down, all I can say 
               <br />
               is that they will destroy that coalidence in 
               <br />
               the confederation compact under which we 
               <br />
               have lived from 1867 down to the present 
               <br />
               time. Now, Mr. Chairman, I do not desire 
               <br />
               to detain the House longer. There are 
               <br />
               many other things I Would like to say. 
               <br />
               I intended to deal with some remarks 
               <br />
               made by members from the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories and to give them some information 
               <br />
               which I have with respect to that country; 
               <br />
               but I do not think it would do any good. I 
               <br />
               will leave them to be dealt with by their 
               <br />
               own constituents in the future. But I have 
               <br />
               given my reasons for holding the views I 
               <br />
               do. I wish to be understood; it is not be- 
               <br />
               cause I have any antipathy, ill-feeling, or 
               <br />
               disrespect towards any Roman Catholic in 
               <br />
               this country that I speak as I do. I have 
               <br />
               not any feeling of that kind towards them, 
               <br />
               and never have had. Such is not my na- 
               <br />
               ture. I hold no spite against any person; 
               <br />
               I have too much of the Irish character for 
               <br />
               that. I can ﬁght.with you this minute and 
               <br />
               shake hands with you the next. I am stat- 
               <br />
               ing my views and giving the reasons why I

               hold them to be sound. It is not because I 
               <br />
               am at the head of the Orange body. The 
               <br />
               Orangemen stand for perfect equality be- 
               <br />
               fore the law, and they are in favour of 
               <br />
               giving the Roman Catholic minority what 
               <br />
               the constitution provides they shall have. 
               <br />
               If the constitution gives them separate 
               <br />
               schools, we will not quarrel with it. We 
               <br />
               are not constitution breakers, but constitu- 
               <br />
               tion supporters; but we want equal rights 
               <br />
               for all before the law. There is no class of 
               <br />
               people who are more tolerant, more reason— 
               <br />
               able and more desirous of conceding to the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic people their rights than 
               <br />

               much viliﬁed and criticised by those who 
               <br />

               whom my hon. friend from East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule) referred as having supported this 
               <br />
               Bill all through, challenged him to show 
               <br />
               that there was one word in that article re- 
               <br />
               ﬂecting on the Orangemen of this country.

               My hon. friend from East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule) did not reply. But I, as an Orange- 
               <br />
               man, feel it my duty to say it is one of the 
               <br />
               greatest insults cast on the Orangemen of 
               <br />
               this country. Let me read it to my hon. 
               <br />
               friend who, I presume, is an Orangeman.
