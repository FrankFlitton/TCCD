               derstand the language that is spoken—that 
               <br />
               is all. It is done in every country in the 
               <br />
               world to—day. The history of every country 
               <br />
               in the world is a history of change, to 
               <br />
               suit changed conditions. France is an 
               <br />
               illustration of it. Spain is an illustration 
               <br />
               of it. The hon. gentleman referred to Al- 
               <br />
               sace <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> Lorraine. A gentleman who tra- 
               <br />
               velled in those provinces told me last year 
               <br />
               that when they were taken over by Ger- 
               <br />
               many, nearly everybody there spoke French. 
               <br />
               but that you would be surprised to-day to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd nearly everybody speaking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">German],</span> and 
               <br />
               the strange thing is that there is no com- 
               <br />
               plaint about it, although the change was 
               <br />
               compulsory. I do not go so far as that, 
               <br />
               because I think we ought to be more gen— 
               <br />
               erous; but in that case, though the change 
               <br />
               was made by law, no great hardship has re- 
               <br />
               sulted. Nor will it be so in the Northwest 
               <br />
               any more than it has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in:</span> Alsace and Lor-

               raine. We are told that uniﬁcation is an 
               <br />
               impossible task, that it is a Utopia, and that 
               <br />
               therefore we must keep up two languages.

               My hon. friend from Jacques Cartier said,

               why shall we not be allowed to speak our 
               <br />

               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman was half Scotch 
               <br />

               <br />
               half English and half French; what would 
               <br />

               I am told that in Glengarry there were a 
               <br />
               lot of Scotchmen who married into the 
               <br />
               French Canadian race; which language 
               <br />
               would be the mother tongue of their child— 
               <br />
               ren ? Are we going to perpetuate it by 
               <br />
               law ? Let the law of the survival of the 
               <br />
               ﬁttest be the law that will determine that. 
               <br />
               We need not trouble ourselves with it at 
               <br />
               all. The hon. gentleman says it is hard to 
               <br />
               deprive people of the right to speak their 
               <br />
               mother tongue. Nobody wants to deprive 
               <br />
               them of the right to speak their mother 
               <br />

               <br />
               like. I was interested in one statement 
               <br />
               that was made by the Solicitor General. He 
               <br />
               said, Why are you demanding this privi- 
               <br />
               lege for the Northwest? Have you had a
