               and by that statement I propose to stand. 
               <br />
               I said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> I believed in a legislative union

               hold to that opinion. But if we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> to

               <br />
               erecting them, but erecting them with the

               <br />
               been just a little more reckless than usual.

               His statement, if taken as he made it, would 
               <br />
               mean that the province of Ontario is under

               <br />
               tion. I challenged the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               from time to time, when he was making that 
               <br />
               deal with the Grand Trunk Paciﬁc, to say 
               <br />
               whether the Grand Trunk Railway was not 
               <br />
               bound to give the people between Toronto 
               <br />
               and Montreal a 2-cent per mile rate. He 
               <br />
               did not answer, but the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               said he did not know whether it was the 
               <br />
               law or not, and never bestirred himself a . 
               <br />
               moment to see that the law was enforced. 
               <br />
               I do not know that the hon. gentleman him- 
               <br />
               self ever supported anybody in this House

               way law efﬁcient and administered as it 
               <br />

               <br />
               which I give them credit, they have not 
               <br />
               taken any steps to make it more efﬁcient. 
               <br />
               The law could be made- much more effective 
               <br />
               in the interests of the people with regard

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. The 4th meridian 
               <br />
               coincides with meridian 110 west Green- 
               <br />
               wich. The northern boundary of Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan and Alberta extends from meridian 102 
               <br />
               to meridian 120 west Greenwich, 18 degrees 
               <br />
               longitude. The division of the northern 
               <br />
               boundary into two equal parts—that is the 
               <br />
               northern boundary of both provinces—— 
               <br />
               would place the dividing line one degree 
               <br />
               west of that deﬁned in the Bill. It would 
               <br />
               make it one degree west of the line we have 
               <br />
               now. _The 4th meridian is the line from
