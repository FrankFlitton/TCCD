               and that the trustees if they so desired it 
               <br />
               must engage a teacher of their religious 
               <br />
               persuasion. Now look how that would work 
               <br />
               out; Suppose there were sixty children in 
               <br />
               the district, then one-quarter of those 
               <br />
               would have one teacher and the other forty 
               <br />
               or forty-ﬁve would have one teacher, yet 
               <br />
               under that direction the trustees would be 
               <br />
               required to pay their equal share of taxes 
               <br />
               for the Catholic teacher who was only 
               <br />
               teaching ﬁfteen children. I submit that 
               <br />
               this is a most unjust proposal and one that 
               <br />
               should not be entertained. If that meet- 
               <br />
               ing was not brought about I ask why the 
               <br />
               rumour has not been denied. I submit that 
               <br />
               it is up to His Excellency that he should 
               <br />
               set himself right upon it. Here are two 
               <br />
               men holding honourable positions, standing 
               <br />
               high in their province, men who have the 
               <br />
               conﬁdence of their province, and they state 
               <br />
               distinctly that that meeting took place and 
               <br />
               that that proposition was made. Did the 
               <br />
               First Minister know about that meeting or 
               <br />
               did he not ? That is the question to be 
               <br />
               decided. If he did not know then I submit 
               <br />
               that the Papal delegate was going beyond 
               <br />
               his proper sphere in making that proposition 
               <br />
               and therefore taking it in any light you 
               <br />
               can it was an improper thing to do ; it was 
               <br />
               wrong to make the proposition. He told 
               <br />
               them according to this report that if they 
               <br />
               agreed to put this clause in, it would ex- 
               <br />
               pedite the enlargement of the province. 
               <br />
               What does that mean ? Does it not carry 
               <br />
               out the statements that have been made in 
               <br />
               the past over and over again that Manitoba 
               <br />
               need not expect any extension of territory 
               <br />
               unless she agreed to separate schools, and 
               <br />
               here we have a proposition made that proves 
               <br />
               beyond a doubt that this was the case. I 
               <br />
               say again that we in this House object to 
               <br />
               any interference whatever in connection 
               <br />
               with church or state. We refuse to allow 
               <br />
               any foreign potentate to take any part in our

               legislation or to dictate how our children 
               <br />
               shall be educated in any part of this fair 
               <br />
               Dominion of ours.

               Now in this age of the world when church

               United States, because they have national

               schools where no religion is taught, the

               church schools have existed 'for so long. I 
               <br />
               have travelled through those eastern coun-

               tries myself, I have seen the sun rise and 
               <br />
               set in many lands, and in travelling through 
               <br />
               them I have observed the way in which the 
               <br />
               Sabbath was kept, and have endeavoured to 
               <br />
               learn something of the results of the church 
               <br />
               schools which prevail there. I found that 
               <br />
               those eastern countries have not been going 
               <br />
               ahead as the United States has. Spain has

               United States where there are no separate

               observance, it is in those countries Where

               the table has groaned beneath their weight.

               the petitions that have been presented and 
               <br />

               Sir, that is the only way in which the
