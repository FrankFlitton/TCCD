               cussed I have no doubt the Minister of

               Justice will show that it is entirely as we all

               Mr. SPROULE. That would be good so 
               <br />
               far as it goes. But the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               should not forget this fact, that he treated 
               <br />
               this House to a very serious argument, or 
               <br />
               what he wanted us to accept as an argu- 
               <br />
               ment, explaining that practically the system 
               <br />
               of schools they have in the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories to—day was no system of separate 
               <br />
               schools at all, it was practically a system of 
               <br />
               national schools. He says that is the only 
               <br />
               conclusion the man in the street can come 
               <br />
               to. He says, let us take the common sense 
               <br />
               view of it, let us leave the constitution ques- 
               <br />
               tion out of consideration altogether. We 
               <br />
               believe that to-day, by the ordinances which 
               <br />
               have been brought into force, the Act of. 
               <br />
               1875 has been so amended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> time to time 
               <br />
               that the schools to-day are practically no 
               <br />
               separate schools at all, that they are national 
               <br />
               schools; and we are asking this House to per- 
               <br />
               petuate them, and not perpetuate a system 
               <br />
               of schools that were intended to be. put in 
               <br />
               operation by the Act of 1875. That was the 
               <br />
               gist of his argument, that was the inference 
               <br />
               which he wished the country to draw from 
               <br />
               the argument he presented to the House.
