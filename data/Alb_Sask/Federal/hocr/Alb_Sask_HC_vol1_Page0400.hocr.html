               as I have said, that in British Columbia 
               <br />
               there were seven Liberals returned and 
               <br />
               not a single Conservative, in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories seven Liberals. with a majority 
               <br />
               averaging a little over 1,200, as against 
               <br />
               three Conservatives barely squeezed in, 
               <br />
               and in Manitoba seven Liberals as against 
               <br />
               three Conservatives. And when we got

               Columbia or the Northwest Territories or 
               <br />
               Manitoba, I venture to say that the govern-

               ment will be able to carry the election of 
               <br />
               such a minister in whatever district they

               Several hon. gentlemen opposite have sug-

               appeared over the signature of Mr. Haul-

               iain. I have already read the letter

               not lay stress on the matter of the num-

               ber of provinces, he does not lay stress on 
               <br />
               the matter of lands; the only thing he does

               to the satisfaction of every lawyer and 
               <br />

               serted the position of the Territories ?
