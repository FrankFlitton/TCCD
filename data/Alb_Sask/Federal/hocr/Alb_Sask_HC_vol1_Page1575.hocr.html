               ures as we ﬁnd them, and this is the rea- 
               <br />
               son why: because clause 12 of this Bill 
               <br />
               reads: ‘Until the said legislature otherwise 
               <br />
               provides.’ Now. the hon. minister knows 
               <br />
               perfectly well that within six months after 
               <br />
               the passage of this Bill the people of AI- 
               <br />
               berta will be called upon to choose their 
               <br />
               ﬁrst legislature. He knows that that leg- 
               <br />
               islature will be chosen on the condi- 
               <br />
               tions as they are to-day, or rather as 
               <br />
               they were last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year,</span> because the later 
               <br />
               comers cannot vote. He knows, therefore, 
               <br />
               that the powers given by this Bill will be 
               <br />
               exhausted with that ﬁrst act of the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               legislature, and from that time forward 
               <br />
               will be null and void; because there is be- 
               <br />
               fore this House a Bill which states that 
               <br />
               in the month of June, in the year 1906, 
               <br />
               there will be a census of the population 
               <br />
               of the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               and Manitoba taken by the Minister of 
               <br />
               Agriculture. Now, it is perfectly well 
               <br />
               known that this legislature is to be chosen 
               <br />
               upon existing conditions, and that one of 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst acts of this legislature, after the 
               <br />
               census of 1900 becomes public, will be if 
               <br />
               necessary. to carry out a distribution of 
               <br />
               seats. He knows that hereafter the newly 
               <br />
               created legislature will be the sole author- 
               <br />
               ity to divide the province of Alberta for 
               <br />
               local electoral purposes. Six months from 
               <br />
               this time the powers given in this Bill will 
               <br />
               practically <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cease:</span> to exist, consequently this 
               <br />
               prospective increase is a matter we have no 
               <br />
               right to discuss. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Then.</span> the minister tells us 
               <br />
               that one railroad is coming in this year, that 
               <br />
               another is coming in two years, and another 
               <br />
               in three years. _ We have to deal with actual

               <br />
               future is not pertinent to the discussion. 
               <br />
               Now. I think I have shown that there 
               <br />
               are a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">many</span> did‘erent considera— 
               <br />
               tions which have to be weighed when 
               <br />
               a province is about to be divided into 
               <br />
               constituencies, and I think we shall 
               <br />
               realize as a House that we are not 
               <br />
               adapted for dealing with questions of that 
               <br />
               character. With all due deference to the 
               <br />
               knowledge and good intentions of the 
               <br />
               members of this House. I submit that a di- 
               <br />
               vision of that character is one that should 
               <br />
               be made by an independent judicial body 
               <br />
               which has some knowledge of local con— 
               <br />
               ditions. There are 215 members of this 
               <br />
               House. How many of these have ever been 
               <br />
               in Alberta or know anything about the 
               <br />
               local conditions there? Here we have -a 
               <br />
               very important measure affecting .the in- 
               <br />
               terests of probably 200.000 people. Is there 
               <br />
               any bar provided before which these peo- 
               <br />
               ple can come and be heard and make their 
               <br />
               grievances known ? This is a matter which 
               <br />
               should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> the fullest possible discus- 
               <br />
               sion, and the people vitally interested should 
               <br />
               be given an opportunity to be heard. But 
               <br />
               no such opportunity is now given them. 
               <br />
               Further than that. with all due deference 
               <br />
               to parliament, I do not think it “can be 
               <br />
               characterized as a wholly non-partisan body.

               I do not think the members of this 
               <br />
               House are likely to approach this question 
               <br />
               having absolutely divested themselves of 
               <br />
               political bias. This Bill has been presented 
               <br />
               in a very simple way. One man fathers it, 
               <br />
               his views are imposed upon the cabinet, the 
               <br />
               cabinet having accepted them, force them 
               <br />
               upon the party, and the party having a 
               <br />
               majority in parliament forces it upon the 
               <br />
               country. That is one-man-rule in a matter 
               <br />
               so important as this which relates to the 
               <br />
               future of 200,000 people. Now I submit that 
               <br />
               is not the manner in which a question of 
               <br />
               this importance should be dealt with. We 
               <br />
               desire to have a commission appointed of 
               <br />
               men of wide knowledge and of legal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">training,</span> 
               <br />
               men who have given their lives to weighing 
               <br />
               judicial questions, and are prepared to deal 
               <br />
               with them in an impartial way, men before 
               <br />
               whom these people interested can come and- 
               <br />
               plead their cause; and when that tribunal 
               <br />
               has been provided we of the opposition are 
               <br />
               perfctly willing to accept without a murmur 
               <br />
               the ﬁnding, whatever it may be. The min- 
               <br />
               ister has intimated that his ﬁnding would 
               <br />
               pass a board of judges. If it passes a 
               <br />
               board of judges, there will be nothing fur— 
               <br />
               ther said. But I am very much mistaken 
               <br />
               if there are three judges in any province of 
               <br />

               There is another point which comes out 
               <br />
               in this discussion. We‘ have seen state- 
               <br />
               ments made and challenged, ﬁgures offered 
               <br />
               and refuted. Where are we ? —Who is

               right? Who has counted these ﬁgures cor-

               rectly? Simply the majority. They may

               be wrong, it is possible for a majority to be 
               <br />
               wrong. But if there were a commission of 
               <br />
               judges to weigh the statements of all part-

               and documents, and be able to obtain full 
               <br />
               information, they would then decide where 
               <br />
               the truth lay, and would act accordingly.

               Now I want to submit some evidence to

               do badly in following some of our sister

               colonies in their manner of dealing with 
               <br />
               questions of this character. We have been 
               <br />
               accustomed especially to look to Australia 
               <br />
               for experiments relating to the ballot law, 
               <br />
               and all things electoral. We have taken our 
               <br />
               ballot system from that country. Now sup-

               New South Wales followed the example of 
               <br />
