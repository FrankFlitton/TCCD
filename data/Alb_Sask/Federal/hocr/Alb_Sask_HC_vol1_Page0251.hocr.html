               We are told that this legislation is an 
               <br />
               infringement on what is called provincial 
               <br />
               rights. As a consistent Liberal, I claim 
               <br />
               myself to be an uphoider of such rights.

               After the battles fought by the late Sir

               great evils to this Dominion. Our allegiance

               less anxious for the promotion and welfare of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, and it is no argument to say 
               <br />
               that, because a certain piece of legislation is 
               <br />
               within the power of a local parliament, there- 
               <br />
               fore the legislation is not to be disturbed. By 
               <br />
               the . same Act of parliament by which the 
               <br />
               power is conferred upon the local legislature, 
               <br />
               the duty and power—because where there is 
               <br />
               a power there is a corresponding duty—are cast 
               <br />
               upon the Governor in Council to revise, and re- 
               <br />
               view, the Adts of the legislative bodies. If you 
               <br />
               are to say that because a law has been passed 
               <br />
               within the legislative authority of the province, 
               <br />
               therefore it must remain, we can easily see, 
               <br />
               Sir, that before long these provinces, instead 
               <br />
               of coming nearer together, will go further and 
               <br />
               further apart. We can see that the only way 
               <br />
               of making a. united Canada, and building up a. 
               <br />
               national life and sentiment in the Dominion, is 
               <br />
               by seeing that the laws of one province are not 
               <br />
               offensive to the laws and institutions, and it 
               <br />
               may be to the feelings, of another—I will go so 
               <br />
               far as to say that they must be to some extent 
               <br />
               taken into consideration.

               I have quoted the above extract in order 
               <br />
               to show that the principle of provincial 
               <br />
               rights is' not always adhered to by those 
               <br />
               who are quite ready, when circumstances 
               <br />
               arise, to invoke it. Let me, however, give 
               <br />
               the opinion on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[this</span> subject of one of the 
               <br />
               fathers of confederation. In an address to 
               <br />
               his constituents, October, .1864, Sir A. T. 
               <br />
               Galt said : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It was clear that in conﬁding the general 
               <br />
               subject of education to the local legislatures, 
               <br />
               it was absolutely necessary it should be ac- 
               <br />
               companied with such restrictions as would pre- 
               <br />
               vent injustice in any respect from being done 
               <br />
               to the minority. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now this applied to Lower Canada, but it 
               <br />
               also applied, with equal force, to Upper Can- 
               <br />
               ada and the other provinces, for in Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada there was a Protestant minority, and in the 
               <br />
               other provinces a Catholic minority. The same 
               <br />
               privileges belong of right here, as belonged to 
               <br />
               the other right elsewhere. There could be no 
               <br />
               greater injustice to a population than to com- 
               <br />
               pel them to have their children educated in a 
               <br />
               manner contrary to their own religious belief.

               Therefore, I say, Sir, that I am within 
               <br />
               the scope of provincial rights in asking that 
               <br />
               this parliament should protect the minority 
               <br />
               in the Northwest. But, there is some- 
               <br />
               thing else than provincial rights. We, the 
               <br />
               Liberal party, stand for provincial rights. 
               <br />
               That was the policy of our old leader, Alex- 
               <br />
               ander Mackenzie; it was the policy of Sir 
               <br />
               Oliver Mowart; it was the policy of Mr. 
               <br />
               Edward Blake. It is still the policy of the 
               <br />
               Liberal party. But, Sir, with provincial
