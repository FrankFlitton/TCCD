               The terms and conditions were that we 
               <br />
               would give these Territories political insti- 
               <br />
               tutions bearing analogy, as far as the cir— 
               <br />
               cumstances would admit, to those existing 
               <br />
               in the provinces. That was in 1870 or 1871. 
               <br />
               What then did we proceed to do ? In 1875 
               <br />
               we gave these Territories a constitution in 
               <br />
               accordance with the solemn compact entered 
               <br />
               into with the imperial authorities. In that 
               <br />
               constitution What did we provide ? We pro- 
               <br />
               vided for separate schools, or rather we pro- 
               <br />
               vided, under section 11 of the Act of 1875, 
               <br />
               for a system of education. That is the letter 
               <br />
               of our constitution. At the. time that consti- 
               <br />
               tution was given these Territories, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the\</span>

               execution of our solemn undertaking to- 
               <br />
               wards the imperial authorities, the man 
               <br />
               who was responsible for section 11 of the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 stood up in this House and 
               <br />
               gave expression to the hope that by that 
               <br />
               Act we had settled for all time this vexed 
               <br />
               question of education in so far as these Terri- 
               <br />
               tories were concerned. I need not repeat 
               <br />
               his words. Mr. Blake then said to the people 
               <br />
               of Canada : We are taking out of provincial 
               <br />
               politics and out of municipal control this 
               <br />
               vexed question of education and are settling 
               <br />
               it for all time in so far as these Territories 
               <br />
               are concerned. Those great men who then 
               <br />
