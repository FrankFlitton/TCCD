               ment in the world that one would choose 
               <br />
               because of its appearance? They had not

               any experience as -to its durability because 
               <br />
               it was only laid last fall and therefore.they 
               <br />
               could not know anything about it. Some 
               <br />
               interested party went around and secured 
               <br />
               the signature of every resident or the street, 
               <br />

               all the residents wanted this pavement is 
               <br />
               a fact and I assume it is. That interested 
               <br />
               party was undoubtedly connected with the

               the hon. minister: When was this let ?—

               <br />
               burton (Mr. Hughes) and in answer he said : 
               <br />
               Last fall. This work was done last fall, the 
               <br />
               hon. mlnster was Acting Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works during last session because we com- 
               <br />
               plained very much that we had only the

               have a responsible minister who was spend- 
               <br />
               ing the money. The hon. acting minister, I

               say again, sheltered himself behind that be- 
               <br />
               cause he was acting minister during last 
               <br />
               session when we had him answering the
