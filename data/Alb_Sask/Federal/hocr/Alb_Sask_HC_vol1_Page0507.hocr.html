               o'clock in his ofﬁce, Privy Council.

               Yours respectfully,

               (Sgd.) RODOLPHE <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BOUDREAU.</span>

               That was on the 16th of February. and 
               <br />
               on the following day accordingly, there 
               <br />
               took place at my oﬂice the interview with 
               <br />
               the delegates from Manitoba. There had 
               <br />
               been a subcommittee of the Privy Council 
               <br />
               appointed to receive the delegates, and the 
               <br />
               ministers present on that occasion were, 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice, the Postmaster Gen- 
               <br />
               eral and myself; I think the Secretary of 
               <br />
               State was present, but of that I am not 
               <br />
               quite sure.

               I take now the statement of Mr. Rogers 
               <br />
               as to what took place then. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rogers</span> 
               <br />
               says : 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               During that interview we presented the claim 
               <br />
               of the province as urgently and strongly as pos— 
               <br />
               sible. In reply Sir Wilfrid said, that if we 
               <br />
               would be good enough to remain in Ottawa for 
               <br />
               three or four days he would again send for us 
               <br />
               and would then be in a position to give us an 
               <br />
               answer.

               As to the latter statement I am sorry 
               <br />
               to say that my memory is not in accordance 
               <br />
               with the memory of Mr. Rogers. I do not 
               <br />
               want to make any imputation, but I ﬂatter 
               <br />
               myself that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,I</span> have a pretty good memory 
               <br />
               and my memory is corroborated by that 
               <br />
               of my colleagues. What took place was 
               <br />
               this: We heard the petition <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">presented</span> 
               <br />
               to us by the delegates from Manitoba. Mr. 
               <br />
               Rogers was the spokesman. I do not think 
               <br />
               Mr. Campbell said anything at all. but if 
               <br />
               he did he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tool;</span> a very indifferent part in 
               <br />
               the discussion which was mainly carried 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> by Mr. Rogers. He presented to us a 
               <br />
               repetition of all the claims which are 
               <br />
               advanced in the state paper now on the 
               <br />
               table of the House. He asked that the
