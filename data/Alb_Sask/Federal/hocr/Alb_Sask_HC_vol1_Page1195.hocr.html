               who the draughtsman is, and I am glad we

               do, knowing some of the opinions which 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Finance held in regard 
               <br />
               to an arrangement of a very similar char- 
               <br />
               acter as between the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               and the Dominion of Canada, and knowing 
               <br />
               that the hon. Minister of Finance, in re- 
               <br />
               gard to the large sum of $2,848,000 which 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario alleged for many 
               <br />
               years was an asset of that province, sup- 
               <br />
               ported that contention, and that he held that 
               <br />
               at any time the province of Ontario had 
               <br />
               the right to call upon the Dominion to pay 
               <br />
               over that large sum of money. Knowing 
               <br />
               that fact, I may well suspect that there 
               <br />
               may be something in even the drafting of 
               <br />
               this clause that will allow these new pro-

               vinces to call upon the Dominion for this 
               <br />
               sum of $8,000,000. Whether that is the in-

               tention of the hon. Minister of Finance or

               be the intention, ot this committee. I

               ninths of the excess of debt which the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces of Upper and Lower Canada had 
               <br />
               over the $62,500,000, when they went into 
               <br />
               confederation. In 1873, a readjustment of 
               <br />
               subsidies was made and the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment agreed to assume the entire ex— 
               <br />
               cess of debt of $10,500,000 owing by the 
               <br />
               old provinces of Canada and to relieve the 
               <br />
               old provinces from the payment of interest. 
               <br />
               In other words they practically made the 
               <br />
               provinces of Ontario and Quebec a gift of 
               <br />
               $10,500,000, because these provinces were 
               <br />
               for ever relieved from the payment of in- 
               <br />
               terest on that money. This seemed to be 
               <br />
               a very generous act on the part of the 
               <br />
               Dominion government, and it is just one of 
               <br />

               ter terms. However, we will say nothing 
               <br />
               more about that now. The provinces of 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec were satisﬁed in 1873 
               <br />
               to get rid of $10,500,000 of debt and throw 
               <br />
               it on the shoulders of the whole of the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of Canada. Nothing more was said un— 
               <br />
               til 1884, when the demand was again made 
               <br />
               for better terms by the provinces and the 
               <br />

               lief of the provinces again. The words 
               <br />
               quoted by my hon. friend from East Grey 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\(Mr.</span> Sproule), I think, made use of by Mr. 
               <br />
               Blake, were very apt indeed. These appli- 
               <br />
               cations came time after time, and we had 
               <br />
               the continual repetition of the same old 
               <br />
               story; better terms, better terms and bet- 
               <br />
               ter terms. In 1884, it became necessary to 
               <br />
               conciliate the different provinces, because, 
               <br />
               I think, that was really the purpose for 
               <br />
               which the new subsidy was given, and it 
               <br />
               became necessary to ﬁnd a basis on which 
               <br />
               the new subsidy could be granted. The 
               <br />
               fact was that the British North America 
               <br />
               Act provided no means for an increase of 
               <br />
               subsidy and it was necessary to devise 
               <br />
               some means. The province of Ontario 
               <br />
               said: You assumed our excess of debt in 
               <br />
               1873 and relieved us of the half yearly pay- 
               <br />
               ment of interest. We had paid for the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst seven years after confederation. 
               <br />
               Now, if you had the right to assume that 
               <br />
               excess of debt and relieve us of that in- 
               <br />
               terest in 1873, it was right that it should 
               <br />
               have been done in 1867, and you ought to 
               <br />
               refund to us the interest we paid during 
               <br />
               those seven years. A calculation was 
               <br />
               made. because it was conceded by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the day that they would have 
               <br />
               to do something, and I think, the gentle- 
               <br />
               man who made the calculation at that time 
               <br />
               was the present Auditor General. he having 
               <br />
               made it before he became Auditor Gen- 
               <br />
               eral. The calculation was made that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">13;-</span> 
               <br />
               half—yearly payments of interest at ﬁve per 
               <br />
               cent up to 1884 would amount to $2.848,- 
               <br />
               000. In 1884, a Bill was passed by this
