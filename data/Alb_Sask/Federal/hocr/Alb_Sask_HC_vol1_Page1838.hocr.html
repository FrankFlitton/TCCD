               was the most frequent case in the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. As I understand it, there are 150 
               <br />
               schools where the Catholics being in a ma- 
               <br />
               jority have organized what we may term 
               <br />
               for the purposes of this discussion public 
               <br />
               schools, and therefore they have no guar— 
               <br />
               antee of any protection in the future. It 
               <br />
               is, on the contrary, in a minority of cases 
               <br />
               that they are organized into separate schools.

               Mr. MONK. In nine cases, and in 150 
               <br />
               cases they lack that protection. As I un- 
               <br />
               derstand it, this parliament has declared 
               <br />
               expressly in favour of protection, of the 
               <br />
               guarantee of the maintenance of rights in 
               <br />
               favour of a Catholic minority. I shall not 
               <br />
               discuss the reasons which have led to the 
               <br />
               conﬁrmation of that principle by a very 
               <br />
               large majority in this House and as far as 
               <br />
               we have been able to test public opinion the' 
               <br />
               sentiment expressed by the House has been 
               <br />
               conﬁrmed throughout the country. Under 
               <br />
               those circumstances I deem it the duty of 
               <br />
               the government to supplement this provi- 
               <br />

               the minority protection all over the pro- 
               <br />
               vince. That is the reason why I voted for 
               <br />
               the amendment of the hon. member for La- 
               <br />
