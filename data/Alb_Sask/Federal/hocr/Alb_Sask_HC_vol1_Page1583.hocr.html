               <br />
               this new parliament had already all the

               trouble in the future? It seems to me that 
               <br />
               the government should carefully consider 
               <br />
               all the facts and ﬁgures which have been

               <br />
               I do not believe that the Prime Minister

               appreciates the real situation as the
