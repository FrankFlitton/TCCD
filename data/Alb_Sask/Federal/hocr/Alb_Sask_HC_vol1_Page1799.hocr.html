               as that. What the hon. member for East

               Grey (Mr. Sprouie) said regarding the

               Orangemen of this country is perfectly cor- 
               <br />
               rect. They have no antipathy to the French 
               <br />
               race or the Roman Catholic‘creed. It is 
               <br />
               their duty to uphold, and they do and will 
               <br />
               uphold, the constitution of this country. 
               <br />
               We are willing to apply the constitution of 
               <br />
               this country to the new provinces whether 
               <br />
               it gives separate schools or not. If the con- 
               <br />
               stitution gives them separate schools, they 
               <br />
               are entitled to them, but we are opposed to 
               <br />
               the mutilation of the constitution and Will 
               <br />
               ﬁght for that constitution to the last ditch. 
               <br />
               We do not believe that the constitution of

               this country should be mutilated or departed

               ber for Leeds (Mr. Taylor) who has told you 
               <br />
               that I am an Orangeman, I may say that 
               <br />
               I am not, but I may add that I am equally 
               <br />
               charged, on just as good ground, with being 
               <br />
               a 'Roman Catholic. The other day I receiv- 
               <br />
               ed a letter written from my own constitu- 
               <br />
               ency by one of my own constituents, in 
               <br />
               which he said he did not know what my 
               <br />
               creed was, but that after reading my speech. 
               <br />
               he supposed I was a Roman Catholic. Let 
               <br />
               me say that I am neither a Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               nor an Orangeman. I have no use myself 
               <br />
               for people who use extreme or abusive lan- 
               <br />
               guage regarding Roman Catholics or Orange- 
               <br />
               men or any other class. and that is the reas- 
               <br />
               on I am at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">issue</span> with the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey (Mr. Sproule). I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">like‘to</span> 
               <br />
               hear extreme or abusive language applied to 
               <br />
               any section of our Canadian people. I have 
               <br />
               nothing whatever against the Orangemen, 
               <br />
               but I do say again. after listening to the 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Grey to-night, that 
               <br />
               I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Ivo</span> not see in’ the article he read any re- 
               <br />
               ference whatever to the Orange society. The 
               <br />
               article refers to the people commanded by 
               <br />
               Dr. Sprou-ie. When you speak of the Orange- 
               <br />
               men of this country, however, you are speak— 
               <br />
               ing of a very large body of men, most of 
               <br />
               whom are very respectable and loyal citizens 
               <br />
               of this country. But when you refer to 
               <br />
               those commanded by Dr. Sproule, you are 
               <br />
               referring to a very small number.
