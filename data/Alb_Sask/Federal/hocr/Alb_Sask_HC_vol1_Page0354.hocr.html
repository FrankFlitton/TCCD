               heard it myself on many platforms—that the 
               <br />
               proper thing for us to do was to trust the 
               <br />
               Liberal party, that with their record in the 
               <br />
               past they would be sure to give us fair and 
               <br />
               liberal terms. We have been told quite re- 
               <br />
               cently and told triumphantly that the seven

               <br />
               then I think it must be due to a sudden

               change of opinion on the part of at least two

               <br />
               have put themselves deﬁnitely on record in

               the liberty of repeating it, that if the House

               a couple of years previously had placed

               I regret that after having for years 
               <br />
               advocated the granting of provincial auton- 
               <br />
               omy to the Northwest Territoriees, I am 
               <br />
               unable to welcome the measure which has 
               <br />
               just been introduced. It does not contain 
               <br />
               the ‘fair and just terms’ for which the people 
               <br />
               of the Territories ask and it does not give 
               <br />
               ‘complete and absolute autonomy’ such as we 
               <br />
               were promised by the Prime Minister. It 
               <br />
               creates two new provinces of an inferior 
               <br />
               type and of a lower grade than the other 
               <br />
               provinces of the Dominion of Canada, and I 
               <br />
               contend that the people of the Territories 
               <br />
               are justiﬁed in their demand to be placed on 
               <br />
               the same level as is occupied by the other 
               <br />
               province especially as they have a popula- 
               <br />
               tion larger at the present moment than the 
               <br />
               populations of four of the seven existing 
               <br />
               provinces of the Dominion. Their disap- 
               <br />
               proval of the Bill which has been introduced 
               <br />
               has been amply proved by the great number 
               <br />
               of protests which they have made and which 
               <br />
               have been placed before this House. I am 
               <br />
               sorry that there are two provinces instead 
               <br />
               of one. The assembly of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories was strongly in favour of having 
               <br />
               only one province for the whole of the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. They had voted on that question and

               opinion on it when they voted as they did . 
               <br />
               at the general elections to which I have 
               <br />
               referred. The late Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) committed himself on only one 
               <br />
               particular point and that was with refer- 
               <br />
               ence to the matter of one or more provinces. 
               <br />
               Although I was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notvpresent</span> at the time 1

               am told on credible authority that both 
               <br />
               at Regina and Indian Head he stated that 
               <br />
               he was in favour of one province. The 
               <br />
               Solicitor General (Mr. Lemieux) has given 
               <br />
               the reasons why apparently the government 
               <br />
               considered it would be undesirable to make 
               <br />
               the whole of the territories into one pro— 
               <br />
               vince. He was afraid that the progress 
               <br />
               and the prosperity of one large province 
               <br />
               would become such that the inﬂuence of that 
               <br />
               province upon the rest of Canada would be 
               <br />
               too great. I regret also to see the name of 
               <br />
               Assiniboia disappear from the map. The 
               <br />
               most thickly settled portion of the eastern 
               <br />
               province, has borne that name for a long

               time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">past:</span> The magniﬁcent Wheat produc-

               of names was being made Assiniboia should 
               <br />

               <br />
               sanctioned by usage, and should have been 
               <br />

               questions than these involved in the Bill

               utes the limitation of the powers of tax-

               people of the new provinces in these Bills-— 
               <br />
               I refer of course to the question of the 
               <br />
               exemption of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               from taxation. One would imagine from 
               <br />
               what one constantly hears in this country 
               <br />
               that the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway had been 
               <br />
               built in order to open up the Northwest and 
               <br />
               that therefore the Northwest should pay 
               <br />
               for the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. But was 
               <br />
               that the case ? Let us turn back for a
