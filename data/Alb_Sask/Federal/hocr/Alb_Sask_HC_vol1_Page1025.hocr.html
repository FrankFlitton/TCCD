               Interior, the Hon. Mr. Oliver. The Con- 
               <br />
               servative association there passed a resolu-

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dature;</span> and he has been returned by ac- 
               <br />
               clamatlon. If he had been opposed, he 
               <br />
               certainly would have been returned by a 
               <br />
               larger majority than he had before. The 
               <br />
               Board of Trade of Edmonton, which cer- 
               <br />
               tainly cannot be called a sectarian body, 
               <br />
               which is neither Galician nor Doukhobor, 
               <br />
               but strictly Canadian, passed a resolution 
               <br />
               endorsing his candidature. I think that is 
               <br />
               a fairly good answer to our critics on the 
               <br />

               <br />
               would give exactly the same answer. I be-

               lieve that the people of the Northwest are

               the splendid speech to which we have just

               listened. It has been one of the most inter—

               esting contributions that has been made

               struck me very forcibly during the last few

               days has been the great calm which has 
               <br />

               <br />
               or four weeks ago it was different. One 
               <br />
               would have imagined, from the speeches of 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite, and from the arti-

               cles in the newspapers which support their 
               <br />
               party, that there was a great agitation in 
               <br />
               this country, that the heather was on ﬁre 
               <br />
               all over Canada. The Toronto ‘World ’ and 
               <br />
               the Toronto ‘ News ’ came out day after day 
               <br />
               with extravagant headlines ; the hon. mem-

               ber for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) deluged 
               <br />
               us with sarcasm; the hon. member for 
               <br />
               South York (Mr. Maclean) went about with 
               <br />
               a chip on his shoulder challenging us all 
               <br />
               to resign; and the hon. member for East

               Grey (Mr. Sproule), in his own mild and 
               <br />
               gentle manner, said some pretty hard things 
               <br />
               about us. But, Sir, the Easter holidays

               came and have passed away, the ice has

               melted from the river, the grass has

               begun to grow, the tulips have begun to

               the quietness of this chamber. We cannot

               We are told that this is a struggle for 
               <br />
               provincial rights. Hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               claim to be the divinely constituted cham- 
               <br />
               pions of these rights considering their past 
               <br />
               record. It is rather satisfactory to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               them in that frame of mind. We are 
               <br />
               rather gratiﬁed to perceive this change of 
               <br />
               heart among so many of our hon. friends 
               <br />
               opposite on this important question. But 
               <br />
               in my opinion provincial rights are not 
               <br />
               at all assailed in this measure, and our hon. 
               <br />
               trends opposite, in rushing to the rescue, 
               <br />
               are simply seeking to combat a phantom 
               <br />
               of their own imagination. If we look 
               <br />
               into the facts, we will ﬁnd that there is no 
               <br />
               such thing in this country as strict pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights on the question of educa- 
               <br />
               tion. That is a thing unknown in our con- 
               <br />
               stitution. It might be a good thing and I 
               <br />
               am not at present disposed to say it would 
               <br />
               not; and if hon. gentlemen opposite Wish to 
               <br />
               start a crusade to change the constitution 
               <br />
               and place the question of education on a 
               <br />
               diﬂerent basis, that would -be a fair ques- 
               <br />
               tion to discuss in public and on which to 
               <br />
               get the sense of. the people. And it hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite were to start any such 
               <br />
               crusade, possibly many of us would feel 
               <br />
               like having the question of education made 
               <br />
               a purely provincial one. I need hardly re- 
               <br />
               fer to the fact, since every hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               here knows it, that section 91 of the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish North America Act enumerates certain 
               <br />
               subjects as coming under Dominion con- 
               <br />
               trol, such as the public debt, postal ser- 
               <br />
               vice, ﬁsheries, the criminal law and many 
               <br />
               others, and that section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">92</span> enumerates the 
               <br />
               subjects which fall under the control of the 
               <br />
               provincial legislature, such as direct tax- 
               <br />
               ation, the maintenance of hospitals and asy- 
               <br />
               lums, property, and civil rights. Then 
               <br />
               we come to section 93, which deals with 
               <br />
               the question of education, and that question 
               <br />
               is dealt with in a different way from any 
               <br />
               of. the others. We do not ﬁnd it mentioned 
               <br />
               at all in sections 91 and 92, but we have 
               <br />
               it specially mentioned in section 93, and 
               <br />
               that section places it under a divided juris- 
               <br />
               diction. Provision is made for separate 
               <br />
               schools in the old provinces of Quebec and 
               <br />
               Ontario, and there is also a provision that 
               <br />
               the minority in the other provinces will 
               <br />
               have the right to appeal to the Dominion 
               <br />
               parliament against any injustice done them 
               <br />
               by a provincial legislature. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.seems</span> to 
               <br />
               me therefore plain that in the matter ot 
               <br />
               education there is no such thing, strictly 
               <br />
               speaking, as provincial rights under our 
               <br />
               constitution.
