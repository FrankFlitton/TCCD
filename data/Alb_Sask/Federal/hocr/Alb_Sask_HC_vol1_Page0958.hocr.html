               I am not referring to this matter for the

               <br />
               ing with a great deal of what they said. I

               do not see, however, that this part of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               bearing upon the issues now before us. My 
               <br />
               only reason for referring to the matter at 
               <br />
               all, is that these hon. gentlemen brought it 
               <br />
               forward in the course of this debate. They 
               <br />
               reminded the House of what happened 
               <br />
               during the war of the American revolution, 
               <br />
               how emissaries came to this country from 
               <br />
               the revolted Protestant colonies to the south. 
               <br />
               These emissaries came to the French Can- 
               <br />
               adian priests and the French Canadian peo— 
               <br />
               ple and invited Canadians to throw in their 
               <br />
               lot with the revolution. These hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men reminded us how both the French Can- 
               <br />
               adian priests and the French Canadian peo- 
               <br />
               ple scorned the advances made to them in 
               <br />
               1774 to join a rebellion against Great Britain 
               <br />
               and in 1812 to give sympathy and aid to 
               <br />
               those who were at war with Great Britain. 
               <br />
               These people decided to remain British citi- 
               <br />
               zens and they were loyal and sincere in the 
               <br />
               stand they took. I agree with all that and I 
               <br />
               am proud of the stand taken by the French 
               <br />
               Canadians on those occasions as are these 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen themselves. But I should 
               <br />
               have been glad had these hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               gone further and explained—in order that 
               <br />
               we might understand the point that they 
               <br />
               were making—what other position these 
               <br />
               people could have taken. Had they pursued 
               <br />
               any other course than the one they did, 
               <br />
               they would have lost British citizenship, 
               <br />
               and that they did not want to do. They 
               <br />
               preferred to be British citizens rather than 
               <br />
               become citizens of a country in which they 
               <br />
               could not have maintained the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privileges</span> 
               <br />
               guaranteed by the settlement of 1759. I

               would like to have had these hon. gentle-

               mengo a little further, and explain to me 
               <br />

               with that matter, as coming from the pro-

               a way that will not be offensive, I am sure, 
               <br />
               to my fellow-countrymen in that province. 
               <br />
               I do not propose to criticise the Quebec 
               <br />
               educational system. In that province, the 
               <br />
               public school system, which is Catholic, 
               <br />
               appears to suit our fellow-countrymen 
               <br />
               of French origin. These schools have 
               <br />
               been instrumental in preserving the 
               <br />
               French language, and in keeping the 
               <br />
               religious observations of the church 
               <br />
               uppermost in the minds of the people. The 
               <br />
               schools are practically a part of the church. 
               <br />
               And through the devotion of the clergy to 
               <br />
               the object in view, there is in Quebec a de- 
               <br />
               vout people, who have a great reverence for 
               <br />
               the Christian religion, as it has been taught 
               <br />
               to them. And I believe that nowhere in Can-

               ada does there exist a better living people 
               <br />
               than the people of the province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               So far as the Catholics of that province are 
               <br />
