               Mr. OLIVER. Well, I did not intend to 
               <br />
               answer him in that way. In regard to ex-

               friend from Calgary that there have’ been 
               <br />
               applications, and very proper applications, 
               <br />
               before the Department of Agriculture to my 
               <br />
               knowledge ever since 1896 for the estab-

               or contiguous to the district which he repre- 
               <br />
               sents, and I do not think it is any discredit 
               <br />
               to the district that it should be so. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">experimental</span> farm at Indian Head is situ-

               ated in a farming district, than which there 
               <br />
               is no better on this continent. And why is 
               <br />
               it any discredit to the agricultural capabili-

               be anxious for the establishment of an ex-

               perimental farm ? My hon. friend (Mr. M. 
               <br />
               S. McCarthy) is driven to hard straits in 
               <br />
               support of his contention as to representa-

               tion when he sees ﬁt to attempt to discredit 
               <br />
               the agricultural capabilities of a country that 
               <br />
               is not subject to be discredited by the source 
               <br />
               from which the attempt comes.
