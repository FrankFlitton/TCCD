               wer Mr. Mackenzie gave was this: Go 
               <br />
               back to your own province and see if, by 
               <br />

               assistance. The chief fault Mr. Mackenzie 
               <br />
               found with them was that they had two 
               <br />
               chambers, they had a legislative council 
               <br />

               <br />
               ought to abolish <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> legislative council, 
               <br />
               and he promised if they would exercise

               squarely to the minority of the province, as

               Now, I would like to say to hon. gentle-

               <br />
               too sensitive as to the way members ex- 
               <br />
               press their views on this question. The 
               <br />
               question comes before us, as we believe, 
               <br />
               not in proper course. Had this Autonomy 
               <br />
               Bill been brought in minus the educational 
               <br />
               clauses, the people of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories would have continued to enjoy the 
               <br />
               same privileges in education that they now 
               <br />
               have, unless those privileges were curtailed 
               <br />
               by the legislature we might create. But, 
               <br />
               if the legislature made such changes we be- 
               <br />
               lieve they would be within their rights. 
               <br />
               And I am prepared to vote against any in- 
               <br />
               terference with their freedom in educa-

               Just a word' or two with regard to the
