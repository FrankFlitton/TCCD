               best possible education they can receive. 
               <br />
               I think, Sir, we may take it for granted 
               <br />
               that the reason the state desires to control 
               <br />
               the education of its youth is that intelli- 
               <br />
               gent peoples recognize that the greatest 
               <br />
               handicap to which youth can be subjected 
               <br />
               is the want of education. We know perfect- 
               <br />
               ly well in our own country that if two lads 
               <br />
               start out in life, one handicapped by a lack 
               <br />
               of education and the other possessed of an 
               <br />
               education, there is no doubt who will be the 
               <br />
               successful man and who will be the hewer 
               <br />

               <br />
               The same thing applies as between nations. 
               <br />
               We all recognize that if one nation looks 
               <br />
               after the education of its youth, while an- 
               <br />
               other nation neglects to do so, the nation 
               <br />
               which neglects the education of its youth 
               <br />
               will be the servant of the other. To—day 
               <br />
               the nations of the world have taken upon 
               <br />
               themselves to look after the subject of 
               <br />
               education for the reason that I have given.

               Why is it that in this country education 
               <br />
               is, by the British North America Act, al- 
               <br />
               lotted to the provinces ? We have the 
               <br />
               division of a great many powers given under 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. To the Do— 
               <br />
               minion is allotted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.the</span> power to legislate ex- 
               <br />
               clusively on many subjects and to the pro— 
               <br />
               vinces is allotted the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{power</span> to legislate ex- 
               <br />
               clusively on many other subjects. Is there 
               <br />
               any reason why, in our own country, this 
               <br />
               particular subject of education has been 
               <br />
               allotted to the provinces ? I think there is 
               <br />
               a well-known reason, and I am going to 
               <br />
               point out that, although it has frequently 
               <br />
               been said in this debate that the provinces 
               <br />
               have not the exclusive right to legislate on 
               <br />
               that subject as they have touching other 
               <br />
               matters, practically they have the exclusive 
               <br />
               right. There is a limitation to their right 
               <br />
               to legislate upon education. They cannot 
               <br />
               legislate as freely perhaps as they can legis- 
               <br />
               late on other subjects, but their right is ex- 
               <br />
               clusive. No other power has the right to 
               <br />
               legislate, except that in certain cases an 
               <br />
               application can be made to the Dominion, 
               <br />
               under the remedial clause, which. as was 
               <br />
               illustrated in the Manitoba school case, has 
               <br />
               been practically blotted out of the statute- 
               <br />
               book. We ask why it is that in our country 
               <br />
               the Dominion has no jurisdiction or legisla- 
               <br />
               tive power, except in exceptional cases, in re— 
               <br />
               gard to education and that the power of 
               <br />
               legislation is given exclusively to the prov- 
               <br />
               inces? We have the answer to that. We know 
               <br />
               that the great father of confederation, Sir 
               <br />
               John Macdonald himself, favoured alegisla- 
               <br />
               tive and not a federal union. His idea was to 
               <br />
               have a great central parliament, as they 
               <br />
               have it in the mother country, conferring 
               <br />
               greater powers on the county councils and, 
               <br />
               to save expense, dispensing with the local 
               <br />

               legislatures. But he was unable to carry 
               <br />
               out his idea of a legislative union, and the 
               <br />
               main reason why a legislative union was not 
               <br />
               carried out by the Dominion of Canada was 
               <br />
               that the great province of Quebec insisted 
               <br />
               that the control of education must be left 
               <br />
               to the provinces. Let me quote a speech 
               <br />
               in the parliamentary debates on the New 
               <br />
               Brunswick School Act. Sir John Macdon- 
               <br />
               ald, then premier, spoke as follows: 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It was known to every one that the question 
               <br />
               of education had threatened confederation at its 
               <br />
               very inception, and a proposition that education 
               <br />
               should be left to the general legislature of the 
               <br />
               Dominion would have been enough to secure 
               <br />
               the repudiation of confederation by the people 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada, and it was therefore ex- 
               <br />
               presly provided in the Act of union that the 
               <br />
               question should be entirely left to the different 
               <br />
               provinces with the provision that whenever- 
               <br />
               there was a separate system in force that sys- 
               <br />
               tem should not be interfered with.

               So we ﬁnd that to-day what we of the

               vinces, was carried out in accordance with 
               <br />
               the principle laid down by the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, which determined the question 
               <br />
               whether or not we should have a legislative 
               <br />
               or a federal government in this country. 
               <br />
               We now come to these educational clauses 
               <br />
               that we have before us. We have heard a 
               <br />
               great deal about the rights of minorities. 
               <br />
               and I would be very sorry to say a word 
               <br />
               against the rights of minorities. I have in 
               <br />
               days gone by in this House stood up for the 
               <br />
               rights of minorities, even though I knew the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">penalty</span> I must pay was the loss of my seat 
               <br />
               in this House; and I have never since re— 
               <br />
               gretted that, because, although I lost my 
               <br />
               seat, I had the consciousness of doing what 
               <br />
               I believed to be right. I have no hesitation- 
               <br />
               in saying that it is incumbent on any majori- 
               <br />
               ty, not merely to be just to the minority. for 
               <br />
               there is no credit to a majority any more 
               <br />
               than to a man in being just, but I think 
               <br />
               it is in honour incumbent on the majority 
               <br />
               to be generous to the minority in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> matters 
               <br />
               in which the minority take a deep interest, 
               <br />
               and there is no matter in which they take 
               <br />
               a deeper interest than in that of education. 
               <br />
               Therefore, I say there is no hon. member 
               <br />
               of this House who would have greater con- 
               <br />
               sideration for the feelings of the minority. 
               <br />
               to whatever class the minority might be- 
               <br />
               long, than I myself. But while paying all 
               <br />
               possible respect to the feelings of the minori- 
               <br />
               ty, we would be unworthy of our positions 
               <br />
               in this House if we entirely shut our eyes
