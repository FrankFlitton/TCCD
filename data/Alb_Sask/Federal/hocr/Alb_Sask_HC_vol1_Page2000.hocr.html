               It is indispensable to the welfare of British

               <br />
               been waiting for it, they have now an op-

               that this railway should be built on Cana-

               territory which is not tapped by the Ameri-

               territory by all means, but this railway dees 
               <br />
               not serve its purpose if it is denied access 
               <br />
               to American territory. Why, Sir, all our 
               <br />
               railways are tapped by American railways. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman stated a moment ago 
               <br />
               that this territory in British Columbia was 
               <br />
               already tapped at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">several.</span> different places 
               <br />
               by American railways. Possibly it is. But 
               <br />
               let me ask if there is any part of the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian frontier between the Paciﬁc ocean and 
               <br />
               the River St. Lawrence which is not tapped 
               <br />
               at almost every mile by American railways ? 
               <br />
               The necessities of the case require it. We 
               <br />
               built a road a few years ago, the Crow's 
               <br />
               Nest Pass Railway, 8. very useful road; 
               <br />
               but when that road was completed, one of 
               <br />
               the very ﬁrst things it did was to obtain 
               <br />
               communication with the American side. The 
               <br />
               American traffic forms a valuable part of 
               <br />
               the trafﬁc of the Crow‘s Nest Pass Railway, 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               and this American <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">connectipn</span> increases the 
               <br />
               value of the business which it has develop- 
               <br />
               ed in the mining districts. So I say: Put 
               <br />
               this road on Canadian territory by all means. 
               <br />
               But I repeat what I said a moment ago, 
               <br />
               that the powers which are vested in the 
               <br />
               Governor in Council are ample, and the 
               <br />
               Governor in Council will exercise those 
               <br />
               powers in order to keep it, if possible, on 
               <br />
               Canadian territory, and it is only allowed to 
               <br />
               be diverted when that is necessary in order 
               <br />
               to avoid great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> of construction. 
               <br />
               For these reasons, the government have 
               <br />
               come to the conclusion not to accept the 
               <br />

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I understood the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman to suggest that clause 
               <br />
               3a, proposed by my hon. friend from North 
               <br />
               Toronto (Mr. Foster), is similar in some 
               <br />
               aspects to clause 3 of the Bill. The remark 
               <br />
               I made a moment before was in view of 
               <br />
               what I understood to be another compari— 
               <br />
               son, namely, that between section 7 of the 
               <br />
               Bill as it now stands and the section pro- 
               <br />
               posed by the member for North Toronto. 
               <br />
               But if there is, as the Prime Minister says, 
               <br />
               very little difference between section 3a, 
               <br />
               now proposed to be added by way of amend- 
               <br />
               ment, and section 3, why, after all, is it like— 
               <br />
               ly that the proposed amendment would have 
               <br />
               any greater effect in retarding the construc- 
               <br />
               tion than section 3 as it now stands? It 
               <br />
               seems to me to impose more responsibility 
               <br />
               upon the government. But I do not quite 
               <br />
               follow that portion of the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man’s argument which indicated that there 
               <br />
               would be greater danger of unduly retarding 
               <br />
               the road.

               Mr. .LENNOX. As the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               says, it is a delicate matter to amend a 
               <br />
               Bill coming from the Railway Committee. 
               <br />
               The Railway Committee has already amend- 
               <br />
               ed this Bill, and would have amended it 
               <br />
               further had it not been, as suggested by the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               ment had been ascertained. The Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance evidently regarded it as an import-
