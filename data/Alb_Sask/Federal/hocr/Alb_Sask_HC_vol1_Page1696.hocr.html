               they were not according to the census of 
               <br />
               1901, but that according to that census 
               <br />
               there was a greater population north of

               township 38 than there was south of it. 
               <br />
               But we know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the census of 1901 does 
               <br />
               not aiford a proper basis of estimate. This 
               <br />
               is stated by the Minister of the interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Oliver) himself, who says, at page

               For the province of Alberta the census was 
               <br />
               taken in 1901, and therefore had become an un- 
               <br />

               <br />
               It was therefore thought better to take as a

               Well, if you take the actual votes polled, 
               <br />
               what does it show ? Take even the govern- 
               <br />
               ment’s ﬁgures and you ﬁnd that 11 south- 
               <br />
               ern constituencies polled in November 3rd 
               <br />
               last 10,556 votes, while 11 northern consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies polled only 9,553 votes. This omits 
               <br />
               the constituency of Red Deer, which is 
               <br />
               partly in the north and partly in the south. 
               <br />
               So, taking the basis proposed by the Minis— 
               <br />
               ter of the Interior himself, you ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               this redistribution gives more representa- 
               <br />
               tives to the north than it is entitled to. 
               <br />
               But if you take the ﬁgures prepared by the 
               <br />
               opposition the disproportion is even great- 
               <br />
               er. And there is probably greater accur-

               <br />
               ﬁgures incorrect, as no homestead entries 
               <br />

               gentleman (Mr. Peter Talbot). lt will show 
               <br />
               that there are very few townships for

               map, he will see that his calculation is 
               <br />
               manifestly unfair. Further, I would point 
               <br />
