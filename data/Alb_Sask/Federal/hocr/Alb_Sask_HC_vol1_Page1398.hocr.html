               <br />
               secured at two of the Galician polls. He 
               <br />
               was able to roll up a majority of sixty—one 
               <br />
               at two of these polls and he could not get 
               <br />
               anywhere near that majority at any otner 
               <br />

               Mr. PAT-ERISON. Our friends opposite 
               <br />
               seem not disposed to expedite matters parti- 
               <br />
               cularly, and I do not want to join them in 
               <br />
               that course. However, if we are to continue 
               <br />
               the discussion there is one circumstance 
               <br />
               which I wish to bring before the notice of 
               <br />
               the House and of our friends opposite and 
               <br />
               the leader of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1the</span> opposition particularly. I 
               <br />
               would like to have from him an explan- 
               <br />
               ation on that one point. In his remarks he 
               <br />
               referred to what had been stated by the 
               <br />
               Finance Minister when he alluded to an im- 
               <br />
               portant event having taken place in the 
               <br />
               district of Edmonton, and he asked :‘ What 
               <br />
               about Centre Toronto ? If the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman will remember when I had the hon- 
               <br />
               our of addressing the House on this question 
               <br />
               and was noticing the challenges that were 
               <br />
               being thrown out, notably by the hon. mem- 
               <br />
