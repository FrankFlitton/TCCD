               for the lands taken away from them by 
               <br />
               this government. A good deal has been laid 
               <br />
               as to what the provinces would do, should 
               <br />
               the lands be handed over to them, for money 
               <br />
               to carry on the government. I may state 
               <br />
               that there have during the last few years 
               <br />
               been large sales of coal lands made. That 
               <br />
               is one way in which a revenue could be 
               <br />
               obtained by the new provinces. I under- 
               <br />
               stand that within the last two years a sale 
               <br />
               of coal lands amounting to about $300,000 
               <br />
               was made to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’one</span> man. That information 
               <br />
               may not be correct but I saw the report in 
               <br />
               several papers. If that is true it applies 
               <br />
               to a very small portion of our coal lands. 
               <br />
               I understand that large sales are being 
               <br />
               made continually to outside corporations. 
               <br />
               I understand that Jim Hill has, in the 
               <br />
               neighbourhood of Pincher <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Creek</span> where I 
               <br />
               live, 10,000 acres of coal lands. I do not 
               <br />
               know what he has paid ‘for them; I do 
               <br />
               not know, in fact, whether "he owns the 
               <br />
               lands or not, but it is generally supposed 
               <br />
               that he owns them, and if he paid the 
               <br />
               same price for these lands that other people 
               <br />
               are paying for similar lands the amount will 
               <br />
               be quite considerable. Other coal lands are 
               <br />
               being sold from time to time. That is one 
               <br />
               source from which a considerable amount 
               <br />
               of revenue would be received by the new 
               <br />
               provinces. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Another way in which, I think, it would 
               <br />
               be very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expedient</span> for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> to 
               <br />
               deal with a portion of the Northwest lands 
               <br />
               would be to grant a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(preemption</span> to settlers. 
               <br />
               I do not know whether it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generally</span> ac- 
               <br />
               cepted in this country or by members from 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, but in my locali- 
               <br />
               ty it is considered that a quarter section of 
               <br />
               land is not suﬂici-ent for a homestead. I 
               <br />
               think this government should take into con- 
               <br />
               sideration the selling to homesteaders the 
               <br />
               odd quarter section adjoining their home- 
               <br />
               steads. As I understand the policy of 
               <br />
               the department at the present time there 
               <br />
               is no land for sale in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories to any person. I believe that 
               <br />
               is the present policy of the government. 
               <br />
               No doubt they will sell in time, and I 
               <br />
               do not see any reason why they should 
               <br />
               refrain from selling land to settlers. We 
               <br />
               know they have been selling it to cor- 
               <br />
               porations. I am quite sincere in what I say 
               <br />
               in reference to placing these odd sections 
               <br />
               at the disposal of homesteaders in addition 
               <br />
               to their homesteads. I think the govern- 
               <br />
               ment could sell this land at a good price, 
               <br />
               and I do not think they could sell it to any 
               <br />
               better people than the homesteaders, selling 
               <br />
               it to them at the price of railway lands, for 
               <br />
               instance. I say the time will come very 
               <br />
               soon, when, it even the Dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment retain these lands, they will be put- 
               <br />
               ting up the price; they will not be giving 
               <br />
               these lands as free homesteads. I do not 
               <br />
               think it is justice to the pioneers who have 
               <br />
               gone in and settled that country, taken up 
               <br />
               land and advanced its value until to—day 
               <br />
               it is worth $5 to $10 an acre, in fact from
