               to do a thing that even this government

               <br />
               commenced by doing away largely with 
               <br />
               cabinet responsibility, and by throwing 
               <br />

               When you put a strong willed minister in

               <br />
               pen. It happened eaily in the career of this 
               <br />
               government. The Minister of Railways and 
               <br />
               Canals did work on a large scale in the pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               provinces without ever having consulted his 
               <br />
               colleagues in the cabinet at all; and 1 be-

               lived by various ministers regarding what 
               <br />

               <br />
               instance of what I mention, and it had some 
               <br />
               effect probably in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cabinet—how</span> much

               <br />
               comes, to push their advantage. Look at 
               <br />
               the humiliating confession made in parlia- 
               <br />
               ment by the ex-Minister of the Interior him- 
               <br />
               self. It was on the occasion of the Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan land business. A certain block of land 
               <br />
               was sold at a song, given away for some 
               <br />
               money and a little more scrip, but thecon- 
               <br />
               dltions were laid down, solemnly agreed 
               <br />
               upon, and brought to this parliament. One 
               <br />
               of the conditions was that they should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pen</span> 
               <br />
               form <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their-obligations</span> and make their pay- 
               <br />
               ments before getting their patents. It came 
               <br />
               out however in this House—it was brought 
               <br />
               out by some hon. gentleman on this side—- 
               <br />
               that the patents were issued before the con- 
               <br />
               ditions were fulﬁlled, and that this was done 
               <br />
               without the cognizance of the minister, and 
               <br />
               the minister had to make a confession in the 
               <br />
               House that he did not know it was done or 
               <br />
               he would not have allowed it. That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> 
               <br />
               is still in the department. He actually gave 
               <br />
               to these gentlemen patents for their lands 
               <br />
               when they had not fulﬁlled their conditions, 
               <br />
               and the only excuse given by the minister 
               <br />
               was that it had not come to his attention 
               <br />
               until too late. This transaction is on the 
               <br />
               same basis. They have had their ﬂing and 
               <br />
               their run in that department. They knew 
               <br />
               that the Prime Minister was easy, and they 
               <br />
               proposed to have it when there was no min- 
               <br />
               ister particularly in charge. In this way 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> gone on. There are some things in 
               <br />
               connection with that department which merit 
               <br />
               the immediate attention of the new Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior, and I hope he will give them 
               <br />
               There have been too 
               <br />
               many rumours regarding that department, too 
               <br />
               many suspicions of jobs carried out in it; 
               <br />
               and what I hope now is that an honest ad- 
               <br />
               ministration of that department will take 
               <br />
               place. But what ought to take place cer- 
               <br />
               tainly is that parliament should not be 
               <br />
               triﬂed with and that no Prime Minister or 
               <br />
               minister should be given false information 
               <br />
               by which to mislead the House. It may be 
               <br />
               all a mistake that can be cleared up as a 
               <br />
               misunderstanding; but it looks now as if it 
               <br />
               were gross carelessness. or something worse, 
               <br />
               that when a contract of that kind had been 
               <br />
               given, the First Minister should have had a 
               <br />
               wrong answer put into his hand. The same 
               <br />
               thing took place earlier in the session, and 1 
               <br />
               called the right hon. gentleman’s attention 
               <br />
               to it. With Mr. Pedley, one of the oﬂicers 
               <br />
               of the department, sitting right before him, 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman was made to give 
               <br />
               to this House information which was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abso—</span> 
               <br />
               lutely incorrect and to provide promotion in 
               <br />
               that department on this false information; 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and,</span> the only reason the Prime Minister had 
               <br />
               for giving it, was the information with which 
               <br />
               he had been furnished. Now his own secre-
