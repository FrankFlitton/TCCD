               1 made a little different calculation on 
               <br />
               the post oﬂices to that which was furnish-

               ed by the Post Ofﬁce Department to the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior. I shall give my 
               <br />
               calculation, and I think you will agree with 
               <br />
               me that I acted very fairly. I found that 
               <br />
               in the constituency of Alberta there were 
               <br />
               forty-six post ofﬁces; in Medicine Hat dis- 
               <br />
               trict, which is to .be added to Alberta, there 
               <br />
               were ten; in Calgary, fifty-four; in Edmonton 
               <br />
               district, sixty, and in Strathcona, ninety- 
               <br />
               ﬁve. A portion of the Strathcona consti- 
               <br />
               tuency runs south of township 38. I made 
               <br />
               a careful calculation of the votes polled 
               <br />
               north and south of Red Deer in my con- 
               <br />
               stituency, and I concluded that one—ﬁfth 
               <br />
               of my constituency was south of the river. 
               <br />
               Going on that conclusion, the part of 
               <br />
               Strathcona constituency south of Red Deer 
               <br />
               would have nineteen post ofﬁces. That 
               <br />
               would leave south of Red Deer 129 post 
               <br />
               ofﬁces and north of Red Deer 136 post 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁces.</span> Although I ani well aware that 
               <br />
               post ofﬁces are not a sure indication of 
               <br />
               population, I submit that in a farming 
               <br />
               country they do indicate whether that 
               <br />
               country is fairly thickly settled or not. If 
               <br />
               we find in a certain district ten post ofﬁces 
               <br />
               and in another of the same size only tour, 
               <br />
               we would naturally conclude that there 
               <br />
               was a much larger population in the form- 
               <br />
               er than the latter.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I also claim that the local improvement 
               <br />
               districts that were organized north and south 
               <br />
               of Red Deer-are an indication of population, 
               <br />
               although not one that can be entirely relied 
               <br />
               upon. The people are not compelled to form 
               <br />
               local improvement districts, but if they do 
               <br />
               form these local improvement districts, they 
               <br />
               spend their own taxes in their own way. If 
               <br />
               they do not form these local improvement 
               <br />
               districts they pay their taxes to the govern- 
               <br />
               ment at Regina, and their money is expend- 
               <br />
               ed for them. But we know that the great 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> of the people want to see how 
               <br />
               their taxes are going to be spent, and the 
               <br />
               result is that they have formed these local 
               <br />
               improvement districts wherever there is 
               <br />

               would tell the population of a district or 
               <br />
               a country, it would be the number of schools 
               <br />
               in it. People do not form schools until they 
               <br />
               have to. They do not organize schools and 
               <br />
               pay taxes for fun. They are compelled, by 
               <br />
               our laws up there, when the child population 
               <br />
               of the locality reaches a certain number, to 
               <br />
               organize schools, and school districts are of 
               <br />
               a uniform size. I ﬁnd that in Edmonton 
               <br />
               constituency there are 92 schools, in the 
               <br />
               part 'of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1Strathcona</span> north of township 38 
               <br />
               there are 234 schools, making a total north 
               <br />
               of Red Deer of 326. South of Red Deer 
               <br />
               we have in Alberta constituency 74 schools, 
               <br />
               in Calgary district 116 schools, in part of 
               <br />
               Strathcona south of Red Deer 58 schools and 
               <br />
               in Medicine Hat district 20 schools, making 
               <br />
               a total of 268———326 schools north of Red 
               <br />
               Deer and 268 south of Red Deer. I believe 
               <br />
               I am correct in saying that that corresponds 
               <br />
               with the number of teachers for each room 
               <br />
               is called a school in the report of our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commissioner</span> of Education. Some one 
               <br />
