               I for one, Mr. Speaker, am of opinion 
               <br />
               that our fellow countrymen and fellow-be-

               all the rights and privileges to which they 
               <br />
               are fairly entitled. But, in a country with 
               <br />
               a mixed population, honourable compromises 
               <br />
               should not be spurned. especialy when, on 
               <br />
               looking back into the past I ﬁnd that the

               other means fail and the majority are 
               <br />
               against us ? In 1892, the minority had a 
               <br />
               feeling that they were downtrodden, and 
               <br />
               that they could not get along under the new 
               <br />
               ordinances. However, subsequent events 
               <br />
               showed that their fears had been exagger- 
               <br />
               ated. and it seems as if. things had been 
               <br />

               Another very striking circumstance was

               opportunity for asserting their rights; on 
               <br />
