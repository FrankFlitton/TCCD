               King John said—and let me tell these hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen that this is my sentiment—that

               and tithe in our dominions by an outside 
               <br />
               inﬂuence. The Prime Minister knows that 
               <br />
               his statement was not in accordance with 
               <br />
               the facts when he said that there was no

               intention to interfere with the Dominion 
               <br />

               <br />
               tention to interfere with the Dominion 
               <br />

               plain this matter before the country. They 
               <br />

               an election, he would have stated grounds 
               <br />
               which might have been of some use in 
               <br />
               England 300 years ago but would not be

               tolerated in any civilized country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today——</span> 
               <br />
               the ground of no popery and no romish 
               <br />
               domination. That is the cry the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman would like to raise. And that is the 
               <br />
               kind of cry, as things have been going, the 
               <br />
               past few weeks, which the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition will be charged with encouraging. 
               <br />
               That is the cry which the leader of a once 
               <br />
               respected party in the Dominion is lending 
               <br />
               himself to.
