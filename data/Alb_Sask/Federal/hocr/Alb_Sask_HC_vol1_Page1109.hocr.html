               <br />
               were ardent in favour of them in 1896. My

               hon. friend from Marquette (Mr. Roche) 
               <br />
               quoted the speech of the ex-Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior (Mr. Sifton) which was delivered 
               <br />
               at Caledonia Springs in April, 1895. In that 
               <br />
               speech the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex-Ministzr</span> of the Interior was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> warm in his denunciation of separate

               <br />
               quoted by my hon, friend from Marquette, 
               <br />
               I will content myself with citing only one

               item which deals more especially with pro-‘

               I will venture the statement that the true

               <br />
               will be better advanced by a policy of con-

               I do not intend to make more than a pass- 
               <br />
               ing reference to the school ordinances of 
               <br />
               1891. I would like to include them in my 
               <br />
               remarks, but they have been fully explained 
               <br />
               by hon. members on both sides of the 
               <br />
               House. In these ordinances there is no- 
               <br />
               thing that can give oiïence to anybody. 
               <br />
               Under these, the regulating of the duties 
               <br />
               of teachers and the control of the schools 
               <br />
               is given to the commissioners appointed by 
               <br />
               the Territorial government and will be with- 
               <br />
               in the jurisdiction of the new provinces un— 
               <br />
               der the Bills creating them, subject to the 
               <br />
               religious instruction provided for under 
               <br />
               clause 137, and this should commend itself 
               <br />
               to all loyal and God-fearing people. As I 
               <br />
               have said, this part of the question has 
               <br />
               been referred to frequently and at length, 
               <br />
               and I shall not continue the discussion. 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst public school I attended 
               <br />
               in-my native town there were two teachers 
               <br />
               One or the 
               <br />
               other opened the daily exercises with the 
               <br />
               Lord’s prayer. And this was acceptable 
               <br />
               to every one. Since then some of my warm- 
               <br />
