               a compact this is when it can be construed 
               <br />
               in 1896 to apply to all the provinces, and

               man in 1905 to apply to only two of them. 
               <br />
               _It is quite evident that what occurred in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ism—and</span> there is no dispute about it— 
               <br />
               was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compromise.</span> This compact was made 
               <br />
               applicable, it is alleged by some, to only 
               <br />
               two provinces, and applicable, as alleged 
               <br />
               by others, to all the provinces. The lan— 
               <br />
               guage of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*I</span> would su/bmit, clearly applies to all 
               <br />
               those entering the union. So, there was 
               <br />
               no difference between the parties at that 
               <br />
               time, nor any difference between the creeds. 
               <br />
               In 1870, Sir John Macdonald and his gov- 
               <br />
               ernment created the province of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               There is no doubt that at that time, the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman sought to place upon that 
               <br />
               province the separate school and the dual 
               <br />
               language system. That was acquiesced 
               <br />
               in by the Liberals. In 1875, a Liberal 
               <br />

               <br />
               other branch of my argument. In that year 
               <br />
               a portion of the district ot Keewatin was 
               <br />
               added to the province of Manitoba. And 
               <br />
               parliament added that territory to Manitoba 
               <br />
               without any restriction ; it took away what- 
               <br />
               ever rights Keewatin .had and placed the 
               <br />
               territory on the same basis as the rest of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. So, that portion added to Manl- 
               <br />
               toba in 1880 was made subject to the Maui- 
               <br />
               toba charter, and released entirely by this 
               <br />
               parliament from any laws, rights or privi- 
               <br />
               leges which it had up to 1880. The point 
               <br />
               I make is that we have on this occasion 
               <br />
               equal freedom to deal with these new pro— 
               <br />
               vinces, and to give them a charter such as 
               <br />
               we deem in their best interest. In 1889 
               <br />
               or 1890 this question was mooted in 
               <br />

               Carthy pointed out to this House certain

               tain things. He said in that year that the

               separate schools system of Manitoba was 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Was</span> not a wise system. He said also that

               the dual language and the separate school

               House at that time will remember the 
               <br />
               motions made and the discussions that took 
               <br />
               place. It was only after many defeats, 
               <br />
               many rebuﬁs, that the ﬁrst sign of success 
               <br />
               on his part was seen. Sir John Thompson 
               <br />
               agreed to the passing of a motion which re— 
               <br />
               legated to the Territorial government of the 
               <br />
               l <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'orthwest</span> Territories the right to deal with 
               <br />
               the language question. It is worthy of note 
               <br />
               that at that time Sir John <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Thompson</span> made 
               <br />
               a clear distinction between the language 
               <br />
               question and the school question. He gave 
               <br />
               in on the language question, but on the 
               <br />
               school question he refused to give in,- as 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen who were here at the time 
               <br />
               will remember. This happened in the ses- 
               <br />
               sion of 1892. Both parties acquiesced in 
               <br />
               that, I believe, though there may have been 
               <br />
               some dissentient voices—I am not sure about 
               <br />
               that. But, in the December following, Sir 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">John</span> Thompson being then premier, saw 
               <br />
               ﬁt to read out of the Conservative party 
               <br />
               Mr. Dalton McCarthy because that gentle- 
               <br />
               man dared to give utterance to views which 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman opposite are expressing to- 
               <br />
               day. There were only two questions on 
               <br />
               which he was giving expression to opinions 
               <br />
               not acceptable to the government of that 
               <br />
               day, and they were the separate school ques- 
               <br />
               tion of Manitoba and the separate school 
               <br />
               question of the Northwest Territories. As 
               <br />
               a matter of fact, the language question had
