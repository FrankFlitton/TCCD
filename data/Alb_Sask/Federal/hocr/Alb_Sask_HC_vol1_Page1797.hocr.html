               settling this once for all. Will this settle 
               <br />
               it once for all? You may satisfy the min- 
               <br />
               ority, but what have you done with the ma- 
               <br />
               jority? If in satisfying the minority you 
               <br />
               create a grievance on the part of the ma- 
               <br />
               jority as great or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greater</span> than the satis- 
               <br />
               faction which you give to the minority, will 
               <br />
               there be other than discontent in the new 
               <br />
               provinces? I say it is the most unlikely 
               <br />
               thing in the world; it will not settle the 
               <br />
               question to take away the rights of the ma— 
               <br />
               jority so as to give special rights to the 
               <br />
               minority. The principle still holds good that 
               <br />
               the majority must rule, as enunciated by 
               <br />
               the First Minister in 1896. He then said 
               <br />
               that is a truism that cannot be denied. 
               <br />
               the majority must have their way. He was 
               <br />
               applying it to Manitoba, and I ask him to 
               <br />
               apply the same language and logic to the 
               <br />
               new provinces and he will ﬁnd himself 
               <br />
               sadly in conﬂict with the Bill now before 
               <br />
               the House. Who are the people after all 
               <br />
               that we should seek to satisfy by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con—</span> 
               <br />
               stitution we are giving? Is it not the ma- 
               <br />
               jority of the people in these two new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces ? Is it the people in Quebec ? Is it 
               <br />
               not more important that we satisfy the 
               <br />
               people out there ? Does the Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance remember that at one time 
               <br />
               in the history of his province, be- 
               <br />
               cause his province was compelled to come 
               <br />
               into confederation without the people hav- 
               <br />
               ing a say in it, or :being able to negotiate 
               <br />
               for their entrance, he saw ﬁt to run his 
               <br />
               election on secession. Take the same _con- 
               <br />
               ditions in these new provinces, and the same 
               <br />
               results are likely to follow. If you ignore 
               <br />
               the rights of the people there, if they are 
               <br />
               not consulted or allowed to take part in 
               <br />
               these negotiations and their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights</span> have been 
               <br />
               disregarded, I say it is not reasonable to 
               <br />
               suppose they will be content in the future 
               <br />
               and that there will be no grievances out 
               <br />
               there. You are compelling the majority 
               <br />
               to submit to the minority and to give what 
               <br />
               the majority may not want to give—I do 
               <br />
               not know whether they do or do not. Do 
               <br />
