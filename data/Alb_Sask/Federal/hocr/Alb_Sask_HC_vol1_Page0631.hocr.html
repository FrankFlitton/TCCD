               parliament met. Sir Charles Topper was

               <br />
               many speeches were made in the House.

               <br />
               down to 1896. The government went to the

               <br />
               the coercion policy. In that election we 
               <br />
               certainly were, in the province of Ontario, 
               <br />
               denouncing the government because of its 
               <br />
               coercion policy. The Liberals, on the other 
               <br />
               hand, were saying: Return us to power, 
               <br />
               and by methods of conciliation we will 
               <br />
               settle this question. The Conservatives 
               <br />
               made it clear .that they intended, if returned, 
               <br />
               to pass the Remedial Bill. The country re- 
               <br />
               turned the Liberals, and some kind of a 
               <br />
               settlement was made which was placed on

               never heard before or dreamed of. It ap—

               yesterday. But I do not think that any hon.

               On the 21st February last the Bill which 
               <br />
               is now before the House was introduced. 
               <br />
               It contained clause 16. It contained a clause 
               <br />
               which did effectually fasten upon the new 
               <br />
               provinces, in my opinion, separate schools.

               The right h-on. leader of the government (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) introduced it in a very elo- 
               <br />
               quent speech. He justiﬁed it upon grounds 
               <br />
               that I cannot agree with. He maintained 
               <br />
               that the constitution required him to do it, 
               <br />
               but nevertheless he justiﬁed it on grounds 
               <br />
               of policy; he said he was in favour of 
               <br />
               separate schools, that the minority were en- 
               <br />
               titled to them, and it was in the best in-
