               this House. that if clause 93 was embalmed 
               <br />
               in the constitution of this country it was at 
               <br />
               the request of the Protestant minority of 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec. Now, Sir, I may 
               <br />
               say at once that it was not necessary to 
               <br />
               embalm that principle of religious equality 
               <br />

               Protestant minority of the province of Que- 
               <br />

               93 in the British North America Act. Here 
               <br />
               is the statement made by Sir John Rose :

               Now, we the English Protestant minority of

               were in a minority and entirely in the hands 
               <br />
               of the French population. We cannot forget 
               <br />
               that in no way was there any attempt to pre-

               the distribution of state funds for educational

               Rose at the time of confederation. There—

               fore, I say that in the light of this testimony 
               <br />
               it was not even necessary for the minority

               Nevertheless, Sir A. T. GaJt, in fulﬁlment of

               the pledge given <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[to</span> the Protestant minority

               that clause inserted in our constitution.

               Now, the ﬁrst question which presents itself 
               <br />
               is that which has been treated this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after.</span> 
               <br />
               noon by my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr.

               Bourassa), namely, does this clause 93 apply 
               <br />
               to Quebec and Ontario only, or does it apply 
               <br />
               to all the provinces ? My hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Labelle has cited the opinion of Lord Car-

               giving the quotation again, but I will only 
               <br />
               quote a few words. Lord Carnarvon, in
