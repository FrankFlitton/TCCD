               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> seems to .be overlooked. The object of the 
               <br />
               legislation of 1875 was not to deal with 
               <br />
               the minority of any particular district. but 
               <br />
               was to deal with the rights of the minority 
               <br />
               in the whole territory. and therefore they 
               <br />
               had to provide for the same rights for every 
               <br />
               portion of the country, no matter whether 
               <br />
               a particular district contained a majority 
               <br />
               or a minority of one class or of the other. 
               <br />
               The conclusion to which the reasoning of 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition would lead us 
               <br />
               is this, that the legislature of 1875 intend- 
               <br />
               ed to give some protection to either the 
               <br />
               Protestants or the Roman Catholics when 
               <br />
               they constitute a minority in any particular

               <br />

               lieve under whose guidance this clause

               was drafted. you ﬁnd that the object of
