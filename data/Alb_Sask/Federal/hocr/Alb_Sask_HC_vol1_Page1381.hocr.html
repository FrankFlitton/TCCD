               because there was more than a mere rumour

               around the corridors of this House that the 
               <br />

               those rumours did not cease until after the 
               <br />
               First Minister had brought down the pro-

               it is intended to call upon us to vote when 
               <br />
               we come to clause 16. But we are practi- 
               <br />
               cally at clause 16, because clause 2 of the 
               <br />
               Bill stands over for the express purpose of 
               <br />

               fore is it possible that the Minister of Jus-

               <br />
               First Minister has promised that that shall 
               <br />

               <br />
               and into the Bill ? Is that the proposition 
               <br />
               of the First Minister or the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance? It is a singular thing that we 
               <br />
               have a statement of the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               that he is giving his attention to clause 16 
               <br />
               as originally introduced, while the Finance 
               <br />
               Minister, the First Minister and the member 
               <br />
               for Brandon (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iSifton)</span> have been giving 
               <br />
               their attention wholly to clause 16 as pro- 
               <br />
               posed to be amended by the First Minister. 
               <br />
               Now, so far as the law points are concern- 
               <br />
               ed, it is not necessary for us to discuss them 
               <br />
               here, because we can do that when the dis- 
               <br />
               cussion on clauses 2 and 16 is proceeded 
               <br />
               with. I am not going into that point fur— 
               <br />
               ther than to say that the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice has already stated on the ﬂoor of this 
               <br />
               House that that Bill, by his reading <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span> it 
               <br />
               section 93 of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               would carry the section of the Act of 1875 
               <br />
               relating to separate schools; and there- 
               <br />
               fore it was not 'absolutely necessary to give 
               <br />
               a dual system of education to the west to 
               <br />
               enact these proposed amendments of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister. The hon. member for Bran- 
               <br />
               don said that the Act of 1875 gave a dual 
               <br />
               system. Does the Minister of Justice deny 
               <br />
               that, or the Minister of Finance, or the 
               <br />
               First Minister—does any of them deny it? 
               <br />
               The Minister of Justice is on record to the 
               <br />
               extent of saying that it was not necessary, 
               <br />
               in giving a dual system of schools, or a 
               <br />
               system of separate schools, to nut into the 
               <br />
               Bill these proposed amendments to section 
               <br />
               16, but, for the sake of certainty, for the 
               <br />
               sake of having no difﬁculty, they are put in,

               (Mr. Fielding) votes. I do not understand

               that he was voting on clause 16 as pro- 
               <br />

               something to say. . I think the Minister of

               constitutents, six months hence: We did 
               <br />
               not know it meant this ; we did not know 
               <br />
               the gun was loaded; we thought it was

               an innocent toy, a mere pop-gun, something 
               <br />
               that would not injure anybody. We want

               Mr. SPROULE. I wish to say just a 
               <br />
               word on the right of the House to know 
               <br />
               what the Bill means. According to Bourinot 
               <br />
               the principle of a Bill is usually debated 
               <br />
               on the second reading. The Commons have 
               <br />
               no rule on this subject, but the practice 
               <br />
               of the House is always to discuss the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of a Bill at this stage ; and a member 
               <br />
               on setting forth reasons why the Bill could 
               <br />
               not be discussed satisfactorily, may move an 
               <br />
               amendment. Now, what are the principTes 
               <br />
               of this Bill ? There is the ﬁnancial prin- 
               <br />
               ciple—the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*question</span> of what will it be fair 
               <br />
               to furnish as an income for the support of 
               <br />
               the new provinces. Then there is the land 
               <br />
               principle, on which we decide whether we

               <br />
               ple of that country shall or shall not haVe 
               <br />
               the right to provide for and control their 
               <br />
               system of education. Every one of these 
               <br />
               principles should be considered by the 
               <br />
               House before it passes judgment upon the
