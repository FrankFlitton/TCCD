               have justice done, and why? These gentle- 
               <br />
               men, in 1896, were ambitious. They had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\long</span>

               <br />
               hand were their ambitions, on the other 
               <br />
               Catholic rights; and which went to the 
               <br />

               rights of his people ; and which weighed the 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. A. A. STOCKTON (St. John City <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> 
               <br />
               County). Mr. Speaker, I regret that phy- 
               <br />
               sically I am not in that condition to dis- 
               <br />
               cuss thls question which I would like to 
               <br />
               be in, but I felt, Sir, that I could not give 
               <br />
               a silent vote upon this all-important ques- 
               <br />
               tion. The proposition brought before the 
               <br />
               House by the First Minister is too great, 
               <br />
               too comprehensive, too far-reaching, for me 
               <br />
               to give a silent vote in this House upon it. 
               <br />
               I have no apology to make for the vote 
               <br />
               that I am about to give when I vote for 
               <br />
               the amendment proposed by the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition. I have no apology to make 
               <br />
               for the observations I intend to offer or for 
               <br />
               the reasons that impel me to vote for the 
               <br />
               amendment of the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               except that I hope that I may give utter- 
               <br />
               ance to no sentiment, that no expression 
               <br />
               may drop from my lips, that can wound 
               <br />
               the feelings of the most sensitive. I agree 
               <br />
               with the Minister of Justice and those who 
               <br />
               have preceded me, that this discussion has 
               <br />
