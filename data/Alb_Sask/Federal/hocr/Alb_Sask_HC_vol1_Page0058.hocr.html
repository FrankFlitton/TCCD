               The right hon. gentleman said : ‘ We have

               had the beneﬁt of the presence of Mr. Haul-

               say further : “Ve have had the advantage of

               the advice of several members from the

               <br />
               Now, as has been pointed out this after- 
               <br />
               noon, Mr. Haultain at any rate has put him-

               <br />

               <br />
               that Mr. Haultain and Mr. Bulyea do not 
               <br />
               speak as private individuals; they speak 
               <br />
               as being armed with the authority of the

               <br />
               l=ered that the claims of the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories were set forth in the most distinct 
               <br />
               and deﬁnite terms—were set forth categor- 
               <br />
               ically—~in a draft <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Bill</span> which the premier

               of the Northwest Territories submitted to 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister more than three years 
               <br />
               ago. Those terms were discussed in the

               legislative assembly, and were for all prac— 
               <br />

               <br />
               say that there Was a unanimous approval 
               <br />
               of the various terms of that draft Bill, with 
               <br />
               just one exception : that was as to whether

               Mr. LAKE. I was endeavouring, Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Speaker,</span> to answer a remark which was 
               <br />
               made by the Prime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bgnister</span> himself; but 
               <br />
               I will get at it more directly. The Prime 
               <br />
               Minister made a strong point of the fact 
               <br />
               that Mr. Haultain had objected to two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces being formed. That made a large 
               <br />
               part of his argument, and surely I should be 
               <br />
               allowed to say a few words in reference 
               <br />
               to that. What I wish to point out is this, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mat</span> a very large majority of the members 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the legislative assembly were in favour

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">n</span> ere divided in opinion as to how these two l

               <br />
               Mr. Haultain was only doing his duty when 
               <br />
               he advocated what was the very strong ver- ,

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">referred</span> to the immense province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which.</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such</span> an area would make, I think he forgot 
               <br />
               that the legislative assembly had not asked 
               <br />
               for the immense area which he now proposes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> include in the two new provinces. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They</span>

               I may say further that the terms of this 
               <br />
               draft Bill formed the principal question in 
               <br />
               the general election of the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories which took place shortly after its 
               <br />
               submission to the legislative assembly ; and 
               <br />
               that the principal campaign literature issued 
               <br />
               by the local government of that day was 
               <br />
               the correspondence in connection with the 
               <br />
               draft Bill, and the draft Bill itself, so that 
               <br />
               there can be no question, seeing that Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain’s government was returned to pow- 
               <br />
               r with an overwhelming majority, that he 
               <br />
               was voicing the opinion of the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest in the demands which he has 
               <br />
               made in regard to the terms upon which the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories were to become pro- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vinces.</span> But, as the right hon; the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister says, he had discussed this ques- 
               <br />
               tion and had great advantage in the dis- 
               <br />
               cussion not only with the representatives of 
               <br />
               the Territorial government, but also with 
               <br />
               several western members, we must presume 
               <br />
               that the Bill was introduced with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con—</span> 
               <br />
               cnrrence of these western members. We 
               <br />
               must assume that, or else these remarks of 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister would have no signific- 
               <br />
               ance or meaning. I noticed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also</span> that some 
               <br />
               Northwest members on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House greeted the remarks of the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister on that occasion with the most 
               <br />
               vigorous applause. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Again I say that I consider that the pre- 
               <br />
               sence of the Minister of the Interior in 
               <br />
               this House is most necessary. A proposal 
               <br />
               is made in these draft Bills that the Domin— 
               <br />
               ion government should remain in possession 
               <br />
               of the public lands of the Northwest. l 
               <br />
               venture to assert that it has been found 
               <br />
               impossible in the past to administer the 
               <br />
               lands of that country, with satisfaction, from 
               <br />
               Ottawa and I think that if a close inquiry 
               <br />
               were made into the conditions it would be 
               <br />
               found that there is a great deal of dissatis- 
               <br />
               faction in that country with the proclaimed 
               <br />
               policy of the Minister of the Interior with 
               <br />
               reference to the settlement of these lands. 
               <br />
               and that the administration of these lands 
               <br />
               is not satisfactory to the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west. This House should have the fullest in- 
               <br />
               formation on these points, and I apprehend 
               <br />
               that it would be practically impossible to 
               <br />
