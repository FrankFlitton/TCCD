               that matter, notwithstanding ‘his formal

               <br />
               school question of the Northwest ? I shall 
               <br />
               be asked. Let me draw attention to the 
               <br />
               fact that as recently as 1901 a joint debate 
               <br />
               took place at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Indian</span> Head, in eastern As- 
               <br />
               siniboia, between Mr. Roblin and Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               tain upon this very question of the exten- 
               <br />
               sion of the Manitoba boundary. Mr. Roblin 
               <br />
               put forth the reason why the people of that 
               <br />
               little place should declare themselves to be 
               <br />
               in favour of the extension of the bound- 
               <br />
               aries of Manitoba, at the expense of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, Mr. Haultain, on the 
               <br />
               other hand, arguing against the proposi- 
               <br />
               tion and seeking to convince the people that 
               <br />
               it was to their interest to remain in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories and that the bound- 
               <br />
               aries of Manitoba should not extend west- 
               <br />
               ward. And what, Sir, were the reasons 
               <br />
               given by Mr. Haultain to induce them to 
               <br />
               resist the blandishments of Mr. Roblin 
               <br />
               and to oppose the extension of the Manitoba 
               <br />
               boundary? The joint debate is report- 
               <br />
               ed in the Regina ‘Leader’ of January 20, 
               <br />
               1902, and Mr. Haultain’s argument is 
               <br />
               summed up in these words: ‘Good roads.

               I said a moment ago that I expressed no 
               <br />
               opinion as to the relative merits of public 
               <br />

               for religious teaching in our schools; not 
               <br />

               <br />
               that school, because I think that school is 
               <br />
               the only school consistent with absolute 
               <br />
               freedom of conscience for which I have al- 
               <br />
               ways stood. As for the common school,

               bringing all the children together, so that 
               <br />
               there may be uniformity, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘I</span> have very little 
               <br />
               to say. My view has been that the indi-

               vidual ought to be developed. I do not 
               <br />
               want uniformity any more than I want 
               <br />
               monotony—both stand practically in the 
               <br />
               same light, so far as I am concerned. I 
               <br />
               believe in the development of the individual 
               <br />
               as I believe in the doctrine of self-help. 
               <br />
               Perhaps, later on, I may have occasion to 
               <br />
               say a few words more about that doctrine. 
               <br />
               I argue that what was said and done in 
               <br />
               1875, what was said and done in 1876, and
