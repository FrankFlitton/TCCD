               so far as that. They could have stopped

               the question ot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immigration—we</span> wished to have 
               <br />
               immigrants come to Canada from his country.

               In the course of our conversation he said,: If

               Now, Mr. Speaker, we had in this govern- 
               <br />
               ment a short time ago a strike. When work- 
               <br />
               men strike, they usually strike for some rea- 
               <br />
               son. I hardly know for what reason the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance and the ex-Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior went out on strike. It may 
               <br />
               have been that the Minister of Finance, 
               <br />
               knowing the ﬁnancial resources of Canada, 
               <br />
               thought that grant of. $2,200,000 per annum 
               <br />
               to those provinces for all time to come was 
               <br />
               too great a drain upon the public exchequer. 
               <br />
               There are various reasons why men go out 
               <br />
               on strike. Sometimes it is for shorter hours; 
               <br />
               sometimes it is for larger pay; sometimes 
               <br />
               it is for ofﬁces of greater emolument. When 
               <br />
               there is a strike there is always a delegate 
               <br />
               appointed to reconcile the strikers, and 1 
               <br />
               can imagine the right hon. the premier being 
               <br />
               the delegate that was sent in this instance to 
               <br />
               bring the strikers back to line. And 1 can 
               <br />
               imagine him saying to the Finance Minister; 
               <br />
               Now, my dear Finance Minister, you know 
               <br />
               I am getting a little advanced in years; I 
               <br />
               am a little more inﬁrm than I used to 
               <br />
               be, my health is not so good. and the 
               <br />
               time may come in a very short while when 
               <br />
               I will retire from the premiership, and there 
               <br />
               is only one man in the Liberal party who is 
               <br />
               competent to ﬁll my shoes and to take my 
               <br />
               job when I give it up, and that man is you ; 
               <br />
               now, Mr. Finance Minister, if you will only 
               <br />
               be good and come back into line, stand up 
               <br />
               in the House and swallow your principles, 
               <br />
               it may be that you will be the white-headed 
               <br />
               boy of the future. I do not know what in- 
               <br />
               ducements were offered to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(ex-Minister</span> 
               <br />
               of the Interior (Mr. Slfton). We know that 
               <br />
               he came back into line, but he would not go 
               <br />
               back to work. As they say in these strikes. 
               <br />
               he brought the gang back, but he would not 
               <br />
               take up his work where he had left off. It 
               <br />
               may have been that he could not see as 
               <br />
               much ahead of him as the Minister of Fin— 
               <br />
               ance, or it may be that the ofﬁce of High 
               <br />
               Commissioner was not so great an induce— 
               <br />
               ment, and that the damp air over there may 
               <br />
               not have been so conducive to his health. 
               <br />
               For those reasons, he simply came back into 
               <br />
               line, but he would not go to work. What— 
               <br />
               ever may have been the inducement that the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman held out to them the 
               <br />
               cats came back, and now they are a happy 
               <br />
               family—happy and united. It is only a 
               <br />
               little while ago that there was mutiny on 
               <br />
               board the ship, but now all is peaceful and 
               <br />
               quiet. 
               <br />
