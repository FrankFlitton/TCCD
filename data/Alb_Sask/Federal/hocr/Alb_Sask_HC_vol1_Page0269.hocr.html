               which the new provinces would be brought

               formation which it would not have been 
               <br />
               right and proper for the minister to discuss

               before the people whose interests were 
               <br />

               <br />
               ister’s only reply was : You must trust the

               the question his only reply was. you are a

               mischief-maker. that is what you are. The 
               <br />
               question was also put to the candidates 
               <br />
               who _were running in the Northwest. They 
               <br />
               were challenged. They had one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reply—</span> 
               <br />
               the reply of the drilled and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taught:</span> 
               <br />
               You ask us what the probable conditions 
               <br />
               will be : we trust the government ;'we have 
               <br />
               faith in the government. The cry of the 
               <br />
               minister was: Trust the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government;</span> 
               <br />
               and the declaration of the. candidates 
               <br />
               was: We have faith in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern-</span> 
               <br />
               ment. But from neither minister nor 
               <br />
               candidate was there a single intimation as 
               <br />
               to what would be the probable conditions. 
               <br />
               So much with reference to that. Carrying

               thing occurred. A trouble arose. disruption

               reason that he had not been consulted with

               <br />
               dissented from it on the record of his life. 
               <br />
               and on account of the principles so often

               asked explanations and we soon found out

               that another minister of the government,—

               before it was brought down to this House. 
               <br />
               There were then two facts of importance. 
               <br />
               There was the fact that the government, as 
               <br />
               a united body had not formed that measure 
               <br />
               and there was the additional fact that there 
               <br />
               was displayed a haste almost nndigniﬁed to 
               <br />
               get the Bill before the House and the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> before those two important mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the cabinet should have an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of being present in Council and ex- 
               <br />
               pressing their views. What was still more 
               <br />
               remarkable was this, that on the most 
               <br />
               important clauses of the Bill, two mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the cabinet, who had been the strong- 
               <br />
               est in their opposition to the principles em- 
               <br />
               bodied in that clause, were the very-two 
               <br />
               members in whose temporary absence the 
               <br />
               Bill had been passed by the Council and 
               <br />
               submitted to parliament.

               Other facts came out. It became known
