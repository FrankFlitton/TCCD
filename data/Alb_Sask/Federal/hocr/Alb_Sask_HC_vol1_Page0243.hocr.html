               Mr. Speaker, that the lands would be vest-

               <br />
               done—either issue free grants to the settlers 
               <br />

               <br />
               issuing free grants, the provinces would 
               <br />
               get no revenue. In the second instance, Le. 
               <br />
               selling the lands, true they would derive 
               <br />
               a revenue from the sales, but at the same 
               <br />
               time, they would fatally restrain and check 
               <br />
               the growth of population. On the contrary,

               which the Dominion government draws

               <br />
               worrying the House with ﬁgures, we may
