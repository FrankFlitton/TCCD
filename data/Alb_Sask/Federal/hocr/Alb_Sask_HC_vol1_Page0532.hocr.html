               <br />
               for the Grand Trunk Railway. The Prime 
               <br />
               Minister also took the ground last session, 
               <br />
               that it would be necessary to have steamers 
               <br />
               on the lakes if the railway were to be made 
               <br />
               successful. Does the government now pro- 
               <br />
               pose to engage in the operation of steamers 
               <br />
               upon the lakes—a proposal .which was 
               <br />
               laughed to scorn by the Prime Minister, by 
               <br />
               the Postmaster General, and by very many 
               <br />
               other gentlemen on that side of the House. 
               <br />
               Surely the government is not leaping hap- 
               <br />
               hazard into this matter without considering 
               <br />
               some of the difﬁculties which the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister and his colleagues were so certain 
               <br />
               about last session, when there was a pro- 
               <br />
               posal that the government should acquire 
               <br />
               and operate the Canada Atlantic from Mon— 
               <br />
               treal to Parry Sound. Has the Minister of 
               <br />
               Railways any report from his engineer as 
               <br />
               to whether or not these things are necessary? 
               <br />
               Has the hon. gentleman any report from 
               <br />
               his engineer or from any expert in the de— 
               <br />
               partment, which would indicate whether or 
               <br />
               not the proposed operation of this line will 
               <br />
               be proﬁtable and will tend to reduce the 
               <br />
               deﬁcits which have prevailed in the past on 
               <br />
               the Intel-colonial Railway? Has the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman any information which would 
               <br />
               indicate to the House whether the opera- 
               <br />
               tion of that line will reduce these deﬁcits or 
               <br />
               will on the contrary increase the margin be— 
               <br />
               tween receipts and expenditure ? Surely it 
               <br />
               cannot be possible that the government have 
               <br />
               entered upon a policy of this kind without 
               <br />
               taking these things into consideration. Al- 
               <br />
               though the minister does purpose making an 
               <br />
               explanation later on, I would suppose that 
               <br />
               at the present time it would not be out of 
               <br />

               <br />
               a distance of 170 miles more of railway

               if he does not deign to answer them, then

               I think we had better know it and govern

               Mr. EMMERSON. I want to say in reply 
               <br />
               to my hon. friend that I explained simply 
               <br />
               the general Dolicy of the government, and 
               <br />
               I said that when the Bill was introduced 
               <br />
               I would then be in a position to furnish 
               <br />
               answers to all reasonable questions that 
               <br />
               might be put to me. If it were not nine 
               <br />

               <br />
               had come a little earlier, perhaps he would 
               <br />
               not have attacked me as he has done for 
               <br />
               not answering. I think I pay proper cour- 
               <br />
