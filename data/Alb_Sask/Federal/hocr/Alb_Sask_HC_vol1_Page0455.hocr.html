               what right we have to suppose that the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest will not grant the 
               <br />
               same privileges as we would grant in the 
               <br />
               east. While I am not saying that they 
               <br />
               would not. I will say that if I were a Catho-

               lic living in the Northwest what has happen-

               me that I had not a great deal to expect in 
               <br />
               matters of this kind. I do not want to jar 
               <br />
               upon the feelings of any western man, or 
               <br />
               any other man, but I think that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[to</span> be honest 
               <br />
               we should place the facts just as we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               them. In the seventies, or perhaps in the 
               <br />
               eighties, a school law was passed in Maui- 
               <br />
               toba which, as far as I can learn. was per- 
               <br />
               fectly satisfactory to the Catholics and was 
               <br />
               a carrying out of the compact of 1870. Why 
               <br />
               it was so, I do not know; but the fact is 
               <br />
               that it was later wiped olÏ the statute-books, 
               <br />
               and there is no such thing in the statute- 
               <br />
               book of Manitoba to-day. It has been stated 
               <br />
               in this House today that a resolution has 
               <br />
               been twice passed in the legislature of the 
               <br />
               Northwest asking the government to take 
               <br />
               away the provisions of the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories Act in respect to separate schools. 
               <br />
               These provisions have not been taken away, 
               <br />
               but does anybody venture to tell me that if 
               <br />
               the legislature of the Northwest had the 
               <br />
               power to take these provisions away, it 
               <br />
               would not do so ? They have twice passed 
               <br />
               resolutions wiping; off the slate. They had 
               <br />
               not the power to fully and effectively carry 
               <br />
               that out, but as far as the intention is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, it was clearly there. All doubt 
               <br />
               with respect to the legislature of the Terri— 
               <br />
               tories is removed in that way, and doubt 
               <br />
               with respect to the legislature of Manitoba 
               <br />
               is removed by the fact that three times in 
               <br />
               succession efforts have been made to wipe 
               <br />
               off the statute—book anything which autho- 
               <br />
               rized separate schools ; and I, therefore, 
               <br />
               think the minority are justiﬁed in asking 
               <br />
               us, when granting a new constitution, to see 
               <br />
               that these rights which were reserved to 
               <br />
               them in 1875 will again be reserved to them 
               <br />
               under the constitution of 1905.

               I have spoken longer than I intended, 
               <br />
               but the points I wish to make are these, 
               <br />
               and I shall summarize them in concluding. 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst place, I wish to point out that 
               <br />
               I think that we have ample power under 
               <br />
               the provisions of the British North America 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act,</span> 1867, and the Orders in Council which 
               <br />
               were passed to give us control over the North- 
               <br />
               west and over British Columbia in 1871, to 
               <br />
               grant a constitution to any new provinces 
               <br />
               that we might carve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out</span> of the new coun- 
               <br />
               try. I think, Sir, that we are perfectly 
               <br />
               safe in taking it for granted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that‘</span> when the 
               <br />
               parliament of Great Britain told us that 
               <br />
               we could give a province a constitution, 
               <br />
               that that means a constitution and it means 
               <br />
               nothing less. To give a province a consti- 
               <br />
               tution is to give it all the machinery neces- 
               <br />
               sary to carry its affairs on as a province; 
               <br />
               and when, in the old days, we took in pro- 
               <br />
               vinces by Order in Council, we took them 
               <br />
               in on such conditions as were stipulated 
               <br />

               and agreed upon. and perhaps one hundred 
               <br />
               changes would be made between the com-

               mencement of negotiations and the ﬁnal 
               <br />
               admission of the province. If we were 
               <br />
               bound down to hard and fast rules, we 
               <br />
               could never get a province to enter the con- 
               <br />
               federation, and the early legislators of Can- 
               <br />
               ada were not long in discovering that some 
               <br />
               discretionary power was needed, and Sir 
               <br />
               John A. Macdonald asked the parliament of 
               <br />
               England to give the Dominion parliament 
               <br />
               such power as would enable them to give the 
               <br />
               provinces entering confederation such con- 
               <br />
               stitution as from time to time they might 
               <br />
               find necessary. These constitutional powers 
               <br />
               were granted and exercised, and in the ex- 
               <br />
               ercise of that discretion the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada had full power to mould and shape 
               <br />
               the conditions of Canada and to give to 
               <br />
               these new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(provinces</span> a constitution as much 
               <br />

               I submit, Mr. Speaker, that we have this 
               <br />
               power, and that we are exercising it in the 
               <br />
               right direction in recognizing the circum- 
               <br />
               stances that to-day exist in that country. 
               <br />
               While we should give every privilege to the 
               <br />
               local legislature, we should carry out, in 
               <br />
               dealing with these new provinces, the prin- 
               <br />
               ciples that governed us in forming constitu- 
               <br />
               tions of the other provinces. It was recog— 
               <br />
               nized, as I said before, at confederation; 
               <br />
               it was recognized in 1870, when the people 
               <br />
               who had formed confederation had every 
               <br />
               term and every condition of that contract 
               <br />
               fresh in their minds, when they had just 
               <br />
               returned from the conferences in England, 
               <br />
               when they were fresh from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> conferences 
               <br />
               at Quebec and elsewhere, and when they 
               <br />
               had the whole business moulded and shaped 
               <br />
               in their minds, then the very ﬁrst time they 
               <br />
               had to put it into effect they recognized the 
               <br />
               principle for which I am contending, and 
               <br />
               which is found in the British North America 
               <br />

               <br />
               fore, it is recognized in the Act of 1875, it 
               <br />
               is recognized in that admirable speech of 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bilake,</span> in that speech of Alexander Mac-
