               up a basis of compromise. It will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found.</span> in

               the sessional papers of this House. The

               terms were submitted to the leading men

               <br />
               gaged. We did not desire that any prin- 
               <br />
               ciple should be yielded without full con- 
               <br />
               sultation. Amongst others it was submit-

               ted to the late Dalton <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">McCarthy;</span> and it 
               <br />
               was approved by him. That compromise 
               <br />
               was carried into legislative effect. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“It</span> does 
               <br />
               not go quite so far as the compromise upon 
               <br />
               this question which is before the House at 
               <br />
               the present time; but it was a substan- 
               <br />
               tial compromise on the general principle 
               <br />
               with which we had to deal. Yet at that 
               <br />
               time there were some men who said: No 
               <br />
               compromise; who said: Don’t give in 
               <br />
               till you get the whole thing, you will get it 
               <br />
               if you stand up. I did not agree with that 
               <br />
               view. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«I</span> thought that some compromise 
               <br />
               should be made. My colleagues in the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of Manitoba thought the same 
               <br />
               thing. and a compromise was made. But, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker,——and this is an observation I 
               <br />
               desire to commend to the attention of the 
               <br />
               House—there were very very few people 
               <br />
               who said, no compromise. And why was 
               <br />
               it that so few people then opposed the com- 
               <br />
               promise ? It was because the people of Ca- 
               <br />
               nada had been ﬁghting about this ques- 
               <br />
               tion for ﬁve years, they were sick and tired 
               <br />
               of the contest, and desired that there should 
               <br />
               be a compromise of some kind so that 
               <br />
               they might have peace. More than that, 
               <br />
               the material progress of this country 
               <br />
               had been stopped. My hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Lanai-k (Mr. Haggart) knows perfectly well 
               <br />
               that the Manitoba school question paralys- 
               <br />
               ed governmental activity for a considerable 
               <br />
               length of time. The members of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment practically did nothing else; they 
               <br />
               could do nothing else but attend to the 
               <br />
               agitation and diﬂiculties that arose out of 
               <br />
               this question. When a question of this 
               <br />
               kind has to be met it has to be met in a 
               <br />
               practical way. Complications arise, govern-
