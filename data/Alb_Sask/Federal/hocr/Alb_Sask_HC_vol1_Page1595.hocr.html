               ed, that that schedule 0f distribution as it 
               <br />
               is now was practically ﬁnished before the 
               <br />
               government had before it any information 
               <br />
               as to improvement districts, as to the num- 
               <br />
               ber of school-houses, as to agricultural pro— 
               <br />
               ducts, and these other things about which 
               <br />
               they have been talking. The Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior contends that that is the actual 
               <br />
               basis, that, the other is for conﬁrmation, 
               <br />
               and when the matter came to the point 
               <br />
               of discussion and you had to sustain your 
               <br />
               position you look around for these other 
               <br />
               things. What reliance can the First Min— 
               <br />
               ister place upon the number of post ofﬁces 
               <br />
               in the north as compared with the number 
               <br />
               of post ofﬁces in the south to show why 
               <br />
               there should be a certain number of con- 
               <br />
               stituencies in the one and a certain num- 
               <br />
               ber in the other ? Will the number of post 
               <br />
               oﬂices be any index to population ? There 
               <br />
               is one post oﬂice in Calgary and there is 
               <br />
               one post ofﬁce serving a district in Stony 
               <br />
               Plain; but is that very fact any indication 
               <br />
               that one place has a larger population than 
               <br />
               the other. If you took the revenue of 
               <br />
               these post ofﬁces, if you could know the 
               <br />
               letters received and sent or the number of 
               <br />
               people actually served by each post ofﬁce, 
               <br />
               then you might have an index to the popu- 
               <br />
               lation, but the ministers say they have 
               <br />
               not that information and they did not at- 
               <br />
               tempt to prepare it in answer to questions 
               <br />
               put. I put it -to the Prime Minister as a
