               Mr. BRODEUR. Based upon a compact 
               <br />
               I was discussing then. But I said 1 never 
               <br />
               for one moment pretended that we are 
               <br />
               obliged to adopt this agreement, if it refers 
               <br />
               to the Territories. There is some diver— 
               <br />
               gence of opinion as to that. Some say that 
               <br />
               all the rights conceded in 1870 have 
               <br />
               been incorporated in the Manitoba Act. 
               <br />
               Some others pretend that these rights apply 
               <br />
               not only to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Manitoba</span> but also to all the set—

               tlements in the Northwest. But coming to 
               <br />
               what I said the other day, what I said was 
               <br />
               that there was a moral obligation, that the 
               <br />
               school question was one of the rights de-

               ted with regard to separate schools does not 
               <br />
               go so far as that. I was simply quoting

               that just as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:1</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11101111</span> obligation to a certain

               incorporated later on in the legislation of 
               <br />

               what we wanted to incorporate in the legisla-

               tion of to-day are the rights and privileges 
               <br />
               which the minority are now enjoying in the 
               <br />
               Northwest. I never pretended that we 
               <br />
               should enact legislation entirely upon the

               that we should continue the system now

               <br />
               would be this, that the legislature of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               by resolution on the very ﬁrst day, or the

               Mr. BRODEUR. I will come in a mo- 
               <br />
               ment to that question. So far as the use of 
               <br />
               the French language in the legislature is 
               <br />
               concerned, the leader of the opposition ad- 
               <br />
               mits that if this motion carries the situation 
               <br />
               will be different to-morrow to what it is 
               <br />
               to-day, because to-day the French language 
               <br />
               is not used in the legislative assembly. the 
               <br />
               Votes and Proceedings are published simply 
               <br />
               in English. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tomorrow,</span> or at the next

               Sitting of the legislature, so long as it does

               not exercise the powers which are given to 
               <br />
               it in this resolution, then the proceedings 
               <br />
               would have to be published in English and 
               <br />
               French.

               <br />
               one thing. The legislative assembly of the
