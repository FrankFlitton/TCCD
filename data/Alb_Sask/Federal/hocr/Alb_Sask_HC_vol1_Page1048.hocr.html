               Now, I noticed in the amendment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which,</span> 
               <br />
               was moved by the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               that he has seen ﬁt to stop short of the 
               <br />
               subsections of section 93. He has framed 
               <br />
               his amendment in such a way that by no 
               <br />
               possibility could a minority claim any rights 
               <br />
               whatever. He has transposed the whole 
               <br />
               meaning of section 93, which says : 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               from the amendment as drawn and as pre—

               the leader of the opposition upon the merits 
               <br />
               of this question? May we assume from the 
               <br />
               manner and the language he has employed 
               <br />
               in drawing up his amendment that he is dis- 
               <br />
               tinctly opposed to any claims of minorities 
               <br />
               in this matter? Were his amendment to 
               <br />
               carry, and were section 93 to stop as it stops 
               <br />
               ii: the amendment which he has placed be- 
               <br />
               fore the House, there never could be a claim 
               <br />
               by a minority for separate schools in any 
               <br />
               way, shape or form, in the new provinces. 
               <br />
               Is that what the hon. member means ? and 
               <br />
               is that a fair indication of his real feelings 
               <br />
               upon the merits of this question, apart from 
               <br />
               the highly technical argument which he 
               <br />
               placed before the House, and in regard to 
               <br />
               which he said he stood upon the rock of 
               <br />

               Now. Mr. Speaker, I do not desire to 
               <br />
               detain the House any longer. I have tried 
               <br />
               to place before you as clearly as I could 
               <br />
               the reasons which impel me, which force 
               <br />
               me, to the conclusion that this parliament 
               <br />
               has the power, the constitutional right, to 
               <br />
               pass this law ; and if it has, and if it does 
               <br />
               pass it, then I submit that no other tri- 
               <br />
               bunal or no other legislative body has that 
               <br />
               power. We have, I submit, the constitu— 
               <br />
               tional right, and we should exercise it. It 
               <br />
               is said that it will create turmoil, confusion, 
               <br />
               prejudice and bad feeling. The educational 
               <br />
               question in Canada has done so from about 
               <br />
               the year 1840 or 1850, in the old provinces, 
               <br />
               and will do so probably for all eternity, 
               <br />
               unless it is settled by some legislation 
               <br />
               emanating from an authorized source. We 
               <br />
               have the right, and I submit that we should 
               <br />
               exercise it. Why leave this question to 
               <br />
               cmbitter the people in those new provinces 
               <br />
               when this is the proper tribunal to settle the 
               <br />
               matter? I agree that if we have the pow-

               ada. I think that from the year 1888 they 
               <br />
               had direct representation in this House, 
               <br />
               and also in the Senate. They amended 
               <br />
               their school law by ordinances passed in 
               <br />
               1890 and 1891, and this government has 
               <br />
               assented to them. For thirty years the 
               <br />
               people have had a guarantee, with the con- 
               <br />
               sent at this House, that the system of 
               <br />
               schools in operation there would be per- 
               <br />
               petuated. Shall we place these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces on a lower plane than we would 
               <br />
               place the colony_ of Newfoundland ? ‘Shall 
               <br />
               we say to these new provinces: If you 
               <br />
               come in you must come in without the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of subsections 1, 8 and 4 of sec- 
               <br />
               tion 93 of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               while Newfoundland would come in sub- 
               <br />
               ject to those subsections? I submit that, 
               <br />
               from the point of justice, of equity, of fair 
               <br />
               dealing with the minority in this country, 
               <br />
               as a pure matter of expediency, if on no 
               <br />
               higher ground, for the purpose of taking 
               <br />
               this matter out of provincial politics-as a 
               <br />
               pure matter of expediency, as well as a 
               <br />
               matter of justice, the educational clauses 
               <br />
               of the Bill as now framed should be passed.
