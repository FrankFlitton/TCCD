               What is the lesson that stands out most

               clearly in this controversy? Is it not the

               bound to re-act against those who resort to 
               <br />
               them ? Is it not the lesson that in this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> government is possible only by 
               <br />
               tolerance, by conciliation, by fair and hon-

               ourable compromise ? To this policy the

               right hon. gent an (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />

               <br />
               has steadfastly adhered ; and of this policy

               he is the most distinguished and successful

               <br />

               ada in dealing with her own colonies. I am 
               <br />
               afraid, Mr. Speaker, the exhibition which 
               <br />
               we have seen to-night takes away a good 
               <br />
               deal of the hope which I might have cherish— 
               <br />
               ed. I hope we may calm down a little as 
               <br />
               this discussion proceeds. What we are do- 
               <br />
               ing is being watched outside of Canada, 
               <br />
               and will have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an:</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inﬂuence</span> far beyond our 
               <br />
               boundaries. I desire to acknowledge in a 
               <br />
               few words the welcome which the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) extend- 
               <br />
               ed to the new provinces on joining the Can- 
               <br />
               adian family circle. But I would remind 
               <br />
               him that the Territories are full-grown, and 
               <br />
               as such they feel themselves entitled to the 
               <br />
               full rights of manhood. If they are denied 
               <br />
               these rights, the relations within the family 
               <br />
               circle will be exceedingly unsatisfactory.

               I am afraid I must spend some little

               time in going back into the history of this

               question. The matter which we have now 
               <br />
               before us was ﬁrst brought prominently to 
               <br />
               the front on May 2nd, 1900. The ﬁrst step 
               <br />
               in the movement was taken in the legisla-

               tive assembly of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               on that day, when a memorial was addressed 
               <br />
               to the Governor General in Council asking 
               <br />
               that this matter be dealt with. In Novem-
