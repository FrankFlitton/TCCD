               <br />

               <br />

               be much more likely to stop it than we

               friend does not apprehend the argument; 
               <br />
               it is this, that if a government, whether 
               <br />
               it be a local or a federal government, gets 
               <br />
               in trouble ﬁnancially, the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment has more resources to fall back 
               <br />
               upon than a local government; the local 
               <br />
               government has no resources other than it 
               <br />
               own lands, and therefore they are more 
               <br />
               liable to sacriﬁce these lands to meet an 
               <br />
               immediate contingency than the Dominion 
               <br />
               government will be. Let us look at the 
               <br />
               experience of the past. There is no deny- 
               <br />
               ing that most of the provincial governments 
               <br />
               are not at the present time ina very ﬁourish— 
               <br />
               ing condition ﬁnancially ; most of them are 
               <br />
               more or less embarrassed, and moreover I 
               <br />
               do not think, judging from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">past;</span> that 
               <br />
               my hon. friend. has a bright example as to 
               <br />
               the administration of public lands by the 
               <br />
               several provinces. Take the neighbouring 
               <br />
               province of British Columbia. They gave 
               <br />
               away their domain, they gave away the 
               <br />
               richest mineral lands they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had,‘the</span> coal 
               <br />
               lands for a mere song, and when in 1897 
               <br />
               the Canadian Pacific Railway came here 
               <br />
               for a subsidy to assist them to build the 
               <br />
               Crow’s Ness Pass line they already had 
               <br />
               an enormous subsidy in lands from the 
               <br />
               British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Columbia</span> legislature, an enormous 
               <br />
               subsidy, so large indeed that before we 
               <br />
               gave any assistance to the company to 
               <br />
               build that line, we compelled it to surren- 
               <br />
               der to us 50,000 acres of their best coal 
               <br />
               lands which we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:keep</span> as a reserve, so that 
               <br />
               the people will have under all circumstan-

               ces the beneﬁt of the coal that is there. 
               <br />
               We were not satisﬁed with the reservation 
               <br />
               of 50,000 acres of coal lands, but, if I re— 
               <br />
               member aright, we also compelled the com-

               pany to sell their coal at a stated price. 
               <br />
               Which we were sure would prevent any

               Ways foretell. I still base my faith 
               <br />
               upon this that if those lands are ot 
               <br />
               more importance to the province than they 
               <br />
               are to the Dominion as a whole, and if

               th r people are equally honest and cap- 
               <br />

               <br />
               care of the public domain than we could 
               <br />
               possibly do. We surely should not attri—

               <br />
               iieve that they will sell their birthright for 
               <br />
               a mess of pottage, simply because of a 
               <br />
               temporary stringency. That is all the pre- 
               <br />
               mier’s argument amounts to. Some pro—

               vinces may not have administered their

               public domain wisely; I am not contend- 
               <br />
               ing that they always have done so, but 
               <br />
               has it not been the argument of my right

               I heard the changes rung upon that as one

               the past, and yet my right hon. friend and 
               <br />
               his colleagues were willing in 1875 to give 
               <br />
               twice as much land to have the Canadian

               <br />
               given by Sir John Macdonald, so that both
