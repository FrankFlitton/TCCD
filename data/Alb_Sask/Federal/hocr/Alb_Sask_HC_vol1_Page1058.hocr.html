               to Roman Catholic minorities than the

               present Bill. To say to me that the Bill 
               <br />
               gives little to Roman Catholic minorities is 
               <br />
               not in itself a recommendation. I am not

               <br />
               minority in this case, but I am urging on the 
               <br />
               government the desirability of ascertaining 
               <br />
               exactly what the constitution does give. If 
               <br />
               the constitution itself, according to the 
               <br />
               decision of the courts should give more to 
               <br />
               the minority than the present Bill gives 
               <br />
               why should we seek to deny that to them ? 
               <br />
               If it should be found that, owing to the

               nothing was given to the minority, then 
               <br />
               would be the time for us, or whatever body

               moments. And what do the seekers get '! 
               <br />
               Very often they simply get what they go to 
               <br />
               seek for, and they only bring away, I am

               <br />
               constitution, the natural question he asks 
               <br />
               himself is what should be his attitude and 
               <br />
               what is his duty under such circumstances '! 
               <br />
               When he is brought face to face with legal 
               <br />
               and constitutional questions in this House, 
               <br />
               and when these questions have, as he be- 
               <br />
               lieves, to be decided upon before he can 
               <br />
               proceed to decide on other or further steps, 
               <br />
               it is very natural that he should hesitate, 
               <br />
               that he should approach these questions with 
               <br />
               ditﬁdence. He realizes that he is untrained 
               <br />
               in that class of work; he realizes that he 
               <br />
               does not know the law, that he does not 
               <br />
               know where the law is, that he does not 
               <br />
               know whether he has the whole of the law 
               <br />
               or not when he reaches it. He knows that 
               <br />
               in all lines of work practice makes perfect, 
               <br />
               and he lacks practice. But he knows also 
               <br />
               that he has to make a decision of some 
               <br />
               kind; he has either to make a decision of 
               <br />
               his own, or he has to entrust that decision to 
               <br />
               some one else; and if there is one fault more 
               <br />
               than another that has in this country been 
               <br />
               found with politicians, I think it is that in- 
               <br />
               stead of trying to decide for themselves, they 
               <br />
               have always allowed their party leaders to 
               <br />
               do the thinking for them. It may be that, 
               <br />
               with the greater wisdom and ability of that 
               <br />
               party leader, that is a wise course, but it 
               <br />
               is one that is open to reproach. However, 
               <br />
               while all that is true with regard to the lay- 
               <br />
               men, it is also true that there are certain 
               <br />
               advantages that come to him in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider-</span> 
               <br />
               ation of such a question. It is usually con- 
               <br />
               ceded by the legal men that the ordinary 
               <br />
               layman has sufﬁcient intelligence to grasp a 
               <br />
               legal point if it is properly explained to him ', 
               <br />
               and in this case we have not only the ex- 
               <br />
               planation, but we have a full and able de— 
               <br />
               bate from the legal men in this House. We 
               <br />
               have their views on every point argued out 
               <br />
               very carefully. We have not only the law 
               <br />
               supplied to us, but we have all the law. We 
               <br />
               do not need to ask, is there any more that 
               <br />
               is not quoted to us ? We ﬁnd that these 
               <br />
               Acts are in the language which we speak. 
               <br />
               When we examine them, we ﬁnd that they 
               <br />
               are not highly technical in their wording, 
               <br />
               and as we read we realize that there has 
               <br />
               been an intention to make them clear. In 
               <br />
               addition, there is the fact that we are forced
