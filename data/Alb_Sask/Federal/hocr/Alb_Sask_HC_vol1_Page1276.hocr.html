               Mr. TURRIFF. I may say that in the 
               <br />
               last couple of years no doubt a larger pro- 
               <br />
               portion of population has gone into the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Saskatchewan than into the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Alberta. That is to be accounted 
               <br />
               for by the fact that there is a large area of 
               <br />
               open prairie in the northern part of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Saskatchewan through which rail- 
               <br />
               ways are now being constructed—two 
               <br />
               branches of the Canadian Northern and the 
               <br />
               North Western Manitoba branch of the Gan- 
               <br />
               ada Paciﬁc Railway ; and in addition a large 
               <br />
               number of settlers have taken up land 
               <br />
               where it is supposed the Grand Trunk Rail- 
               <br />
               way will cross, somewhere to the south of 
               <br />
               these other lines. There is no doubt that as 
               <br />
               soon as these railways cross the dividing 
               <br />
               line between the two provinces, the increased 
               <br />
               settlement will be in the direction of Al- 
               <br />
               berta ; and- there is this further to be borne 
               <br />
               in mind, that one great portion of the new 
               <br />
               province of Alberta is not yet available at 
               <br />
               .all for settlement, that is the great stretch 
               <br />
               of country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">running</span> some 400 miles northwest 
               <br />
               of Edmonton towards the Peace river coun- 
               <br />
               try. During the last three or four years there 
               <br />
               have been hundreds of inquiries of the De— 
               <br />
               partment of the Interior for information 
               <br />
               about that country and I know that until a 
               <br />
               year or so ago at all events the department 
               <br />
               discouraged people from going so far away 
               <br />
               from settlement and survey. But as soon as 
               <br />
               that country is opened up by survey and the 
               <br />
               construction of the Grand <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Trunk</span> Paciﬁc, 
               <br />
               there is no doubt that the bulk of the immi- 
               <br />
               gration for some years will go to Alberta, 
               <br />
               and will quite even up the excess now going
