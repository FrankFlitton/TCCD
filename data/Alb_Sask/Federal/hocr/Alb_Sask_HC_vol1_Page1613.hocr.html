               own mind on this matter, I have taken this 
               <br />
               line of township 38 not because I know the

               somewhat, I may say that, after look-

               tage of difference is so small as to be of no

               importance. In my calculations, I have 
               <br />
               adopted the ﬁgures of the government. 
               <br />
               It makes no difference in the number of 
               <br />
               members north and south which ﬁgures are 
               <br />
               used. Yesterday, the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior stated there would be 11,406 votes cast 
               <br />
               in the twelve.proposed southern constit- 
               <br />
               uencies—I think that they should be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11.410.</span> and that ‘Hansard’ is mistaken 
               <br />
               ——and 9,553 in the eleven northern 
               <br />
               constituencies. The. trouble with the ﬁg- 
               <br />
               ures. and the reason why there seems 
               <br />
               to be a difference in the argument on either 
               <br />
               side. is that the two proposed constituencies 
               <br />
               in Athabaska are left out of the calculation. 
               <br />
               The minister says there are 12 constituencies 
               <br />
               in the south with 11.410 votes and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11in</span> the 
               <br />
               north with 9,553 votes. As a matter of fact, 
               <br />
               there are 13 in the north with 9,553 votes 
               <br />
               cast in the last election. There are a few 
               <br />
               other people in Athabaska, but they are so 
               <br />
               few—as I shall show before I get through— 
               <br />
               as .to make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically</span> no difference. That 
               <br />
               makes a total of 20.963. out of which the 
               <br />
               north has only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">45</span> per cent.

               <br />
               the number south 57 per cent, and my idea 
               <br />
               is that the number of seats north should be 
               <br />

               there was north of Red Deer eleven consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">9,533</span> votes cast at the last 
               <br />
               election. and that south of Red Deer there 
               <br />
               were eleven with 10,566 votes cast. The 
               <br />
               ﬁgures are quite accurate as far as I an) 
               <br />
               informed. But he said, surely that is near 
               <br />
               enough for anybody, and the south ought 
               <br />
               to be satisﬁed with eleven seats. But, ac- 
               <br />
               to these ﬁgures, there are 1,033 
               <br />
               more votes in the south than north, and,

               the voters' lists, as given this afternoon, the

               found that the votes cast were more in

               A reason has been given why there

               was not a larger vote cast in the south last

               <br />
               give any reason. I do not think any judge
