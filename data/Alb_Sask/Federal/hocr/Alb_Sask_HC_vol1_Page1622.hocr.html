               The preparation of our voters’ lists is en- 
               <br />
               tirely differen‘t from the system in the other 
               <br />
               provinces. We are never particular in pre- 
               <br />
               paring our lists because we know that a 
               <br />
               man can vote whether his name was put 
               <br />
               on the list before polling day or not. Some 
               <br />
               carelessness was exhibited no doubt by the 
               <br />
               e-numerators, an'd they omitted se‘veral 
               <br />
               names, but these men came forward on 
               <br />
               polling day and got their votes as they 
               <br />
               were entitled to do. The statement that 
               <br />
               more voted than were on the list before' the

               strange <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement.</span> ‘ Equally outrageous is the

               is able to exert some mysterious inﬂuence over 
               <br />
               the electors of adjoning constituencies. The 
               <br />
               constituencies will resent this reflection on their 
               <br />
               independence. And the adjoining constituencies 
               <br />
               are as completely separated from this city’s in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence as if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatchewan</span> river marked the

               the Calgary press hope to affect a change in

               question, I would like to make a remark 
               <br />
               with reference to the question of more votes 
               <br />
               being polled than there were voters on the 
               <br />
               list. It struck me as a peculiar circum- 
               <br />
               stance that that should have happened in cer— 
               <br />
               tain cases, and I came across an example 
               <br />
               of it in a return which was brought down to

               <br />
               lists in the Northwest. It appeared that 
               <br />
               in one of the districts, the electoral district 
               <br />
               of Mackenzie, there were two lists for poll- 
               <br />
               ing division No. 20. One of them is not 
               <br />
               signed at all. The other is signed by a man 
               <br />
               named Bisli J. Bildel. The former is evi- 
               <br />
               dently the correct list. and it contaians 
               <br />
               sixty-one names. I was startled by this 
               <br />
               fact and began to look through the list. 
               <br />
