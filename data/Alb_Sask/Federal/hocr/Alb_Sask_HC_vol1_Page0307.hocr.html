               <br />
               six and seven provinces, thus explaining that 
               <br />
               the British North America Act was quite an

               <br />
               there is a difference between the British

               throttle the construction by an Act of its

               own. With all his legal knowledge, he can- 
               <br />
               not understand the common sense difference 
               <br />

               <br />

               ance (Mr. Fielding) wanted common sense 
               <br />
               in this matter. I do not wonder that the

               Postmaster General has assumed so much 
               <br />
               with regard to the law. I do not wonder

               this question, desired to look at it in a

               common sense way. I am glad that I am 
               <br />
               a man of common sense, and not down in 
               <br />
               the cellar of the law, where I cannot see the 
               <br />
               daylight. I am willing to leave the matter 
               <br />
               to the common sense of the common people

               of this country. The ordinary man whom 
               <br />
               you meet on the streets, or on the farm, and 
               <br />

               constitution of Canada is, but knows it as 
               <br />
               well as we do; he will say: Do not talk

               to me only of law or of What the judges 
               <br />
               have said; the constitution of Canada was 
               <br />
               made in Britain, and the courts have decided 
               <br />
               that it means something. If the Prime

               <br />

               undertook to say the petitions had been 
               <br />
               sent in here from Orange lodges. Now, let

               the Orangemen and the Roman Catholics.
