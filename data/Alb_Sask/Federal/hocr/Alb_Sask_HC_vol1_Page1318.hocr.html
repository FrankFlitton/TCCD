               <br />
               attachable to different departments. There 
               <br />

               <br />
               trols the estimates. Several times this ses-

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SLPROULE.</span> Several times items were 
               <br />
               put in as revotes which were not revotes. 
               <br />
               I think this was a case in which the item 
               <br />
               was put in as a revote although there had 
               <br />
               been no vote before. I drew attention to 
               <br />
               the irregularity with which the estimates 
               <br />
               were made up, their incorrectness, and the 
               <br />
               loose business methods that seemed to pre— 
               <br />
               vail in the various departments. There is 
               <br />
               certainly blame attachable to some person 
               <br />
               in the Department of the Interior for the 
               <br />
               attempt to let a contract, involving an ex- 
               <br />
               penditure of over a quarter of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million</span> 
               <br />
               dollars, without inviting public tenders, 
               <br />
               without the money being voted, and in ad- 
               <br />
               vance of any action by parliament. That is 
               <br />
               entirely improper, irregular, loose and un- 
               <br />
               businesslike. Yet there is no denying the 
               <br />
               fact that it took place, and had the Minis— 
               <br />
               ter of Justice not stopped the deal, it un— 
               <br />
               doubtedly would have gone on. We are in 
               <br />
               the habit of abusing the Minister of Justice. 
               <br />
               and I want to give him credit for this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ac</span> 
               <br />
               tion. I do not know whether it was done 
               <br />
               out of his overflowing love for the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior or out of his burning desire 
               <br />
               to protect the public treasury. I am bound 
               <br />
               to assume that it was the latter, because 
               <br />
               that was a more praiseworthy motive. At 
               <br />
               any rate, he” accomplished it, and the expen- 
               <br />
               diture is not going on to-day owing to the 
               <br />
               astuteness of the Minister of Justice and his 
               <br />
               close attention to business. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But I want to draw attention to another 
               <br />
               fact. Why was the Department of Justice 
               <br />
               invited to send to the Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior a draft of contract, if the tender 
               <br />
               was not accepted, if the transaction was 
               <br />
               not practically concluded and the contract 
               <br />
               practically let ? That the transaction was 
               <br />
               practically concluded is the only conclusion 
               <br />
               we can come to, because otherwise the De- 
               <br />
               partment of Justice would not have been 
               <br />
               invited to draft a binding agreement. A 
               <br />
               most reprehensible looseness is shown in 
               <br />
               every step in connection with this matter 
               <br />
               1113 to the moment the Minister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ot</span> Justice in- 
               <br />
               terfered and put (a stop to the further pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings. Whatever his motive may have 
               <br />
               been, he was certainly right in doing this. 
               <br />
               But I want to draw particular attention to 
               <br />
               another feature. I listened to the condi-

               <br />
               Gregor Gompany, and I ﬁnd that although 
               <br />
               the speciﬁcations are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬂiciently</span> plain with- 
               <br />
               regard to the number of strands and the 
               <br />
               distances apart at which the posts should be 
               <br />
               placed—one post at every twenty feet—— 
               <br />
               there is nothing to show of what material 
               <br />
               the posts were to be made. I presume they 
               <br />
               were to be made of wood, but what kind of 
               <br />
               wood ? The kind of wood is very important. 
               <br />
               The most common wood in that country is 
               <br />
               the poplar. That is very plentiful, and 
               <br />
               would come up to the size required ; but it 
               <br />
               is well known that in the ground it rots 
               <br />
               very quickly in a very few years, and that 
               <br />
               it rots quickly either in the ground or out 
               <br />
               of it. .If these posts were tu be made of 
               <br />
               cedar, they would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘much</span> more durable; 
               <br />
               but there is not a word in the letter regard— 
               <br />
               ing the class of wood. Therefore, it was 
               <br />
               optional with the contractor to supply any 
               <br />
               kind of posts he chose, and he would natural- 
               <br />
               ly supply poplar, because that is the cheap- 
               <br />
               est he could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get,</span> although it is likewise the 
               <br />
               most useless. This indicates the looseness 
               <br />
               with which these contracts are made, if it 
               <br />
               indicates nothing worse; and there must 
               <br />
               have been an understanding that the con- 
               <br />
               tract would be drawn in this way, leaving 
               <br />
               the contractor to supply whatever kind of 
               <br />
               posts he liked, and-providing a very nice 
               <br />
               opportunity for a rake-off for somebody. 
               <br />
               And I have no doubt that in the end there 
               <br />
               would have been something of the kind. I 
               <br />
               draw attention to these features which have 
               <br />
               come out in this debate. First, there was 
               <br />
               no public invitation for tenders, and conse- 
               <br />
               quently no competition, although there was 
               <br />
               an expenditure of about a quarter million 
               <br />
               dollars of the people’s money involved. The 
               <br />
               Order in Council which is always invoked, 
               <br />
               and which provides that no contract shall 
               <br />
               be let <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> over ﬁve thousand dollars without 
               <br />
               ﬁrst advertising for tenders, was completely 
               <br />
               ignored. Then there is the private letter 
               <br />
               written to a company intimately associated 
               <br />
               with the minister of the Crown, and which 
               <br />
               had done many jobs for him before, and 
               <br />
               that invitation was the only competition in— 
               <br />
               vited for this contract involving an expendi- 
               <br />
               ture of $225,000. Again, this contract was 
               <br />
               entered into and the expenditure incurred 
               <br />
               before the money was voted by parliament. 
               <br />
               The right hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the»</span> First Minister has told 
               <br />
               us that when we are asked to vote the

               money will be time enough for us to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span>
