               cona that in ten cases, I think, in the four 
               <br />
               electoral districts of Alberta, the number of 
               <br />
               votes polled overran the number of votes on 
               <br />
               the list, is sufﬁcient evidence that the votes 
               <br />
               on the list are not an accurate guide to the 
               <br />
               number of the population, and the lists are 
               <br />
               not at all in the same position as the voters’ 
               <br />
               lists in this part of the country where they 
               <br />
               are made up on a different basis. In the 
               <br />
               Northwest the enumerator is appointed im- 
               <br />
               mediately before the election, Whose duty it 
               <br />
               is to place upon the list the names of those 
               <br />
               within the polling division who he believes 
               <br />
               are entitled to vote. He may see these peo- 
               <br />
               ple or he may not ; and in the result of the 
               <br />
               vote it makes no difference whether a man’s 
               <br />
               name is on the list or not, if he is a voter he 
               <br />
               is entitled to go to the poll, and by taking the 
               <br />
               oath, to cast his vote. That being the case. 
               <br />
               it is evident that the same care is not taken 
               <br />
               in making up the voters’ lists that would 
               <br />
               be taken were the voters’ lists the ﬁnal test. 
               <br />
               In this part of Canada, candidates and mem- 
               <br />
               bers go to the expense of hundreds and 
               <br />
               thousands of dollars to get a correct voters' 
               <br />
               list, because that is the ﬁnal test of the right 
               <br />
               to vote. But in the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               the voters’ lists are not the ﬁnal test at all. 
               <br />
               Nobody goes to any expense to prepare a list, 
               <br />
               and the lists are consequently notoriously in- 
               <br />
               accurate so far as they represent the actual 
               <br />
               voting population. When .we proposed to 
               <br />
               provide for a delimitation of the districts it 
               <br />
               was not with an intention of depriving any 
               <br />
               one of his right to vote that we took the basis 
               <br />
               of the votes cast rather than the basis of 
               <br />
               those on the list. but it was because we felt 
               <br />
               that the votes cast would be accepted by 
               <br />
