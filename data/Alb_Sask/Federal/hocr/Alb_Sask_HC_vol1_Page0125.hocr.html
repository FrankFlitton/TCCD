               <br />
               You will have passed from the status of a

               1905, what reason will there be for making 
               <br />
               any change in the legislation on the 1st day 
               <br />
               of July following ? Aside from the constitu- 
               <br />
               tional question, surely we have to admit 
               <br />
               there is the practical question of the needs 
               <br />
               of the people of the Northwest Territories, 
               <br />

               <br />
               30th day of June. A clause of that kind, 
               <br />
               Sir John Thompson said, is as useful to the 
               <br />
               Territories to—day as it was in 1875, and 
               <br />
               surely the same words may be repeated and 
               <br />
               we may say that this clause and the con- 
               <br />
               ditions which the clause has created will 
               <br />
               be just as useful to the people of the North-

               west Territories on the 1st day of July as 
               <br />

               the Remedial Bill of 1896 to override an Act 
               <br />
               of the legislature of Manitoba, passed by 
               <br />
               the voice of the people of that province, and, 
               <br />
               as subsequently was maintained, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entirely</span> 
               <br />
               within the legislative authority of that pro-

               vince. We do not propose to override any Act 
               <br />
               of any legislature. What we propose to—day 
               <br />
               is to conﬁrm and continue for all future time 
               <br />
               a measure which the free voice of the North- 
               <br />
               west legislature has placed upon the statute- 
               <br />
               book of the Territories. So that, on that 
               <br />
               point, there is a wide difference between the 
               <br />
               condition of affairs in respect to Manitoba 
               <br />
               and the condition of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> in respect to 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. Then again it 
               <br />
               was said and with some justice that an 
               <br />
               effort was made to coerce the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, because it was proposed to pass 
               <br />
               an Act against which the government of 
               <br />
               Manitoba entered a solemn protest. There 
               <br />
               is no protest from the government of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories against this measure. 
               <br />
               I make that statement advisedly. The pre- 
               <br />
               mier of the Northwest Territories, an esti- 
               <br />
               mable gentleman who has been taking part 
               <br />
               in this discussion, as properly he should, 
               <br />
               has written a letter to the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               of Canada, but I am informed and believe 
               <br />
               that that letter expresses his individual 
               <br />
               opinion and it is not authorized by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the Northwest Territories. So, in 
               <br />
               the case of Manitoba '1 repeat that the propo- 
               <br />
               sition was to do something against which the 
               <br />
               government of Manitoba protested. in this 
               <br />
               case we are doing something against which 
               <br />
               the government of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               have entered no protest whatever. Then, 
               <br />
               there is a further consideration. I suppose
