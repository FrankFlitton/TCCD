               <br />
               that is section 6 of that Act. I do not

               suppose that we could evade that provision 
               <br />

               wise order. But are we not doing some-

               hon. gentleman will look at the extraordin-

               Mr. LAKE. While four senators for the 
               <br />
               new provinces may be a fair number at 
               <br />
               present, still, I think the general scheme 
               <br />
               of distribution suggested by the Prime Min- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the future of the whole of western Canada, 
               <br />

               lation which will inhabit that area. I would 
               <br />
               like to see provision in the Bill that parlia-

               Mr. FITZPAT‘RICK. Section 26 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act may give that 
               <br />
               power. But it may be that section provides 
               <br />
               for increase in the three divisions existing, 
               <br />
               that, is the maritime provinces, Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec. ‘ On the whole, I think that section 
               <br />
               26 cannot be construed as being applicable. 
               <br />
               But, in that case, the remedy would be by 
               <br />
               application to the imperial authorities.

               Mr. BERGERON. This matter should be

               dealt with with great care. If I under- 
               <br />
               stand well the spirit of the fathers of con- 
               <br />
               federation it was that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Senate</span> was a 
               <br />
               kind of guarantee of minorities, and that 
               <br />
               was why it was given twenty-four members 
               <br />
               for Ontario, twenty-four for Quebec and 
               <br />
               twenty-four for the maritime provinces. If 
               <br />
