               <br />
               province of Quebec, at confederation, the 
               <br />
               Protestant minority was a pretty strong 
               <br />
               minority. We held a much stronger posi- 
               <br />
               tion numerically than we do to-day. It 
               <br />
               was important for us then to be given a cer- 
               <br />
               tain protection, certain safeguards, certain 
               <br />
               guarantees for the continuance of our rights. 
               <br />
               As we are becoming weaker numerically 
               <br />
               in that province, the guarantee and safe-

               guard thus accorded to us becomes more 
               <br />

               <br />
               is weak numerically, and weak perhaps in 
               <br />
               other ways, it is all the more important 
               <br />
               that they should be given a guarantee of 
               <br />
               those rights and privileges which they guard 
               <br />
               So jealously and value so highly. The 
               <br />

               divine right of kings, when the common

               <br />
               round the king and held up his hands. A

               consideration for their cherished principles

               and cherished feelings. Sir, I do not wonder 
               <br />
               at this. We Liberals believe that the major- 
               <br />
               lty should rule; but we believe that the 
               <br />
               majority should rule with full considera-

               tion for the rights, the feelings and the 
               <br />

               essential difference between the principles

               of Tories and the principles of Liberals. 
               <br />
               Their principle entails a caste to rule by

               force over the weaker. Our principle is 
               <br />
               to so rule through the majority that the 
               <br />
