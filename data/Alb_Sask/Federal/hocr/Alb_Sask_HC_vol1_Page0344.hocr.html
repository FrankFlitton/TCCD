               East Grey is the witness now before

               get him to give an answer. I am

               on the other side of the House who are op— 
               <br />
               posed to religious instruction in the schools.

               We have heard them say so one after the

               <br />
               struction in the schools. Well, Sir, I want

               long did it take to shatter our hopes and
