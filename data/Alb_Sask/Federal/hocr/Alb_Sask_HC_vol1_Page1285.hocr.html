               tistically tells us was all settled before it 
               <br />
               ' came down to the House. I am surprised 
               <br />
               at the hon. member putting that forward 
               <br />
               and calling it argument. Then he says the 
               <br />
               second question they decided was whether 
               <br />
               there was to be one province or two. ‘ We ’ 
               <br />
               decided that there were to be two pro— 
               <br />
               vinces. Who decided that? I say that 
               <br />
               question has not been decided yet, and it 
               <br />
               should not be decided until it comes before 
               <br />
               the members of this House, who have an 
               <br />
               equal interest in it with the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Western. Ass-iniboia. Then he tells us 
               <br />
               that the next question ‘we’ decided was 
               <br />
               that the dividing line should be the 4th 
               <br />
               meridian. Again I ask what right had the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman and a few other western 
               <br />
               representatives to decide that ? I think these 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen are arrogating to them- 
               <br />
               selves a great deal too much. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman tells us that he has a right to 
               <br />
               speak for the people of Western Assiniboia 
               <br />
               because he represents them. I am inclined 
               <br />
               to think that when he goes back there he 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that the people will tell him that 
               <br />
               he does not represent their views. He puts 
               <br />
               forth as an argument that the Board of 
               <br />
               Trade of Maple Creek has decided with 
               <br />
               reference to the boundary line. How 
               <br />
               many ranchers, 1 would like to ask him, are 
               <br />
               on the Board of Trade of Maple Creek ? 
               <br />
               I will venture to say that there is not one.

               tell him that I have to accept a great deal.

               I say again that the Board of Trade ot

               Maple Creek is more likely to be composed 
               <br />
               of business men of that locality than of men 
               <br />
               who live 100 or 200 miles away. This new 
               <br />
               province extends hundreds of miles in 
               <br />
               length, and people engaged in this business

               live hundreds of miles away and are pro- 
               <br />
               bably not interested in Maple Creek at all, 
               <br />
               but they are particularly interested in this 
               <br />
               boundary line. I pay very little attention 
               <br />
               to the opinions expressed by those boards 
               <br />
               of trade dealing with a matter which re-

               fers to the country at large, in which pos-

               the lines between these two provinces, all 
               <br />

               that by coming together—not by deciding

               can arrive at a compromise. And if we 
               <br />
               should have to deviate a little from the pro— 
               <br />
               position decided upon by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for West Assiniboia, our conclusion would 
               <br />
               be more to the advantage of the people of 
               <br />
               the west. I was very much impressed with 
               <br />
               the suggestion made by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Hamilton (Mr. Barker); and if this 
               <br />
               matter had not been decided before the 
               <br />
               Bill was introduced it might have been a 
               <br />
               good thing to have made one new province 
               <br />
               out of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Assini- 
               <br />
               boia. I think that would have been an ex- 
               <br />
               cellent proposition, and allow Athabaska 
               <br />
               to be dealt with as a territory for the 
               <br />
               next 25 or 30 years. However, I presume 
               <br />
               matters have gone too far to accomplish 
               <br />
               anything of that kind now, and it remains 
               <br />
               for us to make the best of what I call a bad 
               <br />
               bargain. I do certainly approve of the pro- 
               <br />
               position made by the hon. member for Cal- 
               <br />
               gary. I think it is well to bring the divid- 
               <br />
               ing line eastward 60 or 70 miles, so as to 
               <br />
               include the ranching country, because there 
               <br />
               is considerable unanimity with regard to the 
               <br />
               extent of the territory covered by ranching. 
               <br />
               Then run northward, until you strike the 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan; westward then following the 
               <br />
