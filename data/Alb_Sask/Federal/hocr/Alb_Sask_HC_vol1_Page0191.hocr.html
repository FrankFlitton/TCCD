               this we should endeavour to legislate, not

               When the right hon. gentleman was speak-

               sible to do certain things, for instance, to 
               <br />

               <br />
               objected to that. Now, I object for my

               <br />
               come to grief if we cannot in the ﬁrst in- 
               <br />
               stance, understand our own duties and res- 
               <br />
               ponsibilities here. We are here as represent-

               atives, not primarily of our individual con-

               stituencies; every man sitting in this 
               <br />
               House is the representative of all the people 
               <br />
               of Canada, and I claim to represent the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest just as much as

               the views of seven gentlemen from those

               tion in deciding the future of that great

               country which at no distant day must hold 
               <br />
               the balance of power in this Dominion, I 
               <br />
               can only say on that point emphatically, 
               <br />
               that I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diifer</span> from him. If we could induce 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman, assisted perhaps 
               <br />
               by the ex-Minlster of the Interior—because 
               <br />
               we would be delighted to have his assist- 
               <br />
               ance, though we would want to have it be- 
               <br />
               fore we got very far away, because he might 
               <br />
               change his mind before we met again—if 
               <br />
               we could possibly induce the premier to be 
               <br />
               guided in some way by considerations of the 
               <br />
               triﬂing character of the change suggested 
               <br />
               in the schools as pointed out, though a 
               <br />
               tremendous change as some people think, 
               <br />
               surely something might be done to avoid 
               <br />
               this diiﬁculty. Something has been said 
               <br />
               about the law of 1875 being a law under 
               <br />
               which the people were induced to go into 
               <br />
               the Northwest, and that they have a right 
               <br />
               to believe that it will be maintained. Now 
               <br />
               I would like to ask the ex-Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior how many of his Doukhobors or 
               <br />
               Galicians could he name to-day who went 
               <br />
               to the Northwest because they had read the 
               <br />
               parliamentary debate of 1875, and were sat— 
               <br />
               isﬁed that their school rights would be 
               <br />
               maintained ? If by any possibility any

               Now, before discussing the subject itself, 
               <br />
               let me consider one or two remarks of the 
               <br />
               ex-Minister of the Interior. When the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman was speaking of the causes that 
               <br />
               led him to withdraw from the government, 
               <br />
               he pointed out that the original clause as 
               <br />
               introduced by the government had a certain 
               <br />
               meaning, and that subsequently it was modi- 
               <br />
               ﬁed so that he could accept it. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman pointed out that in the ﬁrst in- 
               <br />
               stance the difference between What he want- 
               <br />
               ed and what he got was so great that he 
               <br />
               was compelled to lay down the seals of 
               <br />
               ofﬁce, to abandon all the patronage and 
               <br />
               emoluments of oiﬁce, and to sink down to the 
               <br />
               level of an ordinary member, and all for 
               <br />
               conscience. But what was it the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man had to salve his conscience for all these 
               <br />
               serious losses ? I think if I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remember</span> 
               <br />
               his language correctly he said there was a 
               <br />
               possibility that if a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">university</span> were en- 
               <br />
               dowed, there might be a discussion as to 
               <br />
               the rights of the respective parties as to a 
               <br />
               share in the money. Then the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man said that under the original clause 
               <br />
               as introduced, all the provisions of the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 were also enacted. Now if the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman will look at the 1875 Act, 
               <br />
               he will ﬁnd there is nothing in that Act 
               <br />
               whatever that provides machinery by which 
               <br />
               these schools shall be carried on. The 1875 
               <br />
               Act says in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁect</span> that Protestant and Ro- 
               <br />
               man Catholics, respectively, whenever in 
               <br />
               a minority, are to be allowed to have sepa- 
               <br />
               rate schools, are to be allowed to appropriate 
               <br />
               their own taxation to the support of their 
               <br />
               schools, and are not to be compelled to sup- 
               <br />
               port any other schools. That is all there 
               <br />
               was in the Act of 1875. There was not a 
               <br />
               word in it about giving the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               hierarchy charge of the schools, there was 
               <br />
               not a word in it about this, that or the other 
               <br />
               regulation, or ordinance, but the local au- 
               <br />
               thorities were to be allowed to do as they 
               <br />
               saw ﬁt, except that they must not inter- 
               <br />
               fere with the rights of minorities to have 
               <br />
               their own separate schools, be they Protes- 
               <br />
               tant or Roman Catholic, and to apply their 
               <br />
               own taxation for their maintenance. Sub- 
               <br />
               sequently the hon. gentleman pointed out 
               <br />
               that certain changes were made by the local 
               <br />
               authorities. Now would the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               pretend to say that anybody whose opin- 
               <br />
               ion was worth considering ever thought 
               <br />
               that the local authorities which had passed 
               <br />
               those ordinances had not the right to repeal 
               <br />
               them ? They passed them, they existed for 
               <br />
               a time, and they repealed them, and that 
               <br />
               is all there was about it. And if the Act 
               <br />
