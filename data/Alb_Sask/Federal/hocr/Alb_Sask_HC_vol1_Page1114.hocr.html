               <br />
               It was clear that in conﬂding the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general-v</span> sub-

               was absolutely necessary it should be accom- 
               <br />
               panied with such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">restrigtions</span> as would prevent 
               <br />
               injustice in any respect from being done to the 
               <br />
               minority. (Hear, hear.) Now, this applied to 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, but it also applied and with 
               <br />
               equal force to Upper Canada and the other pro- 
               <br />
               inces; for in Lower Canada there was a Pro- 
               <br />
               testant minority and in the other provinces a 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the other of right elsewhere. There could

               be no greater injustice to a population than 
               <br />
               to compel them to have their children edu-

               <br />
               resigned his portfolio. Then, what about

               <br />
               not appear from the remarks he is making

               not agree with the Prime Minister ? If the

               would have been kind enough to have re-

               ferred to the Toronto ‘ Globe,’ and explain— 
               <br />
               ed to us why it was not in unity with the 
               <br />
               Liberal party. I mention these facts to 
               <br />
               show that the Liberal party are not at all

               The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               also stated that the Conservative party were 
               <br />
               without a leader or a policy. I have been 
               <br />
               in this House since the year 1891, and have 
               <br />
               sat here with several leaders of the diifer- 
               <br />
               ent parties since that time, and I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.do</span> not 
               <br />
               believe that we have ever had a leader of 
               <br />
               the Conservative party with greater ability 
               <br />
               or more respected throughout this country 
               <br />
               than the present leader of the Conservative 
               <br />
               party. I believe that the Conservative 
               <br />
               party under the leadership of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Carleton would have been in

               <br />
               stuﬁ‘ed the ballot boxes, used bogus ballot 
               <br />
               boxes, used a large amount of money 
               <br />
               which was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subscribed</span> by the Grand Trunk
