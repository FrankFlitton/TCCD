               Now, this is a very deﬁnite statement of 
               <br />
               policy. How is that policy applied in the 
               <br />
               province of Saskatchewan? It is applied 
               <br />
               in the case of Alberta in a way that may be 
               <br />
               quite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfactory</span> to the hon. gentleman him- 
               <br />
               self. But in Saskatchewan we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the government propose to give one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mem-</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ber</span> each to the city of Regina, with 740 
               <br />
               votes polled on November 3rd, and 933 
               <br />
               votes on the list ; Moosejaw, with 786 votes 
               <br />
               polled and 1,000 on the list; and Prince 
               <br />
               Albert, with 542 votes polled and 740 votes 
               <br />
               on the list. Why should these three cities 
               <br />
               be given separate representation, when you 
               <br />
               have such thickly populated rural consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies in the province? Compare any of 
               <br />
               these cities with the district of Souris, 
               <br />
               which polled 2,544 votes and had more than 
               <br />
               3,348 names on the list, the area of this 
               <br />
               constituency being upwards of 3,000 square 
               <br />
               miles. Or compare any of them with South 
               <br />
               Qu’Appelle, with 1,930 votes polled and 2,- 
               <br />
               692 on the list. Or compare it with Salt- 
               <br />
               coats with a population of 11,004 according 
               <br />
               to the last census, with 1,478 votes polled, 
               <br />
               and 2,327 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.names</span> on the list. If these 
               <br />
               three cities are to be given separate repre- 
               <br />
               sentation why was not the town of Medicine 
               <br />
               Hat treated in the same way ‘! The town 
               <br />
               of Medicine Hat has a larger population, a 
               <br />
               larger number of votes on the list and a 
               <br />
               larger number of votes polled than has the 
               <br />
               city of Prince Albert. If Prince Albert 
               <br />
               is to be given one member, why should 
               <br />
               not the town of Medicine Hat also be 
               <br />
               given one member ? But we ﬁnd that it has 
               <br />
               not suited the Minister of the Interior or 
               <br />
               the government to carry out in its entirety 
               <br />
               the principle so deﬁnitely laid down in 
               <br />
               the case of Alberta. It seems to me that 
               <br />
               in every single particular, they have de- 
               <br />
               parted from their principles in distributing 
               <br />
               the seats for the province of Saskatchewan. 
               <br />
               It will be within the memory of the House 
               <br />
               that, a few days back, the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) stated that 
               <br />
               in view of the fact that the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister had stated that it had been his desire 
               <br />
               on one occasion to have the distribution of 
               <br />
               seats submitted to a conference to the North- 
               <br />
               west members 'on both sides of the House, 
               <br />
               he (Mr. R. L. Borden) was perfectly will-

               Mr. LAKE. The government had come

               down apparently because they found their 
               <br />

               lowing on that side of the House. They 
               <br />
               had come down of their own accord. Then

               Mr. LAKE. Of course there would have 
               <br />
               to be a general rearrangement of the north- 
               <br />
               ern seats made after mutual discussion of 
               <br />
               the counties. This, as I say, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">limited</span> the dis- 
               <br />
               cussion just to the limits of the constituen- 
               <br />
               cies in the north and the limits of the con- 
               <br />
               siituencies in the south. I took the position 
               <br />
               at that time, and I took it strongly, that 
               <br />
               cities of such comparatively small popu- 
               <br />
               lation should not be given separate repre- 
               <br />
               sentation, that they should be thrown in 
               <br />
               with the rural constituencies. I took the 
               <br />
               position that a member for a city in the 
               <br />
               legislative assembly of Saskatchewan will 
               <br />
               have very little to do, that, as is well 
               <br />
               known, the members for rural constituencies 
               <br />
               have a very large amount to do in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the representation of their dis- 
               <br />
               tricts; they are constantly applied to in re- 
               <br />
               gard to public works and many other mat- 
               <br />
               ters of local interest. I took the ground 
               <br />
               that the city members would have little to 
               <br />
