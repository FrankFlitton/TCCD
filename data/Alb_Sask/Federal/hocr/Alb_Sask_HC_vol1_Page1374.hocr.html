               drafted them. Since he drafted that

               <br />
               open to doubt at all, circumstances have 
               <br />
               occurred which have caused him to reﬂect. 
               <br />
               He saw at one time exactly the difference 
               <br />

               <br />
               a most emphatic way. And I have no doubt 
               <br />
               that when, two seats behind the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, he thundered out his views as to 
               <br />
               just exactly what was meant by clause 16 
               <br />
               No. 1 and clause 16 No. 2, he upset the mental 
               <br />
               machinery and equilibrium of the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice to a certain extent, so that we 
               <br />
               must allow for the state of ﬂux that follow- 
               <br />
               ed, 'and which has not yet probably run its 
               <br />
               course down to the ﬁnal consistency that it 
               <br />
               will ultimately take. After the Minister of 
               <br />
               Customs got through, the Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance (Mr. Fielding) had something to say—- 
               <br />
               or was it before that ? In his most emphatic 
               <br />
               and cock-sure way, he just simply told this 
               <br />
               House and country that what those sections 
               <br />
               meant was the little end of nothing at the 
               <br />
               last end of the school hours of the day—only 
               <br />
               that and nothing more. That evidently per— 
               <br />
               turbed the Minister of Justice as well. He 
               <br />
               was getting over it slowly, but yesterday 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance actually rose along- 
               <br />
               side of him and said: I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> it yet; I 
               <br />
               stand to my version. That has also con-

               fused .the Minister of Justice ; and then, to

               <br />
               no doubt, he will give us a proper solution

               Canada was bestowing consideration upon 
               <br />
               it. But listening to the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Toronto (Mr. Foster) one would think 
               <br />
               that the whole thing was a joke, a thing 
               <br />
               to be dealt with in the most ﬂippant m nner. 
               <br />
               ‘So far as I am concerned, I want to have 
               <br />
               this legislation disposed of for it seems to 
               <br />
               me to be serious legislation. And I know 
               <br />
               no way to dispose of it so well as by con- 
               <br />
               forming to the rules of the House. The 
               <br />
               rules require that on the second reading, 
               <br />
               the principle of the Bill and the provisions 
               <br />
               contained in the Bill should be explained. 
               <br />
               That is the rule I intend to conform with, 
               <br />
               so far as I can. So far as this section 16 
               <br />
               of the Bill is concerned, it will be necessary 
               <br />
               to speak of it when it is moved and of the 
               <br />
               amendment when it is moved. But, as sec- ‘ 
               <br />
               tion 16 has not been moved and I am not 
               <br />
               moving it, I can see no reason why the 
               <br />
               discussion should proceed upon this matter 
               <br />
