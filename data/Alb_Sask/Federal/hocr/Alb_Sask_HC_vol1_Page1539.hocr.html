               only adds one more to the extraordinary

               <br />
               to place upon this Act of 1875. So far as 
               <br />
               the word ‘ separate’ is concerned, I adhere, 
               <br />
               with all due deference, to the view that it 
               <br />
               means exactly what it says, a separate 
               <br />
               school, it implies nothing more. And when

               established with regard to denominational 
               <br />
               schools, and meant to say that there was 
               <br />
               no other denominational school referred to 
               <br />

               <br />
               testant schools and Catholic schools, and I 
               <br />
               understood the hon. gentleman’s question to 
               <br />
               mean that in case a majority would be com-

               posed partly of Protestants and partly of 
               <br />
               Mormons, they could establish any other 
               <br />
               denominational schools. Naturally the con- 
               <br />
               text to my remarks later on proved that I 
               <br />
               acknowledged the right of any majority to
