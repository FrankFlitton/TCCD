               which has valued education. The peasant

               of Scotland is &amp; philosopher. The artisan

               in the mills at Paisley and elsewhere 
               <br />
               throughout Scotland is a scholar. This is 
               <br />
               mainly due to the splendid educational sys- 
               <br />
               tem that has obtained in Scotland for the

               produced men in all walks of life second

               to none the world over. Now, how do they

               manage this matter of education in Scot-

               land? I ﬁnd that in the year 1903 there 
               <br />
               were £722,000 spent on public schools; for 
               <br />
               Church of Scotland schools, the Presbyter- 
               <br />

               <br />
               £27,000 from the public chest; for United

               Free Church schools, £25,000 from the

               <br />
               of that with my hon. friends opposite, and 
               <br />
               I say that Scotland, in that as in many

               hon. member on the government side of the
