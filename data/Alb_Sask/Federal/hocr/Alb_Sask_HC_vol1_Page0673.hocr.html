               There is another reason why it is best 
               <br />
               for the federal government to administer 
               <br />
               those lands. It may not be considered a 
               <br />
               good reason by some, but I think the ex- 
               <br />
               perience of most of the other provinces will 
               <br />
               give some weight to it. It is this. We 
               <br />
               might at some future time have a careless 
               <br />
               or extravagant government in one or both 
               <br />
               of the new provinces. If such a thing 
               <br />
               did happen our resources would rapidly 
               <br />
               disappear and we might in a very few 
               <br />
               years be compelled to appeal to extensive 
               <br />
               direct taxation.

               There is still another serious obstacle in 
               <br />
               the way of the provinces administering the 
               <br />
               land. Some years ago very extensive 
               <br />
               grants of those lands were made to various 
               <br />
               corporations, railway companies and coloni- 
               <br />
               zation companies. Now it happens that 
               <br />
               when those corporations selected their 
               <br />
               lands they chose the greater portion of it 
               <br />
               in the proposed province of Alberta. So, 
               <br />
               if the provinces received the lands within 
               <br />
               their own borders, they would not receive 
               <br />
               equal shares and an injustice would be 
               <br />
               done to the province of Alberta.

               the other very important question involved

               the education question is a dangerous one

               vented confederation. It caused the down-

               fall of one federal government and our 
               <br />
               friends in the opposition fondly hope that

               it will cause the downfall of another in the

               had no legal training and I frankly admit 
               <br />
               my inability to grapple with a question on 
               <br />
               which the best legal talent in Canada fail 
               <br />
               to agree. I want to say that in 1892 I gave 
               <br />
               this question a good deal of thought. I 
               <br />
               read over the British North America Act 
               <br />
               and the Northwest Territory Act of 1875. 
               <br />
               and I came to the conclusion that whatever 
               <br />
               privileges the minority had when we be— 
               <br />
               came a province these privileges would have 
               <br />
               to be continued. That conclusion may have 
               <br />
               been wrong, but I arrived at it notwith- 
               <br />
               standing the fact that I was then, as I am 
               <br />
               now, strongly opposed to separate schools in 
               <br />
               the usual sense of the term.

               If I understand this Bill in its present 
               <br />
               form, it provides that the minority, either 
               <br />
               Protestant or Roman Catholic, shall con-
