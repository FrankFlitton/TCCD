               advanced by them or any hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               opposite why these lands should not be 
               <br />
               handed over is that there would be a con-

               <br />
               handed over to the provinces. Why this 
               <br />
               delay? Is it because they are in power 
               <br />
               and anxious to maintain their power by 
               <br />
               means of a political machine or is it be— 
               <br />
               cause the hon. member wants to state to

               same measure of self-government that be-

               longs to all the other provinces but one in 
               <br />
               this Dominion ? What were his reasons ? 
               <br />
               Why are these lands detained to-day ? The 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) says that 
               <br />
               there would likely be a conﬂict, but I have 
               <br />
               pointed out before in this House that when 
               <br />
               he was in opposition, when the Conservative 
               <br />
               administration was in power, there was no 
               <br />
               man in Manitoba who advocated more ef— 
               <br />
               fectually or more often. that the lands of 
               <br />
               Manitoba should be handed over to that 
               <br />

               don <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sinon).</span> Thus, I say, that I think

               the people in that country are entitled to 
               <br />
               some further explanation as to why these

               Mr. TURRIFF. The hon. member is mis— 
               <br />
               taken in saying that I advocated handing 
               <br />
               over the lands to the provincial government. 
               <br />
               What I stated 011 every occasion was that in 
               <br />
               the deal that we should make on provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy, we would either be entitled to 
               <br />
               the lands or to a fair compensation for 
               <br />
               them, and the reason I am supporting this 
               <br />
               Bill and this clause—and supporting it 
               <br />
               heartily-is because I consider that we are 
               <br />
               getting a compensation in lieu of lands that 
               <br />
               is better for the province than handing over 
               <br />
               the lands to the province; what we are 
               <br />
               getting is a net revenue paid semi-annually 
               <br />
               in advance, so that We know exactly what 
               <br />
               we get and we get it for all time, and the 
               <br />
               Dominion government will, as has been 
               <br />
               pointed out if they choose. to handle these 
               <br />
               lands from a revenue point of view, be able

               evolved, based on the provinces taking

               iency and of holding ofﬁce. Surely they
