               <br />
               unalterably opposed to this Bill. I have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">letters</span> from Mr. Bruce, who formerly sat 
               <br />

               trade, every one testifying that they do not 
               <br />
               think the Bill practicable and workable. 
               <br />
               These men have spent their lives in the 
               <br />
               business and are thoroughly familiar with 
               <br />
               the requirements of the trade and of agri- 
               <br />
               culture, and I maintain that if the minis- 
               <br />
               ter persists in forcing this Bill through the 
               <br />
               House it will either drive out from the trade 
               <br />
               the men legitimately entitled to stay there or 
               <br />
               it will becomeadead letter on our statute- 
               <br />
               book. Both of these results are undesirable 
               <br />
               and the minister cannot wish for either 
               <br />
               of them to come to pass. I ask then that in 
               <br />
               fairness to all concerned, this Bill should 
               <br />
               be submitted to a committee where per- 
               <br />
               sons, documents, and evidence may be ad- 
               <br />
               duced to show the various features of the 
               <br />
               Bill that are impracticable and unworkable 
               <br />
               or wherein it fails to meet the wishes of 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman who has introducedit. 
               <br />
               If this is done, I think we will secure a 
               <br />
               practicable and workable measure. and I 
               <br />
               again suggest to him that he should read 
               <br />
               carefully the evidence taken by that Brit- 
               <br />
               ish committee of which I have spoken which 
               <br />
               was appointed to deal with this very subject. 
               <br />
               The members of that committee travelled 
               <br />
               from end to end of the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Jsles,</span> took 
               <br />
               the evidence of all parties concerned and of 
               <br />
               every one interested in seeds and after hav-

               was not desirable that government control 
               <br />

               ments which the hon. gentleman putin with 
               <br />
               regard to the labelling of screenings which 
               <br />
               he allows to be held for export. whereas a

               large number of better seeds between

               <br />
               held for export. Therefore a man must 
               <br />
               either not hold these seeds or label good 
               <br />
               seeds as screen-ings. Surely he does not 
               <br />
               want to insist on trying to carry out so

               <br />
               introduced that it bordered very close on 
               <br />
               nonsense and so it does. The minister al- 
               <br />
               lows the lowest grade to be held as screen-

               <br />
               refuses to allow to be held. Surely in view 
               <br />
               of this the minister will not insist on pass-

               <br />
               to have a delay of two or three weeks and 
               <br />
               have a practicable working measure that 
               <br />
               can be carried out than to come to this

               House and insist without due consideration 
               <br />
               on the passing of this measure. I am sure 
               <br />
               that 50 per cent of the members could not 
               <br />
               hear the hon. gentleman yesterday when the 
               <br />
               amendments were introduced. We were 
               <br />
               asked to vote these amendments blindly 
               <br />
               and to take the whole dose down at once. 
               <br />
               It is surely not in the interests of enlight- 
               <br />
               ened legislation, not in accordance with the 
               <br />
               wishes of the members of the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons of Canada, that we should endorse a 
               <br />
               Bill that contains so many imperfections; 
               <br />
               there are as many imperfections in it as

               <br />
               weeds may be in the seeds and I am sure 
               <br />
               there are more than 25 imperfections in 
               <br />
               this Bill that might be easily remedied by 
               <br />
               reference to a committee. I have pleasure

               in moving that this Bill be not now read a

               Mr. FISHER. Before you put the ques— 
               <br />
               tion, I would like to say in reference to 
               <br />
               the remarks of the hon. gentleman, that 
               <br />
               this whole question has been threshed out. 
               <br />
               I think that everything the hon. member 
               <br />
               has said has been said in the House by 
               <br />
               himself perhaps more than once. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman asks that the Bill be referred 
               <br />
               to a special committee, but the Bill has 
               <br />
               been through a general committee, through 
               <br />
               the Committee of the Whole House, and I 
               <br />
               do not think any better committee could 
               <br />
               possibly be struck to consider it any fur- 
               <br />
               ther. The Bill has been before the House 
               <br />
               not in every detail as it is now, but in prin— 
               <br />
               ciple, for the last three sessions. There is 
               <br />
               no question of precipitancy, there is no 
               <br />
               question of hastiness, there is no question 
               <br />
               of lack of consideration. The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man himself and other gentlemen on both 
               <br />
               sides of the House have discussed every 
               <br />
               detail of this Bill over and over again. 
               <br />
               Every detail has been discussed in commit- 
               <br />
               tee and now the Bill is up for its third 
               <br />
               reading. I cannot see any utility in delay- 
               <br />
               ing the passage of the Bill or referring it 
               <br />
               back to any special committee for any par- 
               <br />
               ticular object. I can therefore only ask the 
               <br />
               House to reject the amendment of the hon. 
               <br />
