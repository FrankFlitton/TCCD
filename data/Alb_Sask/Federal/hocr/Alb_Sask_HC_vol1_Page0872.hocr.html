               right hon. gentleman or the people. Upon 
               <br />
               the question of the advisability of having 
               <br />
               a system of separate schools in any portion 
               <br />
               of this Dominion, there is fair room for 
               <br />
               differences of opinion. We can quite under- 
               <br />
               stand why our Roman Catholic friends des- 
               <br />
               ire such a system. It is quite natural that I 
               <br />
               should entertain an entirely different atti- 
               <br />
               tude. That I do, there cannot be very much 
               <br />
               doubt, but I want to point out this. Whe— 
               <br />
               ther separate schools be right or wrong is 
               <br />
               not the question before us. Every man has 
               <br />
               a right to his own religious belief, and I 
               <br />
               would be the last man to interfere with it. 
               <br />
               But to observe the laws of God and make 
               <br />
               laws for good government are two entirely 
               <br />
               distinct things, and I draw that distinction 
               <br />
               in this measure. The late Dr. Ryerson, 
               <br />
               than whom perhaps the country never had 
               <br />
               a greater educationalist, made use of this 
               <br />
               language in pointing out a similar distinc-

               <br />

               fore. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">follow</span> that the government is to compel 
               <br />
               attendance upon the one or the performance of 
               <br />
               the other? If our government were a des—

               I could not express my views upon that 
               <br />
               subject more forcibly than Dr. Ryerson has 
               <br />
               expressed them. And another reason why 
               <br />
               I am opposed to this system of separate 
               <br />
               schools is that the conditions do not at present 
               <br />
               exist in this country that would warrant the 
               <br />
               establishment and maintenance of such 
               <br />
               schools. It is, to my mind, very much better, 
               <br />
               very much more in the interest of the child- 
               <br />
               ren growing up in this country that there 
               <br />
               should be a common system, that there 
               <br />
               should be a mingling of the children that 
               <br />
               will promote the growth of a common in— 
               <br />
               terest and a common sentiment. It is much 
               <br />
               better that that state of affairs should exist 
               <br />
               than that we should have a condition that 
               <br />
               would produce the opposite result. Dr. Ryer- 
               <br />

               <br />

               Now, I venture to think that no such con- 
               <br />
               dition of religious bigotry or party spirit

               for separate schools to protect them from in-

               justice and oppression. These being the 
               <br />
               grounds upon which separate schools were 
               <br />
               originally established, and there being no 
               <br />
               such condition of affairs existing in this 
               <br />
               country, I argue that it is not in the best in- 
               <br />
               terest of the country as a whole that that 
               <br />
               system should be continued or that we 
               <br />
               should enact laws to force such a system 
               <br />
               upon these new provinces. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There is an additional reason. I put it as 
               <br />
               matter of time. When you come to look at 
               <br />
               the time devoted to secular education and 
               <br />
               the time allowed for religious education, 
               <br />
               what do you ﬁnd? You ﬁnd that in the 
               <br />
               School week of ﬁve days there is a total of 
               <br />
               thirty hours, out down by daily recesses 
               <br />
               to say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2711:</span> hours. On the other hand, it you 
               <br />
               allow ten hours a day for sleep, you have 
               <br />
               seventy~one hours still left for religious in- 
               <br />
               struction. If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">27;</span> hours is sufﬁcient for secu- 
               <br />
               lar education, surely 71 hours is sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               for religious instruction. Or carry it a step 
               <br />
               further and make the comparison on the 
               <br />
               basis of a year. We ﬁnd that the school year, 
               <br />
               taking out vacations and holidays, including 
               <br />
               Saturdays and Sundays, is about 1,100 hours. 
               <br />
               This is the time allowed in a year for secu- 
               <br />
               lar education. And upon the same basis as 
               <br />
               before what are you allowed for religious 
               <br />
               instruction? Seven thousand hours—over 
               <br />
               six times as much time as is allowed for 
               <br />
               secular education. Looking at the fact that 
               <br />
               ninety-seven per cent of the children never 
               <br />
               get beyond the common school, and of that 
               <br />
               proportion a large number attend school for 
               <br />
               only a short time, is it not manifestly unfair 
               <br />
               that the time these young people have to pre- 
               <br />
               pare themselves for the battle of life should 
               <br />
               be cut down by even half an hour a day? 
               <br />
               Would it not be better that the time for 
               <br />
               secular education should even be increased 
               <br />
               rather than diminished? That is why I 
               <br />
               should Say it would be an injustice to the 
               <br />
               youth to impose this system upon them. We 
               <br />
               must recognize that there is a duty resting 
               <br />
               upon the parents and pastors as well as upon 
               <br />
               the state. The state has recognized very 
               <br />
               clearly and speciﬁcally parental duty. The 
               <br />
               state, for instance, does not furnish food 
               <br />
               and clothing for the children, but that leaves 
               <br />
               that for the parents to do. So, I think, the 
               <br />
               state should recognize the duty and obliga- 
               <br />
               tion upon the parent to provide for the re— 
               <br />
               ligious education of the child. And if the 
               <br />
               religious education of the child is deﬁcient 
               <br />
               or wanting in any respect the blame rests 
               <br />
               upon the parent and upon the pastor—it 
               <br />
               does not in any way, to my mind, rest upon 
               <br />
               the state. It seems to me that it would be 
               <br />
               a very bad position for this country to oc- 
               <br />
               cupy to make itself the tax—gatherer for the 
               <br />
               church. In all countries where that has 
               <br />
               been the case we know the result. The re- 
               <br />
               sult has been that the people have attained 
               <br />
               no eﬁiciency in matters of education. It is 
               <br />
