               Now, is the present system of schools in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories acceptable to the 
               <br />
               people? I think it is. I feel that I am 
               <br />
               quite safe in stating that the present educa- 
               <br />
               tional system in the Territories if continued 
               <br />
               would be acceptable to at least 90 per cent 
               <br />
               of the people there. I have some knowledge 
               <br />
               of the conditions as they exist. I lived 
               <br />
               many years in the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               and just before I came to take my seat in 
               <br />
               the House,- I made a trip through that coun- 
               <br />
               try, so that I think I am able to speak with 
               <br />
               some little authority on the subject. Pre- 
               <br />
               mier Haultain has told us that if he were 
               <br />
               dictator to—morrow he would continue in the 
               <br />
               new provinces the present system of schools. 
               <br />
               and that being so, is it not fair to assume 
               <br />
               that the present system is satisfactory to 
               <br />
               the people, else why should he or any other 
               <br />
               dictator impose upon the people a system 
               <br />
               to which they object. We have in addition 
               <br />
               the fact that two years ago the government 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories of their own 
               <br />
               accord sat down and framed an autonomy 
               <br />
               Hill, and that Bill contained the principle 
               <br />
               that the present system of schools should 
               <br />
               continue. Remember, that is two years ago, 
               <br />
               when it was impossible to anticipate the 
               <br />
               difference of opinion that now has arisen 
               <br />
               on the subject. It was at a time when the 
               <br />
               government of the Territories sat down with 
               <br />
               a cool head and I hope a patriotic heart to 
               <br />
               draft a constitution for their own people. 
               <br />
               and which I have no doubt they believed 
               <br />
               would be conducive to their continued 
               <br />
               happiness and prosperity. This is very fair 
               <br />
               evidence that the system of schools at pre- 
               <br />
               sent in the Northwest Territories is not only 
               <br />
               satisfactory to the people, but that it is 
               <br />
               just exactly what they want. Again, the 
               <br />
               seven Liberal members in this House repre- 
               <br />
               senting the Northwest Territories have ex- 
               <br />
               pressed themselves as satisﬁed that the 
               <br />
               present school system should be continued 
               <br />
               in the new provinces. and I have not heard 
               <br />
               from the three Conservative members from 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories the expression of 
               <br />
               any unfavourable opinion against that sys- 
               <br />
               tem. Of course, it may be said that mem— 
               <br />
               bers occupying a seat in this House have 
               <br />
               their political prejudices and that their 
               <br />
               opinion and their vote may be biased accor- 
               <br />
               dingly, but it is also true that the people 
               <br />
               who sent these representatives here have 
               <br />
               their own political prejudices and are biased 
               <br />
               when they cast their votes. Is it a fact that 
               <br />
               the seven Liberal members from the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories do reﬂect the opinion of the people 
               <br />
               there ‘2 I think they do I am somewhat

               <br />
               quite sure that 90 per cent of the inhabitants
