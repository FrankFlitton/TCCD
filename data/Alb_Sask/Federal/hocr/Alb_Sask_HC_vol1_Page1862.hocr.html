               the whole truth. I _told the hon. member 
               <br />
               (Mr. Porter) on that occasion that I did not 
               <br />
               know much about the judges or the courts 
               <br />
               of Ontario, but that I looked upon them as 
               <br />
               perhaps higher courts and greater judges 
               <br />
               than ours, and I said to the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               that if he would conduct himself in his 
               <br />
               quotations of law and the handling of a 
               <br />
               case in our Nova Scotia courts as he did 
               <br />
               before that audience, in ten minutes he 
               <br />
               would be kicked out of the court. That is 
               <br />
               what I told him in Oxford, and that is 
               <br />
               what I tell him now. These are the facts, 
               <br />
               and I am not going to follow the discussion 
               <br />
               up any further. I told some of my friends 
               <br />
               up there the character of the opposition 
               <br />
               that was given by this man, and they asked 
               <br />
               me who it was, and the moment they heard 
               <br />
               his name they said: Oh, What else could 
               <br />
               you expect ? Now, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chairman;</span> they 
               <br />
               tried to steal the vote in that constituency, 
               <br />
               they tried to falsify the facts, but the re- 
               <br />
               sult was that in that small place Braemar, 
               <br />
               the Liberal candidate came out with seventy- 
               <br />
               -ﬁve of a majority. I shall be glad to go back 
               <br />
               to that place with the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Porter) and discuss the facts over again. 
               <br />
               He was in his own province, where I was 
               <br />
               an entire stranger ; and if I could kick him 
               <br />
               out of court and capture the meeting, I 
               <br />
               think I was entitled to do it. He under- 
               <br />
               took to prove that section 16 was drafted 
               <br />
               by the Papal ablegate and put in the hands 
               <br />
               of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who moved it with- 
               <br />
               out changing a line or a word. Has the 
               <br />
               hon. member (Mr. Porter) proven that ? 
               <br />
               When he proves that it will be time enough 
               <br />
               for him to interrupt the proceedings of this

               <br />
               referred. That is not the only evidence. 
               <br />
               Let me call my hon. friend’s attention to 
               <br />
               another little piece of evidence which if he 
               <br />
               was so secure in the position he has stated 
               <br />
               to the committee to-night he would have 
               <br />
               taken occasion to repudiate. On June 21, 
               <br />
               when he had failed to keep his promise of 
               <br />
               arraigning me before the House as to my 
               <br />
               statement, I wrote the letter to which I re- 
               <br />
               ferred and in that letter I distinctly and 
               <br />
               clearly deﬁned the issue between us. I said 
               <br />
               in that letter :
