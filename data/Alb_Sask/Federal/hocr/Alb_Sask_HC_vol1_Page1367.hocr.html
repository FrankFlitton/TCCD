               <br />

               digging the trench and laying the pipe.

               Mr. T. S. SPROULE. I desire to inquire 
               <br />
               again about the return I moved for showing 
               <br />
               the number of appointments made in the 
               <br />
               civil service during years past and which, 
               <br />
               I was told, would be brought down at the 
               <br />
               earliest convenient moment. I have not 
               <br />
               heard of it since. The motion for the re- 
               <br />
               turn was passed some time ago and I think 
               <br />
               the subject should receive attention.

               (Mr. Sproule) called my attention to this a 
               <br />
               few days ago. I understand that all the 
               <br />
               departments have to be gone into and the 
               <br />
               return covers also the work of several years. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman must admit that it will 
               <br />
               require some time to compile a return. I 
               <br />
               will keep the matter in hand. I will make 
               <br />
               another note of it.
