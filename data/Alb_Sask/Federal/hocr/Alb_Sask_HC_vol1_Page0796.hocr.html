               Now, Mr. Speaker, in the province of 
               <br />
               New Brunswick, and I venture to say that 
               <br />
               this remark can be applied to most of the 
               <br />
               other provinces of the Dominion if not to 
               <br />
               all, there are no two more important de- 
               <br />
               partments of government than the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Crown Lands and the Department 
               <br />
               of Education; there are no two subjects of 
               <br />
               more vital local provincial concern than 
               <br />
               education and the administration of public 
               <br />
               lands. Any yet we ﬁnd that under this 
               <br />
               Bill the ownership and control of the pub- 
               <br />
               lic lands is absolutely withheld vtrom the 
               <br />
               new provinces, while with respect to edu- 
               <br />
               cation the legislative power of the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces is so restricted as to make the 
               <br />
               educational systems which are to be im- 
               <br />
               posed upon these new provinces, not the 
               <br />
               will and creation of the people of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               this parliament; an external body which has 
               <br />
               no interest—no direct interest at any rate 
               <br />

               quired by purchase or by conquest. The 
               <br />
               title in the lands of this country does not 
               <br />
               vest in this government as a government 
               <br />
               or in this parliament as a parliament, but 
               <br />
               they vest in the King in the right of the 
               <br />
               provinces as has been decided by the Privy 
               <br />
               Council in the cases to which I have alluded. 
               <br />
               We have had quite a recent judgment of the 
               <br />
               Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 
               <br />
               the Attorney General of New Brunswick vs. 
               <br />
               the liquidators of the Maritime Bank, in 
               <br />
               which it was laid down that the lieutenant 
               <br />
               governor in the province represented the 
               <br />
               Crown just as fully and effectually as the 
               <br />
               Governor General does in the federal sphere. 
               <br />
               We have in these cases the authority 
               <br />
               that the title to these lands properly vests 
               <br />
               in the Lieutenant Governor representing 
               <br />
               the King in right of the provinces; but 
               <br />
               it is not necessary to refer to these au-

               the title is in the province and not in the 
               <br />
               Dominion. We have in section 19 of this

               very Bill the admission that the provinces 
               <br />
               are entitled to the lands. Section 19 says:

               public convenience supports the claim that 
               <br />
               these lands should be in the hands of 
               <br />
               the prOvincial authorities. In the ﬁrst place, 
               <br />
               the administration of these lands is directly 
               <br />
               a matter of local and provincial concern; 
               <br />
               it is the people of the provinces who are 
               <br />
               chieﬂy interested in the administration of 
               <br />
               these lands; it is their interests that are 
               <br />
               chieﬂy affected. If the lands are wisely 
               <br />
               and eﬁiciently administered it is they who 
               <br />
               proﬁt and beneﬁt ; if the lands are unwisely 
               <br />
               and inefﬁciently administered it is they who 
               <br />
               uffer. That being the case, 1 submit that 
               <br />
               he administration of these lands should 
               <br />
               he in an authority responsible to the peo- 
               <br />
               ple who are interested. If these lands are 
               <br />
               retained by this government, as is proposed 
               <br />
               in the Bill. we may have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> federal author-

               efficient and most unwise manner. It is
