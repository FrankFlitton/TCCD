               of Justice this afternoon said it was one of 
               <br />
               policy. If it was a question of policy, it

               lieve it is not a question of law; I have 
               <br />
               to disagree with quite a number of my 
               <br />
               hon. friends on this side of the House. To 
               <br />
               me it is not a question of law but absolute- 
               <br />
               ly a question of policy, and even were it 
               <br />
               a question of law, even were it a constl-g 
               <br />
               tutional question, we all know the conver- 
               <br />
               sation that occurred between Catherine of 
               <br />
               France and Henry V. when kissing was 
               <br />
               under discussion. The king said: ‘Nice 
               <br />
               customs must curtsey to great Kings.’ Now, 
               <br />
               to me the constitution is very much of the 
               <br />
               nature of a custom and it at times has to 
               <br />
               curtsey to a great king and the great king 
               <br />
               in this question is that enlightened public 
               <br />
               opinion which upholds those ideas of poll- 
               <br />
               tical freedom and progress which mark this 
               <br />
               American continent, namely, civil and reli- 
               <br />
               gious equality, no connection between 
               <br />
               church and state and a national school sys- 
               <br />
               tem. That is a custom to which even a 
               <br />
               constitution must make curtsey. Because 
               <br />
               the public opinion of the country may say 
               <br />
               that even if the constitution says one thing 
               <br />
               the welfare of the country demands ano- 
               <br />
               ther thing. The Minister of Justice has 
               <br />
               been continually talking about carrying out 
               <br />
               contracts with minorities and the right hon. 
               <br />
               the leader of the House (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />
               often speaks about the sacredness of con- 
               <br />
               tracts and about vested rights. Do they 
               <br />
               know that if this talk were true in which 
               <br />
               they indulge about maintaining contracts 
               <br />
               with minorities and the sacredness of vested 
               <br />
               rights, there would never have been any 
               <br />
               constitutional progress in England or in 
               <br />

               <br />
               ter and that all the constitutions that ever 
               <br />
               were written have been distorted, have been 
               <br />
               thwarted in the public interest '? The con-

               <br />

               <br />
               most distorted document that was ever put 
               <br />
               to pen and ink, and it was because the in-

               <br />
               they were made by the decisions of the

               for the fullest liberty for the people of the 
               <br />
               west in regard to schools. They should

               people of the east by their own election,

               but the people of the west are to have no

               <br />
               bind them and that is the issue that will 
               <br />
               be before the people of this country. This 
               <br />
               to me is absolutely a question of statesman- 
               <br />
               ship, as was said by some hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               opposite. And what is the duty of states- 
               <br />
               manship ? There have been forty legal 
               <br />
               arguments imported into this debate as to 
               <br />
               what the meaning of the constitution is. 
               <br />
               My experience is that you can get as many 
               <br />
               opinions as the number of lawyers whom 
               <br />
               you care to fee and every one of those 
               <br />
               opinions is arguable. But what a states- 
               <br />
               man does and ought to do is to select a 
               <br />
               policy, to judge of the situation, to face 
               <br />
               the conditions that confront him, to face 
               <br />
               the problems before him, and if it depends 
               <br />
               upon the constitution to select a constitu- 
               <br />
               tional position, to take his stand on that 
               <br />
               view of the constitution and if the con- 
               <br />
               stitution does not sufﬁce in carrying his 
               <br />
               policy, What can he do? He can amend 
               <br />
               his constitution; he can even go to the 
               <br />
               imperial parliament to have conﬁrmed. 
               <br />
               what he thinks is in the interest of the 
               <br />
               Canadian people in regard to this separate 
               <br />
               school question in the west as hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men may have to do before many moons 
               <br />
               are over. And so it comes to this that the 
               <br />
               legislation that is proposed on any great 
               <br />

               conditions. I have listened to and have

               almost been surfeited with the praises that 
               <br />
               have been bestowed on the fathers of con— 
               <br />
               federation and with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">versions</span> of what the 
               <br />
               fathers of confederation meant in regard 
               <br />
               to the government of this country. I pay 
               <br />
               great respect to the fathers of the con- 
               <br />
               federation, but what have the fathers of con- 
               <br />
               federation to do with the sons of the 
               <br />
               confederation who are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> in front of a 
               <br />
               great political question ? We pay respect 
               <br />
               to what they say, but can George Brown, 
               <br />
               can John A. Macdonald settle the ques- 
               <br />
               tions that to-day confront us ? We must 
               <br />
               do it to the best of our ability for our- 
               <br />
