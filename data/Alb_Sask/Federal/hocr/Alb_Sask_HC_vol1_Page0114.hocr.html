               the provinces of Ontario and Quebec only. 
               <br />
               This provision was the result of compact

               and agreement. But no restrictions on

               confederation in respect of separate schools.

               titude of Catholics with regard to this mat—

               cerned. They say: It is a matter of our

               faith that our children should be under 
               <br />

               should receive religious instruction at school;

               as an ofﬁcial language of the Northwest 
               <br />
