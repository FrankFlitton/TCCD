               from an independent point of view, that 
               <br />
               there is an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unfair</span> distribution of seats,

               i do not consider is a fair basis at all. But

               even taking that basis, which the Prime

               more representation than to the southern

               cast in these two districts will be less than 
               <br />
               the votes which were cast in the district of 
               <br />
               Kinistino in the last territorial election. The 
               <br />
               right hon. Prime Minister has stated that it 
               <br />
               is almost impossible to distribute the popu- 
               <br />
               laton between these different seats within a 
               <br />
               10 per cent margin. I cannot see that im— 
               <br />
               possibility at all. I think there is no difﬁ- 
               <br />
               culty in the matter. At any rate I say it 
               <br />
               is unfair to have the balance always on one 
               <br />
               side. If there is any diﬂäculty in distribut- 
               <br />
               ing the population within 10 or 20 per cent 
               <br />
               we ought to see that general average 
               <br />
               is evened up. There may be constituencies 
               <br />
               in the south that are higher than the aver- 
               <br />
               age and constituencies in the south that are 
               <br />
               lower than the average. Then, there may 
               <br />
               be constituencies in the north which will 
               <br />
               work out in the same way, some higher 
               <br />
               and some lower. Let there be give and 
               <br />
               take on both sides so as to make a distri— 
               <br />
               bution as between north and south that is 
               <br />
               fairer than this distribution. Do not give 
               <br />
               the advantage all to one side. I consider 
               <br />
               that the only fair basis at which we can 
               <br />
               arrive. Do not give the advantage to the 
               <br />
               north of a representation 22 per cent over 
               <br />
               the representation which you are giving to 
               <br />
               the south, and in addition to giving to the 
               <br />
               north an advantage of 22 per cent add two 
               <br />
               seats in the district of Athabaska which, in 
               <br />
               my opinion, can be very well added to ex- 
               <br />
               isting districts in the northern part of Al-
