               Mr. SPROULE. It reminds me of the 
               <br />
               story of two sharp ‘Alicks’ putting ques- 
               <br />
               tions to each other, and one said: Why is 
               <br />
               it you never see any dirt around the mouth 
               <br />
               of a chipmunk’s hole; the answer was: 
               <br />
               Because it commences to dig at the bot- 
               <br />
               tom; and the other asked: How did it get 
               <br />
               there ?

               Mr. PATERSON. I have no doubt the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman thought he was a ‘s-mart 
               <br />
               Alick’ until the Minister of Justice gave 
               <br />
               him his answer. But the point remains: 
               <br />
               has the member for East Grey good reason 
               <br />

               What an exhibition hon. gentlemen opposite

               Mr. STAPLES. Mr. Speaker, I do not

               know what the hon. minister has said 
               <br />
               during my absence. I was out for a 
               <br />
               moment or two, but I have been told 
               <br />
               since I came into the chamber that he 
               <br />
               spoke of me being implicated in some 
               <br />
               way in the construction of a letter. All 
               <br />
               I can say to the hon. gentleman and 
               <br />
               this House is that, so far as my having 
               <br />
               anything to do with the construction of a 
               <br />
               letter in room No. 6 is concerned, it is ab— 
               <br />
               solutely untrue, and I know nothing of it. 
               <br />
               What I stated yesterday in reference to the 
               <br />
               letter were the simple facts. I was asked 
               <br />
               by the Hon. Mr. Rogers to see that that 
               <br />
               letter was immediately transmitted to the 
               <br />
               First Minister of this Dominion, and the 
               <br />
               messenger was particularly told that Mr. 
               <br />
               Rogers wanted that letter delivered to the 
               <br />
               Fir-st Minister immediately, because he 
               <br />
               was leaving that evening for Toronto.
