               Well, we need not perhaps stop at that; 
               <br />
               it is not fair perhaps to stop at that, be-

               cause we have certain further information

               derived from my hon. friend the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior. Some one told some ‘per— 
               <br />
               sons who told the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               that there is a population of 5,000 souls in 
               <br />
               these two ridings exclusive of Indians—or 
               <br />
               perhaps it may be that some one told my 
               <br />
               hon. friend that directly. I think that was 
               <br />
               the way he put it to the House—some per- 
               <br />
               son, at some indeﬁnite time, at some un- 
               <br />
               known place, the person <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> also unnamed 
               <br />
               and unknown to this House, has informed 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior that these two

               combined electoral divisions contain at the 
               <br />
               present time 5,000 persons exclusive of In- 
               <br />
               dians. Well, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Venture</span> to think that if 
               <br />
               you look at the other sources of information 
               <br />
               upon which reliance has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“been</span> placed by the 
               <br />
               government with respect to other portions 
               <br />
               of the constituency, we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> discount that 
               <br />
               statement a great deal. For my part I 
               <br />
               should be extremely surprised if it could 
               <br />
               be proved by any evidence worth the name 
               <br />
               that there are more than 2,500 persons at 
               <br />
               the present time in those two electoral divi- 
               <br />
               sions, not including Indians. But let us 
               <br />
               take the statement of the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior; let us take his statement, which 
               <br />
               it was not even worth While to put in writ- 
               <br />
               ing, of which it was not worth while to 
               <br />
               give any details; let us assume that there 
               <br />
               are in these two electoral divisions at the 
               <br />
               present time 5,000 people outside of Indians, 
               <br />
               and what have you? You have 245,000 peo— 
               <br />
               ple in the new province of Alberta to whom 
               <br />
               is allotted a representation of 23 members 
               <br />
               in the new legislature, and you have a sup- 
               <br />
               posed 5,000 people in the northern portion 
               <br />
               of that constituency to whom two represen- 
               <br />
               tatives are allotted. That is to say. to 
               <br />
               one—ﬁftieth of the assumed population of the 
               <br />
               province of Alberta a representatiOn of two 
               <br />
               is given, and to all the rest, to the other 
               <br />
               forty—nine-ﬁftieths of that population, a re- 
               <br />
               presentation of 23 is given. Now, there can 
               <br />
               be no excuse for that ; there can be no just!- 
               <br />
               ﬁcation for it ; there can be no apology for 
               <br />
               it. I do not know the motives which in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuenced the Minister of the Interior and 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister in forcing this upon the 
               <br />
               House. We can only guess at them. But 
               <br />
               it seems to be a transaction which is worthy 
               <br />
               of being characterized in the strongest pos— 
               <br />
               sible terms that parliamentary usage will 
               <br />
               permit. It seems to me to be indecent and 
               <br />
               indefensible that 5,000 persons in the north- 
               <br />
               ern part of that constituency should be given 
               <br />
               a representation of two members, while to

               Another provision to which I desire to

               have to say with regard to that in a very few 
               <br />
               words. The argument has been made not 
               <br />
               only by private members on the other side 
               <br />

               <br />
               as well, not, I think, by the right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman, but by some of his colleagues, that 
               <br />
               an obligation is imposed upon parliament 
               <br />
               to pass this legislation because of a com- 
               <br />
               pact which was made in 1870 at the time 
               <br />
               the Territories came into the confederation. 
               <br />
               That argument was disposed of by the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman the other evening, and it 
               <br />
               was disposed of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:by</span> my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice on the same evening. If 
               <br />
               there was any compact such as that which 
               <br />
               has been relied upon, it extended not only 
               <br />
               to separate schools in the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories, but to the use of the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage. A disclaimer was made by the 
               <br />
               Solicitor General, concurred in by the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, both of whom declared that no 
               <br />
               such compact existed under anything that 
               <br />
               took place in 1870; therefore, so far as that 
               <br />
               is concerned we come down to what the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice quoting from the judg- 
               <br />
               ment of a court, calls a parliamentary com- 
               <br />
               pact, and we ﬁnd the obligation to enact 
               <br />
               this legislation, if we ﬁnd it anywhere. in 
               <br />
               the statute of 1875. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               and his colleagues have taken away from 
               <br />
               themselves that argument; they have taken 
               <br />
               it away deliberately, with their eyes open,

               was no compact contained in the Act of 
               <br />
               1875, because otherwise the right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman and his colleagues would have felt 
               <br />
               themselves obliged to accede to the motions 
               <br />
               which they voted down. Therefore. we 
               <br />
               come down after all to the question of con- 
               <br />
               stitutional power, of constitutional right, 
               <br />
               and as to whether it is sound policy in this 
               <br />
               regard to limit the rights of the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. I do not-admit that there is any 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutional</span> power; I deny that there is 
               <br />
               any constitutional right, and I deny further 
               <br />
