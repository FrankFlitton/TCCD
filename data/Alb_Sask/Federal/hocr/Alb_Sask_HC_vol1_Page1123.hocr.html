               I have heard it assigned as a reason to

               justify the active interest Ontario is taking

               here of what George Brown said during the

               It has always appeared to me that the open-

               most cherished projects of my honourable 
               <br />
               friends from Lower Canada. During the dis- 
               <br />
               cussion on the question for some years back I 
               <br />
               had occasion to dip deep in Northwest lore— 
               <br />
               into those singularly interesting narratives of 
               <br />
               life and travels in the Northwest in the olden 
               <br />
               time, and into the history of the struggles for 
               <br />
               commercial dominancy in the great fur-bearing 
               <br />
               regions. And it has always struck me that the 
               <br />
               French Canadian people have cause to look 
               <br />
               back with pride to the bold and successful part

               they played in the adventures of those days. 
               <br />
               Nothing perhaps has tended more to create

               <br />
               by or granted to any of His Majesty’s sub- 
               <br />
               jects or possessed by the subjects of any 
               <br />
               Christian prince or state.’ The area covered 
               <br />
               by this grant has been frequently discus- 
               <br />
               sed, but it is not to my knowledge that 
               <br />
               the conﬁnes- of the grant have ever been 
               <br />
               accurately deﬁned. In' addition to the grants 
               <br />
               to exclusive trade and to the soil, the en- 
               <br />
               tire legislative, judicial and executive power 
               <br />
               was vested in the company. And let me 
               <br />
               here observe that two French Canadian 
               <br />
               gentlemen, Messrs. Radisson and -De Gros- 
               <br />
               eil, ﬁrst discovered the overland communi- 
               <br />
               cation between Canada and Hudson bay, 
               <br />
               and with these gentlemen originated the 
               <br />
               idea of the Hudson Bay Company. In 
               <br />
               1749, an unsuccessful attempt was made 
               <br />
               in the imperial parliament to deprive the 
               <br />
               company of its character for non-user. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">company</span> had at that time four or ﬁve forts 
               <br />
               on the coast of Hudson bay, and in its ser- 
               <br />
               vice about 120 men. After the cession of 
               <br />
               Canada in 1763, numerous fur traders spread 
               <br />
               over the same country, and ﬁnally these in- 
               <br />
               dividual speculators combined into the 
               <br />
               Northwest Fur Company of Montreal. I 
               <br />
               need not refer to the settlement effected in 
               <br />
               that country under the auspices of Lord 
               <br />
               Selkirk. but I would like to refer to the 
               <br />
               license granted in 1821 to the Hudson Bay 
               <br />
               Company and the Northwest Company, 
               <br />
               which two companies were then amalgamat- 
               <br />
