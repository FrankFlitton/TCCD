               =on the occasion of the Grand Trunk Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway debate. He stated that within 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ten</span> years from the completion of this rail- 
               <br />

               <br />
               available, and I think he must only have 
               <br />
               referred to the lands which would be opened 
               <br />
               up by the railway. He further said that 
               <br />
               Within ten years from the completion of the

               not some gentleman may put me right—20,—

               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ought</span> to go upon. If these lands are not

               have in the future-should be given to them. 
               <br />
               Further than that I may quote from a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remark</span> which was also made by the late 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior during the debate 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«on</span> the second reading of this Bill. When, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speaking</span> in reference to the value of the 
               <br />
               school lands fund, he stated that that was 
               <br />
               a fund which would be worth $50,000,000. 
               <br />
               I may point out that the school lands are 
               <br />
               something less than one-seventeenth part of 
               <br />
               the whole of the lands included in these two 
               <br />
               provinces. I cannot suppose that the late 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior would make a state- 
               <br />
               ment of that sort unless he had some ground 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tor</span> believing that at some day in the future 
               <br />
               the amount to be received for these lands 
               <br />
               would reach that sum.

               provinces for its government—$37,500,000. If 
               <br />
               so, why should you bring in the land at all ? 
               <br />
               The land evidently had nothing in the world 
               <br />
               to do with it. What the government were 
               <br />
               evidently looking at was this : What is the 
               <br />
               amount that we should reasonably give to 
               <br />
               each of these provinces to enable it to carry 
               <br />
               on its ﬁnancial affairs; $37,500,000. You 
               <br />
               gave that. You have denied that they should 
               <br />
               have their lands. You say the lands should 
               <br />
               belong to the Dominion government. They 
               <br />
               r10 anyway. You say that the provinces as 
               <br />
               formed shall not have any rights at all over 
               <br />

               <br />
               right and you deny any right to their lands 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after-_they</span> are formed into provinces, when 
               <br />
               as provinces they, I think, ought to have

               their lands and the management thereof, 
               <br />
               for various reasons. But, you deny both

               of these premises. Then. why do you make 
               <br />
               the specious pretense of having anything to- 
               <br />
               do with lands at all ? Why do you not 
               <br />
               simply make your resolution read in this 
               <br />
               way: That the Dominion government does 
               <br />
               not propose to give over to these provinces 
               <br />
               their lands, and yet, recognizing that they 
               <br />
               must have money to carry on their public 
               <br />
               works, you give them the amount of $37,500,- 
               <br />
               000 to be paid in a certain way. That would 
               <br />
               be a fair, open, clear exposition of the real 
               <br />
               facts which the hon. Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Oliver) has inadvertently let out. The 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of the Interior, being young, 
               <br />
               is less Wily and less skilled in the arts of 
               <br />
               concealment than his older colleagues. I 
               <br />
               sincerely trust that his virgin modesty and 
               <br />
               openness will always remain the same, and 
               <br />
               that he will be a shining example of a min- 
               <br />
               ister who is frank and outspoken, who will 
               <br />
               call a spade a spade, and who, when he 
               <br />
               makes a resolution to give money for any 
               <br />
               purpose, will not attribute it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to,</span> some re- 
               <br />
               fined method of calculation as to the quan- 
               <br />
               tity of land and the present and prospective 
               <br />
               value of land, but will just simply say in his 
               <br />
               resolution, as he says before the committee, 
               <br />
               that he proposes to give these new provinces 
               <br />
               $37,500,000 each. This other is all subter- 
               <br />
               fuge and a specious application of the wily 
               <br />
               arts of the politician to lull the sentiments 
               <br />
               and probably the rightful sentiments of the 
               <br />
               people in the Northwest. The hon. Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior has been good enough to say 
               <br />
               that we should have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">information.</span> I 
               <br />
               would like to know the quantity of lands 
               <br />
               there is in each of these provinces that are 
               <br />
               considered to be arable lands, the acreage 
               <br />
               that is considered to be grazing lands and 
               <br />
               the area that is put in the category of 
               <br />
               mineral lands. I suppose there are certain 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">portions</span> of these lands, of which you already 
               <br />
               have made surveys and in regard to Which 
               <br />
