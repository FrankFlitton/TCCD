               resented to the committee that they had 
               <br />
               invested a large amount of money in that

               <br />
               expire, that they have only one year more. 
               <br />
               Since that patent was obtained, in 1891, I 
               <br />
               think it was, the law has been changed, and 
               <br />
               instead of giving ﬁfteen years for the pa- 
               <br />

               <br />
               represented to us that under the circum- 
               <br />
               stances they had incurred great cost, and 
               <br />
               that having received only a poor return it 
               <br />
               would be only fair to give them an exten- 
               <br />
               sion of six years. The objection was made 
               <br />
               that they should get only three years in 
               <br />

               Hon. Sir WILLIAM MULOCK (Postmas- 
               <br />
               ter General). Mr. Speaker, for three hours 
               <br />
               this afternoon the House had the advantage 
               <br />
               of hearing the views of the hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               not upon the subject under discussion, but 
               <br />
               upon many matters totally foreign to the 
               <br />
               measure that the House is now consider— 
               <br />
               ing. If, this afternoon, a stranger had been 
               <br />
               in our galleries, and many there were, and 
               <br />
               had not in advance been informed of the 
               <br />
               subject under debate. it would have been 
               <br />
               impossible for him to have known what the 
               <br />
               subject was that was properly in order be- 
               <br />
               fore the House. For three hours this after~ 
               <br />
               noon the hon. member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster) occupied the attention of the 
               <br />
               House ostensibly in order to aid by some 
               <br />
               useful contribution in the solution of a 
               <br />
               very important public question, but instead 
               <br />
               of bringing to the aid of his country his 
               <br />
               great talents, I think it will be found on a 
               <br />
               careful perusal of his words that his efforts 
               <br />
               were rather to sow the seeds of diScord to 
               <br />
               the injury of his country. He began by 
               <br />
               giving us, as he has on many occasions and 
               <br />
               as he also has given to the public, his views 
               <br />
               on the question of political principles and 
               <br />
               political morality. It must be extremely 
               <br />
               elevating to the people of Canada to take 
               <br />
               their inspiration of political morality from 
               <br />
               such a source. He entered politics with 
               <br />
               principles. He describes the Liberal party 
               <br />
               as conveniently packing their principles in 
               <br />
               a remote corner of a small valise,” and he 
               <br />
               states that they are able to get rid of them 
               <br />
               as conveniently as they can put them in or 
               <br />
               take them out of the valise. What about 
               <br />
               the principles of the hon. gentleman? I 
               <br />
               can recall many of his professed principles, 
               <br />
               for perhaps his principles are not very deep— 
               <br />
               seated, and, like old garments, they are 
               <br />
