               there are no separate schools. There are

               side of the county I ﬁnd such towns as

               I could go on through every county in On-

               tario and show that the separate school

               system is not making headway in that pro- 
               <br />
               vince, but the Roman Catholics, as well as 
               <br />
               Protestants, are realizing the beneﬁt and 
               <br />
               better effect of not having separate schools. 
               <br />
               In Ontario we have no such schools as 
               <br />
               separate high schools. Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               and Protestants, boys and girls, alike, go 
               <br />
               to the same high school, and the best of 
               <br />
               fellowships are engendered there, and yet 
               <br />

               <br />
               a country that does not know its own

               requirements or the class of people that are 
               <br />
               going to populate it—a system that will have 
               <br />
               the effect of weakening the eﬁicîency of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               rate school in that district. What do we

               ﬁnd regarding the number of separate 
               <br />

               <br />
               23 separate schools. In Renfrew, where 
               <br />
               there is a large Catholic population, there 
               <br />
               are also 12 schools: and in the district of

               <br />
               must express my ditﬁdence because of the 
               <br />
               fact that this measure has been discussed

               <br />
               nevertheless I desire to express my views 
               <br />
               concerning it before casting my vote. But 
               <br />
               before proceeding with my argument, I Wish 
               <br />
               to refer for a moment or two to the remarks 
               <br />
               that fell from the hon. gentleman who has 
               <br />
               just sat down (Mr. Bennett). I hardly know 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman well enough to under- 
               <br />
               stand why he should waste so much time 
               <br />
               in commiserating with the Liberal party 
               <br />
               over what he deems to be their troubles. 
               <br />
               Surely if commiseration is needed by any 
               <br />
               party it is required by the party he is fol- 
               <br />
               lowing to-day. I suppose that in the history

               of party government in this country or any 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Englishspeaking</span> country, there never was 
               <br />
               an instance of such a lack of discipline, such 
               <br />
               a violation of the theory of party govern— 
               <br />
               ment, as is evidenced here today. That 
               <br />
               party stands without a leader, without a 
               <br />
               policy, with every one of its-supporters 
               <br />
               going whichever way he chooses. Yet still 
               <br />
               my hon. friend wastes time pointing out 
               <br />
               the weaknesses which he sees in the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment supporters. I am sure we do not 
               <br />
               resent the good feeling and the interest 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               like to console him by the assurance that the

               friends and supporters of the government 
               <br />
