               Mr. SCOTT. As I happen to represent à 
               <br />
               constituency which is divided by the line 
               <br />
               under consideration, I would like the privi- 
               <br />
               lege of saying a few words more upon the 
               <br />
               question. Like with many other questions, 
               <br />
               the selection of this dividing line was 
               <br />
               a compromise. There were people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ye"</span> 
               <br />
               presenting the interests affected who wanted 
               <br />
               the dividing line sixty miles further east, 
               <br />
               which would run in the neighbourhood of 
               <br />
               Crane lake on the line of the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway. When we faced this 
               <br />
               problem, the ﬁrst question to be decided 
               <br />
               was whether it was well now to grant pro- 
               <br />
               vincial autonomy to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest.</span> That 
               <br />
               was decided in the aﬂirmative, though not 
               <br />
               with absolute unanimity. The next question 
               <br />
               was whether there should be one or two 
               <br />
               provinces. That was decided in favour oi" 
               <br />
               two provinces, again not with absolute 
               <br />
               unanimity. Then the question arose as to 
               <br />
               how these two provinces were to be treated 
               <br />
               in regard to ﬁnances and other matters; 
               <br />
               and with perfect unanimity it was agreed 
               <br />
               that it would be well to treat them with 
               <br />
               absolute equality—to give them exactly the 
               <br />
               same ﬁnancial status. Then came the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of selecting the dividing line. and, as I 
               <br />
               mentioned in the debate on the second <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">read»-</span> 
               <br />
               ing of these Bills, each member who was 
               <br />
               under the responsibility of giving advice on 
               <br />
               that question was under a very heavy re- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘sponsibility.</span> 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               My own preference was that the present 
               <br />
               eastern boundary line of the district of 
               <br />
               Alberta should be selected as the dividing 
               <br />
               line. It would be about 50 or 60 miles 
               <br />
               further west than the line which has been 
               <br />
               chosen. However, the weight of opinion 
               <br />
               carried in favour of the fourth meridian 
               <br />
               line, which in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alberta</span> Bill is named as 
               <br />
               the eastern boundary of Alberta. After all, 
               <br />
               I have no very serious objectiOn to urge 
               <br />
               against this line, although I still think that 
               <br />
               the eastern line of the present district of 
               <br />
               Alberta would be the fairest line, looking 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the‘</span> future populations of these respective 
               <br />
               provinces as we may expect them to be, con- 
               <br />
               sidering the class of territory that composes 
               <br />
               the two provinces. The northern portion 
               <br />
               of the proviDCe,of Saskatchewan. so far as 
               <br />
               our present knowledge about that country 
               <br />
               goes, cannot be expected to bear as heavy 
               <br />
               a population as the northern part Of the 
               <br />
               province of Alberta. As I mentioned once 
               <br />
               before, the foot-hill country adjacent to 
               <br />
               the Rocky mountains, and even the 
               <br />
               Rocky mountains in the southern part of 
               <br />

               tion because of the large coal deposits which

               If the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L.

               Borden) were here I would call his attention 
               <br />
               to this statement, which might help to ex-

               the event of autonomy being granted and two 
               <br />
               provinces formed we are of the unanimous opin- 
               <br />
               ion that the 4th principal meridian should be 
               <br />
               the dividing line. As a ranching district we 
               <br />
               have no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tears</span> of bein isolated, as it is our 
               <br />
               opinion that a very arge percentage of the 
               <br />
               ranching district lies east of the 4th meridian.
