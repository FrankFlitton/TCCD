               number of the other gentlemen opposite have 
               <br />
               ignored the constitution to say that they

               must compromise on behalf ot‘ peace—and 
               <br />

               <br />
               men see today the falsity of the stand they 
               <br />
               have taken ; surely they see that instead of 
               <br />
               them compromising on behalf of peace they 
               <br />
               have created a disturbance in this country 
               <br />
               that will not be settled for years to come. 
               <br />
               A weak government may use weak argu— 
               <br />
               ments, but no arguments were ever weaken 
               <br />
               than the arguments used by this govern- 
               <br />
               ment. Man after man on the government 
               <br />
               side has tried to picture this country as in 
               <br />
               the hands of the opposition. Sir, if the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of Canada had an opportunity to-day, 
               <br />
               the aﬂ’airs of this Dominion would be con- 
               <br />
               trolled and directed by the great Conserva-

               <br />
               day voicing the sentiments of the people of 
               <br />
               Canada. If this government continues to 
               <br />
               juggle with the constitution then the people 
               <br />
               of Canada will soon demand that they be 
               <br />
               given a constitution that the ordinary man 
               <br />
               can understand. It was certainly not an 
               <br />
               edifying sight to see the way practically 
               <br />
               every supporter of the present government 
               <br />
               applauded the Prime Minister when he was 
               <br />
               taking away provincial rights from these 
               <br />
               new provinces. Nothing can atone in the 
               <br />
               life of a nation for a lack of courage, 
               <br />
               honesty and common sense in the men who 
               <br />
               are conducting the affairs of state. In 
               <br />
               matters of colonial legislation Great Britain 
               <br />
               always consulted her colonies, and their 
               <br />
               advice was always accepted. But, here the 
               <br />
               Dominion government legislate contrary to 
               <br />
               the demands of the provinces. Bear in mind 
               <br />
               that there never was a British constitution 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">framed</span> without the consent of those who 
               <br />
               had to live under it. Great Britain had our 
               <br />
               consent to the British North America Act 
               <br />
               before that Act was passed in the imperial 
               <br />
               parliament. In giving a federal constitution 
               <br />
               to Australia, the imperial parliament had 
               <br />
               the consent of the Commonwealth to every 
               <br />
               clause, and when there was a difference of 
               <br />
               opinion that difference was settled by agree- 
               <br />
               ment—not by coercion. The people who as- 
               <br />
               sume Dominion or provincial responsibility 
               <br />
               should have a voice in governing their ad- 
               <br />
               mission to that status. The representatives 
               <br />
               of the Territories ask to have control of their 
               <br />
               public lands; they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asked</span> that if these lands 
               <br />
               were to be cut in two the line dividing the 
               <br />
               provinces should be placed sixty miles east 
               <br />
               of the line now proposed in the Bill. They 
               <br />
               asked to have perfect freedom in managing 
               <br />
               their educational policy. All these requests 
               <br />
               were ignored by the Dominion government; 
               <br />
               the only excuse given for not granting the 
               <br />
               demands with reference to the lands being 
               <br />
               that it would interfere with the Do- 
               <br />
               minion immigration policy, and the only 
               <br />
               excuse for limiting the control of educa- 
               <br />
               tion by the province being. that it would 
               <br />
               interfere with the party. Great Britain re-

               and what Great Britain has done for the

               Dominion the Dominion might well do for 
               <br />
               her provinces. All provinces feel the dis- 
               <br />
               advantage of being small. Eastern Canada 
               <br />
               was once composed of four provinces or 
               <br />
               colonies as they were then called. Cape 
               <br />
               Breton was merged into Nova Scotia, and 
               <br />
               there was also about the time of confeder- 
               <br />
               ation a movement on foot to amalgamate 
               <br />
               the maritime provinces so as to cheapen 
               <br />
               legislation; in fact I understand there is 
               <br />
               some discussion with that object in view 
               <br />
               going on at the present time. British Col— 
               <br />
               umbia was once two provinces, the Island of 
               <br />
               Vancouver being separated from the main- 
               <br />
               land, but the two are now united as one pro- 
               <br />
               vince. In the west we will have three pro- 
               <br />
               vinces where two would have been sufﬁcient, 
               <br />
               and were it not for the school question there 
               <br />
               is no good reason why we should not have 
               <br />
               but two provinces. The government lands in 
               <br />
               the United States are largely control-led by 
               <br />
               an independent body of men responsible to 
               <br />
               the president, whereas in Canada at the 
               <br />
               present time, the Crown lands are controlled 
               <br />
               and handled to the advantage of politicians. 
               <br />
               The right hon. the Prime Minister argued 
               <br />
               that the west was bought with a price, but 
               <br />
               now he ﬁnds that the west was not bought 
               <br />
               by Canada, that Canada never recognized 
               <br />
               the Hudson Bay deal, that there are no 
               <br />
               papers to show any transactions between 
               <br />
               Canada and any person for these lands, and 
               <br />
               that Canada would never recognize such a 
               <br />
               transaction. This government evidently does 
               <br />
               not think that the provinces can be trusted 
               <br />
               with their lands, but Mr. Speaker, the time is 
               <br />
               coming and not far distant, when these pro— 
               <br />
               vinces will demand the rights to their lands 
               <br />
               as is conceded in section 109 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, and they will get them. 
               <br />
               The present Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver) made an unfair reference to the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario when he compared the 
               <br />
               amount of money that province received 
               <br />
               from government Crown lands, with the 
               <br />
               compensation which the new provinces will 
               <br />
               get for their lands from the federal govern- 
               <br />
               ment. Mr. Oliver said :
