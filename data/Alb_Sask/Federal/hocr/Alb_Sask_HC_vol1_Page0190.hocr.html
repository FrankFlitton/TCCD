               Bill is, that the right hon. Prime Minister

               in introducing it should tell us that it is 
               <br />
               a matter of such little importance that it

               <br />

               <br />
               Finance—who might have been justified in 
               <br />
               using the language of his leader, and saying 
               <br />
               the Bill was of no moment, because his 
               <br />
               leader thought the Bill of so little impor-

               quired—frankiy admits that it is the most 
               <br />
               important measure that we have had in 
               <br />
               many a day. I go further than the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman and say, in all sincerity, that 
               <br />
               not only is it the most important measure 
               <br />
               before parliament to—day, but I believe that 
               <br />
               it is the most important measure that has 
               <br />
               ever been before this House, the most im- 
               <br />
               portant measure—and I say it with a due 
               <br />
               consciousness of the seriousness of my 
               <br />

               <br />
               come. Let me explain why I say that. 
               <br />
               A great deal has been said by some speak— 
               <br />
               ers in the Way that I sincerely regret. I 
               <br />
               trust I shall be able to express myself on 
               <br />
               these vexed questions without using a sin- 
               <br />
               gle word that will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁensive</span> to any one. 
               <br />
               I do not see why one cannot express htls 
               <br />
               views conscientiously and frankly without 
               <br />

               But, when we are dealing with half a mil- 
               <br />
               lion square miles of territory of our North- 
               <br />

               ing, that history moves on, and that nowa- 
               <br />
               days great changes take place within a 
               <br />
               few years. We have often been referred to 
               <br />
               the year 1875 in this debate, the year when 
               <br />
               the law was passed for the regulation of the 
               <br />
               Northwest, when the school law was placed 
               <br />
               upon the statute-book. Who would have 
               <br />
               expected at that time that people to—day 
               <br />
               would be spending time in discussing the 
               <br />
               school regulations for a country in which, 
               <br />
               I understand, there were in 1875, only about 
               <br />
               500 people. We know that that part of 
               <br />
               the country was then regarded as a part 
               <br />
               that would not attain anything like the im- 
               <br />
               portance it has attained to-day. Within a 
               <br />
               quarter of a century, since the building of 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, wonderful 
               <br />
               changes have come over that part of our 
               <br />
               country. Immigration is pouring in and 
               <br />
               development is rapidly progressing. Not 
               <br />
               only are the eyes of the old provinces ﬁxed 
               <br />
               on the Northwest, but the eyes of the em- 
               <br />
               pire are upon that country as the future 
               <br />
               granary of the empire. More than that, 
               <br />
               Sir, we know that the eyes of the whole 
               <br />
               world are turned to the Northwest as be- 
               <br />
               ing the most attractive place for immigra- 
               <br />

               <br />
               and wishing to ﬁnd new homes. It seems 
               <br />
               that we are approaching this subject in a 
               <br />
               parish spirit if we cannot see more in it 
               <br />
               than a few details concerning the regulation 
               <br />
               of a few schools. The ex-Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior has quoted some eminent Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic prelate as saying that these schools 
               <br />
               differed nothing from public schools except 
               <br />
               in the name. If there is so little to dis- 
               <br />
               tinguish them, if they are practically one 
               <br />
               and the same thing, why should the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman have thrown this ﬁrebrand 
               <br />
               into the political arena? The right hon. 
               <br />
