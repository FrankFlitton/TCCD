               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. The wording of this 
               <br />
               clause would seem to indicate that in its ori- 
               <br />
               ginal drafting it was proposed to entrust the 
               <br />
               delimitation of these ridings or divisions to 
               <br />
               some other body than parliament—some in- 
               <br />
               dependent body. I call the attention of the 
               <br />
               right lhon. gentleman to the wording of the 
               <br />
               section. Those words have no ofﬁce or 
               <br />
               meaning in the section as it stands at pre- 
               <br />
               sent, but they would have an oﬂice and 
               <br />
               meaning if they were part of a section 
               <br />
               which entrusted delimitation of the ridings 
               <br />
               to some independent body, as seems to have 
               <br />
               been contemplated in the ﬁrst instance. I 
               <br />
               am not concerned at the moment with the 
               <br />
               question which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has'</span> been considerably de- 
               <br />
               bated in this committee, namely, as to 
               <br />
               Whether or not there is discrimination be- 
               <br />
               tween the northern part of the province of 
               <br />
               Alberta and the southern portion. The ﬁrst 
               <br />
               question to be considered is the question 
               <br />
               Whether or not this parliament has before 
               <br />
               it the necessary material for the purpose of 
               <br />
               making that division. The right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman and his colleagues in 1899, as has al— 
               <br />
               ready been pointed out by hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               on this side, thought that where certain 
               <br />
               counties in Ontario had to be divided into a 
               <br />
               certain number of ridings. the reasonable 
               <br />
               and proper course would be to entrust the 
               <br />
               division to an independent commission. The

               <br />

               <br />
               the eastern part of Canada at least, to local 
               <br />

               not very much troubled by the considera-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion</span> of local divisions, because there are not

               in the western part of Canada municipali— 
               <br />
               ties, there is no division into counties, no 
               <br />
               such divisions as those to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister attached importance when he 
               <br />
               brought down the Bill for redistribution in 
               <br />
               1903. With all due regard to local divisions, 
               <br />
               and to natural boundaries, Wherever they 
               <br />
               exist, the basis must be a basis of popula- 
               <br />
               tion. When you attempt to proceed upon 
               <br />
               a basis of population in making this dis- 
               <br />
               tribution what are you to look to ? The con- 
               <br />
               ditions in this province and in the province 
               <br />
               of Saskatchewan as well are absolutely 
               <br />
               different from those which prevailed in 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario at that time, but 
               <br />
               the difference is one which forcibly accent- 
               <br />
               uates, in my opinion, the necessity of hav- 
               <br />
               ing these boundaries delimited by some 
               <br />
               tribunal which can make a proper investiga- 
               <br />
               tion for that purpose. In Ontario you had 
               <br />
               not an enormous movement of population, 
               <br />
               you had not a tremendous immigration com-

               <br />
               which was afforded by the census of 1901. 
               <br />
               I have understood from the remarks of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister on this question that we are 
               <br />
               to some extent to proceed upon the basis 
               <br />
               of population as ascertained by the census of 
               <br />
               1901. It must be obvious to the. right hon.

               Bill, it is'a basis which is not acted upon, 
               <br />
               and cannot be acted upon, when we pro— 
               <br />
               ceed to make a per capita allowance to the 
               <br />
               two provinces. The census of 1901 assigned 
               <br />
               to the province of Alberta a population in 
               <br />
               the vicinity of 70,000 souls. The basis upon 
               <br />
               which the government is proceeding to-day, 
               <br />
               in dealing with that province, assigns to it 
               <br />
               a population of not less than 250,000 souls. 
               <br />
               Looking at all available material which 
               <br />
               is before the committee as to population we 
               <br />
               must at once conclude that there are no 
               <br />
               such material as existed in the case of the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario to which I have alluded. 
               <br />
               Even in that case it was thought right by 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister and his colleagues not 
               <br />
               to interfere by delimiting the ridings in this 
               <br />
               parliament, but to entrust the duty’ot‘ divid- 
               <br />
               ing the counties to an absolutely indepen- 
               <br />
               dent body which should proceed upon cer- 
               <br />
               tain principles mentioned in the Bill to 
               <br />
               which I have referred. It has been said that
