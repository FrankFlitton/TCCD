               Hon. Mr. Blake said that the 11th clause of

               the Northwest Territory Act was not yet in 
               <br />

               <br />
               Territories until the Act was proclaimed. It 
               <br />
               was a clause which could only come into force 
               <br />
               practically in connection with a system of tax-

               mained under this form of government. The 
               <br />
               future of these Territories would be either one 
               <br />
               of two things—they would be annexed to Maui- 
               <br />

               <br />

               attention to a resolution which was passed

               With time and consideration came wis-

               dom. That resolution was put to the House 
               <br />
               and how did it result? Six voted in favour 
               <br />
               of it, and 15 against it. And there this 
               <br />
               agitation with respect to the repeal of the

               separate schools ended, and we have heard 
               <br />
               nothing of it since. And of course, the

               present Prime Minister of the Northwest

               resolution and in favour of maintaining the

               <br />
               have something even more recent. We have 
               <br />
               heard quite recently about the extension 
               <br />
               of the Manitoba boundaries and the desir- 
               <br />
               ability of extending those boundaries has 
               <br />
               been dwelt upon. And in that connection 
               <br />
               we have heard references more forcible than 
               <br />
