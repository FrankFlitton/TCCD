               (Mr. Bristol) took occasion to remark that 
               <br />
               when this Bill was originally introduced <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier), he 
               <br />
               invoked moderation on the subject from all 
               <br />
               those who discussed the measure. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Centre Toronto (Mr. Bristol) 
               <br />
               was inclined to praise the right hon. the 
               <br />
               leader of the House (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />
               for having asked for moderation, and hav— 
               <br />
               ing himself set an example of moderation 
               <br />
               in his speech. But a few moments later, 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Centre Toronto changed 
               <br />
               his tone in this respect and said that the 
               <br />
               eulogy pronounced by the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               on separate schools stirred up the resent- 
               <br />
               ment of every Protestant in this House. 
               <br />
               What then does he think of the eulogy or 
               <br />
               complimentary apostrophe that was pro— 
               <br />
               nounced in respect to the minority, in re- 
               <br />
               spect to the Roman Catholic electors of this 
               <br />
               country by his own leader, the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. It. L. Borden)? Now that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman. I think, went a little out 
               <br />
               of his way in the course of his speech to 
               <br />
               eulogize the Roman Catholic minority. It 
               <br />
               was not necessary for him to do so for the 
               <br />
               purposes of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his.</span> argument. However, I 
               <br />
               have no doubt that the Roman Catholic.

               electors of the Dominion of Canada will be 
               <br />
               very much gratiﬁed by that eulogy, although 
               <br />
               it came to them in a sort of backhanded.: 
               <br />
               apologetic manner, for at the same momentl 
               <br />
               the opposition leader said that he could not 
               <br />
               support their claims, that he rested his case 
               <br />
               solely on the rock of the constitution, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he;</span>

               understood it, but he gave them not onei

               single hint of what he would do provided

               this were a constitutional measure and this

               Before entering upon an examination of 
               <br />
               the case, as one might put it, I might say 
               <br />
               that I listened with great care to the speech 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for Centre Toronto (Mr.

               tulate the hon. member on his maiden effort 
               <br />
               in this House. He certainly has succeeded 
               <br />
               a great man, who formerly represented that 
               <br />
               riding in this House, a man who had the

               <br />
               great man, and I might express the hope 
               <br />
               that at some day in the future the hon. 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               British North America Act, 1867, was the

               outcome of a compact or agreement. It is

               far as analysis is necessary for the purpose of 
               <br />
               considering this question and what do you ﬁnd? 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst place you ﬁnd the establishment of 
               <br />
               a. federal parliament and a federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">executive;</span> 
               <br />
               in the next place you ﬁnd the establishment of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provincial</span> legislatures and provincial execu- 
               <br />
               tives ; in the next (place you ﬁnd the distribu- 
               <br />
               tion of executive power between the federal 
               <br />

               <br />
               the next place you ﬁnd the distribution of exe— 
               <br />
               cultive power between the Dominion parliament 
               <br />
               and the provincial legislature. This analysis 
               <br />
               is not exhaustive, but it covers alll that is 
               <br />
               necessary for the present purpose.

               I submit that that is a very fair analysis 
               <br />
               of the Act, and I would point out that in 
               <br />
               section 91 of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the‘Act</span> we ﬁnd the subjects 
               <br />
               which are to be entirely dealt with by this 
               <br />
               parliament. In section 92 of the Act we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd enumerated all the matters which are 
               <br />
               to form the subjects of provincial legis—

               lation. Now, Mr. ISpeaker, marking these 
               <br />
               two sections, examining them carefully, we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that section 91 distinctly applies to
