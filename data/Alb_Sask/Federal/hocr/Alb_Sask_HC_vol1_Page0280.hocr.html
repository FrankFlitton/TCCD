               Mr. FOSTER. It is not the American 
               <br />
               system alone, it is the Canadian system in 
               <br />
               every province except Quebec. Where 
               <br />
               did the right hon. leader of the government 
               <br />
               get his information when he stated in par- 
               <br />
               liament here the other day that in the 
               <br />
               schools of Canada religion and reli- 
               <br />
               gious dogmas were taught from morning 
               <br />
               till night ? Has the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               ever looked into our school systems '? Go 
               <br />
               to the province of Ontario, go to the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba, go to the province of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, go to all of them and that is 
               <br />
               absolutely thewrong explanation and the 
               <br />
               wrong interpretation. These schools are 
               <br />
               free, non-sectarian and consequently nation- 
               <br />
               al. They do not allow dogma to be taught 
               <br />
               whether it is dogma of the Methodist, the 
               <br />
               Presbyterian, the Anglican or the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic. All are treated alike. Is there 
               <br />
               no reasonableness in the proposition, that, 
               <br />
               if the great majority of the people of the 
               <br />
               country feel that the best kind of a 
               <br />
               system is such a system as that, so
