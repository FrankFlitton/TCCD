               his objection was not so much to the con-

               <br />
               making that contract at all. The Public

               <br />

               The hon. Minister of Justice was not so par- 
               <br />
               ticular on that occasion to see that a con-

               have the explanation of the Finance Minis-

               international fence that is entirely insufﬁ- 
               <br />
