               Is it not a strange fact that in England,

               the centre and heart of Protestantism, where

               And this brings me to a question that 
               <br />
               has been lightly touched upon in this 
               <br />
               House by—I was going to say the yellow 
               <br />
               hierarchy—which has been lightly touched 
               <br />
               upon by the hon. member for East Grey 
               <br />
               (Mr. iSproule). And—it is just as well to 
               <br />
               frankly admit it—this question is the very 
               <br />
               basis of this discussion. I wish to treat 
               <br />
               completely, if I can, the question of the in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence of the hierarchy and the alleged 
               <br />
               sinister motives animating the Roman Cath- 
               <br />
               olics in this House. I have referred to the 
               <br />
               case of Archbishop Taché in 1870. That 
               <br />
               was only one instance. Let us take our 
               <br />
               history since the beginning ; and I may say 
               <br />
               that when I read what is now appearing in 
               <br />
               the Ontario newspapers, I cannot help ask- 
               <br />
               ing myself what kind of history can be 
               <br />
               taught in the public schools of Ontario? 
               <br />
               Eleven years after this country had been 
               <br />
               acquired by England by treaty, when prac-

               <br />
               French and Catholic, when the English- 
               <br />
               speaking Protestant population consisted a1- 
               <br />
               most wholly of a few traders in the city of 
               <br />
               Quebec, as the House knows, some trouble 
               <br />
               arose in certain English—speaking Protestant 
               <br />
               communities to the south, and some regi- 
               <br />
               ment-s. entirely composed of Anglo-Saxons 
               <br />

               <br />
               The Governor of that day was named Guy

               Carleton—I do not know whether his name 
               <br />
               is ever mentioned in the public school his-

               these regiments were on their way to Que-
