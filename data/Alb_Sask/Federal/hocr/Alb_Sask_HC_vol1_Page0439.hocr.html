               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(sir.</span> Scott) speaks out for the rights of the 
               <br />
               minority. What rights ? The rights they 
               <br />
               secured under the Act of 1875. But these 
               <br />
               are not the rights _the hon gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Scott) is contending for, because he says 
               <br />
               the rights given the minority under the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 have been whittled away by the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritorial government so that with one breath 
               <br />
               he contradicts what he say with another. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman takes the position <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               George Brown was in favour of these rights 
               <br />
               that were to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maintained</span> for all time 
               <br />
               once they were crystallized into law, and he 
               <br />
               says that he takes the same ground as 
               <br />
               George Brown, but as a matter of fact the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman (Mr. Scott) is only contend- 
               <br />
               ing to-day for minority rights which he says 
               <br />
               are far less than were given to the minority 
               <br />
               under the Act of 1875. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               for West As-siniboia further says :
