               ber of this House to inquire and ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               for himself what was the intention of par-

               order to determine what that intention was 
               <br />
               and what the interpretation should be. I 
               <br />
               do not think it should be circumscribed or

               Mr. STOCKTON. I am glad he is taking 
               <br />
               it back because he evidently did not under- 
               <br />
               stand exactly the force of his argument.

               Mr. BELCOURT. I do not take it back.

               What I said was that the majority whether 
               <br />
               Catholic or Protestant, have an absolute 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               as they may think ﬁt.

               hon. gentleman this question? He said 
               <br />

               <br />
               Catholics would be the majority, and my 
               <br />
               hon. friend said distinctly yes. He would 
               <br />
               ignore the Mormons altogether.
