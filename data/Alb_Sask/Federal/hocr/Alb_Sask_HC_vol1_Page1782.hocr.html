               There was in the ordinance of 1892, a 
               <br />
               clause relating to the organization of the 
               <br />
               districts which remained what it had been 
               <br />
               in the previous ordinance; that is that the 
               <br />
               Catholics when they were a local minority 
               <br />
               in any district were still under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span> 
               <br />
               position which was denounced by Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson in 1890 under which the Catho- 
               <br />
               lics could organize a minority separate 
               <br />
               school only when the majority had organized 
               <br />
               a public school. As I stated this afternoon, 
               <br />
               practically speaking this was no detriment 
               <br />
               to them because the majority were always 
               <br />
               ready to organize their schools before the 
               <br />
               minority, but as far as the majority were 
               <br />
               concerned, even under the ordinance of 1892, 
               <br />
               they observed the spirit of the law of 
               <br />
               1875 and allowed the Catholics where they 
               <br />
               had a majority, to organize the majority 
               <br />
               school which was called a Catholic public 
               <br />
               school. So that, we have to come to the 
               <br />
               ordinance of 1901, which I will consider in 
               <br />
               a moment, to ﬁnd out the disposition which 
               <br />
               was spoken of by my right hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister this afternoon. An effort is 
               <br />
               now being made to create the idea that the 
               <br />
               minority in the Northwest Territories had 
               <br />
               accepted the ordinance of 1892. But, it 
               <br />
               must be remembered that the Catholic min- 
               <br />
               ority came before the Privy Council of 
               <br />
               Canada and asked for the disallowance of 
               <br />
               this ordinance. Upon this point I Wish to 
               <br />
               correct the argument which my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron) made in 
               <br />
               reply to the Minister of Inland Revenue 
               <br />
               (Mr. Brodeur). The hon. member for Beau— 
               <br />
               harnois stated that the reason why the or- 
               <br />
               dinance of 1892 was not disallowed was that 
               <br />
               the dispositions of which the Catholics com— 
               <br />
               plained in that ordinance were contained in 
               <br />
               a previous ordinance. My hon. friend, on 
               <br />
               that point, was mistaken. He confounded 
               <br />
               1892 with 1888. When the law of 1888 con- 
               <br />
               taining a special disposition in regard to 
               <br />
               minority schools was brought before Sir 
               <br />
               John Thompson, he argued that it would be 
               <br />
               useless to disallow that ordinance because 
               <br />
               it would simply put into force the ordinance 
               <br />
               of 1886. But, the ordinance of 1892 was 
               <br />
               entirely new legislation. The reasons that 
               <br />
               were given by Sir John Thompson for not 
               <br />
               disallowing the ordinance of 1892 were 
               <br />
               these:

               I think the principal reason was perhaps
