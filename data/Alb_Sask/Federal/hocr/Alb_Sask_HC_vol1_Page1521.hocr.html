               His only objection to this ordinance, which

               point of this kind—his only objection was 
               <br />
               not that which is raised by the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice to—day; his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objection</span> was that 
               <br />
               the ordinance provided for the establishment

               that which he has suggested. That cer- 
               <br />
               tainly was not the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interpretation</span> which 
               <br />
               occurred to the Minister of Justice in the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%because</span> hc himself told us in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span>

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. If my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice had had this argument in 
               <br />
               his mind, if he had held this opinion which 
               <br />
               he has put forward <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> at the time he 
               <br />
               drafted section 16, No. 1. he could not have 
               <br />
               stated in this House. as he did state, that 
               <br />
               section 16, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No,</span> 1 was designed to preserve 
               <br />
               the rights of the minority as they exist in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> These two 
               <br />
               things would be absolutely inconsistent; 
               <br />
               therefore I ain within my right in insisting 
               <br />
               that the interpretation now relied upon is 
               <br />
               not the one that occurred to the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice when he was drafting that clause. 
               <br />
               It did not occur to him for the very good 
               <br />
               reason that an interpretation of this kind 
               <br />
               is one to which the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               would onfy resort when he found no other 
               <br />
               one would meet the case. To say that you 
               <br />
               must interpret this clause in that way is 
               <br />
               going very far indeed, much beyond any 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lcanon</span> ot” legal interpretation with which i 
               <br />
               1am familiar. As I pointed out. you have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?</span> power vested in the legislature of the Terri-
