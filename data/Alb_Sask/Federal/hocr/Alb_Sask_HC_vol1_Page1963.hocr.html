               Mr. LAKE. I quoted the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior's own remarks, which I think were 
               <br />
               pretty absolute in regard to that matter. 
               <br />
               That was the ﬁrst basis of distribution. 
               <br />
               He said: ‘ The basis of the division of the 
               <br />
               constituencies was necessarily the vote cast ; 
               <br />
               it was the latest and most accurate estimate 
               <br />
               we could get.’ In another place he said: 
               <br />
               ‘The deﬁnite division of the constituencies 
               <br />
               is based on the vote actually polled on the 
               <br />
               3rd of November.’ The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan made a very long argument 
               <br />
               in regard to north and south, as he would 
               <br />
               make the division. I do not propose to follow 
               <br />
               him into that question. He makes a very 
               <br />
               arbitrary division when he brings one of his 
               <br />
               northern constituencies apparently down to 
               <br />
               the main line of the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way. I think that will be suﬂicient for any 
               <br />
               one acquainted with that country to esti- 
               <br />
               mate the value of the hon. gentleman’s re- 
               <br />
               marks in that respect. Then, in endeavour- 
               <br />
               ing to prove from the homestead entries 
               <br />
               what a very large population had gone into 
               <br />
               the north, he took an all-round estimate that 
               <br />
               three would be about the proportion of indi- 
               <br />
               viduals who would go with each homestead 
               <br />
               entry. When he endeavoured to apply this 
               <br />
               principle to the absolute statement of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Humboldt (Mr. Adamson) 
               <br />
               as to the population in that constituency, 
               <br />
               he found that it fell short of the estimate 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for Humboldt. 
               <br />
               In order to make up for this deﬁ- 
               <br />
               ciency, he immediately said this was out- 
               <br />
               side of the numbers who had gone into the 
               <br />
               towns which were springing up all along the 
               <br />
               line. Once he departs from that general 
               <br />
               - basis of three to every homestead entry, his 
               <br />
               whole argument falls to the ground; be- 
               <br />
               cause I contend that he cannot compare an 
               <br />

               <br />
               which every bit of vacant land has for years 
               <br />
               been taken up, and into which great num- 
               <br />
               bers of new population have been coming. 
               <br />
               There people who go in to farm, being un- 
               <br />
               able to ﬁnd homesteads, buy lands. Then, 
               <br />
               an immense number of labourers go in to 
               <br />
               work, and business men to carry on business 
               <br />
               in the towns ; and these have no opportunity 
               <br />
               of ﬁnding homesteads. So that it is absurd 
               <br />
               to take for granted generally that for every 
               <br />
               homestead entry in a particular district, 
               <br />
               three people have come into that district. 
               <br />
               Certainly three people would be no fair esti- 
               <br />
               mate in the older districts; probably four 
               <br />
               would be nearer the mark; whereas in the 
               <br />
               newer districts probably every other person 
               <br />
               who comes in makes a homestead entry. As 
               <br />
               I said when the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatche-</span>

               <br />
               I do not think I need go any further. Any

               Mr. LAKE. The hon. gentleman also said 
               <br />
               that I added Humboldt to Batoche. I did 
               <br />
               not add the whole of Humboldt to Batoche. 
               <br />
               The hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman,</span> perhaps unintentionally, 
               <br />
               did not give a fair description of those con- 
               <br />
               stituencies. My hon. friend from Western 
               <br />
               Assiniboia proposed to cut up four con- 
               <br />
               stituencies in Eastern Assiniboia—Moosomin, 
               <br />
               Whitewood, Grenfell and Wolseley--—-and 
               <br />
               make three of them, and he compared that 
               <br />
               proposal with the alternative suggestion I 
               <br />
               made on the spur of the moment, to the dis— 
               <br />
               advantage of that suggestion. The hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman’s proposal would work out on the 
               <br />
               basis of numbers on the voters’ lists as fol- 
               <br />
               lows: Moosomin, 2,282; Broadview, 2,280: 
               <br />
               Wolseley, 1,850. These are ﬁgures which I 
               <br />
               took from the ﬁgures at my disposal. The 
               <br />
               average of these four constituencies, as I 
               <br />
               have stated before, is already above the 
               <br />
               average throughout the Whole province of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan. I suggest that we should 
               <br />
               take the three constituencies around Regina, 
               <br />
               which are considerably below that average,
