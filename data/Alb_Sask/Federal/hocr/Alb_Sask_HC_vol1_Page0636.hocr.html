               sider them Without looking from every point 
               <br />
               of view. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I.</span> have no hesitation in bringing 
               <br />
               these views before the attention of the 
               <br />
               House. I have done it‘because the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition insinuated that Mr. Dal- 
               <br />
               ton McCarthy was ‘established,’ I think he 
               <br />
               put it, by the Prime Minister in Ontario. 
               <br />
               I have shown that Mr. Dalton McCarthy 
               <br />
               held these views long before 1896. I did 
               <br />
               not require to show you, at all events, I 
               <br />
               will not endeavour to do so, for I think 
               <br />
               that this country is now well satisﬁed, that 
               <br />
               the convictions of Mr. Dalton McCarthy 
               <br />
               then were honest convictions, and that the 
               <br />

               <br />
               harnois (Mr. Bergeron) that he acted out 
               <br />
               of pique or disappointment because he was 
               <br />
               not made Minister of Justice, does not re-

               <br />
               in the whole broad Dominion of Canada. 
               <br />
               ‘From what I have said, it seems clear that 
               <br />
               we must approach this question with a 
               <br />
               knowledge of what has gone before. I an— 
               <br />
               nounced myself at. the outset when I spoke 
               <br />
               on the ﬁrst possible occasion as unalter- 
               <br />
               ably opposed to the educational clauses in 
               <br />
               the Bill, and I will go further and say that 
               <br />
               I am unalterably opposed to this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment legislating in any restrictive way in 
               <br />
               regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> matter of education as against 
               <br />
               these provinces which are about to be 
               <br />
               formed. I am prepared to go further than 
               <br />
               that, and I think I can demonstrate that 
               <br />
               it is necessary to put a clause in this 
               <br />
               Bill stating that fact; otherwise you will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that separate schools will be there 
               <br />
               whether you will or not. This is why I ar- 
               <br />
               gue that there must be a deﬁnite announce- 
               <br />
               ment of policy. Now, Sir, many views have 
               <br />
               been propounded in reference to this. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister has made it perfectly plain 
               <br />
               that as a matter of policy and as a matter 
               <br />
               of law, he thinks that this legislation is 
               <br />
               justiﬁed. The leader of the opposition (Mr. 
               <br />
               R. L. Borden), I repeat again, has not said 
               <br />
               anything about the question of policy; he 
               <br />
               does not argue for or against separate 
               <br />
               schools. He says: Let the constitution 
               <br />
               take its course.

               There are no restricting words there. W'e 
               <br />
               are told we may give them practically a 
               <br />
               free charter in such terms and on such 
               <br />
               conditions as we think ﬁt. I cite also the 
               <br />
               opinion of Mr. Dalton McCarthy, expressed, 
               <br />
               it is true, in an off-hand way in the debate 
               <br />
               in 1891. I wisli hon. gentlemen to under- 
               <br />
               stand in this connection that in drawing an 
               <br />
               Act of parliament it is generally expedient 
               <br />
               to follow some precedent and form. As 
               <br />
               Mr. Dalton McCarthy said, the natural pre- 
               <br />
               cedent and form to be followed is in so far 
               <br />
               as practicable the terms of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. But he went further and said 
               <br />
               that in fairness and in justice to these new 
               <br />
               provinces you should do for them what you 
               <br />
               did for the others. Not only do I invoke 
               <br />
               those whom I have cited but I invoke the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of the Northwest Territories.
