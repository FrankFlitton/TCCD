               yet, but Prince Edward Island and British 
               <br />
               Columbia were in this position. They were 
               <br />
               not, like New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, 
               <br />
               coming at once into confederation. It might 
               <br />
               be that before they did come in they would 
               <br />
               pass separate school laws ; and, in that 
               <br />
               case, they would be in the position of On- 
               <br />
               tario and Quebec, and come into the union 
               <br />
               with school laws already in existence. Then, 
               <br />
               in my judgment, the whole of the four 
               <br />
               clauses would apply to them just as they 
               <br />
               apply to Ontario and Quebec. But they 
               <br />
               might come in and afterwards pass such 
               <br />
               laws, and then the subsections 3 and 4 
               <br />
               would apply. So that, as .to all these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces the greatest care was provided for 
               <br />
               every possible interest and for every variety 
               <br />
               of condition as to the province, consistent 
               <br />
               with this principle. that no province was 
               <br />
               bound to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anything</span> with regard to education, 
               <br />
               there was no limitation of the general 
               <br />
               power under section 93, which was not the 
               <br />
               result of its own free action. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In addition, it was contemplated that we 
               <br />
               should take in the Northwest Territories, 
               <br />
               but there is not a word in this section about 
               <br />
               the Territories. However, in my opinion, 
               <br />
               whenever a territory in the Dominion is 
               <br />
               erected into a province, the provisions of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act with regard to 
               <br />
               education, as affecting a province, will im— 
               <br />
               mediately apply according to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumu</span> 
               <br />
               stances. Thus if we establish Alberta as a 
               <br />
               province in July next, subsection (1) cannot 
               <br />
               apply, because the terms of that subsection 
               <br />
               are not applicable to the case, and we have 
               <br />
               no authority to change the British North 
               <br />
               America Act to make it ﬁt any special case. 
               <br />
               The territory was taken into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> union in 
               <br />
               1870. ‘We are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">establishing</span> it as a province 
               <br />
               in 1905. The words of subsection (1) do not 
               <br />
               provide for such a case, and however reason- 
               <br />
               able it might be, we cannot make them ap- 
               <br />
               plicable. But if after attaining its provin- 
               <br />
               cial status, Alberta should pass laws creat- 
               <br />
               ing separate school privileges, it will be 
               <br />
               bound by the general rule, and having thus 
               <br />
               of its own Will granted the privilege, any- 
               <br />

               it should be restricted and bound by what

               <br />
               I look upon it in this way. 
               <br />

               These Territories are in the union; they 
               <br />
               have been in the union since 1870. From 
               <br />
               the moment they entered the union they 
               <br />
               were entitled to the rights and privileges 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act, but they 
               <br />
               had no power to exercise those rights until 
               <br />
               they attained the provincial status. The 
               <br />
               moment they attained that status they would 
               <br />
               be able to act and to bind themselves; but 
               <br />
               until then they were not bound by anything

               <br />
               the Territories were very much in the same

               to it, but he cannot exercise his rights

               with regard to it until he has attained

               own rights, cannot encumber his property, 
               <br />
               but the moment he comes of age he attains 
               <br />
               all power to do with his property as he 
               <br />
               chooses. So it is with a territory. The 
               <br />
               territory until it arrives at maturity, cannot 
               <br />
               speak for itself or act for itself, and it is 
               <br />
               contrary to the very principle of the Act we 
               <br />
               are dealing with to hold it down to what has 
               <br />
               been done without its own consent. Now, 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite wish to treat these 
               <br />
               Territories as bound by subsection 1, that is 
               <br />
               to treat them as a province now entering 
               <br />
               the union, on the lst of July, 1905, with 
               <br />
               laws as to education in force. Well, if sub- 
               <br />
               section 1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">applies,</span> why not say so ? Why not 
               <br />
               apply it and let ussee how far they are 
               <br />
               bound by it ? But could there be any 
               <br />
               stronger evidence of the fact that it is not 
               <br />
               applicable than the care the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice has taken to alter the section to ﬁt it 
               <br />
               to the facts ? If the hon. gentleman thought 
               <br />
               that the subsection 1 really did apply, he 
               <br />
               would only have to say: ‘Subsection 1 ap- 
               <br />
               plies to the province.’ This is a very small 
               <br />
               subsection, though a very powerful one. It 
               <br />
               has only thirty-one words. The hon. gentle-
