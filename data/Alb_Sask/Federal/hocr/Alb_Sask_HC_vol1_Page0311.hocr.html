               they have no mandate to speak on this ques—

               tend to their own business, but I do believe

               that the people of the Northwest Territories

               be treated for interfering with their pro-

               <br />
               dare to appoint a Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               because they know that the people of the

               Northwest would reject him by an over- 
               <br />

               <br />
               here to—night, but in times <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[past</span> he has

               it is his duty to appoint a Minister of the

               ple of the west on this question. That is 
               <br />
               the constitutional way to proceed, but these

               vitally concerns the people whose interest

               he was specially charged to guard. Let 
               <br />
               them appoint their Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               and they can soon ﬁnd out whether we are 
               <br />
               right or they are right. Sir, as a man try-

               <br />
               hon. member for Lincoln and Niagara re- 
               <br />
               minded us, last evening, several times in the 
               <br />
               course of his speech that he comes from 
               <br />
               that part of Canada surnamed the Garden 
               <br />
               of Ontario. It was necessary that he 
               <br />
               should do so, as his violent delivery and 
               <br />
               forcible language might have led us to 
               <br />
               believe that he was not a resident of that 
               <br />
               rich and beautiful country surrounding St. 
               <br />
               Catharines, but rather that his mind had 
               <br />
               been impressed by the sight of Niagara’s 
               <br />
               surging waters and his ears filled with the 
               <br />
