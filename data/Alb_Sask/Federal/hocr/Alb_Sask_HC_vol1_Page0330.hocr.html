               impress the House With the idea that we 
               <br />
               have virtually national schools in the North-

               separate schools in the proper sense of the

               word. I need not read what he said be— 
               <br />
               cause what he said has been repeated in 
               <br />

               try. He spoke about good faith. He said 
               <br />
               that in keeping that national school system 
               <br />
               we have to allow a half hour for religious 
               <br />

               tions towards the minority. That is right. 
               <br />
               I believe that to be the case but in such a

               matter as that I would go a great deal 
               <br />
               farther than the law. In a country like
