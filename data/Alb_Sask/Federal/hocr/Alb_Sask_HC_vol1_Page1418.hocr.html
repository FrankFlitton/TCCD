               Mr. L. G. McCAR’I‘HY. 
               <br />
               gentlemen (Mr. Ingram) is in such a con- 
               <br />
               siderate mood, I wish to call his attention to 
               <br />
               a reference he made to me which I think 
               <br />
               is quite uncalled for. I was only endeavour- 
               <br />
               ing to straighten out what I thought was 
               <br />
               a misunderstanding, and the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               remarked that I had put up some blulÏ. 
               <br />
               I have been here a few years and I do not 
               <br />
               take much notice of what is said in the 
               <br />
               heat of debate, but the hon. 
               <br />
               one remark the tenor of 
               <br />
               exactly catch, but which I would ask him to 
               <br />
               explain. He seemed to say that there was 
               <br />
               some position to be made for me in some 
               <br />
               way, and that I was not to go back to my 
               <br />
               electors. Well, I never heard of that before, 
               <br />
               and as the hon. gentleman is kindly disposed 
               <br />
               now, I wish he would let me know where 
               <br />
               that position is, what it is, and where he 
               <br />
               heard of it. I can only say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> I give an 
               <br />
               absolute and ﬂat denial to the insinuation, 
               <br />
               and I do not think my attitude on this ques- 
               <br />
               tion would have led any one to suppose 
               <br />
               what the hon. gentleman suggests. As to 
               <br />
               the remark made by the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               from Haldimand, that he expected the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North Simcoe .to rilse and protect the 
               <br />
               member for East Grey, it seems to me that 
               <br />
               that is not a very fraternal desire on the 
               <br />
               part of the hon. member for Haldimand, 
               <br />
               and by this time he should have learned 
               <br />
               that the hon. member for East Grey is as 
               <br />
               .well able to take care of himself as any

               Mr. GUNN. Coming from the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario, as I do, I do not think that prov- 
               <br />
               ince, as the largest tax-paying province 
               <br />
               of this Dominion—and I do not say it 
               <br />
               as reﬂecting 011 any other province com- 
               <br />
               posing this great confederatlon—has been 
               <br />
               treated during this debate with the 
               <br />
               courtesy which it is due it. Observations 
               <br />
               have been made in this debate by several 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen that I do not think have 
               <br />
               tended to add to the dignity of this House. 
               <br />
               An observation was made the other evening 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Pictou (Mr. Mac- 
               <br />
               donald) in reference to the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Toronto (Mr. Foster), that he was 
               <br />
               driven from the province of New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick up to Ontario. All I have to say is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that,</span> I hope many more men of the calibre 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               will be driven from the province of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick to the province of Ontario. In 
               <br />
               reference to the hon. gentlemen who repre- 
               <br />
               sent Ontario in this cabinet, I do not believe 
               <br />
               that they reﬂect the sentiment of the prov- 
               <br />
               ince to-day. When the Minister of Customs 
               <br />
               sits in his seat and hears the people of On- 
               <br />
               tario called bigots, as he has done on many 
               <br />
               occasions with a smile on his face, I say it 
               <br />
               comes with ill-grace from a gentleman who 
               <br />
               occupies that position to allow statements 
               <br />
               of that kind to be made by gentlemen repre- 
               <br />
               senting other provinces without correcting 
               <br />
               them. Nor do I think it becomes the Post- 
               <br />
               master General (Sir William Mulock), who 
               <br />
               also represents the province of Ontario in 
               <br />
               the cabinet, to sit in his seat and permit 
               <br />
               statements to be made such as we have 
               <br />
               heard in this debate, reﬂecting on that pro— 
               <br />
               vince. .I am proud to say that I represent 
               <br />
               a constituency in the province of Ontario. 
               <br />
               True. it is a constituency which was carried 
               <br />
               by Liberals for thirty years; but I believe 
               <br />
               I could go back and carry it to-day by a 
               <br />
               larger majorlty than I had last November. 
               <br />
               I live near the city of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">London,</span> and I am not 
               <br />
               going to express any opinion as to what the 
               <br />
               result will be when the government opens 
               <br />
