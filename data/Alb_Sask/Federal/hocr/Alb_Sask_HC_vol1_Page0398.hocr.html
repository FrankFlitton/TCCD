               I will point out to you a little later, Mr.

               of education Mr. Haultain was doing exactly 
               <br />
               what he had been doing in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. For years he had been discus-

               sing this autonomy matter, and yet until 
               <br />
               the time of the general election last October 
               <br />
               you will fail to ﬁnd any reference he ever

               made in any discussion to the subject of

               <br />
               to say that Mr. Haultain and his colleague

               are at least as much to blame as are the

               Now I revert to a matter that I mentioned

               a little while ago,—-I will have something

               to say with regard to Dr. Goggin a little 
               <br />

               treated in these measures. as a territory or

               a province. There has been a good deal of

               discussion coming from the other side of the 
               <br />

               from Mr. Christopher Robinson, K.C., read 
               <br />

               idea was the basis of Mr. Robinson’s opin-
