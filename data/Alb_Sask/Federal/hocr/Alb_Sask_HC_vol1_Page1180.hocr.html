               on this point I do understand the practice. 
               <br />
               I Wish to protest very distinctly against 
               <br />
               the proposition suggested by the hon. the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance. I believe we are 
               <br />
               entitled, after What occurred last night, and 
               <br />
               it was the understanding of the House 
               <br />
               generally at that time, that the votes of 
               <br />
               members should be recorded as reversed 
               <br />
               from the former division. 
               <br />
               of every hon. member to have his vote so 
               <br />
               recorded. It would be unfair and a danger- 
               <br />
               ous practice to depart from that position 
               <br />
               to—day. I know it to be perfectly clear, 
               <br />
               so far as the last four or ﬁve years are 
               <br />
               concerned, that upon an occasion of this 
               <br />
               kind the practice has been such as is asked 
               <br />
               for by my hon. friend from IElgin (Mr. In— 
               <br />
               gram). The hon. Minister of Finance says, 
               <br />
               forsooth, that because of the inconvenience 
               <br />
               it might occasion to the minority of one, 
               <br />
               the hon. member for ‘South Perth (Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">McIntyre),</span> to have the vote recorded in 
               <br />
               that way we should depart from what has 
               <br />
               been the practice of parliament. The prac— 
               <br />
               tice of parliament must be well under- 
               <br />
               stood by the older members of this House. 
               <br />
               I think it is well understood on this point 
               <br />
               by almost every member of this House, 
               <br />
               and I think it is the right of the House 
               <br />
               to have the vote recorded in the way my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from_Eigin has proposed.

               (Mr. Lennox) has entirely misunderstood

               my point. I rather agree as a matter of 
               <br />
               intelligence and convenience with the sug- 
               <br />

               <br />
               as to recording the names the second time. 
               <br />
               î think it would be the better way, whether 
               <br />
               that changes the practice of the House or 
               <br />
               not. But when my hon. friend declares 
               <br />
               that we must have the practice of the 
               <br />
               House and not what the Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance suggests, he is wrong and I am right 
               <br />
               because Mr. Speaker has told us this is 
               <br />
               the practice of the House. The particular 
               <br />
               point that 'I was drawing attention to 
               <br />
               was that if we recorded the names in the 
               <br />
               way suggested you would place my hon.
