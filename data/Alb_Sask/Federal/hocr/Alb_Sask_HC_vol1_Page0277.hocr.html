               testant minority in the province of Quebec, 
               <br />
               you are bound, to make provision for the 
               <br />
               Protestant—who is just as honest in allegi-

               ance to his creed and maintenance of his 
               <br />
               religious belief as is the Catholic—to give to 
               <br />
               him a place where he will not be constantly 
               <br />
               under the watchful and persuasive power 
               <br />
               and teaching of the Catholic Church. I am 
               <br />
               not going outside of the record in saying 
               <br />
               that. When you talk of toleration, I want 
               <br />
               you to think of that. And, now take the 
               <br />
               other case. Here is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a'</span> Protestant child in 
               <br />
               Ontario. He goes to the public school. From 
               <br />
               the time he enters the school at nine o’clock 
               <br />
               in the morning until he goes out of it at 
               <br />
               four o’clock in the afternoon, there is no 
               <br />
               vestige of denominational or clerical teach- 
               <br />
               ing …. inﬂuence. The Catholic child comes 
               <br />
               from the bosom of a Catholic family and 
               <br />
               returns to the bosom of that family at night 
               <br />
               absolutely unassailed and uninfluenced by 
               <br />
               any dogma denominational or clerical which 
               <br />
               is against his belief or against the 
               <br />
               course of his religious training. That is 
               <br />
               to say, in Ontario there are national schools. 
               <br />
               Now. the only ground you have to stand 
               <br />
               upon in objecting to this system in Ontario, 
               <br />
               is that it is the very absence of dogmatical 
               <br />
               teaching that you object to. Then, if you 
               <br />
               object to that, but not to any direct 
               <br />
               teaching or persuasion, that is the limit of 
               <br />
               your plea. But you cannot say that the 
               <br />
               Catholic child is under perverting inﬂuence. 
               <br />
               In the province of Quebec it is absolutely 
               <br />
               different from what it is in Ontario ; do you 
               <br />
               not see that ?—and consequently you must 
               <br />
               not stretch this claim of your toleration too 
               <br />
               far.

               forced by necessity, or by environment, to

               <br />
               would be if these national schools taught

               compact made, and where? The compact 
               <br />
               was made in 1864 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘by</span> the representatives

               of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova

               representatives met together to form 
               <br />
               a confederation. They made what we

               ﬁnd anything in the list of powers given

               to the exclusive control of the Dominion

               of all the representatives ? The dominant 
               <br />
               idea was that education was a local con- 
               <br />

               the essential. ' Now the essential thing 
               <br />
               is that the province should have exclusive 
               <br />
               control of its education. But those wise 
               <br />
               men sitting there in Quebec city said ; Here 
               <br />
               is Ontario and here is Quebec- we have 
               <br />
               separate schools for Catholics in Ontario 
               <br />
               and for Protestants in Quebec, and a sug- 
               <br />
               gestion was made by Mr. McGee to this 
               <br />
               effect : Yes, we will give the exclusive pow- 
               <br />
               er. but we will add this rider to it, ‘save 
               <br />
               and except the minority rights of the two 
               <br />
               Canadas.’ That is all that was done at 
               <br />
               Quebec. That is all to the very letter, and 
               <br />
               that was passed by the legislature of 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada. There were 
               <br />
               present representatives from the - mari- 
               <br />
               time provinces and also the repre-

               sentatives from the two provinces of 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada. That was their 
               <br />
               compact, and that was all of it. But this 
               <br />
               gave no right for anybody to say that, be- 
               <br />
