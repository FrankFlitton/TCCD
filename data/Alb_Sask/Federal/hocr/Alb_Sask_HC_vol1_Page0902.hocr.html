               are to be admitted into the union. I desire 
               <br />
               to say that in one respect I do not approve 
               <br />
               of the mode of providing the means of 
               <br />
               carrying on the government of those new 
               <br />
               provinces. Possibly it is something that the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister could not provide for in any 
               <br />
               other way, and carry out the proposal made 
               <br />
               in the Bill. The fathers of confederation 
               <br />
               were obliged, when confederation was 
               <br />
               brought about, to recoup the old provinces 
               <br />
               for the revenues which they lost by .reason 
               <br />
               of their coming into confederation, the rev- 
               <br />
               enues which they derived from customs and 
               <br />
               excise. In order to do that a per capita al- 
               <br />
               lowance was made to the provinces of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and New Brunswick as well as of On- 
               <br />
               tario and Quebec at the rate of 80 cents a 
               <br />
               head, based on the population of 1861, and 
               <br />
               I believe it remains up to the present time 
               <br />
               at that ﬁgure. However, I think the con- 
               <br />
               ditions are somewhat different now. We 
               <br />
               are not obliged to recoup these new prov- 
               <br />
               inces for any loss of revenue which they 
               <br />
               are deriving from customs or excise duty, 
               <br />
               because practically they have no revenue of 
               <br />
               themselves from that source, and we are 
               <br />
               in a position to deal along an entirely dif- 
               <br />
               ferent line with these new provinces. I say 
               <br />
               I do not approve of the plan that was 
               <br />
               adopted at that time, but I assume the 
               <br />
               fathers of confederation did what they con- 
               <br />
               ceived Was for the best, and did perhaps 
               <br />
               the only possible thing they could do under 
               <br />
               the circumstances. I believe, however, that 
               <br />
