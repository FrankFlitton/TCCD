               as a reason for that amendment that laws

               to that amendment Sir George E. Cartier 
               <br />
               was the one who spoke on behalf of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, and declared that he would bring 
               <br />
               back no law but one which was exactly the 
               <br />
               same as the resolutions.

               Mr. BRODEUR. I think my hon. friend is 
               <br />
               entirely mistaken as to that. He reminds 
               <br />
               me of something which I have read some- 
               <br />
               where, that it was perfectly understood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be.</span> 
               <br />
               tween Mr. Gait. Sir George E. Cartier and 
               <br />
               Sir John A. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Macdonald</span> that when they went 
               <br />
               to England they would see that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protes</span> 
               <br />
               taut minority in Quebec was absolutely pro- 
               <br />
               tected, and would receive special power to 
               <br />
               dispose of their money and control the acL 
               <br />
               ministration of their schools. I think my 
               <br />
               hon. friend must remember that. Therefore 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> was not understood that those Quebec 
               <br />
               resolutions should be embodied in a law 
               <br />
               passed in England in precisely the same 
               <br />
               form as they were passed here. No. there 
               <br />
               was a conference de novo, the delegates of 
               <br />
               each province united together, discussed the 
               <br />
               question and they came to the conclusion, a 
               <br />
               conclusion which cannot be denied. that the 
               <br />
               compact in regard to separate schools should
