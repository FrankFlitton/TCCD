               My right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />
               has vaunted himself a Liberal of the English 
               <br />
               school. If he were a member in authority 
               <br />
               in the British parliament, would he dare to 
               <br />
               propose a scheme for the redistribution of 
               <br />
               seats in any of the divisions of Great Britain 
               <br />
               according to a scheme framed by two parti- 
               <br />
               sans of his own from the extreme corner of 
               <br />
               that division ? Would he venture to force 
               <br />
               that plan, without reasonable argument, 
               <br />
               upon parliament? No English statesman 
               <br />
               has ever tried to do such a thing ; no British 
               <br />
               government has ever been guilty of doing it. 
               <br />
               Whenever there was redistribution of seats 
               <br />
               there, the ﬁrst point was agreement. We do 
               <br />
               not want Liberal or Tory, we do not want 
               <br />
               Whig or Radical, in the redistributions of 
               <br />
               seats—we want a fair redistribution.

               <br />
               friend his own favourite utterances of years 
               <br />
               ago, how he stood on this side and pleaded 
               <br />
               for an equal division of the constituencies. 
               <br />
               He will answer me that he did not get his 
               <br />
               request, so far as he himself viewed it, but 
               <br />
               that does not matter here nor there against 
               <br />
               the tightness of. the argument. It does 
               <br />
               matter, however, to my right hon. friend. 
               <br />
               it shows whether he was in earnest then or 
               <br />
               not. If he was in earnest, he wished that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tu</span> be carried out, not for party advantage, 
               <br />
               but in justice to the electors themselves. If 
               <br />
               he was in earnest then, these great principles 
               <br />
               have not changed since, and we must pre- 
               <br />
               sume him to be equally in earnest now. 
               <br />
               There he stands at the helm of legislation. 
               <br />
               Will he do to—day, as Prime Minister, what 
               <br />
               he held for and argued for years and years

               culation upon which the distribution was

               made. I think he rather missed the point

               bear me out, having heard him read It. The

               basis of the division of the constituencies 
               <br />
               was necessarily, I said, the vote cast. That 
               <br />
               was not the question that he was arguing 
               <br />
               about at all.‘ That question has not yet 
               <br />
               arisen. I said that we took the actual vote 
               <br />
               cast, because it was the latest and most 
               <br />
               accurate information we could get for the 
               <br />
               purpose of drawing a dividing line between 
               <br />
               the constituencies. But that was not, if he 
               <br />
               followed my remarks of yesterday, the sole 
               <br />
               basis, from my point of view, of the gen— 
               <br />
               eral arrangement that was made. He speaks 
               <br />
               of my having introduced the question of the 
               <br />
               dividing line at township 38. I do not know 
               <br />
               whether it is to the purpose in this argu-
