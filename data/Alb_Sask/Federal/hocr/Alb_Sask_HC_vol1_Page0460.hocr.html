               section [)1 defined the powers of the central

               jurisdiction over education was contained

               it was not. There is a special section of the

               British North America Act, section 93, which 
               <br />

               was the intention of the legislators. Well,

               when this Act was passed in the British 
               <br />

               <br />
               Secretary of State to the colonies, made a

               Now is not that the case of the North- 
               <br />

               to do them the justice that was promised 
               <br />
               in the House of Lords. The hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) made a very
