               It will be seen by that section that the

               Wish to make is that, under the terms of

               and yet the only reason which the Prime

               Minister has advanced for withholding from

               the new provinces the ownership and con- 
               <br />
               trol of the public lands is that it might in-

               terfere with the policy of this government 
               <br />
               in reference to immigration. The section to 
               <br />
               which I have referred shows that the rela- 
               <br />
               tions of this parliament to the new pro— 
               <br />
               vinces in the matter of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immigration</span> would 
               <br />
               be precisely the same as its relations to the 
               <br />
               other provinces of the Dominion; and if 
               <br />
               the other provinces are entitled to retain 
               <br />
               those lands. then surely there isno reason 
               <br />
               why this discrimination should be made 
               <br />
               against these provinces in the Northwest. 
               <br />
               It is the same, I submit, with reference to 
               <br />
               immigration as with reference to the ad— 
               <br />
               ministration of the public lands. It is the 
               <br />
               province and the people of the province who 
               <br />
               are chieﬂy interested in immigration. If 
               <br />
               immigration ﬂows into the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. it is the people of those provinces 
               <br />
               who pro-ﬁt by it ; and if there is an unwise 
               <br />
               policy in reference to immigration, it is the 
               <br />
               peopie of the province who suffer. So that 
               <br />
               I submit there is no reason or argument 
               <br />
               whatever in the only pretext which has been 
               <br />
               set up for withholding from the two pro-

               <br />
               would le-nd any colour to that pretext is that 
               <br />
               this government is to control absolutely the
