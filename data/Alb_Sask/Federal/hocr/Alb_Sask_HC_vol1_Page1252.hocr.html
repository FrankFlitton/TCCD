               Dear <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sin—About</span> a month ago we heard what 
               <br />
               we supposed to be a. rumour to the effect that 
               <br />
               the government were ﬁguring on building wire 
               <br />
               fencing along the southern boundary line of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. We at once wrote the 
               <br />
               Department of Agriculture, asking them if there 
               <br />
               was any foundation in the report, and Mr. 
               <br />
               Fisher referred us to the Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior. We at once wrote that department, 
               <br />
               under date March 20th, but did not receive a 
               <br />
               reply until under date of April 8th, a. letter 
               <br />
               signed by Mr. P. G. Keyes, stating that the 
               <br />
               government had already let the contract for 
               <br />
               the wire fence. In the meantime we had got a 
               <br />
               friend to write Mr. R. F. Sutherland for infor- 
               <br />
               mation regarding this matter, but he professed 
               <br />
               ignorance and only just a day or two ago_a 
               <br />
               letter was received from him stating that he 
               <br />
               found the contract had been let to McGregor, 
               <br />
               Banwell, a ﬁrm in this town. _

               We take the liberty of writing you regarding 
               <br />
               this matter, as our two members from the 
               <br />
               Essex riding are friends of the McGregor, 
               <br />
               Banwell people and we have reason to believe 
               <br />
               they were instrumental in putting the deal

               We supposed it the government intended car- 
               <br />
               rying out such a project it would have adver- 
               <br />
               tised for tenders, but it does not seem possible 
               <br />
               that this could have been done, or some of our 
               <br />
               friends would have seen the advertisement, and 
               <br />
               reported it to us even though we, here, heard 
               <br />
               nothing about it direct. We have about 1,000 
               <br />
               agents scattered over every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">civili’zed</span> part of 
               <br />
               Canada, and they are all interested in our busi- 
               <br />
               ness, and it seems as if some one of them would 
               <br />
               have reported <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> advertisement to us.

               We did not go to Ottawa to personally can- 
               <br />
               vass, thinking the government would surely ad- 
               <br />
               vertise and that we would have a chance to 
               <br />
               tender. It would look as‘ if the deal had been 
               <br />
               put through very quietly, as a matter of favour-

               itsm. If we are not asking too much ot you, 
               <br />
               we would consider it a great favour if you 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd out for us if tenders were adver-
