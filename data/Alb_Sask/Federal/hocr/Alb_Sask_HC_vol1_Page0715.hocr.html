               <br />
               not only at the difference of opinion amongst 
               <br />

               opinion which prevails amongst the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the ministry themselves as regards 
               <br />
               this measure. We found the then Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior—I am referring to the time 
               <br />
               when the Bill was ﬁrst introduced—taking 
               <br />
               exception to the educational clauses as they 
               <br />
               then existed, and stating that they did not 
               <br />
               at all meet with his approval. He so strong- 
               <br />
               ly objected to the original educational 
               <br />
               clauses that he found it necessary to place 
               <br />
               his resignation in the hands of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and now we ﬁnd the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               and the Minister of Justice stating that the 
               <br />
               substituted clauses, which we are now dis- 
               <br />
               cussing, mean exactly the same thing as 
               <br />
               the clause in the Bill originally introduced. 
               <br />
               Now, if there is that much difference of 
               <br />
               opinion among the men who constitute the 
               <br />
               government, that much difference of opinion 
               <br />
               among the legal gentlemen on both sides of 
               <br />
               the House, what can the ordinary lay mem- 
               <br />
               ber think of the legislation ? And how can 
               <br />
               he arrive at a decision ? And I think that 
               <br />
               when there is so much difference of opinion, 
               <br />
               both ’with regard to the constitutional

               aspect of the question and our powers of 
               <br />
               dealing with it, it would be the part of 
               <br />
               Wisdom for the government to withdraw this 
               <br />
               legislation for the time being and to get an 
               <br />

               and what we are really attempting to put 
               <br />
               on the statute-book. Now, I believe that 
               <br />
               we have certain powers by the Acts of 
               <br />

               <br />
               tion upon this matter. And I believe that 
               <br />
               we are assuming to do other things that we 
               <br />
               have not the power to do. I think that it is 
               <br />
               well within our powers to deﬁne the boun- 
               <br />
               daries of a new province and to say 
               <br />
               whether in this case there shall be 
               <br />
               one province or two provinces or more. 
               <br />
               I believe we are authorized to exer-

               cise the creative powers necessary to 
               <br />
               bring these new provinces into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">full-ﬂedged.</span> 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy. But when we at- 
               <br />
               tempt to do more than that. when we at- 
               <br />
               tempt to say. that they shall not have. the 
               <br />
               lands, or to say what kind of educational 
               <br />
               system they shall have, I think we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doing;</span> 
               <br />
               that which the Confederation Act never in- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tended</span> we should do. Looking at it from 
               <br />
               that standpoint, I shall have a few words to 
               <br />
               say with regard to the boundaries proposed 
               <br />
               under this Bill, because that, I think. is 
               <br />
               one of the things we are called upon to deal 
               <br />
               with. On looking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘up</span> the geography of that 
               <br />
               country, and from some personal knowledge 
               <br />
               of it, I am unable to agree with the Bill 
               <br />
               now before the House. In my judgment. 
               <br />
               the proper course would have been to extend 
               <br />
               the boundaries of Manitoba westward and 
               <br />
               to create the balance of that territory into 
               <br />
               one province. It is pretty generally ac- 
               <br />
               knowledged, I think, all over this Dominion, 
               <br />
               that we have too many parliaments. too 
               <br />
               much legislative machinery and too great 
               <br />
               cost of administering the affairs of the 
               <br />
               country. I think it is the duty of this House 
               <br />
               to exercise their rights and privileges in 
               <br />
               the direction of lessening the cost to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               people instead of increasing it. Now. what 
               <br />
               is'the reason for creating two new provinces 
               <br />
               and leaving Manitoba a little garden patch 
               <br />
               alongside of them? We have to gather 
               <br />
               these opinions as best we may. One opinion 
               <br />
               expressed is that this has been punishment 
               <br />
               meted out to Manitoba on account of the 
               <br />
               school legislation she passed some years ago. 
               <br />
               I believe that has been denied by the hon. 
               <br />
               First Minister (Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wilfrid</span> Laurier). who 
               <br />
               says he was never inﬂuenced by that con- 
               <br />
               sideration. I believe another reason which 
               <br />
               has been expressed is that our Roman Cath- 
               <br />
               olic friends in the territory bordering on 
               <br />
               Manitoba decline to come into that province 
               <br />
               on account of the school legislation. If 
               <br />
               there has been anything of that kind, there 
               <br />
               is no evidence of it before this House. We 
               <br />
               do not know the objections sent to or the 
               <br />
               representations made to the government 
               <br />
               With respect to that, so we cannot consider 
               <br />
               that a sufﬁcient reason. Another reason 
               <br />
               advanced is that the people of. the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories adjacent to Manitoba object to 
               <br />
               coming in on account of the debt Manitoba 
               <br />
               has contracted. Looking at that in a reason- 
               <br />
               able and practical way, what is there in 
               <br />
               it? Manitoba has assumed some obliga—
