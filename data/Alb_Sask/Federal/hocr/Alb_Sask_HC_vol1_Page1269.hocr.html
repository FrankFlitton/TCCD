               Commander Perry is looking to the

               to what extent these American explorers 
               <br />
               have already explored in our own territory,

               is that a new strong territorial government

               should be maintained after these new pro- 
               <br />

               as reasonable at the present time to add 
               <br />
               the Yukon to British Columbia, Keewatin 
               <br />
               0 Ontario and Ungava to Quebec, as to 
               <br />
               add the district of Athabaska to these new 
               <br />
               provinces? A person looking at the map 
               <br />
               will see that from the northern limit of 
               <br />
               railway construction to the southern bound- 
               <br />
               ary of Athabaska, the distance is about 113 
               <br />
               miles. and further north from Athabaska 
               <br />
               about four hundred miles. The First 
               <br />
               Minister made the remark, when he intro- 
               <br />
               duced the Bill, that he doubted very much 
               <br />
               the advisability of the policy which creat- 
               <br />
               ed Manitoba into a province in the year 
               <br />
               1870, when there were only some 12.000 
               <br />
               people there. It seems to me that the rea- 
               <br />
               sons he assigned for his objection then. 
               <br />
               are equally applicable now. Looking at 
               <br />
               the map it will be found that the Dominion 
               <br />
               government—unless there is some Bill in- 
               <br />
               tended to provide for it—will still continue 
               <br />
               to administer Mackenzie, and the ofﬁcers 
               <br />
               administering that country will have to go 
               <br />
               through <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Athabas'ka.</span> The danger is that 
               <br />
               you will have conﬂicting laws up there. 
               <br />
               Take for example the fur trade which is 
               <br />
               the largest industry in that territory; you 
               <br />
               will perhaps have one law in Saskatchewan, 
               <br />
               another ln Alberta, and possibly a third re- 
               <br />
               gulation by the Dominion government in 
               <br />
               the Territories to the north. The census 
               <br />
               of 1901 tells_us that there were 252 white 
               <br />
               pepole in Athabaska and 262 unspeciﬁed. 
               <br />
               so that in Alberta we will probably be 
               <br />

               <br />
               pulation or in all one hundred and twenty- 
               <br />
               four white people. I have here the ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               postal guide and I ﬁnd there is only one post 
               <br />
               ofﬁce in Athabaska, so that the schedule 
               <br />
               we have before us gives two representa-

               <br />

               <br />
               of 1901, there were in Athabaska : 80 Eng-

               Mr. OLIVER. The arguments advanced 
               <br />
               by the hon. member Would seem to be good 
               <br />
               arguments against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> being any division 
               <br />
               at all, but I do not see that they apply 
               <br />
               against the divisions that have already been 
               <br />
               made. If there is to be a division at all. 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has stated nothing 
               <br />
               against this particular division. He has ob- 
               <br />
               jected to a division of the ranching country 
               <br />
               into two parts on the ground that the brands 
               <br />
               on one side of the line might become mixed 
               <br />
               with the brands on the other side. That is 
               <br />
               an argument against there being a line at 
               <br />
