               friend is aware that in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preparation</span> of 
               <br />
               this Bill we took the position that the 
               <br />
               government of the new provinces was not 
               <br />
               entitled of right to the lands. We took the 
               <br />
               position that the lands fairly belonged to 
               <br />
               the Dominion. At the same time we had 
               <br />
               to take into consideration the fact that 
               <br />
               the lands which were given to the older 
               <br />
               provinces, not to Manitoba, were to the… 
               <br />
               a valuable asset which enabled them to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,carry</span> on their business. We thought there— 
               <br />
               fore, since we retailed the lands, we should 
               <br />
               do as was done in Manitoba, we should 
               <br />
               give something in money in lieu of the 
               <br />
               lands. But my hon. friend knows better 
               <br />
               than I do, because he was long connected 
               <br />
               with the government which dealt with 
               <br />
               Manitoba, that Manitoba Was not dealt wit-h 
               <br />
               upon any rule which is known, at least, to 
               <br />
               the average mind. From time to time 
               <br />
               Manitoba was given some advantage, but 
               <br />
               they were always given in the absence of 
               <br />
               any principle which could be properly ex-

               <br />
               never been understood. When we came to

               <br />
               to ﬁnd a basis for a calculation as to the 
               <br />
               value of the lands. As to the number of 
               <br />
               acres, we have had calculations made more

               calculation. With regard to the price of

               these lands, 1 think it is not possible to

               ascertain a fair average value by what

               been realized by the disposal of school

               lands by auction. or what has been

               realized by the Hudson Bay Company

               for their lands. The Hudson Bay Com-

               pany chose its own time to sell its lands, 
               <br />
               at a time when it thought the best price 
               <br />
               could be obtained. The school lands are all 
               <br />
               disposed of at auction, they are not dis—

               at auction always with a View of realizing 
               <br />
               the best possible price. Thon with regard 
               <br />
               to lands disposed of by the railway com- 
               <br />
               pany, we know that they always dispose 
               <br />
               of them with a view of getting the best 
               <br />

               <br />
               have increased in value by railway facil- 
               <br />

               That would be no fair basis of compari—

               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway Company 
               <br />

               right, the government redeemed 6,000,000 
               <br />
               acres of their land at a price, I think, of 
               <br />
               $1.50.

               Sir WILFRID <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LAURVIER.</span> That was the 
               <br />
               basis of our calculation. There were some 
               <br />
               6,000,000 odd acres of land disposed of by 
               <br />
               the company to the government, and the 
               <br />
               price realized I think was $1.50 an acre. 
               <br />
               It is possible that to-day the lands in ques- 
               <br />
               tion might be sold for a little higher, or 
               <br />
               possibly they would not bring as much, 
               <br />
               But since that time we have undertaken 
               <br />
               national obligations, and we count upon 
               <br />
               this land as an asset to help us meet those 
               <br />
               obligations. I do not pretend to say that 
               <br />
               we could dispose of all the lands we have 
               <br />
               to-day at $1.50, I think we ought to realize 
               <br />
               more. The government will not dispose Of 
               <br />
               them immediately. they will be sold from 
               <br />
               time to time as the country develops, and 
               <br />
               I daresay they will bring to the govern- 
               <br />
               ment enough reVenue to enable us to meet 
               <br />
               the liabilities we have undertaken. But,
