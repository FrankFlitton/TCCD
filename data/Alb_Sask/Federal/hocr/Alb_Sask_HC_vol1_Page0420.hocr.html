               ious reasons why that does not always take 
               <br />
               place. But the general grotlnd I think is a 
               <br />
               fair ground. It undoubtedly is the right of 
               <br />
               a province to create trust companies, and it 
               <br />
               therefore has power to make legislation. 
               <br />
               In the province of Ontario you have ﬁve 
               <br />
               or six trust companies which have put their 
               <br />
               money into that business, and they have 
               <br />
               been kept down to very rigid conditions, as 
               <br />
               any person knows who is acquainted with 
               <br />
               these matters in that province. Under those 
               <br />
               conditions and with those powers these com- 
               <br />
               panies have gone on and done business. 
               <br />
               Now people come to this parliament and ask 
               <br />
               for powers as a trust company and they ask 
               <br />
               for powers greater than are granted by the 
               <br />
               province. they ask for powers which .are 
               <br />
               to be amalgamated with it and used con— 
               <br />
               jointly, which are not allowedat all by 
               <br />
               the province, and are not allowed because 
               <br />
               of prudential considerations. Although we 
               <br />
               think a lot of our dignity and our super- 
               <br />
               ior powers, we ought to be very careful in 
               <br />
               giving these companies rights which are 
               <br />
               greater than the rights enjoyed by the Com—

               )Ir. FIELDING. My hon. friend will see 
               <br />
               that the laws of the various provinces might 
               <br />
               not be uniform. If we were to undertake 
               <br />
               to adapt ourselves to the laws of each pro- 
               <br />
               vince, we might have difﬁculty. Let us see 
               <br />
               that we do not grant powers which in them- 
               <br />
               selves are unreasonable. But I do not think 
               <br />
               we can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afford</span> to be guided by what takes 
               <br />
               place in the provinces. We must be res- 
               <br />
               ponsible for our legislation. So far as civil 
               <br />
               rights are concerned, nothing we can do here 
               <br />
               can create any civil right. which is exclu- 
               <br />
               sively within the jurisdiction of a province 
               <br />
               and we could not, if we tried to. legislate 
               <br />
               with regard to civil rights. For instance, 
               <br />
               to dispose of trust funds is the business of 
               <br />
               a province, and we do not intend to invade 
               <br />
               that. and could not if we tried.

               Mr. BRODEUR. I may say that trust 
               <br />
               corporations which exist in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">applying</span> to the legislature of 
               <br />
               Quebec for charters to do business in that 
               <br />
               province. One of the most important com-_ 
               <br />
               panies in Toronto came last year to get an 
               <br />
               Act of incorporation from Quebec. and re- 
               <br />
               quested speciﬁcally the rights which were 
               <br />
               denied by the general law. My impression, 
               <br />
               from reading the law. would be that we 
               <br />
               might create a corporation here. but we can- 
               <br />
               not give to that corporation civil powers 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> are denied to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">corporations</span> in the dif- 
               <br />
               ferent provinces. It would be no use for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘us</span> 
               <br />
               to create corporations giving more powers 
               <br />
               than are permitted by the provincial law. It 
               <br />
               would be perhaps just as well for them to 
               <br />
               go to the provincial legislatures to get their 
               <br />

               <br />
               ance with the suggestion which has been 
               <br />
               made. will remain in committee. I want 
               <br />
               to add a clause. This Bill is in part an in- 
               <br />
               surance Bill and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">part</span> a trust company 
               <br />
               Bill. As far as it may be an insurance 
               <br />
               Bill, it comes under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(provisions</span> of the 
               <br />
               general Act. which provides that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com'</span> 
               <br />
               pany shall be organized and commence busi- . 
               <br />
               ness within two years or the charter fails. 
               <br />
               But. as respects the trust company part of 
               <br />
               the Bill, there is no such provision. In 
               <br />
               order to make it clear that the same provi— 
               <br />
               sion shall apply in either case, I propose to- 
               <br />
               add the following clause: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
