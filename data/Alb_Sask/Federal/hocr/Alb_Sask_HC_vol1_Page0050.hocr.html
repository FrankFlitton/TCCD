               <br />
               thinking, and we will prepare a clause

               was submitted to him. It was open to him to 
               <br />
               discuss it; but after he had taken his posi-

               nothing to complain of on his part. The

               Now, this is all I have to say on this

               question at the present time. My hon. friend

               has again pressed me for information on 
               <br />

               It will be the duty of the government, in 
               <br />
               due time, to give to my hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It.</span> L. Borden) and to the House every in-

               formation that is necessary for the discus- 
               <br />
               sion of the Bill. My hon. friend has asked 
               <br />
               me if we contemplate amendments to the 
               <br />
               Bill. I do not know, Sir, that any wrong 
               <br />
               will be done to anybody if we are contem- 
               <br />
               plating amendments. Would it be the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               time that a government when introducing a 
               <br />
               measure should endeavour to see Whether 
               <br />
               or not it was possible to satisfy all sec- 
               <br />
               tions of the country in regard to that mea- 
               <br />
               sure ? In view of the petitions that have 
               <br />
               been presented to the House, some coming 
               <br />
               from one quarter and other petitions coming 
               <br />
               from another side, would it be wrong if the 
               <br />
               government would say : We will reconsider 
               <br />
               our position and see whether or not we can 
               <br />
               satisfy this country ? I am sorry my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span> 
               <br />
               friend has treated the subject a little more 
               <br />
               lightly than I would have expected him to 
               <br />
               do on an occasion of this kind. What is 
               <br />
               the spectacle we have to-day? We have 
               <br />
               the spectacle of numerous petitions being 
               <br />
               presented asking that the educational 
               <br />
               clauses should be Withdrawn from the Bill 
               <br />
               and numerous other petitions asking that 
               <br />
               the Bill should be passed as it is. This is 
               <br />
               a very delicate subject. It is not the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               time this question of education has come 
               <br />
               before the House. It is not the ﬁrst time 
               <br />
               it has engaged the attention of the country 
               <br />
               and upon every occasion that it has come 
               <br />
               before the House, in 1872-73 with regard to 
               <br />

               tion ? Sir, I claim that I have some sense

               of the responsibility that attaches to the 
               <br />
               government and to those who are entrusted 
               <br />
               with the administration of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> of 
               <br />
               the country, and, in a question of this kind 
               <br />
               especially, whenever such a matter is 
               <br />
               brought up the government is faced with a 
               <br />
               difficulty which perhaps it has not antici- 
               <br />
               parted and ﬁnding difﬁculties which no man 
               <br />
               could have foreseen, viewing the virulence 
               <br />
               with which passions are roused, per— 
               <br />
               haps, Sir, there is some reason why a gov- 
               <br />
               ernment should be slow to take any action 
               <br />
               and should hesitate in coming to a ﬁnal 
               <br />
               decision. I have spoken of the virulence ot 
               <br />
               the passions exhibited. I do not say 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂensively;</span> I know that would be 
               <br />
               greatly mistaken if I were to say anything 
               <br />
               offensively on this point. I would not do 
               <br />
               so; I know that public passions, strong 
               <br />
               passions, are not always ignoble; some- 
               <br />
               times on the contrary, they are only the 
               <br />
               exaggeration of a noble sentiment, but even 
               <br />
               the exaggeration of a noble sentiment may 
               <br />
               lead to outbursts of public passion. I say 
               <br />
               to my hon. friend, if he wants to know, 
               <br />
               that this subject gives me a great deal to 
               <br />
               think about, and if it be possible to amend 
               <br />
               this Bill the government need not fear to 
               <br />
               consider the matter. More than this I Will 
               <br />
               not say at present. This I will say, that 
               <br />
               we are thinking upon these matters, that it 
               <br />
               is our duty todo so and the result of our
