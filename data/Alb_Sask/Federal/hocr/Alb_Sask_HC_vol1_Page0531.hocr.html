               <br />

               actually a railway leased to or owned 
               <br />
               by the government. What special advan- 
               <br />
               tage is there in an arrangement of this kind 
               <br />

               of the government before entering upon 
               <br />
               this policy—that reason was, that if the In-

               <br />
               army of canvassers to gather trafﬁc in the 
               <br />
               west. The arrangement which the Minister 
               <br />
               of Railways now proposes is, to operate the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway from Parry Sound 
               <br />
               to Halifax in competition with the Grand 
               <br />
               Trunk Railway. The GrandTrunk Railway 
               <br />
               will have its connections in the west and it 
               <br />
               will have a great many ofﬁcials canvassing 
               <br />
               for trafﬁc for that railway, a work into 
               <br />
               which the Prime Minister thought the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment could not very well' enter. What 
               <br />
               expectation has the government of any con- 
               <br />
               siderable trafﬁc coming over this line if it 
               <br />
               does not send into the west men to canvass
