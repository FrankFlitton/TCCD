               <br />
               now sixty-ﬁve years ago, the ﬁrst squabble 
               <br />
               over separate schools began in Ontario. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst law was introduced on or about 
               <br />
               the year 1840, and I Will read so that hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen may see what has happened :

               The ﬁrst attempt to frame an educational 
               <br />
               Bill was made in 1840, when the matter was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">left</span> to a committee of the House composed of 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen members from Lower Canada and eight 
               <br />
               from Upper Canada. The Bill this committee 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">submitted</span> was a crude affair, but in it the 
               <br />
               principle of separate schools was imbedded. 
               <br />
               Provision was made that ' any person, by mere— 
               <br />
               ly dissenting from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regulations,</span> arrange-

               <br />
               commissioners could establish separate schools.’ 
               <br />
               The introduction of this principle provoked a 
               <br />
               prolonged and bitter controversy lasting till 
               <br />
               1863. .

               “From <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1840</span> to 1863, there was a bitter 
               <br />
               controversy over the introduction of separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools into the province of Ontario, 
               <br />
               a struggle lasting for twenty-three years. 
               <br />
               I point out to these gentlemen opposite that 
               <br />
               from the' ﬁrst introduction of separate 
               <br />
               schools in Ontario, year after year there 
               <br />
               has been introduced into the legislature 
               <br />
               various amendments with small beginnings 
               <br />
               until in the year of our Lord 1905, that 
               <br />
               system is unrivalled in any country in the 
               <br />
               world. So far as I know no country has 
               <br />
               a system equal to that which at present 
               <br />
               prevails in Ontario and Quebec. As I said 
               <br />
               before, these separate schools are here and 
               <br />
               they are here to stay. We are willing they 
               <br />
               shall stay, but at the same time we point 
               <br />
               out to our brethren in the Northwest what 
               <br />
               the term separate school means, so that 
               <br />
               they may learn from past: experience What 
               <br />
               is likely to happen. If hon. gentlemen op- 
               <br />
               posite think it means only half an hour at 
               <br />
               the close of the day they Will soon wake up 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">find</span> out their error. The history of separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools shows that the system <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> from 
               <br />
               losing its grip has been making a steadfast 
               <br />
               onward advance. I commend to hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite the conditions of the present 
               <br />
               day in the old land of. France. I am ”sorry 
               <br />
               to say that not many of our French com- 
               <br />
               patriots are now in the chamber, but I have 
               <br />
               remarked that although these hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men have held up to our eyes the system in 
               <br />
               vogue in the British Islands, they have not 
               <br />
               one word of commendation'for the school 
               <br />
               system of France. As though it were the 
               <br />
               irony of fate, while we are discussing this 
               <br />
               question in this House, a similar discus- 
               <br />
               sion is going on in France, but in an op— 
               <br />
               posite direction. There, the system of un- 
               <br />
               ion between church and state which has been 
               <br />
               in existence for ﬁve centuries is now be- 
               <br />
               ing destroyed; religious orders are being 
               <br />
               driven out of the old land of France, and 
               <br />
               where will they ﬁnd a resting place '? We 
               <br />
               welcome them to Canada, but we welcome

               in the old countries of Europe ? I know it 
               <br />
               may be said that I am speaking from a 
               <br />
               nui-row point of view. I am ready to have 
               <br />
               that said now. I believe I have had as 
               <br />
               great experience of life as the average man 
               <br />
               of my age. I have had the opportunity of 
               <br />
               travelling in many lands; I have visited 
               <br />
               many countries in my time ; I have visited 
               <br />
               many countries the language of which I did 
               <br />
               not know and the religion of which was 
               <br />
               strange to me. I have had the privilege, Mr.

               oi" the men who sit around this chamber. I

               have had the privilege—yes, I say privilege, 
               <br />
               advisedly———of worshipping in the Roman Ga- 
               <br />
               tholic Church. I have visited purely Ro- 
               <br />
               man Catholic countries, where I have heard 
               <br />
               the ceremonies of the Roman Catholic re- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ligion</span> gone through in the churches, and I 
               <br />
               have been inspired with the fervour of the 
               <br />
               worshippers, their religious zeal, and the 
               <br />
               reverence that they show to their Maker 
               <br />
               in their own way. I have been inspired by 
               <br />
               that worship. I have seen it in such coun— _ 
               <br />
               tries as Mexico, Cuba, Italy, France, Switz- 
               <br />
               erland. I have witnessed that worship in 
               <br />
               all these countries and have said to myself : 
               <br />
               These brethren—I am ready to call them so 
               <br />
               —can teach me a lesson; they have more 
               <br />
               ferveur and more religious zeal than I ever 
               <br />
               aspire to have. I regret to say that many 
               <br />
               of our Protestant bodies are far behind the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic Church in this respect— 
               <br />
               that they have not the same reverence and 
               <br />
               zeal, and are not so constantly on the watch 
               <br />
               tower. While this is to be regretted, I 
               <br />
               cannot for one, see why we should treat one 
               <br />
               religious body with any more tolerance 
               <br />
               or favour than we treat another religious 
               <br />
               body. I am ready that the religious body 
               <br />
               with which I am connected shall receive 
               <br />
               common treatment with all the other relig- 
               <br />
               ious bodies in this country. But I do sub- 
               <br />
               mit that in a country with such a variety 
               <br />
               of population, ,such a variety of religions, 
               <br />
               and such a variety of creeds as We have, 
               <br />
               we cannot afford to set up all these divi- 
               <br />
               sions, and to say that all these may pros- 
               <br />
               per and thrive and have their separate 
               <br />
               schools. We cannot do that, and therefore 
               <br />
               we must devise a system that will make 
               <br />
               them all good citizens, true citizens, and 
               <br />
               citizens of one common country and one
