               of the most outrageous Bills ever sub- 
               <br />

               <br />
               lent speech against -the Bill claiming that 
               <br />
               the building of this road would cost the 
               <br />
               Dominion several hundred millions of 
               <br />
               money. The leader of the opposition (Mr. 
               <br />
               R. L. Borden) ﬁercely denounced this Bill

               not only in this House but throughout the 
               <br />

               nearly every supporter of his in the late

               the people: When we pay nine-tenths of

               shall have no question. as to the Grand

               <br />
               for many years to come. And to-day, Sir, 
               <br />
               we have before us the Bill and the amend- 
               <br />
               ment. The amendment, as I say, proposes 
               <br />
               and will, I believe, establish for all time 
               <br />
               to come. a system of separate schools in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories that the people 
               <br />
               do not want and that they abolished four- 
               <br />
               teen years ago. The Bill proposes to legal- 
               <br />
               ize a system that the people have estab- 
               <br />
               lished themselves, that they have approved 
               <br />
               of. that works well, that every man who 
               <br />
               knows of it says is an admirable system; 
               <br />
               and also to the people the power to change 
               <br />
               that system from time“ to time as the cir-

               I was very much pleased with the address 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for Centre York (Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell). I listened to him very patiently, 
               <br />
               but failed to ﬁnd in his arguments very 
               <br />
               much to reply to. The hon. gentleman has 
               <br />
               given us his own interpretation of the Bill 
               <br />
               that has been introduced to this House. 
               <br />
               It seems strange that the Toronto ‘Globe’ 
               <br />
               the independent newspapers, the ministers 
               <br />
               of the various churches throughout the 
               <br />
               country, all give a different interpretation 
               <br />
               of this Act from the interpretation given 
               <br />
               by the hon. gentleman. It seems that he 
               <br />
               alone is an authority on this question, that 
               <br />
               he is in a better position to tell us what 
               <br />
               this Act really means than are the eminent 
               <br />
               legal gentlemen throughout this country. 
               <br />
               He told us that he was giving us something 
               <br />
               that was original. Well, Sir, in order that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman may know something 
               <br />
               that probably is a little more original than 
               <br />
               he has told us, something that will throw 
               <br />
               a little light upon the feeling that exists 
               <br />
               throughout this country to-day, particu- 
               <br />
               larly in Ontario and the Northwest Terri-

               tories, I have pleasure in telling the hon.

               gentleman that the county of Mountain out 
               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Greenway, that gave him at the last

               general election four hundred majority, 
               <br />

               majority of over two hundred. That, Sir, 
               <br />
               notwithstanding the fact that the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the other side ot“ the House, 
               <br />
               and especially the hon. member for Centre 
               <br />
               York (Mr. Campbell) have told us that there 
               <br />
               was no feeling in this country against these 
               <br />
               Autonomy Bills. I think that election tells 
               <br />
               us more plainly than any words that I can 
               <br />
               use, that there is a strong feeling against 
               <br />
               this government, and I can imagine that 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite on hearing that 
               <br />
