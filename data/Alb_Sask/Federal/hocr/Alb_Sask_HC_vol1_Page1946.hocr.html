               <br />

               <br />
               thus saved to the 800 line. While I am

               strongly in favour of a constituency being

               stituency being formed in that way. I held 
               <br />
               that these four constituencies on the main 
               <br />

               <br />
               objection, and it is that these four seats 
               <br />
               have a larger average voting population than
