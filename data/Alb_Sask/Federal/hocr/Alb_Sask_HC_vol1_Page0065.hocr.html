               He is asking when the great ﬁscal policy 
               <br />
               was introduced into this country by the 
               <br />
               great party which I have no hesitation in 
               <br />
               saying has introduced nearly all the great 
               <br />
               policies of this Dominion. I admit that 
               <br />
               these policies have been followed by our 
               <br />
               friends on the other side. They may not 
               <br />
               be very good introducers of policies, but 
               <br />
               they are ﬁrst—class mimics. I am very 
               <br />
               thankful that in their ﬁscal policy they have 
               <br />
               come so near to adopting those rules and
