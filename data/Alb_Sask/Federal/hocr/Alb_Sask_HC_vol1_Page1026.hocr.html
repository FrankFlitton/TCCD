               excellent system, it would be a bad thing

               control. Premier Haultain himself has

               which he says he never would do if left 
               <br />
               to himself. In that respect he reminds 
               <br />
               me of the small boy who would not let 
               <br />
               the other little fellow play in his back yard, 
               <br />
               and refused to allow him the privilege of 
               <br />
               hollering down the empty water barrel. 
               <br />
               And for what reason forsooth? Simply 
               <br />
               because it was his barrel, and he insisted 
               <br />
               on doing all the hollering himself. If that

               <br />
               i have never known of such a case in all

               There is one feature, however, of the 
               <br />
               agitation which is extremely regrettable 
               <br />
               and that is the extremely inﬂammatory 
               <br />
               course which has been adopted by certain 
               <br />

               <br />

               You may give it for what it is worth, but 
               <br />
               my individual opinion is that Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier was informed immediately by Mon- 
               <br />
               seigneur Sbarrettl of the failure of his advances, 
               <br />
               and that the invitation to the other provinces 
               <br />
               to put forward their claims was made expressly 
               <br />
               in Sir Wilfrid’s speech on the following day 
               <br />
               from personal motives of pique, because the 
               <br />
               Manitoba. delegates had not listened'to reason.
