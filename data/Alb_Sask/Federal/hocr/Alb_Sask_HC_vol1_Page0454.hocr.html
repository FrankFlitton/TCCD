               when we are making a new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitution],</span> 
               <br />
               the Catholics—I suppose it is the Catholics 
               <br />
               who are asking for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[this</span> now—come to us 
               <br />
               with a statute of this parliament and say : 
               <br />
               This is an Act which you put upon the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statute-books</span> by which our rights to separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools were granted in 1875, thirty 
               <br />
               years ago; this has been revised and re— 
               <br />
               viewed twenty times since and it has al— 
               <br />
               ways <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> looked upon as a proper thing 
               <br />
               to put in that law, and now we ask you to 
               <br />
               recognize it as fully and as completely as 
               <br />
               a similar right was recognized in 1867. when 
               <br />
               the minorities of Quebec and of Ontario 
               <br />
               came to the fathers of confederation looking 
               <br />
               for the protection of their rights. I ask 
               <br />
               you, Mr. Speaker. if. it would be fair or just 
               <br />
               to say to people who have lived for thirty 
               <br />
               years under a statute which we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given:</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[them</span> affording <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ithem</span> protection, an Act 
               <br />
               passed in 1875. to now remove the protec- 
               <br />
               tion which they have enjoyed constitution~ 
               <br />
               ally for thirty years. Some one was asked 
               <br />
