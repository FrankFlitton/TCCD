               total of 15.005 names on the lists north ot“

               <br />
               on the list. The plan of the leader of the

               opposition would give to the north an ave- 
               <br />
               rage of 120 votes less per seat than in the 
               <br />
               south. That is proof positive that we are 
               <br />
               simply <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggesting</span> a plan that would give 
               <br />
               fair-play <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[both</span> to the north and to the south. 
               <br />
               Now. the government proposes to give seven 
               <br />
               seats in the extreme north each of which 
               <br />
               has an average of 892 names on the voters' 
               <br />
               lists. while they put seven seats in the 
               <br />
               south each of which has an average of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1.540</span> names on the list. As against that 
               <br />
               the leader of the o-pposition’s plan is to 
               <br />
               have 12 seats south of township <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">34</span> with an 
               <br />
               average of 1,274 and 13 seats north of town- 
               <br />
               ship <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">34</span> with an average of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1.154</span> on the list. 
               <br />
               These ﬁgures ought to show the justice of 
               <br />
               our plan to any independent man. I have 
               <br />
               emleavoured to make these calculations as 
               <br />
               carefully as possible from the ﬁgures given 
               <br />
               by the government, and I have shown that 
               <br />
               the plan proposed by the leader of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition can in no sense be said to favour the 
               <br />
               south, but on the contrary it is partial to 
               <br />
               the north to a slight extent because it 
               <br />
               gives one seat to Athabaska with an ex- 
               <br />
               ceedingly small population.

               the Northwest Territories were given repre-

               not. The Territories got four members in

               Mr. PERLEY. That is not the main ques-

               <br />
               and make fair divisions. I am told there 
               <br />
               is a dispute as to whether the capital shall 
               <br />
               be north or south——

               <br />
               there be between north and south: is not

               that the whole question ?

               Mr. PERLEY. That may be so. but 
               <br />
               that is not a question which we should take . 
               <br />
               sides on. If the province of Alberta had 
               <br />
               her own legislature and she chose to divide 
               <br />
               and give undue proportion to the northern 
               <br />
               area that is her own business exactly as it 
               <br />
               was our business, when in distributing the 
               <br />
               constituencies for the Dominion we chose 
               <br />
               to give the Northwest an undue proportion.
