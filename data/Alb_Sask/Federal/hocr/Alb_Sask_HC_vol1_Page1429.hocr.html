               my own way, that we may see whether my

               The Northwest Territories Act is a Do—

               minion Act, and, as such, it can only be 
               <br />
               amended by us. If it is allowed to con- 
               <br />
               tinue in operation it will form part of our

               time, to incorporate the provisions of that 
               <br />
               Act, so far as they are not inconsistent 
               <br />
               with the provisions of this Act, into this

               the danger of general words of that charac-

               new law that you do not intend to include 
               <br />
               such as I suggested with regard to section 
               <br />
               5. Then there was the point which was 
               <br />
               mentioned \by my hon. friend from South 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. Lennox), which had occurred 
               <br />
               to me before he spoke. The Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories Act deals with a number of 
               <br />
               matters, which, under the constitution of 
               <br />
               the new provinces, are not to be the sub- 
               <br />
               ject of provincial legislation. When you 
               <br />
               legislate by reference to the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories Act you may embody something 
               <br />
               in the constitution of the new provinces 
               <br />
               which cannot be dealt with afterwards, 
               <br />
               either by the provincial legislature or by 
               <br />
               this parliament—the provincial legislature 
               <br />
               being una-ble to deal with it because the 
               <br />
               subject is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">within</span> the sphere of the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial authority, and this parliament not 
               <br />
               - being able to deal with it, because, under

               Well, assuming that we have the power 
               <br />
               under the British North America Act of 
               <br />
               1871, which the Minister of Justice suggests 
               <br />

               be the case, upon an examination of the

               <br />
               made of repeal by this parliament, can you 
               <br />
               really reserve to this parliament the right 
               <br />
               to repeal, having regard to the fact that 
               <br />
               under the Act of 1871 you cannot alter this 
               <br />
