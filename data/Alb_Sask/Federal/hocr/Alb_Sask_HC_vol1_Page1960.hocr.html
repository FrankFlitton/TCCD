               roughly speaking, 30,000 in the north and 
               <br />
               18,000 in the south. If that is a fair basis 
               <br />
               -—and I submit it is a fair basis—then the 
               <br />
               fairest division of the ﬁve new seats we 
               <br />
               can make is to give to those ten northern 
               <br />
               seats, in which there is an increase of 30,- 
               <br />
               000 homestead entries, three seats, and to 
               <br />
               the southern group, in which there is an in- 
               <br />
               crease of 18,000 homestead entries, two 
               <br />
               seats. This is still giving an advantage to 
               <br />
               the south. There cannot be any dispute as 
               <br />
               to these ﬁgures, because they are ofﬁcial, and 
               <br />
               there is a reason why the increased popula- 
               <br />
               tion should appear in the north. Those 
               <br />
               who are familiar with the country unhesi- 
               <br />
               tatingly say that the increase of population 
               <br />
               during the last three or four years has been 
               <br />
               largely in the north, and the reason, as was 
               <br />
               pointed out by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'hon.</span> member for West As- 
               <br />
               siniboia (Mr. Scott), is that in the north two 
               <br />
               lines of railway have practically been built 
               <br />
               —the main line of the Canadian Northern 
               <br />
               running right across the province, and the 
               <br />
               northern branch of the Canadian Northern 
               <br />
               from Erwood, which is now built up to 
               <br />
               within a few miles of Prince Albert. Then, 
               <br />
               too, the Grand Trunk Paciﬁc line has been 
               <br />
               surveyed there, and every one knows that 
               <br />
               a great number of settlers have gone in 
               <br />
               along that survey and taken up homesteads. 
               <br />
               As a matter of fact, we know that the north- 
               <br />
               ern country has progressed much more 
               <br />
               rapidly than the south. We know that from 
               <br />
               the homestead entries, which demonstrate be- 
               <br />
               yond question the fact that the settlement in 
               <br />
               the north is proceeding much more rapidly 
               <br />
               than in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">south.</span> Therefore, taking the home- 
               <br />
               stead entries as a basis, 30,000 as against 
               <br />
               18,000, it seems to me that no fairer distri- 
               <br />
               bution of the additional representation could 
               <br />
               be made than to give three to the north 
               <br />
               and two to the south. I have estimated the 
               <br />
               population upon these ﬁgures, and have 
               <br />
               taken the same basis as the hon. member 
               <br />
               for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott); for each 
               <br />
               homestead entry I have allowed three per— 
               <br />
               sons, and I have added to that the census 
               <br />
               population of 1901. I ﬁnd, according to 
               <br />
               that calculation, in the ten southern districts 
               <br />
               the present estimated population is 92,254, 
               <br />
               while in the ten northern districts the esti- 
               <br />
               mated population is 141,646. These ﬁgures 
               <br />
               not only justify the distribution of three new 
               <br />
               seats in the north as against two in the 
               <br />
               south, but taking into consideration its 
               <br />
               prospective increase of population, it cer- 
               <br />
               tainly would justify four in the north and 
               <br />
               one in the south, as in the government’s

               people in the north, and yet my hon. friend 
               <br />
               says tha-t the north is being over-represented, 
               <br />
               Now, I need not follow out these ﬁgures. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from Qu’Appelle has sub- 
               <br />
               mitted a map, and in so far as he lays out 
               <br />
               the same divisions as are laid out in the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment schedule I think we may take it 
               <br />
               for granted that the government schedule 
               <br />
               is perfectly correct. I ﬁnd that the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has made some criticism in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re«</span> 
               <br />
               gard to Redberry, but according to his own 
               <br />
               schedule he makes a district of Redberry, 
               <br />
               which corresponds fairly with the govern- 
               <br />
               ment one; Battleford is practically the 
               <br />
               same; Rosthern is made a little smaller; 
               <br />
               Saskatoon is made smaller; Prince Albert 
               <br />
               city is cut out altogether and Humboldt is 
               <br />
               cut out altogether and added to Ba— 
               <br />
               toche. I want to call the attention of 
               <br />
               the committee to the facts in regard to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Humboldt.</span> The hon. gentleman says that 
               <br />
               Humboldt should not have separate repre-
