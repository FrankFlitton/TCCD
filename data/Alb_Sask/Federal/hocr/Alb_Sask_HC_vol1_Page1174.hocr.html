               Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) has 
               <br />
               brought on all this. He has made a great 
               <br />
               mistake, ﬁrst of all in transferring to the 
               <br />
               federal arena a comparatively small ques- 
               <br />
               tion, one that could have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been»</span> settled in 
               <br />
               the comparatively local ﬁeld <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">where</span> it ought 
               <br />
               to have been settled. For some reason or 
               <br />
               other he has chosen to cause strife, to 
               <br />
               cause agitation, to cause dissension, from 
               <br />
               the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc over this ques- 
               <br />
               tion. There was no need of it. I say that 
               <br />
               we are now on the eve of a long period of 
               <br />
               strife in connection. with this matter. This 
               <br />
               has not been brought about by this side, it 
               <br />
               has not been brought about by the ‘in- 
               <br />
               tolerant ’ people of Ontario, but by the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec and the Liberal party of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, and the responsibility must 
               <br />
               rest upon them. We do not want these 
               <br />
               school questions brought into this parlia— 
               <br />
               ment. The Conservative party brought 
               <br />
               them into this parliament once, and the 
               <br />
               Conservative party almost disappeared from 
               <br />
               this country by reason of this act on its 
               <br />
               part. The Liberal party have brought this 
               <br />
               question into this parliament, and the same 
               <br />
               doom awaits them for the same offence. 
               <br />
               Leave these questions to the provinces; 
               <br />
               leave it to the west to settle what kind of 
               <br />
               schools they will have. I have enough con— 
               <br />
               ﬁdence in my fellow-countrymen in the 
               <br />
               west to believe that they will do substantial 
               <br />
               justice. So far, they have done it. I would 
               <br />
               sooner trust my rights and interests to them 
               <br />
               than to an Act of the parliament of the 
               <br />
               Dominion which has to be enforced by the 
               <br />
               club, if at all, but that can never be en- 
               <br />
               forced in the west. There can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no</span> en-

               forcement of such a law upon a free people 
               <br />
               who have not been consulted in the making 
               <br />
               of the law. The Liberal party, the party

               here to-night, I shall be charged with all 
               <br />
               kinds of intolerance, with being rancorous, 
               <br />
               with being malignantly rancorous, as I 
               <br />
               have been charged in the press of Quebec. 
               <br />
               But I say I am speaking for the people of 
               <br />
               my province, and I believe I am speaking 
               <br />
               for the people of the west. I believe what 
               <br />
               I say is on the line of the political institu- 
               <br />
               tions which are the pride of our people ,and 
               <br />
               which are being worked out in this country. 
               <br />
               There is no rancor in my heart. I think 
               <br />
               as much of my fellow-countrymen of the 
               <br />
               east, no matter to what province they be- 
               <br />
               long, as I do of my fellow—countrymen of 
               <br />
               the west. We have to govern this country ; 
               <br />
               we have to live together. We must learn 
               <br />
               to grow together. But we must have dis- 
               <br />
               cussions of this kind in parliaments of this 
               <br />
               kind. All our progress on constitutional 
               <br />
               lines has been worked out in discussions 
               <br />
               like this. Parliament is a place for discus- 
               <br />
               sion. And because men take strong ground 
               <br />
               in parliament, and because they try to just- 
               <br />
               ify their position by argument, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there‘is</span> no 
               <br />
               stigma to be placed upon them for that. 
               <br />
               Never was one of these questions threshed 
               <br />
               out in old Canada, or in old England, 
               <br />
               such as we are now discussing when there 
               <br />
               was not this feeling that now exists, and 
               <br />
               this charge and counter-charge. All this is 
               <br />
               of the nature of the case. And so, while 
               <br />
               trying to make a strong case from my point 
               <br />
               of view, I do so with high respect for the 
               <br />
               views of those who do not agree with me. 
               <br />
               In some way we have to work this thing 
               <br />
               out. We have to learn to govern the coun- 
               <br />
               try as it is to-day, with diverse races and 
               <br />
               diverse religious professions. We have to 
               <br />
               do it respecting one another and according 
               <br />
               to one another the right to the fullest ex- 
               <br />
               pression of the views we hold. And it is 
               <br />
               in .that spirit that I am addressing the 
               <br />
               House to-night. I know that some good 
               <br />
               will come of this discussion. I know that 
               <br />
               out of it all, in some way, the people of the 
               <br />
               west will be left free and that they will
