               Mr. LANCASTER. In reference to the 
               <br />
               amendment of the hon. member for Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. Lennox) the minister has not disputed 
               <br />
               that this is a new offence which has been 
               <br />
               created and if he does not realize it I can 
               <br />
               assure him that so far as I am concerned, I 
               <br />
               am satisﬁed that the penalty is very large 
               <br />
               for a new oﬂence. What is the oiïence ? 
               <br />
               The oﬂîence is one that might very innocent— 
               <br />
               ly be technically perpetrated by a man who 
               <br />
               would then be ﬁned $500. It is not neces- 
               <br />
               sary under the section that the person pro- 
               <br />
               ceeded against should be offering this seed 
               <br />
               for sale at all. Anybody who happens to 
               <br />
               have seed in his possession that some in- 
               <br />
               former thinks might possibly be sold—and 
               <br />
               of course anything we have might possibly 
               <br />
               be sold without our being in the selling 
               <br />
               business—anybody, a professional man or 
               <br />
               a manufacturer or a clergyman without 
               <br />
               having anything to do with the growing of 
               <br />
               seed, who may be the custodian of seed 
               <br />
               which he holds in trust for somebody else, 
               <br />
               may be ﬁned, for the informer does not have 
               <br />
               to prove that he is advertising it for sale 
               <br />
               or recommending people to buy it or in any 
               <br />
               way advancing the idea that he has it for 
               <br />
               sale. Under these circumstances there 
               <br />
               should be a very small amount of ﬁne if it is 
               <br />
               only a trivial offence as is likely. The 
               <br />
               offence is not as serious as striking a man 
               <br />
               over the head yet a magistrate for such an 
               <br />
               offence as that could ﬁne a man $1 only.

               Last year it was my duty to present a 
               <br />
               statement covering more than half a year, 
               <br />
               during which I was not connected with the

               <br />
               having presented a statement covering a

               <br />
               state the results for the year 1903—4. The

               908 more than those of the preceding year. 
               <br />
               The expenditure was $7,239,982, being $1,- 
               <br />
               043,329 more than those of 1902—3. This 
               <br />
               left a deficit of $900,751, which was con—
