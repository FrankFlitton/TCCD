               <br />
               in discussing the land question last night 
               <br />
               I discussed the ﬁnancial question, because 
               <br />
               the two seem to be intimately combined; 
               <br />
               and having said all that I would have said 
               <br />
               if I had divided my remarks into two parts, 
               <br />
               the one on lands and the other‘on ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               terms, I do not know that it is worth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">while</span> 
               <br />
               to repeat them again to-night, unless the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice is very anxious to hear 
               <br />
               a good speech a second time. There is 
               <br />
               another reason which would induce me _to 
               <br />
               repeat it, if I had a little more faith in the 
               <br />
               stiff-necked and rebellious ministry which 
               <br />
               sits opposite me. I might think it worth 
               <br />
               while to repeat it if I thought they 
               <br />
               yould take good suggestions and put 
               <br />
               them into practice; but I can quite 
               <br />
               see that having arranged their method 
               <br />
               and plan, which is to my mind an entirely 
               <br />
               ﬁctitious one, and placed on a ﬁctitious 
               <br />
               basis, they propose to carry it out. I get no 
               <br />
               assistance from the Northwest members, 
               <br />
               who seem rather to be indisposed to make 
               <br />
               a good and enduring provision ﬁnancially 
               <br />
               for their country. They shiver on the brink 
               <br />
               of a little responsibility, and do not seem 
               <br />
               to feel that the people or the legislature 
               <br />
               will care to take up the matter in a business 
               <br />
               way and arrange for their present necessi- 
               <br />
               ties, and at the same time conserve the re- 
               <br />
               sources Which would sufﬁce for future 
               <br />
               and better use. Having exhausted my store 
               <br />
               of wise and prudent counsel, I do not know 
               <br />
               that it is of any use to cast any more pearls 
               <br />
               before the government opposite. I have 
               <br />
               said my say, and I hold to my contentions.

               so rapidly that the expenditure has gone

               our annual grant will increase, but the

               needs of the country will increase far more 
               <br />

               <br />
               new provinces will have to resort to direct
