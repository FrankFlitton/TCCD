               This would leave undoubtedly the right

               teaching in the separate schools just as they 
               <br />
               have it now. To my mind that is wrong. I 
               <br />
               admit that the local government should have 
               <br />
               control so far as the qualiﬁcation of teachers

               ous instruction and decide what kind shall

               be given through secular education. But 
               <br />
               let us leave that aside. The amendment I 
               <br />
               propose would leave the system as it is 
               <br />
               to—day. Instead of interfering with that 
               <br />
               system you would simply give the right to 
               <br />
               those who want to have a public school con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               those public schools the same privileges 
               <br />
               as pertain to separate schools. As a matter 
               <br />
               of .fact both schools are conducted in the 
               <br />
               same way at present. This would allow the 
               <br />
               majority in every district Where they want 
               <br />
               religious instruction in the schools to have

               be under the separate school legislation, and 
               <br />

               every school in the province which wanted 
               <br />
               religious instruction would have to become 
               <br />
               a separate school ?

               Mr. BOUR’ASSA. Only in case when the

               <br />
               be such an agitation as might cause the 
               <br />
               local legislature to do away with religious 
               <br />
               instruction in the public schools. the right 
               <br />
