               maximum allowed at present should remain the

               maximum. I have not had time to look up the

               <br />

               matter from political expediency must be dealt 
               <br />

               Now. from what has been said before, 
               <br />
               and from the description given in the letter 
               <br />
               which I have just read as to the working 
               <br />
               of the present law in the Territories, 1 
               <br />
               think. any reasonable man would agree 
               <br />
               with me that the present law is what we 
               <br />
               want continued when we become a province. 
               <br />
               and we would like this to be deﬁnite and 
               <br />
               so explicitly stated in the Act and in such 
               <br />
               simple and plain language that there could 
               <br />
               be no doubt as to the meaning and inter- 
               <br />
               pretation thereof. So many laws are framed 
               <br />
               in such ambiguous language that no ordinary 
               <br />
               man can understand them, and as an emi- 
               <br />
               nent judge once informed me in regard to 
               <br />
               the working of a certain law, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11!)</span> per- 
               <br />
               son could tell anything about it, and that it 
               <br />
               would all depend upon what judge had 
               <br />
               the last guess at it. So I consider this case. 
               <br />
               If in the constitution that is being framed 
               <br />
               for us at the present time nothing deﬁnite 
               <br />
               is laid down in regard to this matter of 
               <br />
               education, we will be like a ship without 
               <br />
               a rudder and it will require a long period 
               <br />
               of unrest, agitation and legal proceedings 
               <br />
               before we will know where we are at, and 
               <br />
               I venture to say that no man living can at 
               <br />
               present predict where we would land, but 
               <br />
               that in all probability we would ﬁnd our-

               One thing more, Mr. Speaker, it has been 
               <br />
               asserted over and over again, that this Bill 
               <br />
               is an interference with the provincial rights 
               <br />
               of the new province. So far as I can see, 
               <br />
               nobody is in favour of absolute provincial 
               <br />
               rights. In the Bill now under consideration, 
               <br />
               there is a more violent interference with 
               <br />
               provincial rights than is found in the edu- 
               <br />
               cational clauses. I mean the refusal to 
               <br />
               allow the provinces to tax the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway in violation of the exemption 
               <br />
               granted by the parliament of 1881. This 
               <br />
               is a violent interference with provincial 
               <br />
               rights, yet no one in this House or out of 
               <br />
               it, suggests that this parliament should not 
               <br />
               keep faith with the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way. The granting of the exemption by the 
               <br />
               Conservative government of 1881 was a 
               <br />
               most unrighteous act as far as the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories were concerned, but no one desires 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> see parliament repudiate its obligations,

               raised a single howl about this interference

               under certain circumstances, and in the

               <br />
               advisable, but necessary, to make an ex-

               ception to the doctrine of provincial rights, 
               <br />
               and they consider the Canadian Paciﬁc

               Railway exemption as one.

               lands be given to'the provinces with a 
               <br />
               provision attached that the provinces shall 
               <br />
               not be allowed to deal with them as 
               <br />
               they' deem best. but that they must 
               <br />
               continue the system of free homestead 
               <br />
               grant, and be restricted in the price at 
               <br />
               which they can Sell lands. Now, could 
               <br />
               there be a more gross interference with 
               <br />
               provincial rights, and not only is it an iu— 
               <br />
               terference with provincial rights, but it is 
               <br />
               a slap at the people of the Territories? It 
               <br />
               is simply telling them, that they are not ﬁt 
               <br />
               to be trusted to manage their own affairs, 
               <br />
               so far as the lands are concerned. We have 
               <br />
               listened to hon. gentlemen opposite day after 
               <br />
               day, as they loudly proclaimed that the peo— 
               <br />
               ple of the new provinces were perfectly ﬁt 
               <br />
               and entitled to manage their own affairs 
               <br />
               in the matter of education. Yet in the mat— 
               <br />
               ter of lands, gentlemen opposite practically 
               <br />
               say this is not so. What does it all mean, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker? It means that hon. gentle-
