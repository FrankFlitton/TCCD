               Bill as originally introduced, and indeed as 
               <br />
               it is at present, proposes to devote these 
               <br />
               funds in equal proportions—at any rate 
               <br />
               without discrimination—to the separate 
               <br />
               schools as well as to the public schools 
               <br />
               established in" that country. It proposes to 
               <br />
               divert the fund that is provided for the 
               <br />
               support of public schools from its legitimate 
               <br />
               channel and to apply it to a purpose for 
               <br />
               which it never was designed. I need not 
               <br />
               say that the original Bill met with the very 
               <br />
               strongest opposition in this House and in 
               <br />
               the country, and even within the ranks of 
               <br />
               the government itself. It was opposed on 
               <br />
               all sides ; the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton) when he learned the contents ot the 
               <br />
               Bill at once entered his protest and he re- 
               <br />
               fused to sit around the council table with 
               <br />
               the men who had concocted such a measure. 
               <br />
               Then, the next step was the introduction of 
               <br />
               the new clause which was supposed to re— 
               <br />
               move all the objectionable features of the 
               <br />
               original clause 16, and this was the clause 
               <br />
               which brought back Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Sifton</span> to the sup- 
               <br />
               port ot the government. I want for a few 
               <br />
               moments to look at the difference between 
               <br />
               these two clauses ; I think it is proper that 
               <br />
               we should analyse them. Immediately that 
               <br />
               this new clause was published the report 
               <br />
               was sent broadcast throughout the country 
               <br />
               that the diﬂiculty had been removed by giv- 
               <br />
               ing to the Northwest Territories simply 
               <br />
               what they enjoy at the present time. 1 
               <br />
               tlnnk that hon. members in discussing this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> have largely avoided analysing the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Inference</span> between the original and the am- 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(real</span> the fact that the difference in prin-

               <br />
               The o1iginal clause 16, p1ovided for the esta- 
               <br />
               blishment of a dual system of schools; it 
               <br />
               p10vided that the money set apart under the 
               <br />
               Dominion Land’s Act for the support of 
               <br />
               public schools should be diverted and ap-

               propriated without discrimination for the 
               <br />
               support of public and separate schools. We 
               <br />
               are all agreed that this was the meaning 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oi?</span> the original clause, and we are all fur— 
               <br />
               ther agreed that it took <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘away</span> from the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of these new provinces the freedom to 
               <br />
               administer their educational <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> as they 
               <br />
               might consider best in their own interests. 
               <br />
               It deprived them of what they were entitled 
               <br />
               to as a freedom loving people, namely the 
               <br />
               right of self—government in the matter of 
               <br />
               education. These, 'Sir, are the three cardi- 
               <br />
               nal principles of clause 16 of the original 
               <br />
               Bill. Now what do we ﬁnd in the amend- 
               <br />
               ed clause ‘? In the first place the amend- 
               <br />
               ed clause provides for a dual system of 
               <br />
               schools exactly as the original clause did; 
               <br />
               the amended clause provides that the money 
               <br />
               set apart under the Dominion Land’s Act 
               <br />
               for the support of public schools shall be 
               <br />
               diverted and appIopriated for the support 
               <br />
               of public and separate schools without dis-

               i ask my hon. friends on the other side of

               tween the original clause and the amend~ 
               <br />
               ed clause ? If they can see a difference, 
               <br />
               I cannot. In principle there is no difference 
               <br />
               whatever, but it pleased the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior to go out on the one clause and 
               <br />
               to come back on the other. Like a man 
               <br />
               going on a journey, he bought a return ticket 
               <br />
               because he intended coming back by the 
               <br />
               same route. I have on doubt that in start- 
               <br />
               ing the hon. gentleman (Mr. Sifton) thought 
               <br />
               there were boulders on the track; he 
               <br />
               thought the engine might bump into a land- 
               <br />
               slide or something of that kind, and it was 
               <br />
               not a very pleasant journey for him. But 
               <br />
               when he came back over the same road he 
               <br />
               found there were curvatures and other 01)- 
               <br />
               structions that he did not anticipate, and 
               <br />
               he found he had to make a pretty sharp 
               <br />
               curve in Older to get back. But the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman (\11 'Siftou) is a man of great 
               <br />
               1:'esou1ce.He says he does not like this

               the history of the question in the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. and from knowledge I have of what 
               <br />
               public men are prepared to think on this whole 
               <br />
               question from beginning to end, I am ﬁrmly 
               <br />
               convinced that it would be better for the R0- 
               <br />
               man Catholic people of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories if the legislature were left absolutely 
               <br />
               free.

               The hon. gentleman (Mr. Sifton) tells us 
               <br />
               that it would not only be better for the 
               <br />
               Protestants but better for Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               that the people of that country should be 
               <br />
               left absolutely free to deal with education 
               <br />
               as they thought best. Why, Sir, he ought 
               <br />
               to be 011 this side of the House. That is 
               <br />
               what we think. He thinks with us but he 
               <br />
               votes against us. And why does he do so ?
