               the value of these dredges. When I asked

               <br />
               know how many dredges have been brought 
               <br />
               into the country and the value of these 
               <br />
               dredges, the hon. Minister of Customs at 
               <br />
               once smells a rat, he sees that there is go- 
               <br />

               <br />
               job lot of dredges which have been brought 
               <br />
               in by Conmee, Bowman and other party 
               <br />
               friends. and the hon. Minister of Customs 
               <br />
               can tell you the value of everything else 
               <br />
               brought into the country, but when it comes 
               <br />
               down to dredges, he thinks it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">islnot</span> in the 
               <br />
               interest of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">department</span> that it should 
               <br />
               he told. Is not that a wonderful thing? 
               <br />
               I am afraid that if my hon. friend had 
               <br />
               slid along in his usual easy official way,

               suggested to the hon. minister it would 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. PATERSON. Proper criticism carries 
               <br />
               weight with' it, but such criticism as we

               He stated that I thought he was going to 
               <br />
               unearth something. That statement of his 
               <br />
               is without foundation. It was none of my 
               <br />
               business to suspect anything, for the ques- 
               <br />
               tion was a proper one, and, as a member of 
               <br />
               this House, the hon. gentleman was entitled 
               <br />
               to a courteous answer. To insinuate that I 
               <br />
               had any motive or reason for withholding 
               <br />
               information is a sentiment worthy of the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman (Mr. Bennett), but it is not 
               <br />
               worthy of his friends who sit with him.
