               struction is not conﬁned to separate schools; 
               <br />
               it applies to all schools in the Territories. 
               <br />
               It is provided that wherever the trustees 
               <br />
               so Wish, Wherever the local condition-s per- 
               <br />
               mit, there shall be religious instruction in 
               <br />
               all schools in the Northwest Territories, not 
               <br />
               in the minority schools only. Then there 
               <br />
               is a further provision that all schools may 
               <br />
               be opened with the reciting of the Lord’s 
               <br />
               Prayer. Does anybody object to that ? I 
               <br />
               hope not; I trust that in any case where 
               <br />
               the trustees of a school authorized that, it is 
               <br />
               not objectionable. But then there is this half 
               <br />
               hour of religious education. From the hour 
               <br />
               at which these schools open in the morning 
               <br />
               up to half-past three in the afternoon they 
               <br />
               are absolutely alike ; there is no difference ; 
               <br />
               the teachers have the same duties, the same 
               <br />
               qualiﬁcations; the same examinations, the 
               <br />
               same course of study, the same books are 
               <br />
               prescribed by the government, the regula- 
               <br />
               tions are made by the government, the in- 
               <br />
               spector is appointed by the government. I 
               <br />
               repeat that from the hour of opening in the 
               <br />
               morning up to half-past three in the after— 
               <br />
               noon there is no shade of difference in all 
               <br />
               these schools in the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               So it has come to this, that we have a shade 
               <br />
               of difference as respects the half hour of re- 
               <br />
               religious instruction, from 3.30 to 4 o’clock. 
               <br />

               <br />
               should not be a cause of conﬂict. Where 
               <br />
               the majority of the people and the 
               <br />
               trustees are of the Protestant faith, 
               <br />
               that half hour of religious 
               <br />
               will,.of course, take the form of the faith 
               <br />
               of the majority ; it will be Protestant reli- 
               <br />
               gious instruction. Where the majority of 
               <br />
               the people and the trustees are Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics, that half hour of religious in- 
               <br />
               struction will follow the faith of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic majority. In each of these cases 
               <br />
               the minority, if they Wish, may have a 
               <br />
               separate school. I am ﬁrmly persuaded that 
               <br />
               the difference is so slight that if we reach a 
               <br />
               wise decision now, if we refrain from 
               <br />
               fanning the ﬂame of political passion—I 
               <br />
               withdraw that word political, I am not dis— 
               <br />
               cussing this fro-m a party standpoint, and i 
               <br />
               did not intend to use that word. and I with- 
               <br />
               draw it—-—if we refrain from doing or saying 
               <br />
               anything which can fan the ﬂame of reli- 
               <br />
               gious excitement in the Northwest Terri— 
               <br />
               tories now, my honest conviction is that 
               <br />
               the separate schools will diminish, and the 
               <br />
               free common public schools will increase. 
               <br />
               I am persuaded that the difference is so 
               <br />
               small that the mass of the people in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories will hardly ﬁnd it to 
               <br />
               their advantage to keep it up except in a 
               <br />
               few instances. I am reminded of one point : 
               <br />
               I had forgotten to state that even with 
               <br />
               respect to that half hour, it is not a matter 
               <br />
               of obligation, but if the parents of any child 
               <br />
               disapprove of that religious instruction for 
               <br />
               that half hour. the child may withdraw.

               of the national school system in that pro-

               as an example of toleration and good will:

               <br />
               I stated at an earlier stage of my speech : 
               <br />
               Thou shalt not teach any ‘ism’ but thou 
               <br />
               shalt teach by precept and example,
