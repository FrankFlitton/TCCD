               They certainly did demand to control their own

               educational system through the provincial gov— 
               <br />

               <br />
               education of the minority. The minority was 
               <br />
               to control its own educational system and has 
               <br />
               always done so. The majority would probably 
               <br />
               have acted rightly by the minority, even if they 
               <br />
               had been free to act otherwise, but at confed-
