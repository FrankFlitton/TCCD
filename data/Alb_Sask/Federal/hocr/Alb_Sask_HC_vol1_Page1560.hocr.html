               more apparent. If we assume that each <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ot</span>

               the constituencies of Athabaska and Peace

               <br />
               in all—and that, I think, is liberal, in view

               hon. gentleman who leads this side of the

               House—the ﬁgures give Peace River a popu-

               lation of 800 and Athabaska 1,436, totalling 
               <br />
               2,236. Divide that by ﬁve to ascertain the 
               <br />
               number of votes, or by any other ﬁgure you 
               <br />
               choose to select, and it will give a voting

               population for the two constituencies of 
               <br />
               447. So, when I am allowing 300 for each 
               <br />
               constituency, I think I am within the mark 
               <br />
               when I say that it is a fair and liberal al- 
               <br />

               the south as having each a v‘oting popula— 
               <br />
               tion of 300 and compare them with those in 
               <br />
               the north. Take all the constituencies of 
               <br />
               the north, and include Red Deer in the south. 
               <br />
               it matters not for the calculation in which 
               <br />
               part you place the constituency of Red Deer,

               ment urge that they should be deprived of 
               <br />
               two representatives. But let us look at 
               <br />
               the population according to the census of 
               <br />
               1901. It has been repeated over and over 
               <br />
               again in this House, that in the Whole (lis- 
               <br />
               trict of Athabask-a there were only 241 white 
               <br />
               people. Now, we are not taking in the 
               <br />
               whole of Athabaska, we take in about 50 
               <br />
               per cent; I am willing -to say that it in— 
               <br />
               cludes 70 per cent of the population. But 
               <br />
               I may point out now that for some reason 
               <br />
               or other, if I am correctly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">informed,‘</span> re-

               statement has been made to me, and I be— 
               <br />
               lieve it is correct. Now if we take 70 per 
               <br />
               cent of that white population of 241 it 
               <br />
               would give us 160 people, and if we look 
               <br />
               at the census of 1901 we will find that in 
               <br />
               the whole province of Alberta there are two 
               <br />
               and a third times the number of people 
               <br />
               now, on the estimate of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice when he put it at 173,000, that there 
               <br />
               was when the census was taken in 1901. No 
               <br />
               man will argue in this House that there 
               <br />
               has been a greater inﬂux of population, pro- 
               <br />
               portionately, into Athabaska <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> there has 
               <br />
               been into the other portions of Alberta. For 
               <br />
               a number of years back there has been no 
               <br />
               diﬁiculty in getting settlement along the 
               <br />
               lines of railway construction; therefore I 
               <br />
               think we are justiﬁed in assuming that the 
               <br />
               inﬂux into Athabaska has been no greater 
               <br />
               proportionately, than into the rest of the 
               <br />
               province of Alberta. Therefore if I multi- 
               <br />
               ply 160 by two and one—third it will‘give 
               <br />
               a population of 400. Where have the addi— 
               <br />
               tional half—breeds, if any, come from into 
               <br />
               Athabaska? If they have gone in there 
               <br />
               from the northern part of Alberta, the 
               <br />
               northern part of Alberta would be depleted 
               <br />
               thereby. But has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> been into that 
               <br />
               country the last two or three years any 
               <br />
               inﬂux of settlement, either of white people 
               <br />
               or of half-breeds? Therefore, I say that 
               <br />
               the time is not ripe yet to give that dis- 
               <br />
