               not be fair to compare one post ofﬁce with 
               <br />

               is that where there are more post ofﬁces

               there are more people. My hon. friend

               cannot d'aw any conclusion from the argu-

               ment, which he made very insidiously, I 
               <br />
               will not say ingeniously, in which he com—

               pared a rural population with an urban

               not a fair comparison, because if we com-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3</span> the question of policy was decided 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">]by</span> a conference of both parties. That 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lpnlicy</span> was agreed upon and then the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">î</span> matter was submitted to the judges 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> for the purpose of delimiting the 
               <br />
               constituencies according to that policy.

               What does the hon. gentleman propose ‘: 
               <br />
               He says that the admission of Athabaska and 
               <br />
               Peace River district is a question of policy. 
               <br />
               That question would not be decided in the 
               <br />
               imperial parliament at all. That is a fair 
               <br />
               question for a conference or for the judges 
               <br />
               to decide. The principles upon which a dc- 
               <br />
               limitation is made is a subject for a con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ference.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because</span> the delimitation is made 
               <br />
               upon principles which are given to the judges 
               <br />
               for that purpose. In England it was entirely 
               <br />
               different. Mr. Gladstone meets Sir Stafford 
               <br />
