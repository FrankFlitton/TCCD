               <br />

               basis upon which the government proposes 
               <br />

               <br />
               so far as I understand. Well, then we might 
               <br />
               look at the condition, as outlined by a very 
               <br />
               important memebr of the government at 
               <br />

               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton), in 1903. What is the basis 
               <br />
               the government has laid down ? The 
               <br />
               basis is that we are to pay to the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces annually, by way of compensation 
               <br />
               therefor, a sum based upon the estimated 
               <br />
               value of the lands. I suppose that that is in 
               <br />
               line with the position taken by members

               must get at the value of the lands for

               <br />
               compensate the Territories, not on the basis 
               <br />
               of $3 per acre, but $1.50 per acre.

               And I venture to think that thereis every 
               <br />
               reason indeed for the criticism of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Qu’Appelle (Mr. Lake) and my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. M. S. Mc- 
               <br />
               Carthy). What is the position of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment? 'Do they recognize that they 
               <br />

               for the people of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />

               <br />
               from Western Assiniboia cannot support 
               <br />
               them unless they take that view. That 
               <br />
               was his solemn declaration, made, I am 
               <br />
               sure not once, but many times, and 
               <br />
               certainly made in parliament. Well, they 
               <br />
               apparently carry out that view by provid- 
               <br />
               ing that there shall be compensation. But 
               <br />
               when they compensate the provinces for 
               <br />
               the lands, they compensate them on the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">basis</span> of ﬁfty cents on the dollar. What

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justiﬁcation</span> has the government for that ? 
               <br />
               It does not make any difference Whether

               it is enough for the requirements of the
