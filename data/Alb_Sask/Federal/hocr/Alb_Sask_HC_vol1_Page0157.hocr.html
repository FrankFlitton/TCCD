               than once hinted at rather forcibly by my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from North Toronto (Mr. Foster). 
               <br />
               There is and has been an attempt in this 
               <br />
               House to weaken the inﬂuence and dis- 
               <br />
               parage the judgment of the leader of the 
               <br />
               government (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). In days 
               <br />
               gone by we were accustomed to hear from 
               <br />
               the other side of the House at times, and 
               <br />
               in the press, descriptions of the right hon. 
               <br />
               leader of this government being little more 
               <br />
               than clay that was moulded in the hands 
               <br />
               of some stronger man or men in his cabinet. 
               <br />
               Now the tune is entirely changed. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from North Toronto, describing him 
               <br />
               the other day, and he was very indignant 
               <br />
               about it, said that that his conduct was like 
               <br />
               that of a Czar, who introduced-a measure 
               <br />
               without consulting his colleagues, and who 
               <br />
               does whatever he pleases.

               head of the government ? Does the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman remember that a few years ago 
               <br />
               there was a government with which he was 
               <br />
               in perfect accord on all questions of policy, 
               <br />

               <br />
               be introduced—thoroughly in accord, a 
               <br />
               united and happy party ? But unfortun- 
               <br />
               ately the strong leader was not at their 
               <br />
               head. and the hon. gentleman and six others 
               <br />
               withdrew. Well, now. if we have got a

               gentleman spoke at that meeting, and he 
               <br />
               uttered a sentiment that I think was hardly 
               <br />
               proper and which I regretted to see coming 
               <br />
               from him. He said that the introduction of 
               <br />
               this Bill tended to promote racial and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span> 
               <br />
               ligious strife. According to this gentleman, 
               <br />
               that could only be averted by withdrawing 
               <br />
               this Bill and then this vexed question of 
               <br />
               race and religion would be eliminated alto-
