               ber for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) remembers 
               <br />
               that in the fall of 1903 we had a discussion 
               <br />
               about a certain matter of capital advance. 
               <br />
               I read a telegram from Mr. Hauitain which 
               <br />
               practically asked me to get a capital ad-

               vance on certain terms which he said 
               <br />
               would be satisfactory to him. Well, later 
               <br />
               in the assembly he declared that they were 
               <br />
               not satisfactory, and it is to the knowledge 
               <br />
               of everybody that that declaration had 
               <br />
               absolutely no other motive than partisanship 
               <br />

               said .in his telegram that he would be satis-

               lature that it was not satisfactory, and for 
               <br />
               purely partisan reasons, which nobody can 
               <br />
               successfully deny.

               Mr. SPROULE. I did not understand

               that the money was got on the terms that

               Mr. SCOTT. Absolutely. Then as this
