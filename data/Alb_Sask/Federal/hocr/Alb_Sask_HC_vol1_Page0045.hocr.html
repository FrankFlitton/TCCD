               I would remark to my hon. friend from

               Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) that the manner in

               (Mr. Sifton) and on the eve of the return of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding)— 
               <br />
               affords an excellent specimen of the way in

               <br />
               the debates of 1902 and to the speech which 
               <br />
               the Minister of theInterior (Mr. Sifton) then 
               <br />
               made with all the authority of a member of 
               <br />
               the administration. The ex—minister spoke

               <br />

               Last year it was arranged that a discussion 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take</span> place, and our friends of the terri-

               torial government did urge that it should take 
               <br />
               place earlier. But the Minister of Finance was 
               <br />
               obliged to go to England immediately after the 
               <br />
               session, and a discussion in his absence would 
               <br />
               of course have been impossible, he being one of

               just mentioned but brought this Bill down, 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the collective wisdom of the government, 
               <br />
               without the assent of his two colleagues,— 
               <br />
               who above all others should have been con- 
               <br />
               sulted—when we ask him why he tool: that 
               <br />
               extraordinary course, he vouchsafes to the 
               <br />
               House not one word in explanation. I 
               <br />
               ventured to suggest some days ago that it 
               <br />
               was due, not only to the House and the 
               <br />
               country but to the right hon. gentleman him- 
               <br />
               self, that some explanation should be given. 
               <br />
               I am still of that opinion. What was the 
               <br />
               reason, when the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) was expected in Ottawa within 
               <br />
               two days, that this Bill was rushed into 
               <br />
               the House of Commons before his arrival, 
               <br />
               while not one step has been taken to for- 
               <br />
               ward it through any of its stages for three 
               <br />
               weeks afterwards '? Why was it, when the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance was on his way home 
               <br />
               from England and expected to arrive, as he 
               <br />
               did arrive, in Ottawa within four or ﬁve 
               <br />
               days, that the Prime Minister rushed in 
               <br />
               feverish haste to the House with this meas- 
               <br />
               ure, and has not since sought to advance 
               <br />
               it one single stage ? Was it because some 
               <br />
               of the right hon. gentleman’s colleagues 
               <br />
               were wavering and he dreaded the result 
               <br />
               of the inﬂuence of two such strong members 
               <br />
               of his cabinet as the ex-Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior and the Minister of Finance upon 
               <br />
               those who were hesitating to indorse the 
               <br />
               course the right hon. gentleman purposed 
               <br />
               to pursue. Was there any idea in the mind 
               <br />
               of the First Minister that these gentlemen 
               <br />
               might not be so ready to hesitate or to 
               <br />
               retreat once this measure had been brought 
               <br />
               down as a government measure. Was there 
               <br />
               anything of that kind in the mind of the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman ? I do not know. I 
               <br />
               cannot tell what was in his mind, but we 
               <br />
               at least are able to conclude that something 
               <br />
               very extraordinary must have impelled him 
               <br />
               to take the course he did.

               <br />
               in 1902 and again in 1903, took the ground 
               <br />
               that the Northwest Territories already had a

               very considerable degree of responsible gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. They had a legislature of their 
               <br />
               own, a cabinet of their own, and he pointed 
               <br />
               out that with the exception of the right to 
               <br />
               incur debt and one or two other matters, 
               <br />
               they were already invested with the powers
