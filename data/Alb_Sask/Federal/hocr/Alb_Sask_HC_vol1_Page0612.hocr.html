               Mr. FITZPATRIOK. It was settled be- 
               <br />
               fore this interview. That is exactly 
               <br />
               What we contend for. The delegate evid- 
               <br />
               ently did not know anything about what 
               <br />
               had taken place. It was settled two days 
               <br />
               before that conference. He said that if you 
               <br />
               want your boundaries extended the best 
               <br />
               thing you can do is to conciliate the inhab- 
               <br />
               itauts of the country to be affected because 
               <br />
               the government cannot agree and will not 
               <br />
               agree in all probability to extend the boun- 
               <br />
               daries of Manitoba against the wishes of the 
               <br />
               people whose political interests depend upon 
               <br />
               the change and whose political interests 
               <br />
               would be affected by the change. And he 
               <br />
               said to him : Here, these people, the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics, are in the enjoyment of separate 
               <br />
               schools, whereas if they come into the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba they will be under a 
               <br />
               different constitution and they will object 
               <br />
               to any extension of the boundaries of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba which will prejudicially affect their 
               <br />
               interests in so far as the school question is 
               <br />
               concerned. Is there anything improper in 
               <br />
               that ? Is there anything wrong ? Is there 
               <br />
               anything that the delegate should apologize 
               <br />
               for ? Incidentally let me observe that we 
               <br />
               have heard a great deal about the nefarious 
               <br />
               system of separate schools in the Northwest. 
               <br />
               We have heard a great deal about the 
               <br />
               shackles that we are going to put on the 
               <br />
               hands of the people there, it has been said 
               <br />
               that we are going to submit the people of 
               <br />
               the Territories to an indignity by imposing 
               <br />
               upon them a separate school system and yet 
               <br />
               here we ﬁnd that these people, instead of 
               <br />
               desiring to throw off the shackles, unani- 
               <br />
               mously protest against any change. This 
               <br />
               is simply an incidental remark that I want 
               <br />
               to make at the present moment. But, I 
               <br />
               shall not transgress the rules of the House. 
               <br />
               Unfortunately, some time before we reach 
               <br />
               the third reading of the Bill, I shall be ob- 
               <br />
               liged to inﬂict a speech upon the House. 
               <br />
               But, is there anything improper in 
               <br />
               what has taken place which makes it 
               <br />
               necessary to speak of the delegate in 
               <br />
               the ill disguised terms of contempt 
               <br />
               which have been applied to him by 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House ? Why should he be called a police- 
               <br />
               man, or likened to a cabman ? Is there any 
               <br />
               necessity for that? Is there anything in 
               <br />
               what has occurred to justify these epithets 
               <br />
               that were applied to him ? Now, the dele- 
               <br />
               gate goes on, and see what he says about 
               <br />
               his conversations so far as the government

               which the government can be held respon- 
               <br />
               sible ? The delegate says he had a private 
               <br />
               conversation with this gentleman, that his 
               <br />
               object was simply to improve the condition 
               <br />
               of the Catholics, and he says the govern- 
               <br />
               ment had no knowledge of it. Why should 
               <br />
               we be held responsible for that. If I were

               prepared to take all responsibility for 
               <br />
               everything the delegate said. I see nothing 
               <br />
               in it that any man need be ashamed 
               <br />
               of and I speak now, not as a Catho- 
               <br />
               lic, but as a citizen of this country. I have 
               <br />
               made a longer speech than I intended and 
               <br />
               I apologize to the House for so doing. but I 
               <br />
               thought it was my duty to make this state-

               not been apologetic fora course which I

               do not understand why the Minister of Jus— 
               <br />
               tice has brought my name into this discus- 
               <br />
               sion. He referred to my being in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">company</span> 
               <br />
               this afternoon with the Hon. Mr. Leblanc, a 
               <br />
               member of the Quebec legislature and ex- 
               <br />
               speaker of that body, who happened to be 
               <br />
               here and who was kindly olfered a seat on 
               <br />
               the ﬂoor of the House. And the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice availed of this incident to introduce 
               <br />
               my name into the beginning of his speech, 
               <br />
               and to say that we wanted to make an at- 
               <br />
               tack upon His Excellency. The Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice also said that the leader of the 0p- 
               <br />
               position had thought it well to make an apo- 
               <br />
               logy for the remarks he made this after- 
               <br />
               noon, but I do not know that the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition made any apology, and I do 
               <br />
               not understand that he had any to make. 
               <br />
               The question which the leader of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition brought before the House. is a most 
               <br />
               important one, and in what I shall say now 
               <br />
               I will be as candid as the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
