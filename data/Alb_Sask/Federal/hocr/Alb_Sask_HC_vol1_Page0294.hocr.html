               How have we dealt with education in the

               seven provinces of this Dominion? We

               <br />
               came -to legislate. Nova Scotia‘ had no

               separate schools ; the British North America 
               <br />

               <br />
               Brunswick there were no separate schools; 
               <br />
               when they joined confederation the Con-

               federation Act gave them no separate

               <br />

               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> and left them in the enjoyment 
               <br />
               of separate schools. In Ontario when it

               entered confederation there were separate

               <br />
               of the British North America Act. They were 
               <br />
               not there by right or law because there were 
               <br />
               no laws. The country was almost unin- 
               <br />
               habited, no constitution had been declared, 
               <br />
               it was working under the old law of England, 
               <br />
               and the legislators of that day, endeavouring 
               <br />
               to recognize the condition of affairs as they 
               <br />
               found it, when they were going to make

               <br />
               there are no schools in Manitoba by law 
               <br />
               there are some by practice and we will give

               vinces that now constitute this Dominion, 
               <br />
               each province was left either with or with-

               was at the time of its entering into the 
               <br />
               union. But what do we ﬁnd in the case 
               <br />
               of the Territories ? In 1875, thirty years 
               <br />
               ago, this parliament passed an Act author- 
               <br />
               izing the legislature of the Territories to 
               <br />
               establish separate schools. The Act of 1875 
               <br />
               did not declare the character of these 
               <br />
               schools; they might be under church con- 
               <br />
               trol or they might be under state control. 
               <br />
               I frankly confess that I disapprove of sepa- 
               <br />
               rate schools under church control, and on 
               <br />
               one occasion when I had the opportunity 
               <br />
               I recorded my vote against the maintenance 
               <br />
               of the status quo of 1875. I object to that 
               <br />
               feature of it which admits of a school under 
               <br />
               church control, but the Act remained on the 
               <br />
               statute—book and it is on the statute-book 
               <br />
               to-day. ‘It is quite common practice in this

               <br />

               supreme as is the legislature of any pro- 
               <br />
               vince. For thirty years the people of the 
               <br />
               Territories have been in the enjoyment of 
               <br />
               rights under the Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«1875,</span> and they have 
               <br />
               made clear their views on their educational

               system in the form of laws passed by their 
               <br />
               legislature. The ex-Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               correctly described the educational laws of 
               <br />
               the Territories. He pointed out that under 
               <br />
               the ordinance, chapter 29, which we pro- 
               <br />
               pose to accept as the standard, the separate 
               <br />
               schools as they are to-day are really na- 
               <br />
               tional schools; that the teachers must be 
               <br />
               qualiﬁed equally with the teachers in the 
               <br />
               public schools, that the schools must be 
               <br />
               organized under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> state and not under 
               <br />
               the church, that the text books are pres- 
               <br />
               cribed by the state, that the inspection, 
               <br />
               the examination and the whole control of 
               <br />
               these schools called separate schools, is 
               <br />
               with the state. We have been assailed in- 
               <br />
               deed by people opposed to us because these 
               <br />
               schools are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁciently</span> under church 
               <br />
               control. The existing school system in the

               Territories is the outcome of thirty years 
               <br />
               of legislation by— the people of the Terri-
