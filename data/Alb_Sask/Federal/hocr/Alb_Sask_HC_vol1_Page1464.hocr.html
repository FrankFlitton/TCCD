               made a few minutes ago by the hon.

               member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) 
               <br />
               that the lands should be treated on the 
               <br />
               same principle as our school lands which 
               <br />
               are held for the purpose of squeezing the 
               <br />
               last cent of value out of them, he 
               <br />
               will realize the difference between the 
               <br />
               two policies and systems of adminis- 
               <br />
               -tration; the difference between the idea 
               <br />
               held by the people out west and the 
               <br />
               idea so persistently advanced by hon.

               gentlemen on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House in this discussion. In one case the 
               <br />
               idea was that these lands should pass out 
               <br />
               of the hands of the Dominion and into the 
               <br />
               hands of the settlers. I think that idea 
               <br />
               was speciﬁcally stated in the remarks of 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior; certainly, it 
               <br />
               was the intention; and, inasmuch as that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman mentioned a ﬁxed price, 
               <br />
               whether that price should be adhered to or 
               <br />
               not, it was clear that the idea was abso- 
               <br />
               lutely contrary to the idea suggested by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Toronto.

               very large acreage to the Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               Valley Land Company, did he do it with 
               <br />
               the idea that the land should pass at the

               <br />

               of money and scrip to that land company,

               There is a practical proof of what my hon.

               friend’s predecessor thought with refer-

               <br />
               wan Valley Land Company at a certain 
               <br />
               price per acre, as the hon. gentleman has

               of the lands being settled. The company 
               <br />
               which got the lands at that low price were 
               <br />
               under contract, it was a condition of pur- 
               <br />
               chase, that they should place settlers upon 
               <br />
               the lands, and neither he nor I have any

               <br />
               settlers and placing them on those lands. 
               <br />
               The essential point is to get settlers on the 
               <br />
               land, and that is a point which our hon. 
               <br />
               friends opposite seem to miss. The land as 
               <br />
               land has no value, it is worth nothing, it is 
               <br />
               the use of the land that gives the value, it is 
               <br />
               the requirement of that land by the people 
               <br />
               that gives it value. That land may stand 
               <br />
               from now till doomsday, as it has stood 
               <br />
               from the creation until now, without being 
               <br />
               of any value unless settlers go upon it and 
               <br />
               make it of value by producing wealth out 
               <br />

               Mr. FOSTER. My hon. friend must not 
               <br />
               carry that argument too far, because the 
               <br />
               instance I cited is directly against them. 
               <br />
               The land does have value given to it by 
               <br />
               the work of the labourer. The land has a 
               <br />
               value before the labourer has put his spade 
               <br />
               into a single foot of its soil. The land that 
               <br />
               was sold for $1 or $1.50 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«per</span> acre had no 
               <br />
               settlers upon it, the land that was retailed 
               <br />
               out by the go—between company had no la- 
               <br />
               bourer’s spade or plough put into it when it 
               <br />
               had increased in value from $1.50 up to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$$$</span> 
               <br />
               or $10, but it was the prospective idea that 
               <br />
               by-and—by the real worker would come in 
               <br />
               and would raise enough from it to enable 
               <br />
               him to pay the $10 that came to the go—be- 
               <br />
               tween. But my hon. friend has no basis, 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial or otherwise for saying that there

               Mr. OLIVER. Of course 1 do not wish to 
               <br />
               enter into an academic discussion with my 
               <br />
               hon. friend at this moment on the question 
               <br />
               between us. He must know that that part!- 
               <br />
               cular land was not worth anything until it 
               <br />
               came into the possession of the worker. The 
               <br />
               value that it had was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because</span> of somebody 
               <br />
               having worked the land and having demon- 
               <br />
               strated that it could be worked to advan- 
               <br />
               tage. The ultimate increase in the value or 
               <br />
               the land does depend, not necessarily on that 
               <br />
               particular piece of land being worked, but 
               <br />
               on the possibility of its production being de— 
               <br />
               monstrated by the work on land there or 
               <br />
               thereabouts. and the demandfor that land 
               <br />
               that comes by reason of the presence of the 
               <br />
               settlers. The company who bought that land 
               <br />
               had to go to the expense of advertising lt 
               <br />
               and of bringing settlers there. I do not know, 
               <br />
               and he does not know what the expense 
               <br />
               was, and there is where our hon. friend: 01)- 
               <br />
               posite altogether <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[miss</span> the point of how the 
               <br />
               value of land comes about. Our lands lay 
               <br />
               there for many years after they came under
