               <br />
               the First Minister applies that to parlia-

               <br />
               the law may be general, the separate 
               <br />
               school provisions will apply only to min- 
               <br />
               orities. Look at section 41 of ordinance 
               <br />
               29, and if I am wrong I ask the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice to correct me. You cannot bring 
               <br />
               a separate school into existence under sec-

               <br />
               moves. There can be no separate school 
               <br />
               without that. Well, then, what about con- 
               <br />
               scientious scruples against being taught in

               <br />

               <br />
               have a separate school. The majority must 
               <br />
               have a public school, separate and apart 
               <br />

               remedial legislation if the majority were 
               <br />

               I happen to be in a somewhat inquisitive 
               <br />
               mood to-night, and I would like to know 
               <br />
               who was the draughtsman of the proposed 
               <br />
               amendment to section 16 ? It was drawn by 
               <br />
               no ’prentice hand. Was it the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice who was the draftsman ? The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, I notice, this afternoon took par- 
               <br />
               ticular care to steer clear of that inquiry. 
               <br />
               Well, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) 
               <br />
               and the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sif-

               <br />
               amendment that was drawn. In conse- 
               <br />
               quence of that amendment they withdrew 
               <br />
               their opposiltion to the Bill ; and when they 
               <br />
               gave us their reasons why they had with-
