               where such an idea has prevailed, the people 
               <br />
               have grown up in ignorance, and where there

               is ignorance there is a corresponding amount 
               <br />
               of slavery. We ought not to impose such

               conditions upon this new country in the

               Mr. F. A. LAURENCE (Colchester). Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, I am reminded by the clock in 
               <br />
               front of me that the night is far spent and 
               <br />
               that the patience of the members of this 
               <br />
               House has already been considerably taxed. 
               <br />
               It would be improper, therefore, for me to 
               <br />
               prolong the debate this evening beyond a 
               <br />
               very few minutes, especially as I shall have 
               <br />
               an opportunity to complete my observations 
               <br />
               when the discussion is resumed. In offering 
               <br />
               to address the House upon this subject, im- 
               <br />
               portant as it is, I have no expectation what- 
               <br />
               ever that I can contribute anything to this 
               <br />
               debate. I rather seek an opportunity to .ad— 
               <br />
               dress myself to the House for the purpose 
               <br />
               of expressing my views and giving the rea- 
               <br />
               sons for the vote which I shall give upon 
               <br />
               this Bill.

               I do so as a duty to myself and as a duty 
               <br />
               also to the constituents whom I directly 
               <br />
               represent in this parliament. It is nothing 
               <br />
               new to say that this is a very important 
               <br />
               measure. It is important, Sir, from many 
               <br />
               considerations. It_ is important because it 
               <br />
               marks the period when two new provinces 
               <br />
               are to be admitted to the union or the Do- 
               <br />
               minion of Canada. It is important by rea- 
               <br />
               son of the vastextent of those two immense 
               <br />
               territories which are to be presently erected 
               <br />
               into two provoinces as part of our Dominion. 
               <br />
               We are informed that each of these pro— 
               <br />
               vinces will comprise no less an area than 
               <br />
               275,000 square miles. The mind of man 
               <br />
               almost fails to grasp the signiﬁcance, the 
               <br />
               vastness, the greatness of these ﬁgures. 
               <br />
               We can only faintly do so, Sir, by compari— 
               <br />
               son, and I may be permitted to say that 
               <br />
               each of these provinces will be nearly six 
               <br />
               times as large as the great state 01! New

               quarter millions; each of them will be ﬁve 
               <br />
               times as great in point of area as the large 
               <br />
               state of Illinois, with its population of 5,-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">000,000;</span> each will be six times as large as

               This Bill deals, among other things, with

               the question of the public lands of these 
               <br />
               provinces. It proposes to leave them vested 
               <br />
               in the Dominion, as they are now and have 
               <br />
               been vested since they were acquired. For 
               <br />
               myself, I entirely concur with the argu- 
               <br />
               ments which were addressed to this House

               of immigration, Sir, I think ought to be

               This Bill deals with another question,

               perhaps not more important, although one
