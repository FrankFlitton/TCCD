               Now Sir, that prophesy of the Montreal 
               <br />
               ‘ Witness’ is pretty nearly correct. It is 
               <br />
               not absolutely correct because the ex-min- 
               <br />
               ister (Mr. Sifton) did not wait until next 
               <br />
               week and he most certainly did not make 
               <br />
               a strong speech. With these two triﬂing 
               <br />
               exceptions the ‘Witness’ article is true. 
               <br />
               When one considers the position of the ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> reminds us of 
               <br />
               the cartoon which was widely circulated 
               <br />
               throughout this country some years ago at 
               <br />
               the expense of another politician; it was 
               <br />
               a very pretty picture with the legend at 
               <br />
               the bottom : The cat came back.

               We had the privilege of hearing the ex- 
               <br />
               minster this afternoon and you remember 
               <br />
               the excuse he gave. He was perfectly pre— 
               <br />
               pared to accept the present clauses, but he 
               <br />
               feared the original clauses because he 
               <br />
               thought they might be liable to introduce 
               <br />
               some of these ordinances of an ephem- 
               <br />
               eral character that had come and gone 
               <br />
               years ago, and he also feared that 
               <br />
               peradventure a university might be 
               <br />
               founded in years to come in the dis- 
               <br />
               tant Northwest, and when founded it 
               <br />
               might lead to dissensions between majori- 
               <br />
               ties and minorities in that unhappy coun- 
               <br />
               try. One feels inclined to protest against 
               <br />
               such an affront to the intelligence of the 
               <br />
               members of this House, as for a gentleman 
               <br />
               who occupies such an exalted position to 
               <br />
               venture to come before parliament with 
               <br />
               such an excuse as this. We cannot be very 
               <br />
               much surprised if the majority in this coun- 
               <br />
               try are inclined to think that the truth, the 
               <br />
               whole truth and nothing but the truth has 
               <br />
               not been told them by hon. gentlemen op- 
               <br />
               posite in their account of the effect of this 
               <br />
               Bill. If further conﬁrmation of such sus- 
               <br />
               picions were necessary, one has but to look 
               <br />
               at the arguments advanced by hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite in support of their Bill. As I 
               <br />
               have said, the burden rests on a govern- 
               <br />
               ment which brings down a Bill to show 
               <br />
               good and suﬂicient reason to justify its 
               <br />
               passage.

               Let us look at the arguments advanced 
               <br />
               by the leading gentlemen on the opposite 
               <br />
               side of the House who have spoken. The 
               <br />
               right hon. the Prime Minister spoke first, 
               <br />
               and assuming that a gentleman of his 
               <br />
               ability made the best argument that could 
               <br />
               be made in favour of the Bill, let us see 
               <br />
               what his statements were. His ﬁrst justi— 
               <br />
               ﬁcation for it was, because of the cleavage 
               <br />
               between Roman Catholics and Protestants; 
               <br />
               a cleavage on matters of dogma. Now, 
               <br />
               if the statement of the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance is true, what earthly difference 
               <br />
               does such a cleavage make? Let the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic children be instructed by 
               <br />
               their priests from half-past three to four 
               <br />
               and the children of any Protestant denomin- 
               <br />
               ation be instructed by their ministers from

               half past three to four, and where is there 
               <br />
               any necessity of referring to a cleavage .in 
               <br />
               dogma, and how can that affect the ques- 
               <br />

               tween Roman Catholics and Protestants ? 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics and Protestants are not all 
               <br />
               the people of this country. The Minister 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interior</span> is perhaps responsible for 
               <br />
               other complications that may arise when 
               <br />
               we come to consider <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cleavage’in</span> doctrine; 
               <br />
               because I believe the hon. member for East 
               <br />
               Grey (Mr. Sproule) will object to some of 
               <br />
               the settlers in the Northwest being classed 
               <br />
               as adherents of the Protestant faith. Where 
               <br />
               will you put the Doukhobors, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mormons.</span> 
               <br />
               the members of the Greek Church ? Are 
               <br />
               they Protestants? If the only cleavage to 
               <br />
               be considered is a cleavage in doctrine, 
               <br />
               between two bodies, perhaps something may 
               <br />
               be said for separate schools; but if the 
               <br />
               cleavage between Mormons and Protestants 
               <br />
               is as broad as the cleavage between Pro- 
               <br />
               testants and Roman Catholics—and I trust 
               <br />
               that it is broader or if the cleavage be- 
               <br />
               tween Protestants and Doukhobors is as 
               <br />
               broad—and I believe it is just as broad— 
               <br />
               then why should there be separate schools 
               <br />
               instead of national schools ? The Hon. 
               <br />
               George Brown, whose speeches in the Sen— 
               <br />
               ate have often been quoted in admiration, 
               <br />
               in objecting to separate schools, pointed 
               <br />
               out that if they were allowed, Anglicans and 
               <br />
               Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists were 
               <br />
               just as much entitled to them as any other 
               <br />
               class of the community; and .hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite who are sufﬁciently instructed 
               <br />
               ir. theology will bear me out when I say 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between the high church 
               <br />
               Anglican and the Roman Catholic is much 
               <br />
               less than the difference between the high 
               <br />
               church Anglican and the adherent of the 
               <br />
               denominations commonly known as Pro- 
               <br />
               testant. . 
               <br />
               Then the hon. gentleman said: Give the 
               <br />
               Northwest the same rights as are given to 
               <br />
               Quebec and Ontario. Why did the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman say that? In the British North 
               <br />
               America Act there was no confederation 
               <br />
               of Quebec and Ontario. There was a con- 
               <br />
               federation of four provinces—Quebec, On- 
               <br />
               tario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were not 
               <br />
               given separate schools, Ontario and Que- 
               <br />
               bec were not given separate schools, by the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> of Union; and when these provinces 
               <br />
               are coming‘into a partnership in which there 
               <br />
               are seven provinces, and only two have 
               <br />
               separate schools, on what ground can the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman say that as a matter of right 
               <br />
