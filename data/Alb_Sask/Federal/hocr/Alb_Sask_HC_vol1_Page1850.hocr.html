               to the contrary contained in any ordinance 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories. I have here

               the declaration made by the Minister of

               Justice on the 8th of June to that effect. 
               <br />
               I have also the declaration made by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice this afternoon, saying 
               <br />
               that my amendment meant a re-enactment 
               <br />
               of everything which the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Beauharnois intends to secure to the min- 
               <br />
               ority in the Northwest. Therefore, so far as 
               <br />
               the legal strength of my amendment is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, I rely upon the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               who is the legal adviser of this government 
               <br />
               and of this parliament. It may be that I 
               <br />
               am mistaken, but, I suppose, if I am mis- 
               <br />
               taken, no suspicion should rest upon me in 
               <br />
               following so distinguished a legal light 
               <br />
               rather than following those whom I do not 
               <br />
               consider legal lights, the ex-Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior (Mr. Sifton) and the Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance (Mr. Fielding). The hon. Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Inland Revenue (Mr. Brodeur) tries 
               <br />
               to continue on his own account the eﬂ'orts 
               <br />
               made by some hon. gentlemen on the other 
               <br />
               side to fasten upon me the reputation of a 
               <br />
               demagogue. And it was the friendly pleas— 
               <br />
               anti-y of my hon. friend the Solicitor Gen- 
               <br />
               eral (Mr. Lemieux) to couple my name with 
               <br />
               that of the hon. member for East Grey 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sproule). But unfortunately for the 
               <br />
               views of these hon. gentlemen, a quarter of 
               <br />
               an hour after the Solicitor General and the 
               <br />
               Minister of Inland Revenue voted with the 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Grey against the 
               <br />
               amendment of the hon. member for Labelle 
               <br />
               (Mr. Bourassa). Mr. Chairman, it is not 
               <br />
               my habit to discuss—the Solicitor General 
               <br />
               reminds me that he shirked the vote.

               Mr. BOURASSA. That is a little joke, 
               <br />
               it means simply that if the Solicitor Gen-

               whole Liberal party occupied on the 21st of 
               <br />
               February; and it I am a demagogue now, 
               <br />
               and if my name should be coupled with 
               <br />

               last night, I should not be denounced by

               justice among the English Protestants of 
               <br />
               this country to do justice to the minority

               Inland Revenue that I do not seek shelter 
               <br />

               <br />
               peated it last night, that if this question had

               <br />
