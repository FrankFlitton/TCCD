               people were of the Roman Catholic majority, 
               <br />
               these were the very people whom my hon. 
               <br />
               friend (Mr. Sproule) says were driving the 
               <br />
               Protestants out and yet they went to the 
               <br />
               United States in considerably larger num- 
               <br />
               bers, even proportionately, than the Pro- 
               <br />
               testant minority of that province. The 
               <br />
               statement of the Huntingdon ‘Gleaner’ is 
               <br />
               absolutely unfounded and far-fetched. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend has here again shown his credu- 
               <br />
               lity when listening to stories about the 
               <br />
               condition of affairs in Quebec. If he went 
               <br />
               to Quebec and studied a little more on the 
               <br />
               spot, he would not make such statements 
               <br />
               as he has done. It has been said that the 
               <br />
               Catholics can go to Protestant schools, that 
               <br />
               there is no earthly reason why Catholics 
               <br />
               should not go to Protestant schools because 
               <br />
               offensive religion is not taught in public 
               <br />
               schools, but that Protestant children cannot 
               <br />
               go to Catholic separate schools because the 
               <br />
               Catholic religion is taught in them. So far 
               <br />
               as the province of Quebec is concerned, I 
               <br />
               do not know that there is any more reason 
               <br />
               why the Protestants should object to their 
               <br />
               children going to a Catholic school in that 
               <br />
               province than why a Catholic should 
               <br />
               object to his children going to a 
               <br />
               Protestant school. It is true that the lion.

               <br />
               I am sorry my hon. friend said that, because

               the Catholic religion is taught in the Catho-

               I have received. I have here the curricula

               Now what do I ﬁnd in regard to Protestant

               Under these circumstances, I want to repel

               the statement of the hon. member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for,</span> Beau- 
               <br />

               bec are Godless and secondly I want to 
               <br />
               point out that it is no more right that the 
               <br />
               Protestants of Quebec or the Protestants of 
               <br />
               this country should ask that the Catholics 
               <br />
               should be forced to go to Protestant schools 
               <br />
               than it is that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestants</span> should be 
               <br />
               forced to go to the Catholic schools. The 
               <br />
               legitimate and logical conclusion of this 
               <br />
               statement is that we must have in Canada 
               <br />
               separate schools, and if we have separate 
               <br />
               schools, Sir. that they should be guaranteed 
               <br />
               to the people who enjoy them and that they 
               <br />
               should not be dependent on the will of a 
               <br />
               local majority which may change its mind.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There is another argument in favour of 
               <br />
               separate schools. Supposing that we have 
               <br />
               public schools in which no religion is taught 
               <br />
               at all. We have a large number of people 
               <br />
               in this country who believe that a proper 
               <br />
               and good education requires religious in- 
               <br />
               struction, that it is necessary in a school to 
               <br />
               have the children taught in religious exer— 
               <br />
               cises. If in public schools religion is not 
               <br />
               taught and if Catholics are obliged to pay 
               <br />
               their taxes to the public schools, then if 
               <br />
               they want to live up to their conscientious 
               <br />
               convictions they would be obliged instead 
               <br />
               of sending their children to the public school 
               <br />
               to keep them at home or to create out of 
               <br />
               their own pockets With their voluntary sub- 
               <br />
               scriptions private schools in which their 
               <br />
               form of education should be taught. Now, 
               <br />
               Sir, if their taxes are obliged to be paid to 
               <br />
               the public schools, it is very evident that 
               <br />
               these same people cannot effectively and 
               <br />
               efﬁciently keep up private schools as well 
               <br />
               owing to the payment of their taxes into 
               <br />
               the public schools. It is not to be expected 
               <br />
               that they could do so, and the result
