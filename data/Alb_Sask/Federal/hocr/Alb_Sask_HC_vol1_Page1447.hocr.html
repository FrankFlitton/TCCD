               Who has ever lived in that country must 
               <br />
               know, it is the spread of settlement over

               the still vacant areas that is really the 
               <br />
               main cause of the increase of land values,

               from this effort to spread settlers over the

               yet unoccupied territory, the tendency to

               I think the experience of the past few 
               <br />
               years has shown clearly, in the ﬁrst place, 
               <br />
               that the results in regard to the settle- 
               <br />
               ment of the lands .in the Territories have 
               <br />
               been satisfactory. Those results to the 
               <br />
               whole Dominion have been so very deﬁnilte 
               <br />
               and so very satisfactory, that we cannot 
               <br />
               afford—it would not be sound public policy 
               <br />
               —to change a system which has resulted 
               <br />
               so satisfactorily, in the face of the exper- 
               <br />
               ience which we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span> regard to the pro— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> vinces which have the ownership of their 
               <br />
               lands. It may be said, and it is quite 
               <br />
               true, that a government sitting here <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vin</span> Ot- 
               <br />
               tawa might at some future time reverse 
               <br />
               the present policy of free lands in the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. If that were done, it would re— 
               <br />
               verse the argument which I have made 
               <br />
               here to-day. Certainly the government 
               <br />
               that was in power <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">until]</span> 1896 did not have 
               <br />
               the policy of the land for the people which 
               <br />
               has prevailed since; but I believe that the 
               <br />
               people of this country, through the exper- 
               <br />
               ience of the past few years, have arrived 
               <br />
               at a deﬁnite understanding that the policy 
               <br />
               of free lands is the policy for the well- 
               <br />
               being of this Dominion, and I can scarcely 
               <br />
               believe that even a change of government 
               <br />
               would bring about a change of that policy. 
               <br />
               The people of the Dominion at large have 
               <br />
               become so well aware of the beneﬁts re- 
               <br />
               sulting from the rapid settlement of the 
               <br />
               Northwest through the giving of its lands 
               <br />
               free to settlers, that I cannot imagine any 
               <br />
               Dominion government reversing that 
               <br />
               policy. But a provincial government 
               <br />
               cramped for money, as all our provincial 
               <br />
               governments are, deriving no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">d‘il-ect</span> re- 
               <br />
               venue from the inﬂux of settlers, but car- 
               <br />
               rying an increased burden by reason of 
               <br />
               every ship load of immigrants that arrived 
               <br />
               would be likely to adopt a policy of admin- 
               <br />
               istration of the lands for revenue, which 
               <br />
               would be injurious in the ultimate end <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               the province itself, and still more to the

               <br />

               Mr. SPROULE. The great reason why 
               <br />
               Ontario does not get the bulk of the immi- 
               <br />
               grants whom it otherwise would get is 
               <br />
               the fact that so much prairie land has been 
               <br />
               opened up for settlement, on which people 
               <br />
               prefer to go and get immediate returns 
               <br />
               rather than go on timber land and clear 
               <br />
               it up. I want to put myself on record as 
               <br />
               being in favour of the provinces having 
               <br />
               their lands. We have only one instance in 
               <br />
               the Dominion of a province not owning its 
               <br />
               land, that is, Manitoba, and we have had 
               <br />
               complaints from that province ever since 
               <br />
               It has been a province, and applications for 
               <br />
               the right to control its land-s. In view of 
               <br />
               that experience, it seems to me that we 
               <br />
               should avoid committing the same blunder 
               <br />
               in connection with the new provinces which 
               <br />
               we are establishing. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               says the Dominion has a greater interest 
               <br />
               in securing settlers than the province has. 
               <br />
               I do not think it has, and I do not see why 
               <br />
               it should have. It is said that the province 
               <br />
               would not have as much interest as the 
               <br />
               Dominion, because it would not have free 
               <br />
               grant lands; but all the land in the North— 
               <br />
               west is not free grant. While a portion 
               <br />
               of it is free, as is the case in Ontario, we 
               <br />
               still reserve a portion that may be sold to 
               <br />
               recoup the public treasury for the outlay. 
               <br />
               The Dominion is following very much the 
               <br />
               same system as is being followed by some 
               <br />
               of the provinces. We gave the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba a portion of the swamp lands; it 
               <br />
               applied for more, and complained because 
               <br />
               we withheld what we did. If it is a griev- 
               <br />
               ance to the people of Manitoba that the 
               <br />
               Dominion withheld the public lands, it must 
               <br />
               be equally so to the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. I see by a return which 
               <br />
               has been brought down that there are 938,- 
               <br />
               813,210 acres of land in the Territories not 
               <br />
               yet taken up. A large portion of that ls 
               <br />
               not ﬁt for settlement; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but'as</span> settlement 
               <br />
               goes on and improvements take place, and 
               <br />
