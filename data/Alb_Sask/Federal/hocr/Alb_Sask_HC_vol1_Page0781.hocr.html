               I think, Sir, these words, wise, clear, and 
               <br />
               epigrammatic as they are, fairly well des- 
               <br />

               tlemen opposite are trying to excite in this

               country ; and I think the outcome of it will 
               <br />
               be just what Mr. Balfour has described as 
               <br />
               the outcome of the agitation in England at 
               <br />

               hon. leader of the opposition moving an 
               <br />
               amendment for which he cannot even carry 
               <br />
               his own party, still less attract votes from 
               <br />
               outside of his party. We have him appeal- 
               <br />
               ing to provincial rights. We have him appeal- 
               <br />
               ing to a very small and unimportant part of 
               <br />
               provincial rights, and ignoring the right of 
               <br />
               restriction in regard to education lest we 
               <br />
               may magnify the general right. We ﬁnd

               his friends, and largely his press, appealing 
               <br />
               against separate schools; and here again 
               <br />
               they cannot carry with them those who, in 
               <br />
               their party as in ours, are best able to judge

               atical appeal. We ﬁnd, on the other side, 
               <br />
               a united party, a party which, in bringing 
               <br />

               one, now appeals for support to the people 
               <br />
               of this country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iSir,</span> here as always the 
               <br />
               Tories stand for coercion, while the Liberals 
               <br />
               stand for conciliation and the recognition 
               <br />
               of the rights of the minority. Here as al- 
               <br />
               ways we ﬁnd the struggle between the two 
               <br />
               classes of people in the country. I have full 
               <br />
               enough conﬁdence in the people of this Can-

               country, in every part and in every province, 
               <br />

               some—not a majority, Sir—not even a large 
               <br />
               minority—may be led away and blinded by 
               <br />
               fanatical appeals, appeals mostly made with 
               <br />
               sinister and ulterior motives, and not honest 
               <br />

               of the great advance and progress which 
               <br />
               we have made in the near past. I am satis- 
               <br />
               iied that the great mass of the people of 
               <br />

               <br />
               will suppport and endorse it. I do not like 
               <br />
               to prophesy ; it is better to state things after 
               <br />
               the event; but from what hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite and their press in the country have 
               <br />
               said, it is probable that this Bill and these 
               <br />
               clauses will be supported in this House by 
               <br />

               <br />
               any government measure for many years. 
               <br />
               Sir, I can expect that; I think we have a 
               <br />
               right to expect it ; because these clauses em— 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Speaker, I will not detain you or this 
               <br />
               House longer. I trust that these few words 
               <br />
               will throw a little light, at any rate on one 
               <br />
               or two points of this question. I have tried 
               <br />
               thus to put before the House the reasons 
               <br />
               why, as a Protestant from the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec especially, I am in favour of separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools, and why I want to see them in- 
               <br />
               troduced into the Northwest Territories, and 
               <br />
               their continuance guaranteed on behalf of 
               <br />
               the Catholic minority there. I speak not 
               <br />
               only as a member from the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec, but as a member of the government of 
               <br />
               Canada, and a citizen who is interested in 
               <br />
               our country, and I believe, Sir, that the only 
               <br />
               way by which we can cement the people of 
               <br />
               this country together is by conciliation, by 
               <br />
               recognition of the rights of minorities, by 
               <br />
               helping the weak in order to make them as 
               <br />
               good as the strong.
