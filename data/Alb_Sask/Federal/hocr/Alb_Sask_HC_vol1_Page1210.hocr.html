               Sir WILFKID LAURIER. I understand

               that there is very little waste land in these

               the hon. gentleman. In Manitoba there was 
               <br />
               a good deal ot‘ swamp lauds, but I am told 
               <br />
               by the members from the Northwest that 
               <br />
               there are no swamp lands in the new pro-
