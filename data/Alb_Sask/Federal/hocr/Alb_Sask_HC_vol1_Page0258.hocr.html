               such experience as we have recently had

               the clause inserted in Mr. Haultain’s draft 
               <br />

               cussed, or even fairly understood, I presume, 
               <br />
               it would be necessary to make sure that we 
               <br />
               realize the difference between ‘continue’ and 
               <br />

               vinces in the Northwest, we should get 
               <br />
               along without any law at all until the legis- 
               <br />
               lature can meet ? Surely not. And this 
               <br />
               section 3 simply perserves for the time be- 
               <br />
               ing the laws in existence on the 1st of

               <br />
               been put in every law creating a province, 
               <br />
               simply to provide a body of laws until the 
               <br />
               legislature can meet and pass laws to con- 
               <br />
               tinue the laws that have been handed over 
               <br />
               or repeal or amend them. Yet, the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Edmonton tries to construe this 
               <br />
               Bill as simply giving to the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest what they asked for in their 
               <br />
               draft Bill. But I have already indicated 
               <br />
               the difference—we may have asked for it 
               <br />
               for the time being; but we do not ask to 
               <br />
               have the present system of schools per- 
               <br />

               <br />

               in the Northwest with regard to strikes, no 
               <br />
               doubt the hon. member for Edmonton would 
               <br />
               like to have it kept on the statute—book 
               <br />
               until the legislature could meet and pass 
               <br />
               such a law. He says also: 
               <br />

               I say that in view of the fact that these 
               <br />
               separate schools have been in existence for 20 
               <br />

               But I ﬁnd that on reference to the Jour- 
               <br />
               nals of the legislative assembly, for 1889, 
               <br />
               page 65 and for 1890, page 129, that there 
               <br />
               were certain proceedings of that assembly 
               <br />
               of which the hon. member for Edmonton did 
               <br />
               not inform the House. Now I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875 deals with education, and 
               <br />
               I am going to trouble the House while I

               is necessary for the point I desire to make.
