            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The whole matter seems to be involved in 
               <br />
               a great deal of mystery. Has the govern- 
               <br />
               ment entered into arrangements, or taken 
               <br />
               into consideration the erection of a fence 
               <br />
               the cost of which, to my mind. must run 
               <br />
               away up into hundreds of thousands of do]- 
               <br />
               lars, and all this Without ever consulting 
               <br />
               parliament as to whether parliament would 
               <br />
               approve of the erection of a fence in that 
               <br />
               section of the country ? That, I think. in 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place, was an improper thing. Then, 
               <br />
               an undertaking such as that, I certainly say, 
               <br />
               should have been given the widest publicity. 
               <br />
               Tenders should have been advertised for 
               <br />
               all over this country, because fence building 
               <br />
               companies are not rare. I wonder what 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Grey (Mr. Tel- 
               <br />
               ford) will think of supporting a govern- 
               <br />
               ment which would undertake to do a work 
               <br />
               of this kind in this way. In his town, I 
               <br />
               think, there is a fence company that would 
               <br />
               be very glad to tender for a work of this 
               <br />
               kind. You ﬁnd them here and there through—
