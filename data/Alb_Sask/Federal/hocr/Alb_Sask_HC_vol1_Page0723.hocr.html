               Mr. Haultain claims that the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories came into 'the union in 1870,

               Mr. Haultain argues that section 93 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act applies as at 
               <br />
               the time when the territory was annexed 
               <br />
               to the Dominion. In other words. he says 
               <br />
               the new provinces are entitled under the
