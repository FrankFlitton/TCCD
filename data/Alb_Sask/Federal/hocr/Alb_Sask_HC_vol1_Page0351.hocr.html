               <br />
               the statement of my hon. friend. but I had 
               <br />
               thought—and I think every member in this

               House will agree with me that it was a 
               <br />
               very legitimate thought—that the leader of 
               <br />
               one of the great parties in this House, in a 
               <br />
               matter of this kind, would naturally con- 
               <br />
               sult with his supporters and followers and 
               <br />
               be, to a very large extent, guided by their 
               <br />
               opinions. If he has not consulted the Wishes 
               <br />
               of the people with whom he is associated 
               <br />
               on that subject, if he has not consulted the 
               <br />
               wishes of the county of Carleton which he 
               <br />
               represents, he is entitled to make the state- 
               <br />
               ment he has. But I thought it was only 
               <br />
               natural that he would consult his followers 
               <br />

               that I did not think it was a question upon

               <br />

               heard that they have ever given him any 
               <br />
               mandate to represent them. So far as my

               nounced it in caucus the day before I spoke 
               <br />
               in this House, and I did not announce it 
               <br />
               as a matter on which they should dictate

               <br />
               suspicion on this side that in taking the 
               <br />
               course he did, he took the lines indicated

               <br />
               ther he consulted them or not. There is 
               <br />
               a very shrewd suspicion that the game he 
               <br />
               is playing to-day is that which the gentle- 
               <br />
               men who sit behind him have set for him, 
               <br />
               that he is following the pace they set for 
               <br />
               him, and that, not with a great deal of 
               <br />
               relish, it is evident, but still bravely enough, 
               <br />
               he is trying to keep ahead of the procession 
               <br />
               which these gentlemen have organized. He 
               <br />
               realized at the outset that in doing so he 
               <br />
               was going to alienate a great many of his 
               <br />
               friends in the province of Quebec. He rea- 
               <br />
               lized that the course he was inspired to 
               <br />
               take was going to alienate his friends in 
               <br />
               the province, and he tried to make up for 
               <br />
               it by paying them compliments. They 
               <br />
               asked him for bread and e gave them a 
               <br />
               stone. They asked him bread, and he 
               <br />
               gave them petriﬁed bouquets. I wonder 
               <br />
               if the hon. gentleman deceived himself to 
               <br />
               the extent of believing that any one in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec is to be hoodwinked by 
               <br />
               these empty and sonorous compliments. If 
               <br />
               he did, he had a very prompt, rude and sad 
               <br />
               awakening. Within a few hours from the 
               <br />

               <br />
               was on his feet, and in a remarkable speech 
               <br />
               destroyed to atoms the_ speech which his

               this question is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">boomerang.</span> and that

               while the ranks of the opposition <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> 
               <br />
               are divided, the ranks of the Liberal party 
               <br />
               present an unbroken front. When the

               vote is taken on this question there will be 
               <br />
               given for the Bill the largest majority that

               Mr. Speaker, I have spoken much longer 
               <br />
