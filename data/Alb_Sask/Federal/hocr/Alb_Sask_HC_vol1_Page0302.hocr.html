               In the province at the union ! In the pro- 
               <br />
               vince at the time that it joined the union, as 
               <br />
               for instance, Ontario and Quebec as the hon. 
               <br />
               Postmaster General admitted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-night.</span> He 
               <br />
               said-we have these schools here because we 
               <br />
               had them when we came into the union, and 
               <br />
               he then proves our case further by saying 
               <br />
               that Nova Scotia and New Brunswick do not 
               <br />
               have these schools because they did not 
               <br />
               have them when they came into the union, 
               <br />
               and that British Columbia did not have them 
               <br />
               when they came into the union. That was 
               <br />
               the reason why they did not have them. 
               <br />
               Now, here is where I begin to disagree with 
               <br />
               him. He says it is fair to say to the people 
               <br />
               in the Northwest: You are not a province, 
               <br />
               we are about to make you a province for the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst time, we do not know whether you will 
               <br />
               establish separate schools or not but we will 
               <br />
               take you by the throat and make you do it. 
               <br />
               That is great logic. That is a wonderful 
               <br />
               argument to come from a statesman like the 
               <br />
               hon. Postmaster General, as he called him- 
               <br />
               self two or three times to—night, although no- 
               <br />
               body applauded him when he did it. That 
               <br />
               was the logic that came from this would be 
               <br />
               statesman. If we apply his logic it means 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this:</span> Here are people twenty-one years of 
               <br />
               age having the right to vote who have voted 
               <br />
               for a certain thing, being fully enfranchised 
               <br />
               and entitled to vote on the question, while 
               <br />
               on the other hand we are going to entran— 
               <br />
               chise another man who has not now a vote 
               <br />
               and make him vote what we direct all his 
               <br />
               life. That is a fair interpretation of the 
               <br />
               argument which the Postmaster General has 
               <br />
               made. We are going to say because we are 
               <br />
               creating a province that you shall do exactly 
               <br />
               what Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island and British Columbia did 
               <br />
               not have to do. Although British Columbia 
               <br />
               did not have to adopt a separate school sys- 
               <br />
               tem we say to these new provinces that it 
               <br />
               you come in you must establish a separate 
               <br />
               school system because they have one in 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec. No such thing was 
               <br />
               said to British Columbia. Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island did not have to adopt the separate 
               <br />
               school system, but in regard to these new 
               <br />
               provinces we say: You haVe not a system 
               <br />
               of separate schools but we are going to 
               <br />
               make it certain you must have one because 
               <br />
               you cannot come into the union if you do not ‘ 
               <br />
               have separate schools as they have them in 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec. These other provinces 
               <br />
               were allowed to do as they liked. They were 
               <br />
               provinces that were fully enfranchised and 
               <br />

               want to bother with the legal aspect 'of this 
               <br />
               question. The hon. Minister of Customs 
               <br />
               was very anxious to get away from the legal 
               <br />
               question. He said that Christopher Robin- 
               <br />
               son’s opinion was not quite the same as that 
               <br />
               of the hon. leader of the oppostion, that they 
               <br />
               were both excellent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lawyers—he</span> spoke cor-

               rectly about that—that the hon. the Minister

               of Justice disagreed with the legal opinion

               of these gentlemen and that he was a good 
               <br />
               lawyer. But I have not seen the opinion of 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Justice yet. The hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs may know quietly. or 
               <br />
               through some secret channel of the cabinet. 
               <br />
               what the opinion of the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice is, but I do not know what it is. 
               <br />
               But, we will assume that it was contradic- 
               <br />
               tory of and different from the opinion of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the leader of the opposition. 
               <br />
               What was the wise solution of the Minister

               of Customs ? What was the advice that he 
               <br />
               gave us in his great wisdom ? He says that 
               <br />
               as these lawyers differ about the question as 
               <br />
               to whether the Dominion of Canada has the 
               <br />
               power to go on and settle that question we 
               <br />

               The argument of the Minister of Customs 
               <br />
               was, that as the lawyers differed as to 
               <br />
               whether Canada has the power to enact 
               <br />
               this legislation, the wise thing to do to 
               <br />
               settle the question was for this parliament 
               <br />
               to take the power. It is an easy thing for 
               <br />
               the Minister of Customs to get away from

               the legal and constitutional aspect ot‘ the 
               <br />
               question, but it never occurred to him that 
               <br />
               there was a still more common sense solu- 
               <br />
               tion. and that is that provinces could grant 
               <br />
               separate schools if they wanted to and no- 
               <br />
               body disputes that the provinces have the 
               <br />
               power—and that being so, it would be a 
               <br />
               Wise thing to let the new provinces do as 
               <br />
               they like on the question of education. 
               <br />
               There is no dispute that the provinces have 
               <br />
               the power to legislate on education the 
               <br />
               whole dispute is whether the Dominion 
               <br />
               government has the right to force a par— 
               <br />
               ticular system of education upon them. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Customs could not see that 
               <br />
               the easiest solution of the difﬁculty was for 
               <br />
               us to say : as there is a great difference of 
               <br />
               opinion as to whether we have the right 
               <br />
               to do this or not, and as there is no differ- 
               <br />
               ence as to the right of the province to do 
               <br />
               it, then let us trust the province. And so 
               <br />
               these gentlemen opposite believing they have 
               <br />
               a good case for separate schools on the 
               <br />
               merits, should have no reason to fear. But 
               <br />
               that solution did not occur to the cham-
