               not be handicapped with any such tax exemp-

               part of a weathercock politician being waft- 
               <br />
               ed hither and thither by every speech that 
               <br />
               is made in this House. We want a strong 
               <br />
               man at the head of the Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior. We do not want a man who is 
               <br />
               changing his opinions every day. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman states that he has changed his 
               <br />
               opinion on this question and he gives as 
               <br />
               his reason that he was inﬂuenced by the 
               <br />
               speeches made by the hon. member for Ed- 
               <br />
               monton (Mr. Oliver) and the hon. ex—Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*Sifton).</span> Now, he has 
               <br />
               been speaking on public platforms in the 
               <br />
               past, he has been associated with his fellow 
               <br />
               westerners and he knew what their opinions 
               <br />
               were on this question. He has conversed 
               <br />
               with them in private and in public, but it 
               <br />
               only remains after these Bills are introduc- 
               <br />
               ed and after he has listened to a couple of 
               <br />
               speeches in this House that were probably 
               <br />
               repeated to him in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">private</span> on many occas- 
               <br />
               ions for the hon. gentleman to change his 
               <br />
               opinion. Under these auspices he gave ut— 
               <br />
               terance to the following statement in this 
               <br />
               parliament :
