               would undoubtedly be entitled to repeal the 
               <br />
               law just the same as the legislature of 
               <br />
               Manitoba was entitled to repeal the law 
               <br />
               which had been passed after Manitoba came 
               <br />
               into confederation.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I suppose, so fa- as 
               <br />
               that is concerned, if you apply the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of Canada it depends on whether sub- 
               <br />
               section 4 would apply. If my hon. friend 
               <br />
               had been careful enough to read my speech 
               <br />
               he would have seen that I had already pro- 
               <br />
               nounced an opinion on that and he need 
               <br />
               not have asked me the question. I said that 
               <br />
               in my opinion, the application of subsection 
               <br />
               1 might give the answer as to the applica— 
               <br />
               tion of subsection 4, and I thought subsec— 
               <br />
               tion 1 would not apply to conditions existing 
               <br />
               in the Territories. Some hon. gentlemen on 
               <br />
               this side of the House have not taken that 
               <br />
               view, and most hon. gentlemen on the other 
               <br />
               side have taken precisely the opposite view. 
               <br />
               That is a point on which I do not pretend to 
               <br />
               have a very strong opinion. I have not con- 
               <br />
               sidered it very carefully. My proposition 
               <br />
               was simply to apply the constitution of Can— 
               <br />
               ada as contained in the Acts of 1867, 1871 
               <br />
               and 1886 to these new provinces. I was pre- 
               <br />
               pared and am prepared to abide by the re- 
               <br />
               sult of the application of that constitution. 
               <br />
               But in any event, I would point out to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend that the question of remedial 
               <br />
               legislation could not be one of very great 
               <br />
               importance in his opinion, because, if the 
               <br />
               minority in the provinces would apply for 
               <br />
               remedial legislation, undoubtedly my hon. 
               <br />
               friend and his leader would oppose it in the 
               <br />
               future just as they did in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1896.</span>

               Mr. BRODEUR. My hon. friend (Mr. R.

               <br />
               answer and I think I can go a little further 
               <br />
               and ask him : leaving aside what the 
               <br />
               judges may. decide in the future, whether 
               <br />
               in his own opinion he is ready to declare 
               <br />
               that the minority will have the right to 
               <br />
               remedial legislation under the circumstances 
               <br />
               which I have mentioned. The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man (Mr. R. L. Borden) proposes to make 
               <br />
               the law now ; he should know exactly what 
               <br />
               he intends in making that law and he must 
               <br />
               be in a position to declare whether that law 
               <br />
               will be suﬂicient or not.
