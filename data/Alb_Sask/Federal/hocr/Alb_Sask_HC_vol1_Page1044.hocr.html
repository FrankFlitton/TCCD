               <br />
               go beyond the language of the statute itself. 
               <br />
               Sometimes it has been done, but the text 
               <br />
               writers on the construction of statutes are 
               <br />
               rather against allowing the language of de-

               bates in parliament or negotiations previous

               <br />
               tories had no voice in the matter whatever.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for‘the</span> rest, herds of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buffalo.</span> My submission 
               <br />
               is this : that there is a distinction in section 
               <br />
               146 which we must all recognize as the mode 
               <br />
               ot“ admission. In one case colonies or pro- 
               <br />
               vinces could come in by agreement on a 
               <br />
               joint address; in the other case the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories must come in on an address of this 
               <br />
               House approved by an Order in Council. 
               <br />
               The distinction is this : the colonial entities 
               <br />
               referred to in section 146 were to come in 
               <br />
               as provinces having rights subject to the 
               <br />
               terms of the British North America Act as 
               <br />
               stated in these seven words I have quoted. 
               <br />
               But for the Territories, it was provided that 
               <br />
               they should merely come in as a territorial 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enlargement</span> of the country, an increased 
               <br />
               area for Canada; that they should merely 
               <br />
               come within our boundaries and form a part 
               <br />
               of the Dominion of Canada, not subject to 
               <br />
               any agreement or compact they made but 
               <br />
               subject to our will approved by an imperial 
               <br />
               Order in Council. And that is the manner 
               <br />
               in which the provinces did come in. I notice 
               <br />
               that the leader ot” the opposition in one part 
               <br />
               ot‘ his speech takes grave objection to the 
               <br />

               <br />
