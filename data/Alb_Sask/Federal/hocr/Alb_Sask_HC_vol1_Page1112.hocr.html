               which bring men together, which make us 
               <br />
               feel that we should see more of one another 
               <br />

               <br />
               ences of this kind would also dispel the idea 
               <br />
               from the minds of honest men that in the

               formation of a government the personnel 
               <br />

               <br />
               of its members are in favour of provinciail 
               <br />
               rights or opposed to separate schools. One

               of the epochs in the life of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Wellington (Mr. T. Martin) seems 
               <br />
               also to have been in connection with a visit 
               <br />
               to a Roman-a Catholic establishment. This 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, after treading the heather 
               <br />
               of his native heath for some hours and 
               <br />
               quoting the biography or autobiography—I 
               <br />
               do not know which—of one Dr. Robertson, 
               <br />
               goes on to tell how he got over the priest's 
               <br />
               fence in his town. I think that the good- 
               <br />
               will which this hon. gentleman bears to the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic Church rests on the fact 
               <br />
               that the reverend gentleman did not catch 
               <br />
               him on this occasion, and if the facts were 
               <br />
               known we would ﬁnd that the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man probably got under the fence and that 
               <br />
               it was the garden or orchard fence. This
