               heard, whether delegations were invited, or 
               <br />

               <br />
               felt agrieved in the matter to make their

               views known. It would appear that this

               <br />
               a delicate matter. In fact it is evident that

               the hon. the Minister of the Interior, some- 
               <br />
               what like Moses of old, has come down 
               <br />
               with his tables of stone and asks us to ac- 
               <br />
               cept them as though carved by divine power, 
               <br />
               and as though they were too sacred 
               <br />
               to be altered in the least jot or tittle by any 
               <br />
               profane hand. I only hope that before the 
               <br />
               debate is through, the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               will follow the precedent of the law giver 
               <br />
               of old and ﬁnd it advisable to dash his tables 
               <br />
               of stone to the ground and get new ones.

               tial justice to all parties concerned. Let us 
               <br />
               then start on that basis. The First Minister 
               <br />
               has expressed, not only his own desire, but 
               <br />
               no doubt the desire also of his colleagues, 
               <br />
               to do justice in this redistribution ; and 
               <br />
               therefore in the hope that, if we show that 
               <br />
               injustice is done, he will be the ﬁrst to re- 
               <br />
               medy it, we shall continue the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion.</span> 
               <br />
               It is not an easy task to divide a province 
               <br />
               into electoral divisions. Certainly it is not 
               <br />
               an easy task to do so justly, although we 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> almost imagine from the extent of the 
               <br />
               injustice in this schedule that it had been 
               <br />
               an easy task. The government, in clause 12 
               <br />
               oi" the Bill, have given us two of the fact- 
               <br />
               ors which they have evidently taken into 
               <br />
               consideration in dealing with this matter, 
               <br />
               namely, that the electoral divisions shall be 
               <br />
               deﬁned with due regard to the distribution 
               <br />
               of population and existing local divisions, 
               <br />
               Which we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take</span> to mean the divisions in the 
               <br />
               Northwest legislature at present. But there 
               <br />
               are other factors which should be taken into 
               <br />
               consideration in making distribution. There 
               <br />
               are the physical features of the country. It 
               <br />
               is inadvisable that a mountain range, for 
               <br />
               example, should separate two parts of a 
               <br />
               constituenncy, or that an unfordable river 
               <br />
               should cut it in twain, and it is equally inad- 
               <br />
