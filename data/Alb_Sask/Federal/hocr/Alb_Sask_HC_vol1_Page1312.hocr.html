               fences are not of equal value. Because Mr.

               that the price of the fence is a fair one. 
               <br />
               i do not offer any opinion on that except to 
               <br />
               suggest that the prices of different fences 
               <br />
               might properly vary. But the principal point 
               <br />
               and after all the essence of the whole thing 
               <br />
               was this: that there was under consider- 
               <br />
               ation in the department a project for erect- 
               <br />
               ing a fence along the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">boundary</span> line or a 
               <br />
               portion of it. The Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               appears to have attached so much import- 
               <br />
               ance to it that he submitted an estimate 
               <br />
               to this House in order that he might ob- 
               <br />
               tain an appropriation. In the meantime the 
               <br />
               minister had been making inquiries as to 
               <br />
               the cost of these fences and as to the terms 
               <br />
               upon which he might obtain them, and the 
               <br />
               record shows that he invited a tender, ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the documents which the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister has read, from a concern. Whether 
               <br />
               or not he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> have invited tenders from 
               <br />
               others is a fair question of debate, and if 
               <br />
               a contract had been made then undoubtedly 
               <br />
               that would have been a proper Subject of 
               <br />
               discussion. But the deputy minister points 
               <br />
               out that after the resignation of the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior he had to deal with 
               <br />
               this matter, that he was collecting the pa— 
               <br />
               rers together in order that he might sub- 
               <br />
               mit them to the successor of the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior; knowing that the new min- 
               <br />
               ,i-ster would be obliged to submit them 
               <br />
               to Council.

               take could arise has been explained, namely, 
               <br />
               that the secretary of the department, being 
               <br />
               aware that a draft of contract had been 
               <br />

               <br />
               assumed, erroneously, that the matter was 
               <br />
               settled, and he so informed the Page Wire

               secretary himself did not become aware of 
               <br />
               that. I cannot answer that question. There

               has been signed, not a penny of the public 
               <br />
               money has been pledged, nothing has been 
               <br />
               done beyond collecting the information 
               <br />
               which the deputy minister says he desired 
               <br />
               to place before the new minister, so that it 
               <br />
               might be dealt with in the usual way. 
               <br />
               Meanwhile the Department of Justice, in 
               <br />
               considering the draft of the contract submit- 
               <br />
               ted to them, reported that the matter prop- 
               <br />
               erly belonged to the Department of Public 
               <br />
               Works. There the whole matter ends. 
               <br />
               Nothing further was done. no steps were 
               <br />
               taken, no contract was awarded, nobody has 
               <br />
               the fence, nobody has the deal, there is ab- 
               <br />
               solutely nothing whatever beyond collecting 
               <br />
               the information to be dealt with at the 
               <br />
               proper time through the incoming minister,

               Mr. DAVID HENDERSON. Possibly I 
               <br />
               owe an apology to the House for a state- 
               <br />
               ment which I made yesterday. Speaking 
               <br />
               from recollection, I stated that I did not 
               <br />
               believe that an estimate had ever been 
               <br />
               passed by this House to provide for the ex- 
               <br />
               pense of this fence, and therefore I thought 
               <br />
               it was not a proper transaction for the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to enter into, not having received 
               <br />
               the sanction of parliament for the expendi-
