               anxious to speak at this time. I have only 
               <br />

               that not only has an injustice been done to 
               <br />
               him, but a very great injustice has been 
               <br />
               done to the Orange body. I have a large 
               <br />
               number of the members of that order in my 
               <br />
               riding. They are amongst the best citizens

               of South Simcoe—they are not better than 
               <br />
               the others, but I do say emphatically 
               <br />
               that there are none better. I do not

               not call attention to the matter which 
               <br />
               has cropped up in this way. I have re-

               frained from speaking on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">many</span> occasions 
               <br />
               in this debate, because, in common with the 
               <br />
               Orange body of this country, I desire that 
               <br />
               peace and harmony shall prevail amongst 
               <br />
               all classes of the people, that we may 
               <br />
               unitedly work out the destiny of the coun-

               emphasizing those prejudices which make 
               <br />
               for division. If we are to work in peace and
