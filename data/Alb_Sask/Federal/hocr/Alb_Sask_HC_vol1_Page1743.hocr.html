               Mr. FOWLER. Well, from the geographi- 
               <br />
               cal position of Edmonton, it does not strike 
               <br />
               me that the reasons for placing the capital 
               <br />
               there are so obvious as the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior would have us suppose. There 
               <br />
               must be some hidden reason for it which 
               <br />
               has not yet been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disclosed</span> to the committee. 
               <br />
               Is it because that happens to be the resi- 
               <br />
               dence of the minister himself? Can he 
               <br />
               not get beyond the parochial idea ? Surely 
               <br />
               the position he occupies to-day as a minister 
               <br />
               of the Crown should have broadened his 
               <br />
               ideas, and have enabled him to get away 
               <br />
               from the parish in which he resides. Any 
               <br />
               man who studies the situation must be con- 
               <br />
               vinced that Edmonton is not the proper 
               <br />
               place for the capital. but that the proper 
               <br />
               place is the city of Calgary, which is more 
               <br />
               nearly the centre of population in the pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               country, and on the main line of travel, 
               <br />
               the main line of the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way. not on a sidetrack as the city of Ed- 
               <br />
               monton is it seems to me that the min- 
               <br />
               ister is treating this committee with very 
               <br />
               scant courtesy when he shows such a lack 
               <br />
               of explanation for placing the capital in 
               <br />
               this position. I do not think he has any 
               <br />
               right to treat this committee in this cava-

               tricts. That province was divided into four 
               <br />
               federal constituencies. In the two north 
               <br />
               districts of Edmonton and Strathcona the 
               <br />

               of Calgary and Alberta. I may say further

               that the general impression throughout the

               largely towards the northern country. Be- 
               <br />
               sides, throughout the northern country there 
               <br />
               will be shortly two main lines of railways 
               <br />
               built, namely, the Canadian Northern, which

               <br />
               it in a short time. This leads to the in-

               lation of some 11,000 less than in the north-

               <br />
               than would be Edmonton. The argument 
               <br />
               my hon. friend brings forward with respect 
               <br />
               to railways in the future to go through 
               <br />
               Edmonton rather gives the advantage to 
               <br />
               Calgary, because Calgary is not dependent 
               <br />
               on the future for railway communication as 
               <br />
               it has a railway, the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way, running through it now. And the 
               <br />
               maps published by the Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior show that the settlement in the 
               <br />
               southern part of the proposed province of 
               <br />
               Alberta is very much in excess of that in 
               <br />
               the northern part. They show that the 
               <br />
               country to the south is being taken up very 
               <br />
               much more rapidly than the country to the 
               <br />
               north. And that settlement will be great— 
               <br />
               ly increased when the large irrigation canal 
               <br />
               is completed which is now in course of con— 
               <br />
               struction. That will open to settlement two 
               <br />
               or three million acres of very fertile land 
               <br />
               that only require irrigation to become cap-
