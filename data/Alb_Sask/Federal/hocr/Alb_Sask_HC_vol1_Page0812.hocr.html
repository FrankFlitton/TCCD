               <br />
               of the preamble. Section 2 gives us the 
               <br />
               right to establish new provinces and to 
               <br />
               grant them a constitution. It is evident that 
               <br />
               Sir John Macdonald had that section in 
               <br />
               mind when he stated that we had a right 
               <br />
               to grant to the future provinces of the 
               <br />
               Northwest such constitution as we thought 
               <br />
               ﬁt. Now, in 1875, we granted separate 
               <br />
               schools to the Territories. That Act was 
               <br />
               subsequently, and on several occasions, dis- 
               <br />
               cussed before this House ; it was amended, 
               <br />
               revised and it never suggested itself to the 
               <br />
               mind of any one to alter, or strike out of the 
               <br />
               constitution of the Northwest Territories, the

               it was rebuffed in quick order by the Con- 
               <br />
               servative government. But, to—day, who are 
               <br />
               those agitating against that clause of the 
               <br />
               Bill which embodies the present school law 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories, in the con- 
               <br />
               stitution of the new provinces? Are they 
               <br />
               the representatives of the west ‘? Are they 
               <br />
               the representatives of the Territories where- 
               <br />
               in we are carving two new provinces ? No, 
               <br />
               the great majority of the House are in 
               <br />
               favour of that legislation. Those who are 
               <br />
               voicing that grievance are the advocates of 
               <br />
               the so-called provincial rights, Whose self- 
               <br />
               constituted champion, the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey, on that occasion, got ahead even 
               <br />
               of his chief, the leader of the opposition.

               For the sake of provincial rights, do you 
               <br />
               say ? But, there are no such rights in 
               <br />
               existence as yet. Surely, this is only a 
               <br />
               pretense; hon. members, in this House, are 
               <br />
               fully aware that this is not the true reason,

               the real motive of the opposition which has

               been carried on against the Bill. I have no

               <br />
               which is found objectionable, because separ-

               ate schools imply the teaching of religion
