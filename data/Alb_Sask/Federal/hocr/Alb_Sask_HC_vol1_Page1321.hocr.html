               Now I take it that if the Department 
               <br />
               of the Interior wanted to call for tenders for 
               <br />
               this fencing, they would have to recognize 
               <br />
               that section of the Act passed during the 
               <br />
               present session of parliament. But what do 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd them doing? Writing to a firm 
               <br />
               asking them for their ﬁgures regarding the 
               <br />
               building of this fence. The First Minister 
               <br />
               has not stated in his correspondence on 
               <br />
               whose recommendation it was that the De- 
               <br />
               partment of the Interior wrote this ﬁrm of 
               <br />
               McGregor-Banwell. 
               <br />
               in the correspondence brought down. Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, in the correspondence he has given 
               <br />
               to the department, says he had nothing to 
               <br />
               do with it, the member for South Essex says 
               <br />
               he had nothing to do with it, either by recom- 
               <br />
               mendation or otherwise; but the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">First</span> 
               <br />
               Minister has not given us the information. 
               <br />
               Now it would appear that the department 
               <br />
               wrote to the McGregor-Banwell Company 
               <br />
               rto come to Ottawa, they come on the 18th, 
               <br />
               cn the 19th they submit their ﬁgures; and 
               <br />
               could any one pretend to say that the De- 
               <br />
               partment of the Interior, after writing to 
               <br />
               this ﬁrm to come to Ottawa and submit 
               <br />
               their ﬁgures for the construction of this 
               <br />
               fence, and then afterwards advertising for 
               <br />
               tenders, did not intend to give these people 
               <br />
               some advantage after putting them to all 
               <br />
               the trouble of coming to Ottawa ? Would 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">il,</span> not occur to any reasonable mind that 
               <br />
               the object was to defeat this very section 
               <br />
               2 of this Bill, because after getting this 
               <br />
               ﬁrm to come to Ottawa and getting their 
               <br />
               figures, they could give them this work 
               <br />
               to do, and by that means they would not 
               <br />
               have to submit this tender to the Governor 
               <br />
               in Council at all. So, coupling that with all 
               <br />
               these other mishaps that have occurred from 
               <br />
               the commencement, we are driven to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that the Department of the Inter- 
               <br />
               ior intended to do something crooked in 
               <br />
               the transaction. 1 think there can be no 
               <br />
               doubt about it, because Mr. Speaker has 
               <br />
               been misled, the First Minister himself has 
               <br />
               been misled, the ﬁgures in the estimates con- 
               <br />
               tained a mistake, and we are confronted 
               <br />
               with mistakes on every hand. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘In</span> fact,

               <br />
               would they have done? When, on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tlie</span> 
               <br />
               4th of January, 1905, the Minister of the

               Interior intended to have this work done, 
               <br />
               he would naturally have called for tenders, 
               <br />
               he would have advertised or have instruct- 
               <br />
               ed his department to advertise, so that 
               <br />
               tenders could be oîÏered by different parties

               <br />
               submitted them to the Governor in Council

               <br />
               would have been perfectly straight. But 
               <br />
               he has not done that; and I repeat that

               coupling together all these mishaps that

               is With regard to this being aboundary fence 
               <br />
               between the United States and Canada. 
               <br />
               I have not been able to hear the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister very well <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> but from What 
               <br />
               I understood him to say in reply to the 
               <br />
               member for South York, no correspondence 
               <br />
               had been held with the government of the 
               <br />
               United States in regard to this boundary 
               <br />
               line fence. If that is the case, I think it is 
               <br />
               a very unfortunate circumstance. We all 
               <br />
               know what boundaries mean, we all know 
               <br />
               they are more fruitful of discord among 
               <br />
               friends, discord among neighbouring farmers, 
               <br />
               and discord among those who own territory 
               <br />
               alongside each other, than any other thing 
               <br />
               that can be mentioned. Now it appears 
               <br />
               no ordinary precaution has been taken.
