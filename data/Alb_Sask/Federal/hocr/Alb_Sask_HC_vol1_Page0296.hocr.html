               Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. 'Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               this House is being favoured with peti- 
               <br />
               tions. The hon. gentleman says that the

               Orange and the Green are working together 
               <br />
               for the good of the Conservative party. He 
               <br />
               is doing his share in one way, and the Jac- 
               <br />
               ques Cartier Club, his host, appears to be 
               <br />
               doing its share in another way; and thus 
               <br />
               the Orange and the Green are getting in 
               <br />
               their work. I hold in my hand a copy of a 
               <br />
               communication signed by Elie Maurault, 
               <br />
               Secretary of the Jacques Cartier Club. I 
               <br />
               do not know the gentleman; but the writer 
               <br />
               of this communication does not appear to 
               <br />
               share the sentiments of the member for 
               <br />
               East Grey. The member for East Grey has 
               <br />
               been promoting one line of campaign, while 
               <br />
               his club in Quebec has been promoting an- 
               <br />
               other line. It is all right if it stirs up strife, 
               <br />
               so long as both get in their work for the 
               <br />
               good of the Conservative party ; the Orange 
               <br />
               and the Green. as he says, working toge—

               baited with the orange, and some one else 
               <br />
               with the green. May I ask the member for 
               <br />
               East Grey what part he took in getting this
