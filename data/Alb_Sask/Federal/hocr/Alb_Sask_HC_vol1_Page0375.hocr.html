               <br />
               course of action of the new provinces in 
               <br />
               the Northwest. It deprives these new pro-

               vinces of the right to manage their own 
               <br />
               affairs as the older provinces are free to 
               <br />
               manage theirs. In this respect, the mea— 
               <br />
               sure does not carry out the principle of con- 
               <br />
               federation. . And it comes with doubly bad 
               <br />
               grace from a Prime Minister who comes 
               <br />
               from Quebec, a province that insisted upon 
               <br />
               a form of confederation which would make 
               <br />
               their provincial rights secure. Now that the 
               <br />
               rights of his own province are established, 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Prime</span> Minister attacks the provincial 
               <br />
               rights of the new provinces in the west. 
               <br />
               In view of all this I say we are face to 
               <br />
               face with a great crisis and there is strong 
               <br />
               excitement throughout our country. And 
               <br />
               why ? Because of the outrage upon the 
               <br />
               feelings and opinions of the people who 
               <br />
               have no opportunity to help themselves. 
               <br />
               Should this continue ? I say it should not. 
               <br />
               I have called attention to the fact that dis- 
               <br />
               regard of our constitutional system almost 
               <br />
               drove one province into revolt, and, if it

               <br />

               did not know when the Minister of the In-

               Minister of the Interior were here or not,

               know that the proposition has been put 
               <br />
               forward that the ministers represent lo- 
               <br />
               calities, and that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">areIto</span> be trusted

               and occupying so much attention in this 
               <br />
               House and in the country at large? Not one,

               Sir, and so far as any information is given 
               <br />
               by the First Minister to-day, there will be no
