               province of Manitoba which I think is en- 
               <br />
               titled to fair consideration. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1:</span> Manitoba has 
               <br />
               asked to have her territory extended to the 
               <br />
               shores of Hudson‘s bay; and this is a 
               <br />
               prayer which seems to me to be entitled 
               <br />
               to a fair hearing. The province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               is not, however, the only one whose terri- 
               <br />
               tory could be extended towards Hudson’s 
               <br />
               bay. The province of Ontario would have 
               <br />
               the same right; the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               would also have that right; and the new 
               <br />
               province of Saskatchewan also. |Therefore, 
               <br />
               in the project which we have to present to 
               <br />
               the House to-day, instead of including in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> province of Saskatchewan that portion

               once, and I have the authority of my col-

               leagues to make the announcement, that we 
               <br />
               propose to invite the province of Ontario, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               wan to meet us here to decide whether or 
               <br />
               not it is advisable that the limits of any 
               <br />
               of these provinces should be extended to 
               <br />
               the shores of Hudson’s Bay, and if so, in 
               <br />
               what manner it should be done. We have 
               <br />
               not considered the matter yet, but perhaps 
               <br />
               it may not be unadvisable even to consult 
               <br />
               the other provinces. I venture to think that 
               <br />
               the proposal which I now make to the 
               <br />

               itself to the approval of all those who have

               -culty to the members of the committee who 
               <br />
               had the preparation or this Bill, has been 
               <br />
               the selection of the capitals of the respec-

               tive provinces. As to the capital or the 
               <br />
               province of Saskatchewan, the difﬁculty is 
               <br />
               easily solved, it will be, as it is at pre- 
               <br />
               sent, Regina. But as to the capital of 
               <br />
               Alberta, the selection was not so easy. 
               <br />
               There were three claimants for it—Calgary, 
               <br />
               Red Deer and Edmonton, each of which 
               <br />
               had a good claim. We have decided that 
               <br />
               we would not make any ﬁnal selection, 
               <br />
               leaving the ﬁnal selection to the province 
               <br />
               itself. In the meantime, if you look at 
               <br />
               the map, you will see that Edmonton seems 
               <br />
               to be the most central point, and therefore 
               <br />
               we propose to make Edmonton the capital

               to their governments. This plea was no 
               <br />
               doubt suggested by the fact that at the 
               <br />
               time of confederation, all the parties to the 
               <br />

               vinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec, each retained her own 
               <br />
               lands ; and when at a later day the province 
               <br />
               of British Columbia was admitted to the 
               <br />
               Dominion, she also retained her lands. But, 
               <br />
               Sir, the cases are not at all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parallel.</span> When 
               <br />
               the provinces which I have named came 
               <br />
               into confederation, they were already sov- 
               <br />
               ereignties. I use that term, because bar- 
               <br />
               ring their dependence as colonies they were 
               <br />
               sovereignties in the sense of having the 
               <br />
               management of their own affairs. Each 
               <br />
               had a department of government called the 
               <br />
               Crown Lands Department, which was en— 
               <br />
               trusted with the power of dealing with 
               <br />
               those lands, either for revenue or for settle- 
               <br />
               ment. But the case of these new provin- 
               <br />
               ces is not at all similar. They never had 
               <br />
               the ownership ,of the lands. Those lands 
               <br />
               were bought by the Dominion government, 
               <br />
               and they have remained ever since the pro- 
               <br />
               perty of the Dominion government, and 
               <br />
               have been administered by the Dominion 
               <br />
               government. Thereforelsay the two cases 
               <br />
               are not in any yvay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parallel;</span> they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indeed</span> 
               <br />
               absolutely diﬂerent. When the province's 
               <br />
               which I have named came into confedera— 
               <br />
               tion they retained the ownership of their 
               <br />
               lands; but when the two new provinces 
               <br />
               come into the Dominion, it cannot be said 
               <br />
               that they can retain the ownership of their 
               <br />
               lands, as they never had the ownership. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Therefore, the proposition that in equity 
               <br />
               and justice these lands belong to the prov- 
               <br />
               inces is not tenable. But for my part I 
               <br />
               would not care, in a question of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">import»</span> 
               <br />
               ance, to rest the case on a mere abstract pro- 
               <br />
               position. We must view it from the 
               <br />
               grounds of policy; and from the highest 
               <br />
               grounds of policy, I think it is advisable 
               <br />
               that the ownership of these lands should 
               <br />
               continue to be vested in the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. We have precedents for this. This 
               <br />
               is a case in which we can go to the United 
               <br />
               States for precedents. They are situated 
               <br />
               very much as we are regarding the owner- 
               <br />
               ship of lands and the establishment of new 
               <br />
               states. Whenever a new state has been 
               <br />
               created in the American Union, the Federal 
               <br />
               government has always retained the owner- 
               <br />
               ship and management of the public lands. 
               <br />
               And when we take the records of our own 
               <br />
               country, we know that when Manitoba was 
               <br />
               brought into the Dominion, that province 
               <br />
               was not given the ownership of her lands. 
               <br />
