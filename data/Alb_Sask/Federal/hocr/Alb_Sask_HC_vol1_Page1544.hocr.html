               constituencies in the old district of Alberta

               m which is included two constituencies which 
               <br />
               were formerly in Saskatchewan; that is to 
               <br />
               say part of Vermilion, Saskatchewan, and 
               <br />
               Medicine Hat. With regard to Athabaska, 
               <br />
               'we have given two constituencies to Atha- 
               <br />
               baska, and the reason- is this: There is 
               <br />
               now a small population, not a very large 
               <br />
               population in Athabaska. I would remind 
               <br />
               my hon. friend that there is a wide differ- 
               <br />
               ence between the Western part of Atha- 
               <br />
               baska and the eastern part. The eastern 
               <br />
               part; that is to say the part which is north 
               <br />
               of Saskatchewan has not yet been settled. 
               <br />
               There may be a few hunters and a few 
               <br />
               Indians, but there is no settled population 
               <br />
               there, whereas in the western part of Atha- 
               <br />
               baska there are settlers now going up on 
               <br />
               the Peace river which is a good fertile dis- 
               <br />
               trict, in which population is increasing, in 
               <br />
               which there is agriculture, in which there 
               <br />
               are to-day two grist mills. Then you have 
               <br />
               the river Athabaska district which is the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">line</span> of travel from the north to the south. 
               <br />
               and in which there are several small esta- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">blishments.</span> It has been hinted, I think 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. M. S. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) that these two districts were 
               <br />
               not entitled to two representatives. I grant 
               <br />
               at once that perhaps they are a little below 
               <br />
               the unit—but I invite the criticism of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Calgary as to the reasons 
               <br />
               Why we gave two representatives. They

               hon. friend (Mr. Oliver). We have endea- 
               <br />
               voured to get at the present population by 
               <br />
               different data such as the number of post 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁces,</span> entries of homesteads, and such data 
               <br />
               as is in our possession and which we thought 
               <br />
               would be more correct than guess work.
