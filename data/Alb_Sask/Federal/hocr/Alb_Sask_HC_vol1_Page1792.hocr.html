               <br />
               he is afraid they may not otherwise get. 
               <br />
               What excuse did the Minister of Justice give 
               <br />
               for proposing this amendment? He said: 
               <br />
               ‘I do not wish to be misunderstood. It is 
               <br />
               because we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> sure that these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights</span> 
               <br />
               would be secured to the minority if we al- 
               <br />
               lowed the whole of section 93 to go into 
               <br />
               operation in connection with this Act, that 
               <br />
               we are proposing to amend a portion of that 
               <br />
               section 93, and substitute clause 16 for the 
               <br />
               old clause, which provides that we shall 
               <br />
               amend section 93 by reading into it the or- 
               <br />
               dinances as they exist to-day in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Noztli-</span> 
               <br />
               west Territories, and thereby amend the 
               <br />
               constitution.’ What did the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               say when he introduced this Bill ? He said: 
               <br />
               ‘ We are standing on the rock of the consti- 
               <br />
               tution.‘ But he contended that as the min- 
               <br />
               ority in the Northwest Territories enjoyed 
               <br />
               separate schools to-day, and as th0se schools 
               <br />
               had been in existence for so many years, 
               <br />
               this provision would bring them under the 
               <br />
               constitution and secure to them that right 
               <br />
               in perpetuity. Now, here was something 
               <br />
               that rather amused me, and that I thought 
               <br />
               was scarcely consistent with that statement. 
               <br />
               Following it, the row broke out between 
               <br />
               the present government and the late Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior,</span> and they succeeded in 
               <br />
               bringing him back by amending the clause 
               <br />
               in question. The Prime Minister said: ‘We 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> have been unfortunate in our language, 
               <br />
               but what we desired to perpetuate is what 
               <br />
               exists in the Northwest to-day.’ But what 
               <br />
               exists there to-day is not by any means 
               <br />
               what was given under the Act of 1875. If 
               <br />
               the rights given under the Act of 1875 were 
               <br />
               what the 'minority fell heir to, the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister admitted that he did not intend to 
               <br />
               perpetuate those rights, but that he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intended</span> 
               <br />
               to perpetuate what was grafted on that Act 
               <br />
               by the ordinances and the amendments made 
               <br />
               to it and the regulations. Is that consis- 
               <br />
               tent with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position‘he</span> took, that he was 
               <br />
               standing on the rock of the constitution? 
               <br />
               In my judgment it was not. Then there 
               <br />
               was a controversy. between the late Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior and the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               as to who drafted the original clause 16, 
               <br />
               and why it was drafted as it was.
