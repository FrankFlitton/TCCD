               Mr. PATERSON. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               does not deny it. Are we then bound to

               that is a part of their policy, they had better 
               <br />
               bring Mr. Rogers too, because he has said 
               <br />
               a great many things in his manifesto which 
               <br />
               are very difﬁcult to reconcile or to under-

               tion at the bar of the House as to what

               has transpired, it would be very nice to put 
               <br />
               some questions to Mr. Rogers. It would be 
               <br />
               very nice to ask him, in the ﬁrst place, how 
               <br />
               he came to write that manifesto which any- 
               <br />
               body reading it would suppose to mean that 
               <br />
               he himself was the one who had the inter- 
               <br />
               view with the Papal ablegate. He speaks 
               <br />
               in the plural, the hon. gentleman says, and 
               <br />
               he was one of the deputation. And in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               document also he speaks im the singular—he 
               <br />
               says ‘I ’ rather a mixed document. Like to 
               <br />
               know where the singular ceases and the 
               <br />
               plural commences. Like to know why he 
               <br />
               thought it necessary to write such a docu- 
               <br />
               ment. His indignation, it would seem, was 
               <br />
               aroused against this Papal delegate for 
               <br />
               daring to suggest such a thing to him, but 
               <br />
               he had no opportunity, apparently, to ex— 
               <br />
               press his indignation for six long weeks. 
               <br />
               And at last, when he had time to express 
               <br />
               his indignation, he carefully dug out from 
               <br />
               ‘Hansard,’ or somewhere else, correspond- 
               <br />
               ence that had taken place between certain 
               <br />
               parties years ago, when some members of 
               <br />
               this House professing the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               faith had communication with the head of 
               <br />
               their church in reference to matters in 
               <br />
               which there was feeling in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec in which these gentlemen resided. 
               <br />
               And these things are dragged in here. What 
               <br />
               for ? Why to work upon the feelings and 
               <br />

               <br />

               this matter was before the country, and

               all the documents in ‘ Hansard,’ before 1904
