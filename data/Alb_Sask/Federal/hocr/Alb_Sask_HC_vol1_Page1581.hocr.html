               dule was brought to this House. Within 
               <br />
               two weeks there were protests from the 
               <br />
               Liberals and Conservatives in Calgary. 
               <br />
               There were protests from Raymond on the 
               <br />
               south to Red Deer on the north, a distance 
               <br />
               of 200 miles; from Medicine Hat to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Pincher</span> 
               <br />
               Creek, east and west, a distance of 150 
               <br />
               miles. There were protests from 30,000 
               <br />
               miles of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">territory</span> occupied by 130,000 .people.
