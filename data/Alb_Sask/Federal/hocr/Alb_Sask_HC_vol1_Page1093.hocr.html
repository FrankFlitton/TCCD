               a great many very decent men among them.

               say that the man who can issue such a

               at which we are told great enthusiasm was 
               <br />
               exhibited. At this meeting the Grand Master 
               <br />
               and several other gentlemen—a good many 
               <br />

               Mr. KENNEDY. I have a lot of good 
               <br />
               friends in the Orange order, who, I am con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdent, will not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allow</span> themselves to be led 
               <br />
               by men who do not know what they are 
               <br />
               talking about. and I am convinced that it‘ 
               <br />
               there should be an election in my constit- 
               <br />
               uency to-morrow, I would have a good solid 
               <br />
               support from these very men.

               public schools such as is provided for in 
               <br />
               these Bills. I believe that even if this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">L'heu-</span>

               pect on the autonomy of the provinces, they 
               <br />
               still should pass in their present form as 
               <br />
               they will give peace to these new provinces 
               <br />
               —peace, such as some of the older provinces 
               <br />
               did not know about some years ago and 
               <br />
               which some of _them are in danger of los- 
               <br />
               ing now. Why did these gentlemen send 
               <br />
               out these circulars and petitions ? Why 
               <br />
               did they not instruct the people so that they 
               <br />
               would know intelligently what they were 
               <br />
               doing and not require them to sign what 
               <br />
               they did not understand. I do not think 
               <br />
               that was exactly a square thing to do, as 
               <br />
               I think these gentlemen will ﬁnd out to their 
               <br />
               cost later on.

               I just wish to make a few remarks on 
               <br />
               some of the observations I have heard from 
               <br />
               some of the other speakers. Our hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Leeds (Mr. Taylor) must be a mind 
               <br />
               reader or a prophet or he must have some 
               <br />
               secret spies in his pay among the cabinet 
               <br />
               ministers. In what other way could he 
               <br />
               have secured all the information which he 
               <br />
               gave us the other day? He seemed to be 
               <br />
               able to,tell us everything that was said and 
               <br />
               done in the secret cabinet councils and in 
               <br />
               the interviews between cabinet ministers 
               <br />
