               The ﬁrst feature of the Bill to which I 
               <br />
               wish to draw your attention has reference 
               <br />
               to the ownership of the lands. It has been 
               <br />
               said that the lands should be owned by the 
               <br />
               provinces themselves. That may be true 
               <br />
               in many cases ; but in view of the fact that 
               <br />
               ithis government has expended so much 
               <br />
               money in bringing the proper kinds of immi- 
               <br />
               grants into this country, and has got the 
               <br />
               immigration system on a good basis, we 
               <br />
               surely ought to leave that matter in the 
               <br />
               hands of those Who have brought it to such 
               <br />
               a successful issue. We want the best class 
               <br />
               of immigrants we can have in this country, 
               <br />
               and I believe the government are exercising 
               <br />
               precautions to secure that class. We have 
               <br />
               never before had such a rush of immigrants 
               <br />
               into this country as we have to-day. We 
               <br />
               are delighted to have so many coming from 
               <br />
               the American union—bur own Canadian sons 
               <br />
               coming back to live with us again and bring- 
               <br />
               ing their families with them, and others who 
               <br />
               went from European countries to the United 
               <br />
               States and graduated in the school of agri- 
               <br />
               culture there and learned how to farm on 
               <br />
               a system suitable to a prairie country. These 
               <br />
               are the kind of people we want, and when 
               <br />
               this government is doing so much to bring 
               <br />
               them, why should we not leave the immi- 
               <br />
               gration in their hands '? The only way we 
               <br />
               can do that is to leave in their hands the 
               <br />
               control of the lands. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There is another thing which we should 
               <br />
               take into consideration. You <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"know</span> that 
               <br />
               we have in the Northwest a large extent 
               <br />
               of country which is very fertile, provided 
               <br />
               it is supplied with fresh water by means 
               <br />
               of a proper system of irrigation. There are 
               <br />
               millions of acres of that kind of lands in 
               <br />
               the .west and we want to see these lands 
               <br />
               brought into the best possible state of cul- 
               <br />
               tivation. They are being settled by a 
               <br />
               thrifty class of people, progressive farmers 
               <br />
               who are doing well on these lands and we 
               <br />
               want to have it clear for all time to come 
               <br />
               that there shall be a sufﬁcient amount of 
               <br />
               water for proper irrigation there. This 
               <br />
               brings us into direct antagonism with some 
               <br />
               of the States of the American Union. There 
               <br />
               are some streams which originate in the 
               <br />
               United States and ﬂow into our country and 
               <br />
               difﬁculties are already cropping up between 
               <br />
               this country and the border states. Surely 
               <br />
               we ought to have this matter in the hands 
               <br />
               of the Canadian government so that they 
               <br />
               will be able to take hold of it and carry it 
               <br />
               through to a successful issue.

               There is one feature in particular about

               I assert that it Mr. Rogers states that Mon- 
               <br />
               seigneur Sbarret‘ti did press him to make the 
               <br />
               suggestion of terms and conditions which he 
               <br />

               it has taken place without my participation, 
               <br />
               and I never heard of it in any way <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whatever</span>

               until last Saturday, when the matter was
