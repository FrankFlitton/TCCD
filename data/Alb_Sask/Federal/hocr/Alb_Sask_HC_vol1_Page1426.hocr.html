               over the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Territories Act as 
               <br />
               amended for the purpose of seeing Just 
               <br />
               how this provision would work out. It may 
               <br />
               be. as the Minister of Justice says, that it 
               <br />
               will work out all right. I am not prepared 
               <br />
               to say at the moment that it will not. It 
               <br />
               will of course require very careful con- 
               <br />
               sideration of the various sections of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories Act, and I have no 
               <br />
               doubt the Minister of Justice has given 
               <br />
               them the most careful consideration. I 
               <br />
               observe that section 5 of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories Act provides that the 
               <br />
               Governor in Council may from time 
               <br />
               to time appoint an administrator to execute 
               <br />
               the objects and functions of the Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor during his absence, illness, or 
               <br />
               other inability. That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> not be incon- 
               <br />
               sistent, I suppose, with anything contained 
               <br />
               in this Bill ; but is it the intention that this 
               <br />
               parliament or the legislature of the province 
               <br />
               should make provision for such a case ? I 
               <br />
               am not mentioning this because it is of very 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> importance. but only as an illustra-

               But that is simply illustrative of the gen-

               eral position as to What provisions of Dom-

               legislation will remain subject to our con-

               trol. Possibly we may be continuing Dom-

               inion legislation which may be very em-

               barrassing to the provincial authorities, and 
               <br />

               I did not draft this clause, and I am some- 
               <br />
               what embarrassed by the form of the lan- 
               <br />
               guage in the ﬁrst line. It was drawn by 
               <br />
               Mr. Newcombe, who is much more familiar 
               <br />
               with this kind of work than I can presume 
               <br />
               to be. The explanation I have received is 
               <br />
               that the intention is to repeal the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories Act, but at the same time to 
               <br />
               continue those provisions of that Act which 
               <br />
               would form the body of the law—in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact,</span>

               the common law of the Territories, and of

               careful consideration of that section, which 
               <br />
               does not deal with a matter of very great

               us in going to the imperial parliament. We

               reason why we should examine all these

               its full provincial authority. It is practically

               dealing with a territory which has been ex-

               us. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’So</span> it is a case of exceeding diﬂiculty, 
               <br />
               and I want to see that in this important con- 
               <br />
               stitutional Act we are making provision for 
               <br />
               everything that can possibly arise.

               Mr. BARKER. I would like the minister 
               <br />
               to explain this. It has been understood that 
               <br />
               clause 16 is to disappear from this Bill and 
               <br />
               what we may call the hon. member for

               Brandon’s clauses are to take its place. 
               <br />
               But under section 15 as it is now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worded,</span> 
               <br />
               will not section 16 come back as section 11 
               <br />
               of the Act of 1875 and be beyond the control 
               <br />
               of the provinces ?

               <br />
               section 16 as it is proposed to amend it and
