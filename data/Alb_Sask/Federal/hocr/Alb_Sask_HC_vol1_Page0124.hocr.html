               Now we insist by the clause of the Act of 
               <br />
               1875 which has been included in the various

               Mr. McCarthy, it will be observed, as an 
               <br />
               opponent of the system of separate schools, 
               <br />
               took the ground that if the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada wished to destroy that system it 
               <br />
               must not wait until it undertook to create 
               <br />
               a province. His argument is that if you 
               <br />
               leave these NorthWest people in possession 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the separate school system, if you go on

               you approve of them and allow them to go 
               <br />
               into operation, then you are conﬁrming the

               come in and say; we will deprive you of

               this : That if this question of separate schools

               <br />
               grant provincial autonomy to any portion of

               province that has joined the confederation has 
               <br />
               been entitled to, what Manitoba was entitled 
               <br />
               to, and what I submit under the circumstances

               <br />
               me draw attention to the constitution con- 
               <br />
               ferred upon Manitoba in that regard. I have 
               <br />
               not got it under my hand, but it will be found 
               <br />
               on consulting it that when we conferred au— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonomy</span> upon the province of Manitoba, we did 
               <br />
               it by reference to the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What.</span> we declared was that where not 
               <br />
               otherwise provided for in the Act, all the 
               <br />
               provisions of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               should apply to the province of Manitoba, and 
               <br />
               I think the very same words were contained 
               <br />
               in the resolutions which were passed at the 
               <br />

               <br />
               that we have got that precedent before us;

               that was the promise upon which we admitted 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and looking at the character of the 
               <br />
               legislation. I do not think that there can be

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impression—he</span> will probably say that he 
               <br />
               certainly did not so intend—that Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson had expressed no opinion favour- 
               <br />
               able to the continuance of separate schools 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories. Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson, in answer to Mr. McCarthy. did 
               <br />
               state that the parliament of Canada could 
               <br />
               give to the Northwest Territories such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span>

               constitution as it might see ﬁt; but in do- 
               <br />
               ing so Sir John Thompson used words which 
               <br />
               unmistakably show that in his mind that 
               <br />
               moral obligation would exist. Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson said :
