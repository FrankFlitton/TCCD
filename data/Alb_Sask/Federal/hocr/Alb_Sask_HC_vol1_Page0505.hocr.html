               Now, this to my mind is conclusive that Sir

               Wilfrid in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">combination</span> with Monseigneur 
               <br />
               Sbarretti had hoped by their present course to

               carry out the promise given through their accre-

               <br />
               underhand way. In view of the foregoing, 
               <br />
               I am sure that Sir Wilfrid Laurier owes it to 
               <br />
               the people of this province to at once give a 
               <br />
               reason why we are not entitled to im- 
               <br />
               mediate consideration and action other than 
               <br />
               the ﬂimsy excuse which he has already himself 
               <br />
               created in his invitation to Mr. Whitney to ad- 
               <br />
               vance a claim to some portion of Keewatin 
               <br />

               It is certainly idle for any person to assume 
               <br />

               <br />
               hand Sir Wilfrid's attitude carries with it

               evidence of a full knowledge of arrangement,

               <br />

               On Monday last, which was the 3rd of 
               <br />
               April, I brought down to this House a re- 
               <br />
               turn to an address moved for some time ago 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Marquette (Mr. 
               <br />
               Roche), asking for copies of all correspon- 
               <br />
               dence that had taken place between the 
               <br />
               government of Manitoba and this gov- 
               <br />
               ernment on the subject of the exten— 
               <br />
               sion of the boundaries of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               The last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paper</span> upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> return was 
               <br />
               the acknowledgment of the receipt of our 
               <br />
               reply to the prayer of the Manitoba govern— 
               <br />
               ment. We have received since that time a 
               <br />
               further rejoinder by Manitoba to our reply. 
               <br />
               We did not bring it down on Monday with 
               <br />
               the return, because we had not then re- 
               <br />
               ceived it. It arrived at the Privy Council 
               <br />
               ofﬁce only yesterday. 1 at once gave orders 
               <br />
               to the clerk of the Privy Council to have 
               <br />
               it prepared for presentation to the House 
               <br />
               and I have to-dny laid it on the table of 
               <br />
               the House. In all this there was no evi— 
               <br />
               dence of any intention to conceal anything. 
               <br />
               There was nothing to conceal, this was a 
               <br />
               public document. Then I see by the corre- 
               <br />
               spondence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the order of the Manitoba 
               <br />
               government was passed on the 31st of 
               <br />
               March, which was last Friday. It was 
               <br />
               sent to us on the following day, Saturday. 
               <br />
               it could not therefore get here until yes- 
               <br />
               terday morning, and as soon as it was re— 
               <br />
               ceived by us, as I said a moment ago, I 
               <br />
               gave instructions to have it prepared and 
               <br />
               laid on the table of the House, so as to 
               <br />
               form part of the correspondence which the 
               <br />
               people of this country have a right to have 
               <br />
               before them. Now, I pass to another state- 
               <br />
               ment of Mr. Rogers:
