               <br />
               refer to Manitoba as being little, as being 
               <br />
               only a postage stamp, and that kind of 
               <br />
               thing, it is belittling that province. I was 
               <br />
               saying that Manitoba, if not so large in 
               <br />
               territory as some other provinces, is big 
               <br />
               in other ways, and it is of very great im- 
               <br />

               <br />
               done more to advertise Canada than any 
               <br />
               other province. Manitoba has been the 
               <br />
               great factor in opening up and developing 
               <br />
               the territory which we are now dividing 
               <br />
               into provinces. The early pioneers in Mani- 
               <br />
               toba have been of untold value to the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion of Canada. Without the development 
               <br />
               and the prosperity that we have in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories to—day, the eastern prov- 
               <br />
               inces would not be in their present pros-

               <br />
               The hon. member for Eastern Assiniboia 
               <br />
               (Mr. Turriff), speakinghere the other even- 
               <br />
               ing, referred to the dread which the people 
               <br />
               in the territory just west of Manitoba have 
               <br />
               of attaching themselves to that province, ow- 
               <br />
               ing to the enormous debt at present resting 
               <br />
               upon it. There is no doubt that those 
               <br />
               people would hesitate very much before 
               <br />
               they would agree to subject themselves to 
               <br />
               a heavy increase of taxation, and the condi- 
               <br />
               tions in Manitoba to-day have had a good 
               <br />
               deal to do with creating &amp; feeling on their 
               <br />
               part against uniting with us. Knowing 
               <br />
               these conditions myself, I could not very 
               <br />
               well expect an extension of the boundaries 
               <br />
               of the province in that direction. But I 
               <br />
               would like to say that we are going to get 
               <br />
               an extension to the north and the east. I 
               <br />
               do not value that extension very much. It 
               <br />
               is largely a matter of sentiment. When 
               <br />
               we take up this question with the govern- 
               <br />
               ment here, whatever party may be in power, 
               <br />
               we shall have to consider not only the ex- 
               <br />
               tension of the boundaries of Manitoba, but 
               <br />
               the question of a greater subsidy on ac-

               without.

               friends. Go back to 1870, when Manitoba 
               <br />
               was brought into confederation, and what 
               <br />
               did they give us '! A very small terri- 
               <br />

               <br />
               about 1881 we got an extension of the 
               <br />
               boundaries. The federal government made 
               <br />

               <br />
