               aside for the moment I want to be precise 
               <br />
               in the position I take, -I want to be quite 
               <br />
               sincere about this, for it is a. serious mat- 
               <br />
               ter. I hold the Conservative party res- 
               <br />
               ponsible for the fact that two sets of peti- 
               <br />
               tions are being circulated in this country 
               <br />
               at present—one addressed to the people of 
               <br />
               Ontario for the purpose of creating prejudice 
               <br />
               in their minds against this Bill and the 
               <br />
               other addressed to the people of Quebec for 
               <br />
               a like purpose. My hon. friend the member 
               <br />
               for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) charged us 
               <br />
               with not having consulted the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest who are most concerned in this 
               <br />
               Bill. I say, and I say it deliberately, that 
               <br />
               an attempt is being made to prejudice the 
               <br />
               people of Ontario against this Bill. And 
               <br />
               for what reason <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for-sooth</span> '? Because they are 
               <br />
               jealous that a Catholic happens to be con- 
               <br />
               nected with it.

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I rather like to hear 
               <br />
               my hon. friends interrupt me. There must 
               <br />
               be some reason for it. When I rose in fear 
               <br />
               and trembling to follow the Goliath of the 
               <br />
               opposition, I did not expect so much success. 
               <br />
               As far back as 1902, Mr. Speaker, a Bill 
               <br />
               was prepared by the executive of the North— 
               <br />
               west <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> in anticipation of that an- 
               <br />
               tc-nomy which is now about to be granted.
