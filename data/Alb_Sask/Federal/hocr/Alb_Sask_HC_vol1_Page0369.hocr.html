               in this connection I called attention to the 
               <br />
               peculiar condition, namely, that we are

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Yes, and this 
               <br />
               is a reason why, in my estimation, instead 
               <br />
               of pressing the matter, we should exercise 
               <br />
               a little delay. This Bill cannot be postponed 
               <br />
               if we intend to have these provinces begin 
               <br />
               operations on the 1st of July next. There 
               <br />
               are many reasons why this should be done. 
               <br />
               the people expect it, and therefore we can- 
               <br />
               not delay the prosecution of the Bill. But 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman wants us at the same 
               <br />
               time to proceed with the Bill and to proceed 
               <br />
               with an election in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, or somewhere else. I do not think. 
               <br />
               under the circumstances, we can do any- 
               <br />
               thing else than to proceed, as governments 
               <br />
               have always proceeded in these matters, 
               <br />
               and to take time to consider who is the best 
               <br />
               man to seek to ﬁll this position. There are 
               <br />
               numerous precedents, of which I will refer 
               <br />
               to a few. There has been a vacancy before 
               <br />
               in the portfolio on the Interior. For in- 
               <br />
               stance, the Department of the Interior had 
               <br />
               been ﬁlled by a very able man. the Hon. 
               <br />
               Thomas White. from the 5th of August, 
               <br />
               1885. to the 21st April, 1888, and then a 
               <br />
               vacancy occurred through the death of that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eentleman.</span> That vacancy remained from 
               <br />
               the 21st April to the 3rd August, 1888, not 
               <br />
               one month. not two months, not three 
               <br />
               months, but more than three months elapsed 
               <br />
               before the vacancy was ﬁlled. This oc— 
               <br />
               curred during a session of parliament, and 
               <br />
               I do not remember that any word of criti- 
               <br />
               cism was made against the government 
               <br />
               because they did not proceed immediately 
               <br />
               to ﬁll that portfolio. But that is not all. 
               <br />
               I would call attention to another important 
               <br />
               department of the government. the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Railways. That department was 
               <br />
               created on the 20th of May, 1879, it was 
               <br />
               ﬁlled by Sir Charles Tupper, who occupied 
               <br />
               the position until the 23rd of May, 1884. 
               <br />
               when the position became vacant and re- 
               <br />
               mained vacant—how long ? To the 25th of 
               <br />
               September, 1884? No, but until the 25th 
               <br />
               of September, 1885, nearly a year and four 
               <br />
               months. But that is not all. The Hon. 
               <br />
               John Henry Pope occupied the portfolio 
               <br />
               from September 25, 1885, to April 1, 1889. 
               <br />
               when a vacancy again occurred by the death 
               <br />
               of Mr. Pope, and the portfolio remained 
               <br />
               vacant until the 28th of November, 1889, 
               <br />
               when it was ﬁlled by Sir John A. Macdon- 
               <br />
               ald. He occupied the post of Minister of 
               <br />
               Railways until the 6th of June, 1891. when 
               <br />
               the portfolio became vacant and remained 
               <br />
               so until the 11th of January, 1892, when 
               <br />
               it was ﬁlled by the hon. member for Lanark

               series of months. It has been practically 
               <br />
               taken over by another gentleman who is 
               <br />
               not responsible in the way that a minister 
               <br />
               is. I am not at all saying that he would not. 
               <br />
               make a very good responsible minister, but 
               <br />
               no man can in a lay position, so to speak, 
               <br />
               administer a department with the same 
               <br />
               power and with the same sense of responsi- 
               <br />
               bility as one .who is specially appointed 
               <br />
               under the law. So that, in reference to that 
               <br />
               the maxim which has been so often men- 
               <br />
               tioned here of late that the King‘s govern- 
               <br />
               ment must go on applies. The King’s gov- 
               <br />
               ernment must go on. It will not wait even 
               <br />
               for illness or for death or for any of these 
               <br />
               circumstances. The affairs of the country 
               <br />
               are over and superior to all these and there 
               <br />
               is not the least doubt in the world that the 
               <br />
               department suffers from the lack of a res- 
               <br />
               ponsible head.
