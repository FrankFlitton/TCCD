               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Very good. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">luen</span> I understand that the position taken 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) is 
               <br />
               that the provinces come in with their legis— 
               <br />
               lative authority, with their school legisla- 
               <br />
               tion, and that we are bound by the consti- 
               <br />
               tution to apply that school system. That is 
               <br />
               all my theory; I never went further than 
               <br />
               that. We are bound to apply the system 
               <br />
               which is now in force, the only difﬁculty 
               <br />
               that there is now will be to ascertain what 
               <br />
               is the system in force in the Territories 
               <br />
               which we are going to make into provinces. 
               <br />
               But, Sir, although my hon. friend to-day 
               <br />
               takes a position which is somewhat ambi- 
               <br />
               guous, for my part I take the ground that 
               <br />
               we are bound constitutionally at this table 
               <br />
               to insert <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislative</span> provisions which will 
               <br />
               make the system of schools which exists in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories to—day absolute 
               <br />
               and beyond the purview and the powers of 
               <br />
               the legislature. That is to say, we are 
               <br />
               bound to apply the principles of the consti- 
               <br />
               tution.

               that it is the provisions of section 93 which 
               <br />
               must apply. We come now to the question 
               <br />
               of what is involved in this proposition, but 
               <br />
               We have to apply section 93. What is the

               system which prevails to-day in the North—

               attention that we had given to this matter. 
               <br />
               The Act of 1875, I may observe, which is 
               <br />
               the organic law of the provinces up to this 
               <br />
               moment, was not a school Act, it was simply 
               <br />
               an organic law. It did not pretend to frame 
               <br />
               a school law for the Territories, it did not 
               <br />
               pretend to enact a school system, it simply 
               <br />
               put forth certain rights which were to be 
               <br />
               pilots to, the legislative power when it 
               <br />
               came to exercise its authority. It imposed 
               <br />
               certain restrictions on the legislative powers 
               <br />
               of the Territories which they were bound to 
               <br />
               observe. Now what were these restrictions? 
               <br />
               I cannot do better than give the very words‘ 
               <br />
               of the Act itself. The Act stated this :
