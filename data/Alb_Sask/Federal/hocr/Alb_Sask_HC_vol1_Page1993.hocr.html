               <br />
               Territories are concerned, through Hon. 
               <br />
               George Brown, voiced this sentiment: You 
               <br />
               have passed this legislation; you have set- 
               <br />
               tled the question for all time ; it has passed 
               <br />
               out of the domain of Dominion controversy. 
               <br />
               I gave you the views of those who pro- 
               <br />
               moted this legislation and were favourable 
               <br />
               to it. Here I give you also the opinion 
               <br />
               concerning it and the construction put upon 
               <br />
               by the man who most bitterly opposed it. 
               <br />
               So there, friend and foe alike, joined to say 
               <br />
               that this question was settled for ever. 
               <br />
               .And, as I have said, it passed beyond our 
               <br />
               domain. Subsequently, in 1891, an attempt 
               <br />
               was made to settle this question, other- 
               <br />
               wise. That is when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&lt;Act</span> was be- 
               <br />
               ing consolidated. if I remember rightly, 
               <br />
               and at that time the attention of the House 
               <br />
               was again drawn to this section 11, to this 
               <br />
               provision in the constitution we had given

               <br />
               consecrate that principle by yOur positive 
               <br />
               legislation; because if you do, the system 
               <br />
               will be continued under which rights and 
               <br />
               privileges will be acquired, which, when you

               come to deal with these Territories and

               make them into provinces, you will ﬁnd

               in existence and you will not be able to 
               <br />
               get rid of them. Not only that, but, if I 
               <br />
               remember rightly, it was in 1880, that a 
               <br />
               statute was passed by this parliament 
               <br />
               with respect to the constitution of these 
               <br />
               Territories in which we mad-e the provision 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act with res- 
               <br />
               pect to education, that is to say, section 
               <br />
               93, expressly applicable to the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. Now, in the light of these 
               <br />
               facts, we are called upon to deal with these 
               <br />
               provinces. and we have to remember the 
               <br />
               pledge we gave to the imperial authorities 
               <br />
               that we would give to these Territories in- 
               <br />
               stitutions similar in principle to our own. 
               <br />
               We have to bear in mind the fact that 
               <br />
               We have by our own Act created in the 
               <br />
               province a certain condition of things with 
               <br />
               respect to schools, that by our positive act 
               <br />
               that school system has been continued up 
               <br />
               to the present time. And, when we come 
               <br />
               to apply section93, what do we do ? The 
               <br />
               rights that have grown up in that territory 
               <br />
               under the present school system. if these 
               <br />
               rights and privileges have been brought in 
               <br />
               by reason of the legislation of the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, go on in spite of anything that could 
               <br />
               be done. But, because they have been 
               <br />
               created and have grown up not by reason 
               <br />
               of the Act of the territorial authority. but 
               <br />
               by reason of our Act, we are to repudiate, 
               <br />
               and say to these people: It is true, we 
               <br />
               have created that system, true we are res- 
               <br />
               ponsible for it; true if these had been pro- 
               <br />
               vinces and the legislation had been their 
               <br />
               work, we would not 'have had ally right to 
               <br />
               deal with it;—but because these things have 
               <br />
               grown up under our Act, we have the right 
               <br />
               to repudiate them. That is a position this 
               <br />
               government refuses to take. So far as this 
               <br />
               government is concerned. there will be no 
               <br />
               repudiation, either with respect to the con- 
               <br />
               tracts entered into with the Hudson Bay 
               <br />

               My hon. friend the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion has accurately stated the conditions 
               <br />
               which exist in the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               as the result of section 16, No. 2. The min— 
               <br />

               <br />
               them all the rights and privileges they en- 
               <br />
               joy at the present time under chapter 29 of 
               <br />
               the ordinances. With respect to the min- 
               <br />
               ority in general, when they happen to form 
               <br />
               a majority in a school district, they would 
               <br />
               not have a guarantee of the continuance 
               <br />
               of these rights which they now have.
