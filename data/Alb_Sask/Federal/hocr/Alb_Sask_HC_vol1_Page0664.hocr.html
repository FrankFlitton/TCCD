               for Pictou (Mr. Macdonald) pointed out last 
               <br />
               night, the people of the province of New

               Brunswick have, through their legislature,

               vinces are beginning to fear for our future 
               <br />
               representation in this parliament. While 
               <br />
               we do not wish to ask for any infringement 
               <br />
               upon the clauses of the constitution, still 
               <br />
               it is nothing but natural that we should 
               <br />
               call the attention of parliament to the result 
               <br />
               which may come about through the great

               ' us in the future unrepresented or insufﬁ-

               ciently represented in the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada. Therefore, I think I am voicing 
               <br />
               not only my own sentiments but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> senti- 
               <br />

               <br />
               will hear me out in this declaration that

               it is only natural and right that the govern-

               importance without consulting the other 
               <br />
               provinces, which are an equally interested 
               <br />
               in our national development. I think, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, my view is supported by the 
               <br />
               speech of the member for West Assiniboia 
               <br />
               (Mr. Scott), who says that the people of 
               <br />
               the eastern portion of Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               would have objected to being brought 
               <br />
               into the province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Manitoba because 
               <br />
               they would be deprived of the im- 
               <br />
               mense beneﬁt which they Will receive by 
               <br />
               remaining within the limits of Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan, and would be deprived in the very 
               <br />
               ﬁrst year of the sum of $202,687, besides 
               <br />
               being exposed to share the debt and possibly 
               <br />
               the responsibilities of another province, 
               <br />
               which has made much progress, no doubt, 
               <br />
               but which is already calling for better 
               <br />
               terms. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I regret to 
               <br />
               have heard this evening, and on former oc- 
               <br />
               casions, the statement that the non—exten- 
               <br />
               sion of the boundaries of Manitoba was due 
               <br />
               to other reasons than the best interests of 
               <br />
               the people of the Northwest as a whole, 
               <br />
               and especially of the people of Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan.

               But this question has another aspect. A

               great deal has been said about the school

               House made to sentiment. We have heard 
               <br />
               from the member for Labelle (Mr. Bour-

               member of this House, and from my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Beauce (Mr. B-éland), These hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen .have certainly delighted and as- 
               <br />
               tonished this parliament as well as their con-

               stituents. by their eloquence and their lofty 
               <br />
               sentiments. I have not had the honour nor 
               <br />
               the advantage of remaining in my native 
               <br />
               province, but I have spent thirty-three 
               <br />
               years of my life in another province look- 
               <br />
               ing after the interests of a people to whom 
               <br />
               I always speak in the language of my 
               <br />
               heart. If the scene of my activity has been 
               <br />
               laid in another sphere my sentiments have 
               <br />
               perhaps become more expanded, and the
