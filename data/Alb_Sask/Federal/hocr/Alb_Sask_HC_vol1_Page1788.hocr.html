               That is a widespread impression. A friend

               <br />
               give us what we have, even though it may 
               <br />
               not be one—quarter of what the minority in 
               <br />
               Quebec are guaranteed—I admit that it is 
               <br />
               useless to ask for a French—speaking min-

               to give the English-speaking minority of 
               <br />
               Quebec—and I would show my spirit of 
               <br />
               conciliation, by saying: I accept. Give 
               <br />
               these people the right to their separate 
               <br />
               schools, their Catholic schools, controlled

               jority as well as where they are a minority, 
               <br />
               and I will abandon the rest. I will even 
               <br />
               agree to the keeping of the uniform system 
               <br />
               which the Prime Minister has declared would 
               <br />
               be an act ot“ infamous tyranny if commit- 
               <br />
               ied by the province of Quebec. I will 
               <br />
               say that in the Northwest it will not be an 
               <br />
               infamous act of tyranny. I am willing to 
               <br />
               trust to the generosity of the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest if you give us separation. 
               <br />
               reason is obvious. I think I know the 
               <br />
               English—speaking people; I know their good 
               <br />
               qualities. They may have the spirit of 
               <br />
               domination, but they have not the spirit of 
               <br />
               persecution. 
               <br />
               into your home to force you to adopt his 
               <br />
               ways of living. But if you live in the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house</span> with him, he will try to compel you 
               <br />
               to live his way. This is but an exagger- 
               <br />
               ation of a good quality in the English—-the 
               <br />
               strength of will and persistency ot‘ purpose. 
               <br />
               .It is not surprising, that, having had large 
               <br />
               success in spreading their institutions and 
               <br />
               power over so many lands they should be 
               <br />
               convinced even in an exaggerated form at 
               <br />
               times, that their institutions are the best— 
               <br />
               that they should be convinced that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because</span> 
               <br />
               they eat roast beef nobody else should eat 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chicken.</span> But as I say, the Englishman 
               <br />
               will not go to another man’s house to per-

               secute him there. So, if this principle of 
               <br />
               separation is recognized, I am willing that 
               <br />

               vince of Quebec laughed at me, but the

               Minister of Justice acknowledged that my

               position was right, the Prime Minister

               40 per cent Catholics, and therefore "ou
