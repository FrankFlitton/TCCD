               <br />
               quota is 1,300. Why does it require

               1,465 voters in the south for one mem-

               could not be all the possible conﬁdence in

               the world placed upon the ﬁgures as given

               an' instance which conﬁrms our suspicions.

               <br />
               For example, the High River constituency 
               <br />
               which is largely devoted to ranching only 
               <br />
               polled 63 per cent. and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Macleod,</span> another 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ranching</span> constituency. 64 per cent of the 
               <br />
               names on the list. Stony Plain of which we 
               <br />
               have heard, managed to get in 78 per cent. 
               <br />
               and St. Albert succeeded in polling 77 per 
               <br />
               cent of its vote. There are some very pecu- 
               <br />
               liar features about this which make it still 
               <br />
               more apparent why this basis of calculation 
               <br />
               was used. In the northern part they not only 
               <br />
               voted the whole list but more. In Cracow, 
               <br />
               a name which shows that it is largely in- 
               <br />
               habited by Poles who helped to swell the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s majority, there were 113 
               <br />
               names <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> the list and 100 east. In Sallman, 
               <br />
               19 were cast and there are 17 on the list. 
               <br />
               In Kensington 82 were cast and 52 on the 
               <br />
               list. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wetaskiwin</span> there were 282 cast and 
               <br />
               266 on the list, in Rosenthal, 52 cast and 44

               <br />
               Albert cast 206 votes, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">although</span> there were 
               <br />
               only 103 on the list. 1 can readily see under 
               <br />
               these circumstances why it should be deem- 
               <br />
               ed advisable for the minister to attempt to 
               <br />
               defend his schedule by considering the num- 
               <br />
               ber of votes cast, but unfortunately the 
               <br />
               people of the south apparently had overlook- 
               <br />
               ed the fact that a distribution was coming. 
               <br />
               The minister has mentioned Cardston, which 
               <br />
               had a small vote in the south. If I under- 
               <br />
               stand, this is a Liberal constituency sur- 
               <br />
               rounded by several of another character, 
               <br />
               and there might be danger in the event of 
               <br />
               Cardston being enlarged that it would no
