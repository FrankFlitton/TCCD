               have brought to the attention of the House 
               <br />
               yesterday, the matter which I am about 
               <br />
               to mention, but it was not very con- 
               <br />
               venient for the First Minister (Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />

               <br />
               over until to—day. The subject on which 
               <br />
               I wish to speak for a few moments con- 
               <br />
               cerns certain passages in a letter which the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               has recently addressed to the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman who leads this House (Sir Wil- 
               <br />
               frid Laurier). In proposing to discuss cer- 
               <br />
               tain passages in that letter I do not for one 
               <br />
               moment forget that it is not open for me 
               <br />
               to-day to discuss the measures which the 
               <br />
               letter relates and therefore I am touching 
               <br />
               the letter of Mr. Haultain in so far 
               <br />
               only as it is concerned with the manner and 
               <br />
               circumstances in which and under which 
               <br />
               this Bill was introduced in this House. I 
               <br />
               assume that Mr. Haultain’s letter will be 
               <br />
               brought down with any other additional 
               <br />

               the month of October last and the present 
               <br />
               time is certainly a very peculiar one. We 
               <br />
               had this subject, the granting of provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy to the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               discussed to some extent in the year 1901, 
               <br />
               again in 1902, and again in 1903. On the 
               <br />
               last occasion I moved a formal resolution in 
               <br />
               this House in which after setting out re— 
               <br />
               solutions of the legislature of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories to the effect that provin- 
               <br />
               cial status should be granted to these Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. I had submitted to the House that 
               <br />
               that request should be taken into immediate 
               <br />
               consideration by the government of this 
               <br />
               country and should be acted upon forthwith. 
               <br />
               I pointed out at that time that even if my 
               <br />
               motion passed, if the government was dis- 
               <br />
               posed at once to accept the suggestion 
               <br />
               which I then made, it would take a 
               <br />
               considerable time to arrange the de- 
               <br />
               tails. It was not a matter, as I admitted, 
               <br />
               to be lightly undertaken or to be disposed 
               <br />
               of in haste, and it was for that reason that 
               <br />
               I urged upon the government the imme- 
               <br />
               diate consideration of the question, in the 
               <br />
               month of October, 1903, saying as I did 
               <br />
               at that time, that if the matter were taken 
               <br />
               up by the government at once the popula- 
               <br />
               ion of the Northwest Territories of Can- 
               <br />
               ada would probably be 500,000 before the 
               <br />
               details could be arranged and the measure 
               <br />
               brought down for the consideration of the 
               <br />
               House and of the country.

               stituency of Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) spoke 
               <br />
               on that motion. He would not support the 
               <br />
               resolution for the granting of provincial 
               <br />
               institutions to the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               unless he knew exactly the terms upon which 
               <br />
               autonomy would be granted. Let me quote 
               <br />
               his own expressive words : 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               I, as a representative of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, do not propose to go into a sort of blind 
               <br />
               pool. not knowing how we are going to come

               <br />
