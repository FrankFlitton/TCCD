               My constituency is one which is very even- 
               <br />
               ly divided. I have very many English-

               speaking electors and many members of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               been in the past, to go before these men, who 
               <br />
               are serious men and whose good opinion I 
               <br />
               value, and defend before them, as I must

               ence I have had in the past with these men, 
               <br />
               they will understand the argument which

               has been presented to this committee to-

               I did not intend to speak, Mr, Chairman, 
               <br />
               but I feel that it is incumbent upon me to 
               <br />
               protest in my name and in that of my 
               <br />
               French colleagues in this House, against 
               <br />
               the insults lavished upon us by the hon. 
               <br />
               members for Montmagny and Labelle, yes-

               terday and the day before, in the course 
               <br />
               of this debate, I protest at the same time 
               <br />
               against the abuse heaped by the member 
               <br />
               for Beauharnois (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bergeroni</span> on the

               French speaking representatives of the pro-

               vince of Quebec. I think it is rather a 
               <br />
               peculiar way of showing one’s patriotism 
               <br />
               to endeavour to belittle in the eyes of the 
               <br />
               whole country the French Canadian mem- 
               <br />
               bers in this House, as was done by the hon. 
               <br />
               member from Labelle, who has thought 
               <br />
               ﬁt to revile those whom the French Cana~ 
               <br />
               dians have chosen as their standard bearers 
               <br />
               in this House. The hon. member for La-

               belle, who poses as the champion of the 
               <br />
               rights of our nationality, showed himself 
               <br />
               a poor type of a patriot when he insulted 
               <br />
               the French Canadian members in con-
