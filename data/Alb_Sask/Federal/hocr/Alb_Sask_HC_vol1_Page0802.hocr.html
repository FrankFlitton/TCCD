               tutional obligation upon us, should we enact 
               <br />
               this legislation and upon w.hat.ground is it 
               <br />
               contended by those who are supporting the 
               <br />
               Bill that this legislation should be crystal- 
               <br />
               lized into law ? The only other ground that 
               <br />
               has been advanced is that there is a moral 
               <br />
               obligation upon us. So far as that is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, Mr. Speaker, I cannot see for my 
               <br />
               part that there is any moral obliga- 
               <br />
               tion whatever upon this parliament. But, 
               <br />
               if there were any moral obligation why 
               <br />
               not leave that moral obligation to be 
               <br />
               recognized by the provincial authorities ? 
               <br />
               If there really exists a moral obliga- 
               <br />
               tion surely we can trust the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories to recognize it. 
               <br />
               There is no justiﬁcation or warrant, good,

               many members of this House seem to have 
               <br />
               been labouring under the misapprehension 
               <br />
               that the effect of that clause is to embody
