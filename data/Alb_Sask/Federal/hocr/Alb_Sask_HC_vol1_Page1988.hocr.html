               I pointed that out a little more in detail 
               <br />
               the other evening than I shall do at the 
               <br />
               present time. I pointed out that in the 
               <br />
               interest of the minority in this country as 
               <br />
               well as in the interest of the majority, it 
               <br />
               is right and wise that we should abide by 
               <br />
               the constitution. because, that constitution. 
               <br />
               if it is invaded to-day for one class. may 
               <br />
               be invaded to-morrow for another class. I 
               <br />
               deny that there is any intolerance in asking 
               <br />
               that we should abide by the compact and 
               <br />
               the constitution which were deliberately 
               <br />
               adopted in 1867. Any argument as to tol- 
               <br />
               erance is an argument which ought to be 
               <br />
               addressed to the people and to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legisla-I</span> 
               <br />
               tures of the new provinces. I think that 
               <br />
               all of us on this side of the House may 
               <br />
               at the same time treat with some disdain 
               <br />
               the arguments of those who throw the taunt 
               <br />
               of intolerance in our teeth and at the same 
               <br />
               time turn to their friends and colleagues 
               <br />
               and say: We may grant this after all to 
               <br />
               the minority because it is absolutely useless 
               <br />
               to them; these are not separate schools ; the 
               <br />
               privilege granted is absolutely worthless 
               <br />
               and in a few years the name of separate 
               <br />
               schools will disappear from the Northwest. 
               <br />
               That is a very high <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exemplivﬂcation</span> of tol- 
               <br />
               erance ! If it is so regarded by some hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite, I do not so regard it. 
               <br />
               If there was any compact, if there was any 
               <br />
               agreement, why grant separate schools are to 
               <br />
               be of no value at all to those who demand 
               <br />
               them ? It seems to me that a different policy 
               <br />
               should have been pursued. 
               <br />

               tion 16, to which I have just referred. 
               <br />
               would not prevent the legislature of the new 
               <br />
               province from interfering with the power of 
               <br />
               the trustees or from vesting that control over 
               <br />
               religious instruction in the Commissioner of 
               <br />
               Education, or in the council of public in- 
               <br />
               struction, or in any other body <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> it 
               <br />
               may designate at any time in the future. 
               <br />
               That was the position and my 'hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Labelle, in the ﬁrst instance. and my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Beauharnois afterwards 
               <br />
               proposed motion-s in Committee of the Whole 
               <br />
               House, which in their opinion, guarded the 
               <br />
               rights of the Catholic minority when that 
               <br />
               Catholic minority happened to beamajority 
               <br />
               in anyparticular school district. These mo- 
               <br />
               tions were voted down. They were voted 
               <br />
               down without very much discussion .by the 
               <br />
               government and without very much reason 
               <br />
               being given by any member of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. They were regarded as unneces— 
               <br />
               sary or inexpedient—I do not know which— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perhaps</span> both; at all events, they were very 
               <br />
               summarily <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dispssed</span> of and the matter was 
               <br />
               supposed to end there. But, it did not end 
               <br />
               there.. Then came a very pretty little piece 
               <br />
               of by—piay. That which had been proposed 
               <br />
               by my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘hon.</span> friend from Labelle and by 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Beauharnois and some- 
               <br />
               thing more to which I will call <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention</span> 
               <br />
               was proposed by the hon. member for Sas- 
               <br />
