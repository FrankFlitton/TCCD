               <br />
               after all. I just now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sent</span> into the reading

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">loom</span> twice for the ﬁrst part of the report

               I twice got the answer that the volume can-

               not be found. I have compared that por- 
               <br />
               tion of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debate</span> contained in the 
               <br />
               ‘ Leader ’ oi'the 2nd of January, 1902, which 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice has produced, and I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that it begins at a portion of the speech 
               <br />
               which follows that quoted by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Qu’Appelle. Therefore my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Qu’Appelle in stating that there was a 
               <br />
               context which would explain the references 
               <br />
               of Mr. Haultain to this system, was abso- 
               <br />
               lutely right. The Minister of Justice. it 
               <br />
               seems to me, should not have made the con- 
               <br />
               tradiction which he did unless he had ex- 
               <br />
               amined the previous portion of the speech. 
               <br />
               which is not contained in this issue at all. 
               <br />
               lt begins in this way : ‘ Continued from last 
               <br />
               issue.’ and then proceeds almost at the very 
               <br />
               words which my hon. friend the Minister 
               <br />

               <br />
               a moment ago, I said that I had but few 
               <br />
               words to add; but since the speech made 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Finance, I have con— 
               <br />
               cluded to offer some further remarks, espe— 
               <br />
               cially in reply to those made by him con— 
               <br />
               cerning the election recently held in Edmon-

               ton. For some weeks past this House has 
               <br />
               resounded time and again with challenges 
               <br />
               to the government to open constituencies in 
               <br />
               order to test public feeling in the country.

               Hon. members on this side have been free

               <br />
               sideration, I presume, they thought it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prob»</span>

               of West Assiniboia was to have been opened 
               <br />

               members of the opposition, the government

               saw ﬁt to change their opinions at the

               <br />
