               points plain now,. it will not be my fault. 
               <br />
               To make my meaning plain, I must refer 
               <br />
               to the autonomy question in a general Way. 
               <br />
               Prior to my ﬁrst coming to this House in 
               <br />
               1901, I was an advocate of immediate au- 
               <br />
               tononiy for the Territories. In 1901 and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1902,</span> I urged my opinions in that direc- 
               <br />
               tion strongly in this House. In March, 
               <br />
               1903, the Manitoba courts gave a judgment 
               <br />
               on. certain test tax cases, to which I shall 
               <br />
               refer later. That judgment was such as to 
               <br />
               lead me to revise my views as to the de- 
               <br />
               sirability of the Territories immediately ob- 
               <br />
               taining autonomy. The Ottawa corres- 
               <br />
               pondent of the Winnipeg ‘ Free Press’ ob- 
               <br />
               tained interviews upon that judgment from 
               <br />
               most of the Northwest members. In my 
               <br />
               statement to that correspondent, I spoke 
               <br />
               as follows :
