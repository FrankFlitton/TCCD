               terms of the draft Bill, because, as he said, 
               <br />
               it was attempting to grab too <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much,</span> the

               stood my hon. friend to lay down the pro-

               position that because that draft Bill had 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               for instance, the application of section 93

               an awful thing if any power of self govern- 
               <br />

               west Territories, but they are anxious to 
               <br />
               take away about half the territory of the
