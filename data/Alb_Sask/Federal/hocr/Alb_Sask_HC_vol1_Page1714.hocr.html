               trying to set the machinery in motion for 
               <br />
               these new provinces, and I think it is be-

               neath the dignity of this parliament to take

               sides against one part or the other part of 
               <br />
               these new provinces. The case cited by my 
               <br />
               hon. friend (Mr. Scott) is another matter 
               <br />
               altogether. In that case we were providing 
               <br />
               seats for our own parliament; in this case 
               <br />
               we are legislating for provincial constitu- 
               <br />
               encies, and I submit that in all fairness 
               <br />
               as between the different sections of that 
               <br />
               country, and in order to make the people 
               <br />
               satisﬁed and happy, we ought as nearly 
               <br />
               as possible give every man the same power 
               <br />
               in voting at this ﬁrst provincial election. 
               <br />
               Afterwards the province can divide the con— 
               <br />
               stituencies as it thinks ﬁt, and I shall be 
               <br />
               quite content. I ask whether it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> that 
               <br />
               this parliament should apparently—and I 
               <br />
               cannot see any other object in it—take sides 
               <br />
               with the north as against the south in this 
               <br />
               matter.

               Mr. SCOT' ‘. No. I contend that this par- 
               <br />
               liament is under full responsibility to do 
               <br />
               the fair thing in the premises, and I think 
               <br />
               that to do anything less for more than half 
               <br />
               the area of the province, the district of 
               <br />
               Athabaska, would not be doing the fair 
               <br />
               thing. My hon. friend admits that the 
               <br />
               whole matter hinges on the question of the 
               <br />
               capital. If he looks at the map, he will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the centre of the province is 100 
               <br />
               miles north <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bf</span> Edmonton. Yet our friends 
               <br />
               in the south are contending that they 
               <br />
               should have the privilege, while they com- 
               <br />
               pose perhaps nearly half the population of 
               <br />
               ﬁxing the capital far south of the centre. 
               <br />
               Mainly because that is the question. I say 
               <br />
               it is the duty of this parliament to see that 
               <br />
               fair-play is granted to the northern portion 
               <br />

               when that redistribution takes place,‘ 
               <br />
               legislature will not take away these two

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I do not propose to

               match my hon. friend in prophesying; he is 
               <br />
               much better at that than I am. If it is a 
               <br />
               good argument that because there is a large 
               <br />
               territory there should be this extraordinary 
               <br />
               representation, how does it happen that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has been so blind to 
               <br />
               that consideration during the last nine 
               <br />
               years? The Northwest Territories, with 
               <br />
               a small population, it is true, but with an 
               <br />
               area exceeding all the rest of the Dominion

               of Canada two or three times over, accord-

               ing to the argument now put forward, 
               <br />
               should have been represented in this House 
               <br />
               by fifty or sixty members instead of four 
               <br />
               from 1896 to 1900. and from 1900 to 1904; 
               <br />
               yet I never heard the hon. gentleman or any 
               <br />
