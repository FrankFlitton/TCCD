               such is not the intention of the govern-

               <br />
               tion of amending that imperial statute. If

               we then turn to section 16, we ﬁnd the pro-

               posed amendment to that section, to say,

               Speaker, is clearly arrogating to this parlia-

               <br />
               the facts show, it is assuming so to amend

               people themselves. It will be observed 
               <br />
               that an integral part of the Prime Min-

               <br />
               a discrimination against Alberta and

               this House in session for a period, I be- 
               <br />
               lieve, of about six weeks in an endeavour to 
               <br />
               force their views with regard to provincial 
               <br />
               r1ghts upon parliament, and to show that 
               <br />
               the taking into their own hands by the 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament of the ﬁxing of the 
               <br />
               franchise was the gravest possible departure 
               <br />
               from the principle of provincial rights. Yet, 
               <br />
               this same so-called Reform or Liberal gov- 
               <br />
               ernment has seized upon this very ﬁrst op- 
               <br />
               portunity which has presented itself under 
               <br />
               their regime to swallow their principles in 
               <br />
               that respect; and, in this instance they 
               <br />
               are by this section retaining absolutely in 
               <br />
               their own hands the ﬁxing of the franchise, 
               <br />
               which course on the occasion I have referred 
               <br />
               to, they in the strongest terms reprobated. 
               <br />
               But Mr. Speaker, the crowning effort of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister to deprive the new pro- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               in section 16 of these Bills. To my mind,

               been accentuated as much as it might have 
               <br />

               <br />
               beyond the Act of 1875. That Act provided 
               <br />
               for the introduction of the principle of 
               <br />
               separate schools into the Northwest, 
               <br />

               <br />
               their supporters and for the freedom

               of these supporters from liability to 
               <br />
               taxes for maintenance of public schools; but 
               <br />
               that Act did not provide for a division of the 
               <br />
               public moneys devoted to education. In 1879, 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reenactment</span> of the Dominion Lands 
               <br />
               Act in that year named ‘public schools’ 
               <br />
               as the recipients of the school funds 
               <br />
               from the Dominion Lands in Manitoba 
               <br />
               and the Territories. Before that date, 
               <br />
               in former re—enactments, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statutory</span> 
               <br />
               provision was that such moneys should 
               <br />
               be devoted simply to ‘education.’ In that 
               <br />
               year the word ‘education’ was struck out 
               <br />
               and the words public schools inserted. In
