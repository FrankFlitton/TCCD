               the Territories passed a resolution consent-

               that these people living north of Manitoba 
               <br />

               <br />
               been included. It has always been part of 
               <br />
               the Territories since the district of Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan was established. It has been 
               <br />
               always represented in the territorial assem- 
               <br />
               bly and has always been connected with 
               <br />
               the Territories, why then should it not 
               <br />
               continue to form part and parcel of 
               <br />
               the new province of Saskatchewan with 
               <br />
               which it has always been connected ? 
               <br />
               The only reason why it has not been includ- 
               <br />
               ed so far as I can see was the desire of the 
               <br />
               First Minister to give the province of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba an opportunity to show that these peo- 
               <br />
               ple would not object to joining that province, 
               <br />
               but, Sir, to ask this government to force 
               <br />
               these people into Manitoba, when on every 
               <br />
               occasion they have protested against any 
               <br />
               such course, would be, in my opinion noth- 
               <br />
               ing short of coercion. If the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba can show at the conference, which 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman says will be held, 
               <br />
               that these people will not object to joining 
               <br />
               Manitoba then, the conference will be in a 
               <br />
               position to hear the request of that province, 
               <br />
               but until Manitoba can show that consent. 
               <br />
               she is not in a position to urge any claim to 
               <br />
               have that portion of the district of Sas— 
               <br />

               <br />
               If Manitoba can show that these people do 
               <br />
               not object, then the conference will be in a 
               <br />
               position to hear the rival claims of Manitoba 
               <br />
               and Saskatchewan.

               There is another point to which I wish 
               <br />
               to call the attention of the House and par- 
               <br />
               ticularly the attention of the Postmaster 
               <br />
               General. In the remarks the Postmaster 
               <br />
               General made the other day in reference to 
               <br />
               the interview he had with the delegates of 
               <br />
               the Manitoba government with regard to the 
               <br />
               extension of the Manitoba boundaries, I 
               <br />
               understood him to take the position that it 
               <br />
               would be a fair distribution of the district 
               <br />
               of Keewatin if Manitoba were given the bar- 
               <br />
               bour at the mouth of the Churchill on the 
               <br />
               Hudson bay and Ontario the harbour at the 
               <br />
               mouth of the Nelson.

               Well, Mr. Speaker, all I have to say in 
               <br />
               reference to that is this: That if the 
               <br />
               principles of right and justice prevail at the 
               <br />
               conference, as I rthink they Will prevail, 
               <br />
               neither the province of Ontario nor 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba will get the 
               <br />
               port at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mouth</span> of the Churchill. 
               <br />
               but that port will go to the province 
               <br />
               to which it rightfully belongs, namely the 
               <br />
               new province of Saskatchewan. There is
