               such a lack of respect for institutions, such

               lack of respect for public honour, the 
               <br />
               mystery to me is that there is not more

               crime than that which is committed in the

               Dominion of Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Speaking</span> of divorces, 
               <br />
               I was a little surprised that the right hon. 
               <br />
               First Minister should touch on that ques- 
               <br />
               tion. He knows very well that the cost 
               <br />
               in the Dominion of Canada is a barrier to 
               <br />
               divorces. He knows that the facility in 
               <br />
               this country is not as great as it is in many 
               <br />
               states of the union for divorces. He knows 
               <br />
               that in Canada mediation very often comes 
               <br />
               in. Friends of the persons concerned and 
               <br />
               church dignitaries step in and prevent a 
               <br />
               consummation of divorces; and he knows 
               <br />
               that if there is one thing that characterizes 
               <br />
               Canada, it is the goodness of the women of 
               <br />

               that there is some cause for divorce in Can-

               gentleman (Mr. Sam Hughes) point out a

               single man in the province of Quebec who 
               <br />
               is not loyal? The hon. gentleman has

               taken the responsibility of saying that he 
               <br />
               was glad to know there were some loyal

               from Cape Breton.
