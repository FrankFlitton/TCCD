               I 
               <br />
               View it is wise to do so. Again, I am not 
               <br />
               in favour of retaliation, upon commercial

               cause it is an expedient proposition. But in 
               <br />
               a larger sense I am opposed to those restric- 
               <br />
               tions, because We want to get capital to come 
               <br />
               here. In this case when these gentlemen 
               <br />
               OWn it, where they are subject to our laws, 
               <br />

               <br />
               .priate it by Act of parliament, I see no 
               <br />
               reason why we should place any other res- 
               <br />
               triction upon them. I am opposed to narrow 
               <br />
               restrictions that will prevent a man coming 
               <br />
               into this country and investing his capital. 
               <br />
               No independent Canadian would go into a 
               <br />
               country and invest his capital it he could 
               <br />
               not control it afterwards. I think it is a 
               <br />
               narrow view, one that will not beneﬁt‘ us in 
               <br />
               the end. What we want ﬁrst of all is capital; 
               <br />
               and if we want it should we not be willing to 
               <br />
               give it a fair Show with ourselves ‘? I shall

               Mr. PRINGLE. Some hon. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               judging from their remarks, seem to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               alarmed simply because the word American 
               <br />
               has been used. One hon. gentleman says 
               <br />
               that when this clause was added to the 
               <br />
               Railway Act it was understood that there 
               <br />
               would be no exception to that law. I would 
               <br />
               like to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pointkout</span> to that hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               that last year he sat in this House and ac- 
               <br />
               quiesced in some ten Bills that went through 
               <br />
               making exceptions to the general law of 
               <br />
               this country. Last session alone we put 
               <br />
               through ten Bills_ which were exceptions to 
               <br />
               the general law of this country. New, if 
               <br />
               there ever was a case made out justifying 
               <br />
               an exception it is this case. In 1897 some 
               <br />
               Americans came into this country under a 
               <br />
               law that then existed, passed in 1888. They 
               <br />
               expended $750,000 in building that railroad 
               <br />
               from the river St. Lawrence to the city of 
               <br />
               Ottawa. As I said before, unfortunately it 
               <br />
               has not been a proﬁtable venture. They 
               <br />
               had vested rights. This parliament in 1903, 
               <br />
               did what is very unusual, they passed re- 
               <br />
               troactive legislation which seriously affects 
               <br />
               those vested rights. Now I‘ say we have 
               <br />
               made out a strong case why there should 
               <br />
               be an exception to that general law. It is 
               <br />
               not as if Americans were coming in here 
               <br />
               to-day and asking for a charter to build a 
               <br />
               road; then of course they would have to 
               <br />
               come under the law passed in 1903: But 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd them here with the end of their 
               <br />
               system, 56 miles long, which is of no use 
               <br />
               to any other railroad corporation in this 
               <br />
               country, but which is connected with their 
               <br />
               road on the American side by the bridge 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> crosses the river St. Lawrence at 
               <br />
               Cornwall. It is the only company that 
               <br />
               can really make that road proﬁtable, which 
               <br />
               can make it a road that will serve the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the counties of Stormont and Russell 
               <br />
               through which it passes, and it is now a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'road</span> that is doing good to the city of Ot-

               tawa. They are in a position, having the 
               <br />
               road on the American side, having control 
               <br />
               of the bridge which crosses the river, to

               <br />
               Now what is their position ? The New York

               <br />
               because they want to come into this coun-

               try and operate that 56 miles of railroad, 
               <br />
               the hon. member for York is afraid they 
               <br />
               are going to run away with the country. 
               <br />
               They have got to come in here and operate 
               <br />
               under the provisions of the Railway Act.- 
               <br />
               They come under section 23 to section 25 
               <br />
               and they come under the control of the Rail- 
               <br />
               way Commission. What great harm is going 
               <br />
               to be done if they come in here and expend 
               <br />
               half a million dollars improving that rail- 
               <br />
               way, assisting the town of Cornwall and 
               <br />
               giving to the people of the county through

               service? I cannot see where the harm <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is,,</span> 
               <br />
               and I think it would be most unreasonable 
               <br />
               to ask that company to make a majority 
               <br />
               of their directors British subjects. This is 
               <br />
               an international road. Do the United States 
               <br />
               make the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, running 
               <br />
               through the state of Maine, change their 
               <br />
               board of directors and make a majority of 
               <br />
               their board American citizens? No. The 
               <br />
               directors are Canadians, they are British 
               <br />
               subjects and they operate through the State 
               <br />
               of Maine. I submit we have made out a 
               <br />
               strong case why there should be an excep-

               Mr. EMMERSON. It is sought to be 
               <br />
               shown that this is an exceptional case. In 
               <br />
               1903 and in 1904 there was very strong 
               <br />
               opinion expressed on all sides that it should 
               <br />
               be the policy of Canada to exclude other than 
               <br />
               British subjects from the boards of control 
               <br />
               of our railways in Canada. We enacted cer— 
               <br />
               tain legislation both in 1903 and 1904, but 
               <br />
               we were careful as respects the conditions 
               <br />
               which then prevailed, and we added a clause 
               <br />
               giving to those companies which had aliens 
               <br />
               on their boards time rto remedy the diﬂiculty. 
               <br />
               We ﬁxed a time limit and we made that time 
               <br />
               limit the 31st January, 1905. This corpor- 
               <br />
               ation was in existence at that time. We 
               <br />
               passed this legislation with the full knowl— 
               <br />
               edge of this corporation as it was then con- 
               <br />
               stituted. We recognized the conditions 
               <br />
               which prevailed and that corporation at that 
               <br />
               time was just as much American as it is to— 
               <br />
               day. The only difference there is between 
               <br />
               that corporation at that moment and the 
               <br />
               same corporation at this moment is that 
               <br />
               there is a difference in the personnel of the 
               <br />
               shareholders. Why should the present share- 
               <br />
               holders have any rights which you would 
               <br />
               not grant to the shareholders of that day ? 
               <br />
