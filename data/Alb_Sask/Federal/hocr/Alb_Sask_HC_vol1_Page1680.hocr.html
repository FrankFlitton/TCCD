               Now let us take the names on the voters’ 
               <br />
               lists. In the southern constituencies, ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the government estimate there 
               <br />
               were 15,895 and according to the estimate 
               <br />
               of the opposition there were 15,567. Here, 
               <br />
               the government admit 328 more names on 
               <br />
               the list than the opposition claim. In the 
               <br />
               northern constituencies the government’s es- 
               <br />
               timate of names on the lists is 12,863 and 
               <br />
               the estimate of the opposition is 13,345, Red 
               <br />
               Deer omitted. Here again the opposition 
               <br />
               have accorded to the eleven northern con- 
               <br />
               stituencies 482 more names than the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment claim, so that our estimate in this 
               <br />
               respect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is.</span> more favourable to the conten- 
               <br />
               tion of the government than is their own 
               <br />
               estimate. If in the ﬁrst place it was legit-

               imate that we should divide the error be- 
               <br />
               tween the two, it is legitimate we should 
               <br />
               divide the error again in the second place, 
               <br />
               and consequently we strike a mean between 
               <br />
               the calculation of the opposition and the 
               <br />
               calculation of the government, although we 
               <br />
               would prefer to argue it out on the govern— 
               <br />
               ment ﬁgures as being far more favourable 
               <br />
               to us. The government give a total num- 
               <br />
               ber of names upon the voters lists as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">29,-</span> 
               <br />
               050. It will be noticed that the opposition 
               <br />
               make it 30,104, a difference of 154. We may 
               <br />
               then agree that 30.000 or ﬁfty more than 
               <br />
               the government make it and 100 less than 
               <br />
               the opposition make it, is about fair. We 
               <br />
               shall say that there are 30,000 names upon 
               <br />
               the lists. It you take the 15.700 that are 
               <br />
               found in the eleven southern constituencies 
               <br />
               and the 13,100 in the eleven northern con-

               <br />
               Deer it would give you a total of 30.000. 
               <br />
               Now 30,000 divided by twenty-three will 
               <br />
               give you the quota for twenty-three con- 
               <br />
               stituencies at 1.300. Both sides are m'e-

               by taking the names on the list we see that 
               <br />
               the 11 southern constituencies have one 
               <br />

               stituencies have one too many, that is, leav-

               ing aside for the time being Peace River 
               <br />
               and Athabaska. No attempt has been made 
               <br />
               to refute the estimate of population made 
               <br />
               by the Medicine Hat ‘Times’ from infor- 
               <br />
               mation obtained from a great many reliable 
               <br />
               sources. By that estimate 07.203 people live 
               <br />
               below Red Deer and 70,021 live above, and 
               <br />
               there are. 5,569 people in Red Deer, making a 
               <br />
               total of 172.853. If you establish your mean 
               <br />
               at 7,470. you will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnd</span> that the 11 southern 
               <br />
               constituencies are entitled to nearly 13 re- 
               <br />
               presentatives and the 11 northern constitu- 
               <br />
               encies to less than 10. Therefore, if you 
               <br />
               strike a mean of calculation between the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures of the government and the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               of the opposition, it will probably be more 
               <br />
               nearly correct than the ﬁgures of either side. 
               <br />
               You ﬁnd that the 11 southern constituencies, 
               <br />
               by all these three tests, should have 12 re— 
               <br />
               presentatives; it has therefore at least one 
               <br />
               representative too few. On the other hand, 
               <br />
               if you take the 7 constituencies north of the 
               <br />
               north Saskatchewan river, and examine 
               <br />
               them on the government ﬁgures, you will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that that is Where the over-representa- 
               <br />
               tion lies. According to those ﬁgures, there 
               <br />
               are in those 7 constituencies 6,502 names on 
               <br />
               the list, allowing to Peace River and Atha- 
               <br />
               baska 600 names, and that there were 5,085 
               <br />
               votes cast, allowing to Peace River and 
               <br />
               Athabaska, 450. So that you have for each 
               <br />
               of these seven constituencies an average of 
               <br />
               930 names on the list and 726 votes cast. 
               <br />
               Now, we have already seen that 1,300 is the 
               <br />
               average number of names on the list and 900 
               <br />
               the average number of votes cast ; so that it 
               <br />
               is evident that the portion of country that is 
               <br />
               over-represented is the portion north of the 
               <br />
               North Saskatchewan river. Now. if it be 
               <br />
               demonstrated beyond peradventure that the 
               <br />
               southern section is at least one member 
               <br />
               under-represented and the northern section 
               <br />
               at least one member over-represented, it 
               <br />
               should be easy to transfer one member from 
               <br />
               the north to the south, and thus put an end 
               <br />
               to this interminable discussion, and satisfy 
               <br />
               all sides. Before I sit down. l wish to point 
               <br />
               out that you are not justiﬁed, according to 
               <br />
               our contention, in giving two members to 
               <br />
               Athabaska. We have never in the course 
               <br />
               of this debate urged that Athabaska should 
               <br />
               he unrepresented. We have never asked 
               <br />
               that a single <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">m‘en]</span> in that country should be 
               <br />

               <br />
               have asked is that a certain amount of 
               <br />
               equality should prevail. We claim that two

               representatives for Athabaska are altoge- 
               <br />

               <br />
               think one is quite sufﬁcient. Let me show
