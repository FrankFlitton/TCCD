               numbers that they are entitled to provincial

               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they"</span> have practically had provincial

               believe that there should be two provincial 
               <br />
               parliaments, as the country seems to me to 
               <br />
               be too large for only one parliament. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There:</span> 
               <br />
               fore, in so far as that is concerned, I am 
               <br />
               fully in accord with the granting of provin- 
               <br />
               cial autonomy to the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />

               be entirely governed by the British North

               America Act and do nothing inconsistent 
               <br />
               with it. The other provinces were formed in 
               <br />
               accordance with that Act, and I have 
               <br />
               yet to hear where there has been any trouble

               <br />

               ting along nicely and quietly, and the maj- 
               <br />
               ority there have been treating the minority 
               <br />
               fair and right, at least as far as I can judge 
               <br />
               from reading the newspapers, according to 
               <br />
               the newspapers there has been very little 
               <br />
               trouble in that province since the advent of 
               <br />
               the Conservative party into power in its 
               <br />
               legislature. In my opinion, the amendment 
               <br />
               moved by my hon. friend the leader of the 
               <br />
               oposition is in accordance with the British 
               <br />
               North America Act and is consequently fair 
               <br />
               and just. I believe further that if this gov- 
               <br />
               ernment persists in attaching the educa- 
               <br />
               tional clauses to these Bills, that will have 
               <br />
               the effect of retarding immigration. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that people intending to come and 
               <br />
               settle in this country, when they see this 
               <br />
               agitation raised and this quarrel going on 
               <br />
               probably in the provincial government of“ 
               <br />
               the new provinces, many of them, both Ca- 
               <br />
               tholic and Protestant. who may feel strongly 
               <br />
               on this question, will not emigrate to this 
               <br />
               country. Therefore, I think that if the- 
               <br />
               schools were left entirely in the hands of 
               <br />
               the provincial government, there will not be 
               <br />
               any strife or trouble, but these governments 
               <br />
               will meet the wants of the people as these 
               <br />
               wants manifest themselves from time to 
               <br />
               time. In my opinion, these educational 
               <br />
               clauses aretacked on to these Bills on ac— 
               <br />
