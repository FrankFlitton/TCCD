               Winnipeg is the third largest banking centre 
               <br />
               of Canada. The ‘ Financier ’ a leading ﬁnan-

               <br />
               Well, in 1900 the bank clearings of Winni- 
               <br />

               they amounted to $258,631,000.

               I think I have given ample proof of the 
               <br />
               great prosperity of that western country; 
               <br />
               and that prosperity has come because of the 
               <br />
               sound national policy and railway policy of 
               <br />
               the late Conservative government. There is 
               <br />
               nothing that I believe more strongly. i

               to give hon. gentlemen opposite credit for 
               <br />
               all they have done. I give them credit for 
               <br />
               what they have done to promote immigra—

               after the Conservative government had 
               <br />
               opened up the country and had secured low

               <br />
               been in this parliament than I ever heard in 
               <br />
               my life before. This is not to me a matter 
               <br />
               of Roman Catholics. I am glad and proud 
               <br />
               to say that my best friends and some of my 
               <br />
               warmest supporters, in the town in which I 
               <br />
               live. are Roman Catholics. And I want to 
               <br />
               say further that in the town in which I live, 
               <br />
               the town of Boissevain, we have six schools 
               <br />
               and a number of Catholics. My best and 
               <br />
               warmest political, and I may say business 
               <br />
               friend is a Roman Catholic. Perhaps 'in

               mentioning this; I am indulging in senti-

               ment, but the right hon. First Minister 
               <br />
               spoke of sentiment in introducing this 
               <br />
               measure, and there is no doubt sentiment is 
               <br />
               a great force. Well, his little girl and mine 
               <br />
               played together, they went to school to— 
               <br />
               gether, they had their parties together, 
               <br />
               and I do not believe that they knew which 
               <br />
               one is Protestant and which one is Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic. Yet for all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> each one was true 
               <br />
               to her church. Now, I believe that that is 
               <br />
               the kind of thing a national school builds 
               <br />
               up. I am prepared to go a good deal further 
               <br />
               perhaps than many in this House. I go a 
               <br />
               long way in favour of separation between 
               <br />
               church and state. I say there should be

               <br />
               in the Northwest we must abide by it. But 
               <br />
               lawyers disagree as well as doctors, and 
               <br />
               when lawyers disagree on the consti-

               tutional phase of this question who is to 
               <br />
               decide? I have been a regular attendant 
               <br />
               during this debate, and have been a 
               <br />
               pretty close observer, and I do not 
               <br />
               know yet what the constitution says on 
               <br />
               this question. I do not know yet what 
               <br />

               <br />
               clauses—the one ﬁrst brought down and 
               <br />
               the one brought down subsequently, and 
               <br />
               I must come to the conclusion that 
               <br />
               if doctors disagree so also do lawyers. We 
               <br />
               are told that the doctors’ mistakes are buried 
               <br />
               six feet under ground. That is sometimes 
               <br />
               cast up against us by the lawyers. But I 
               <br />
               have heard also that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> lawyers’ mistakes
