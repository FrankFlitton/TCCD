               population of Alberta was 72,924 and the

               Mr. W. J. ROCHE. It has been stated 
               <br />
               in the public press that the number of 
               <br />
               homestead entries in the west is no parti- 
               <br />
               cular indication of the increased population 
               <br />
               because many of these homestead entries 
               <br />
               have been made by men who have come 
               <br />
               from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American,</span> side, bought land ad— 
               <br />
               joining the entry, hold it for an increase 
               <br />
               in price, and many of them never come 
               <br />
               back to settle on the land. I had occas- 
               <br />
