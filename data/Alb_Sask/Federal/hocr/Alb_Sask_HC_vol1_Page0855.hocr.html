               long prior to any promise of legislation for 
               <br />

               The Catholic portion of the population have at 
               <br />
               times exhibited dissatisfaction, but it has never 
               <br />
               been very serious, and the general expression 
               <br />
               is that if the present system is continued, prac- 
               <br />
               tically everybody will be satisﬁed.

               ﬁrst, because there is the feeling that those
