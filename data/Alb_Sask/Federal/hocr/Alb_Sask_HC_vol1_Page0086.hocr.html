               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. The reason that 
               <br />
               this Bill stood was because I desired the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman who has the Bill in charge 
               <br />
               (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scott),</span> to explain why it was neces- 
               <br />
               sary to have a capitalization, if I remember 
               <br />
               correctly, of $2,000,000, and in addition to 
               <br />
               that the power to issue bonds upon the 
               <br />
               whole length of the road to the extent of 
               <br />
               $25,000 a mile. I would think that perhaps 
               <br />
               the bond issue would of itself be amply 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient to build and equip the road—per- 
               <br />
               haps more than sufﬁcient—but in addition 
               <br />
               to that we have authorized a capitalization 
               <br />
               of $2,000,000.

               Mr. SCOTT. I may say, Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               that the application of the promoters called 
               <br />
               for a capitalization of only $1,000,000 and 
               <br />
               it was in the judgment of the standing com-

               mittee on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railnays</span> and Canals that the
