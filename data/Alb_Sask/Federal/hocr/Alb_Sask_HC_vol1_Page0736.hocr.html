               ings (Mr. Northrup), in the course of their 
               <br />
               eloquent addresses on this subject, showing, 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Crown</span> holds these lands in right of 
               <br />
               the provinces and that the provinces are 
               <br />
               therefore entitled to them. Then, by way of 
               <br />
               rendering autonomy to the provinces beyond 
               <br />
               question complete and absolute. we have 
               <br />
               clause 23 of these Bills leaving in full force 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway right to full 
               <br />
               exemption from all powers of taxation, pro- 
               <br />
               vincial or municipal, for all time. I might 
               <br />
               also draw attention to the fact that these 
               <br />
               Bills make no provision as to the subject 
               <br />
               of irrigation in the west, although the right 
               <br />
               hon. First Minister had before him in fram- 
               <br />
               ing these Bills the draft Bill of the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Haultaxin,</span> which showed in section 10 and 
               <br />
               its explanatory notes the very great import- 
               <br />
               ance which that hon. gentleman, who is 
               <br />
               well acquainted with the needs of the North- 
               <br />
               west, placed upon that subject. On the whole 
               <br />
               it appears to me that instead of granting 
               <br />
               his much vaunted absolute and complete 
               <br />
               autonomy to the new provinces the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman is not granting any auton- 
               <br />
               omy at all other than in name; in fact, a 
               <br />
               not unﬁtting title for these Bills might he 
               <br />
               ‘ autonomy, how not to grant it.’
