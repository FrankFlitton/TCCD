               dealing with the boundary question in the 
               <br />
               early part of his speech and laid down the 
               <br />
               principle that it was absolutely essential in

               <br />
               vinces of about equal size, and he attached 
               <br />
               a special importance to that principle, in- 
               <br />
               deed, we can all see that it is more espe-

               <br />
               giving a reason why the boundaries of Maui-
