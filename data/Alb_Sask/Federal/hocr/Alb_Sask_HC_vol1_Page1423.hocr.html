               <br />
               was in charge of this side of the House. I

               some of our members desire to deal with 
               <br />
               this question but are not here to-night, and

               I think at least it was due to any one who

               was representing this side of the House

               some regularity in regard to this Bill. Of

               asking the minister what he meant to do ?

               He said: ‘I made an arrangement with

               On the 2151: of April (Good Friday) there was 
               <br />
               an excursion from Hamilton to Buffalo per 
               <br />
               Toronto, Hamilton and Brantford Railway, and 
               <br />
               as usual a large number went. Amongst others 
               <br />
               in the excursion were John <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Stevenson</span> and 
               <br />
               Thomas Mair, employees of the Sawyer-Massey 
               <br />
               Company. On reaching the bridge at the Falls, 
               <br />
               they were accosted by an American ofﬁcial, who 
               <br />
               interrogated them in the car as to how long 
               <br />
               they had been in Canada, &amp;c., and told them to 
               <br />
               follow him. He took them to the customs- 
               <br />
               house and told them to sit down, and demanded 
               <br />
               $2 each before they would be allowed to pro- 
               <br />
               ceed. They assured him both by letter——
