               these same gentlemen led by the member

               around with chips on thier shoulders and

               challenged the government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(to</span> open a consti—

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituency</span> in the Northwest. Well, a

               constituency was opened in the Northwest

               and then What happened? Oh. but says 
               <br />
               an hon. gentleman opposite, there was fear 
               <br />
               and trembling about that. Yes, there was 
               <br />
               fear and trembling in the ranks of the oppO- 
               <br />

               .as to the candidate that would be selected; 
               <br />
               yes, there was fear among the Conserva-

               tives that they might put up a candidate 
               <br />
               who would lose his deposit. There is no

               fear amongst hon. gentlemen on this side
