               of North York, and if the Liberal party 
               <br />
               can satisfy the people of Canada—I do not 
               <br />
               think they will—then possibly the Post-

               master General may realize that ambition 
               <br />
               to attain which he surrendered the rights

               of the people of the new provinces which

               has had conference after conference with 
               <br />
               the Papal ablegate, not only as to clause 
               <br />
               16 of the original Bill but as to the amend- 
               <br />
               ed educational clause which was substi- 
               <br />
               tuted for it. This latter clause was brought 
               <br />
               in to quiet the rebellion in the Liberal

               concerned as to whether or not the rights 
               <br />

               time for the people of Canada to think 
               <br />
               and they are doing their own thinking 
               <br />
               and don’t you forget it. If the gentlemen

               the government, a crisis had been brought 
               <br />
               about in the affairs of Canada. That crisis 
               <br />
               is the result of the government’s studied 
               <br />
               silence, of its system of misleading the 
               <br />
               people, of its system of working in the 
               <br />
               dark, of its'system of retiring behind the 
               <br />
               lines of Torres Vedras before the election, 
               <br />
               and rushing out after the election, to steal 
               <br />
               away the rights of the people. Don‘t ima- 
               <br />
               gine that you can coerce the people of the 
               <br />
               west. Don’t imagine that you can perman- 
               <br />
               ently secure 'even the best interests of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Roman</span> Catholic church in this way. As 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance said, if you 
               <br />
               treated the people of the west in a generous 
               <br />
               way, if you approached them in a fair spirit, 
               <br />
               the minority would get all the con- 
               <br />
               cessions they needed as is the case 
               <br />
               in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick where 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance told us they have 
               <br />
               not separate school laws, but where the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics enjoy vastly greater pri- 
               <br />
               vileges than as he would have us under- 
               <br />
               stand it—this legislation gives the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics of the west. 1 shall say 
               <br />
               no more. This is an important ques- 
               <br />
               tion ; it is fraught with immense conse- 
               <br />
               quences for the people of Canada; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,it</span> is a 
               <br />
               question upon which the people are think- 
               <br />
               ing and it is a question which will not die. 
               <br />
               Had this measure been introduced in 
               <br />
               a more moderate manner and in a 
               <br />
               constitutional way it might be that we 
               <br />
               would hear no more of it at the next elec- 
               <br />
               tion. But, introduced as it was, in the ab- 
               <br />
               sence of the constitutional advisers of 
               <br />
               the Crown, the people of the west lulled 
               <br />
               into fancied security as they were, the 
               <br />
               haste with which the leader of the govern-

               guage, with which the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               Introduced it, the statements which he 
               <br />
               made, the events which have occurred since 
               <br />
               involving the discussion of the inﬂuence 
               <br />
               exercised by the Papal ablegate over the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of this country, the manner 
               <br />
               in which the representatives of the west 
               <br />
               have been treated, the manner too in which 
               <br />
               the land question and the Question of timber, 
               <br />
