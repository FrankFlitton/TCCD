               the people of the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               are by no means a unit in favour of coer- 
               <br />
               cion. They have shown in 1896 that 
               <br />
               they are not in favour of coercion, 
               <br />
               and if you give them an opportunity. I 
               <br />
               believe they will show again that

               they are not in favour of coercion no

               more than are the people of Ontario. 
               <br />
               There is not even a suggestion of tyranny 
               <br />
               and the freenien of Quebec will not hesitate 
               <br />
               to record- their votes against tyranny just 
               <br />
               the same as the freemen of Ontario. I have 
               <br />
               no further desire to discuss this matter until 
               <br />
               it reaches the committee stage but I would 
               <br />
               appeal, as I appealed in the earlier part of 
               <br />
               my address, to the right hon. Prime Min- 
               <br />

               tentiou is wrong I want to point out to him 
               <br />
               that the Act of 1875 will be part of the laws 
               <br />
               of the new provinces until the legislatures 
               <br />
               meet and change it and it must be supposed 
               <br />
               that the Roman Catholic minority in these

               <br />

               a tremendous interest in that particular

               local standpoint, but I would think that 
               <br />
               when the people of the Northwest Territor-

               Some time ago, before this Bill was read a 
               <br />
               second time, the hon. leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion (Mr. R. L. Borden) was very anxious 
               <br />
               to have the matter discussed, and so was 
               <br />
               the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> for North Toronto (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster), and we heard a great deal about 
               <br />
               dissension in the government ranks from 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Toronto. But, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, we do not hear very 
               <br />
               much about that now. Why ? Because 
               <br />
               the right hon. Prime Minister of this 
               <br />
               country (Sir Wilfrid Laurier), is com-

               ing before the country and before this 
               <br />
               House with this Bill with practically a solid 
               <br />
               support behind his back. We do not hear 
               <br />
               anything about dissensioﬁ now simply be— 
               <br />
               cause when the hon. leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               came down to the second reading of the 
               <br />
               Bill he was not able to say that he was lead- 
               <br />
               ing the opposition. He said that he was 
               <br />
               leading himself and that was all he was 
               <br />
               doing because every hon. member behind 
               <br />
               him was going his OWn way. The members 
               <br />
               from the Northwest have been criticised, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               were simply a ﬂock of sheep, that we were 
               <br />

               <br />
               had been told by the right hon. Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister to get out of the House so that we 
               <br />
               would not be called upon to say anything—
