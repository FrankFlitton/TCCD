               Mr. GEORGE H. PERLEY <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Argenteuil).</span> 
               <br />
               This matter has been so thoroughly threshed 
               <br />
               out, Mr. Speaker, and the hour is now so 
               <br />
               late that I do not propose to keep the House 
               <br />
               very long. After listening to the many and 
               <br />
               varied arguments we have heard since this 
               <br />
               debate began it seems to me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quite</span> evident 
               <br />
               that no one is absolutely certain whether 
               <br />
               or not this House has the power to pass this 
               <br />
               Bill in its present shape. The hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle</span> 
               <br />
               man who has just spoken (Mr. McKenzie) 
               <br />
               claims that our constitution is as pliable 
               <br />
               and elastic as the British constitution, but 
               <br />
               I can hardly see how for a moment it can 
               <br />
               be maintained that a constitution, which is 
               <br />
               a written one, and hence bound within the 
               <br />
               four corners of the document, can be at all 
               <br />
               compared to one which has its only basis in 
               <br />
               practice and precedent. Our constitution 
               <br />
               is the British North America Act, and that 
               <br />
               Act I do not think we have the power to 
               <br />
               alter or change in any particular without 
               <br />
               the consent of the imperial parliament. 
               <br />
               After listening to the very able argu— 
               <br />
               ments which we have had pro and con con- 
               <br />
               cerning the question of jurisdiction from the 
               <br />
               many able lawyers who have taken part in 
               <br />
               this debate it seems to me that those who 
               <br />
               deny our power to legislate as we please re— 
               <br />
               garding the new provinces have the best of 
               <br />
               the argument, and I shall be surprised if 
               <br />
               the question of our jurisdiction is not car- 
               <br />
               ried to the Privy Council in England before 
               <br />
               it is ﬁnally decided. Should this happen, as 
               <br />
               I am afraid it will, the effect in the mean- 
               <br />
               time will be most unfortunate, for the new 
               <br />
               provinces will be kept in a condition of 
               <br />
               trouble and uncertainty until the matter is 
               <br />
               ﬁnally decided. In my opinion it would have 
               <br />
               been far better had a series of questions been 
               <br />
               submitted to the Supreme Court and the 
               <br />
               Privy Council, and thus have removed by 
               <br />
               the highest court in the empire any doubts 
               <br />
               that might arise as to our powers. and as the 
               <br />
               creation of these new provinces was a mat- 
               <br />
               ter which has been anticipated by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every‘</span> 
               <br />
               body for some years, it seems to me that 
               <br />
               it would have been only ordinary foresight 
               <br />
               and prudence on the part of this government 
               <br />
               to have found-out in advance exactly what 
               <br />
               jurisdiction this parliament has regarding 
               <br />
               these matters and thus be in a position to 
               <br />
               act without any uncertainty or hesitation.
