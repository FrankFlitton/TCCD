               a total number of whites in the year 1901 
               <br />
               of 59,570 for the old district of Alberta. It

               So, I deduct the total population of Indians

               <br />
               from that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">calculation,</span> if you simply divide 
               <br />
               that sum by 59,570, that the population has 
               <br />
               increased nearly four times or 392 per cent 
               <br />
               as compared with what it was shown to be 
               <br />
               in the 1901 census. What I am driving at 
               <br />
               is this: The census of 1901 is a most ex- 
               <br />
               traordinary basis to form this distribution 
               <br />
               upon when there are four white settlers 
               <br />
               now for every settler that there were four 
               <br />
               years ago. How can this committee for 
               <br />
               one instant say that this new population is 
               <br />
               divided absolutely evenly throughout the 
               <br />
               whole country, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(population</span> which is four 
               <br />
               times as great as it was four years ago? 
               <br />
               In these last four years we have'been hav— 
               <br />
               ing exceptionally good seasons in the south- 
               <br />
               ern part of Alberta and there has been a 
               <br />
               large inrush of immigration. Perhaps in 
               <br />
               the northern part they had almost too much 
               <br />
               rain and it is possible that the rush into 
               <br />
               that portion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alberta</span> has not been as 
               <br />
               great as in the southern part. It seems to 
               <br />
               be rather extraordinary that hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite should take the 1901 census as 
               <br />
               a standard and assume that as the white 
               <br />
               population has increased four times the in- 
               <br />
               crease has been evenly distributed through- 
               <br />
               out the whole of that country. I think from 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures which have been presented to 
               <br />
               this House it may be taken for granted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               the population has not gone evenly through 
               <br />
               that country, because we ﬁnd this peculiar 
               <br />
               circumstance that while from the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               which the right hon. Prime Minister gave 
               <br />
               to us it is found that the population of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1.901</span> was 17 per cent greater in the northern 
               <br />
               part of the old province of Alberta than it 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               'as in the southern part. We ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               votes registered were 23 per cent greater in 
               <br />
               the southern part than they were in the 
               <br />
               northern part. How is this discrepancy

               <br />
               opposite have been trying to make us believe 
               <br />
               that they are so extremely just that no un— 
               <br />
               fairness would be done if their amendment 
               <br />
               were carried. Let me point out a few facts 
               <br />
               and make a few comparisons. It is proposed 
               <br />
               by this amendment that that district of 
               <br />
               Alberta should have ﬁve local seats and the 
               <br />
               district of Edmonton six local seats. The 
               <br />
               vote cast last November in the Alberta d-is— 
               <br />
               trict was 3,433 which for ﬁve seats would 
               <br />
               give an average of 686 votes to each. The 
               <br />
               vote cast last November in the district of 
               <br />
               Edmonton was 5,061 which for six local 
               <br />
               seats would give 843 each. We see that 
               <br />
               each of the local constituencies in Edmonton 
               <br />
               would have 843 votes while each of the Al- 
               <br />
               berta local constituencies would have 686. 
               <br />
               This discrepancy will be more striking when 
               <br />
               you compare the rural constituencies of Al- 
               <br />
               berta and Strathcona. The amendment pro- 
               <br />
               poses that Alberta should have ﬁve local 
               <br />
               constituencies and Strathcona six. The vote 
               <br />
               in Alberta last November was 3,432 or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">636</span> 
               <br />
               for each of the ﬁve local constituencies. The 
               <br />
               vote in Strathcona was 5,871 or 978 votes 
               <br />
               for each of the six local constituencies,'and 
               <br />
               yet that is the proposition of these gentle— 
               <br />
               men opposite who tell us they are so fair 
               <br />
               and so just that they would give each con— 
               <br />
               stituency its fair representation. I want to 
               <br />
               say to this committee that if there is any 
               <br />
               part of Alberta that is going to be under- 
               <br />
               represented it is the constituency of Strath- 
               <br />
               cona, for there is not a shadow of a doubt 
               <br />
               in the mind of anybody who knows the 
               <br />
               Northwest that it is by far the. most popu— 
               <br />
               lous district in the proposed provinces. Of 
               <br />
               that I can cite many proofs. Let us make 
               <br />
               another comparison. In the Alberta consti- 
               <br />
               tuency there are 59 organized school dis- 
               <br />
               tricts and in Strathcona which I have the 
               <br />
               honour to represent there are 245. Each of 
               <br />
               the local constituencies in Alberta would 
               <br />
               have 12 school districts while each of the 
               <br />
               local constituencies in Strathcona would 
               <br />
               have 41. -
