               In dealing with the provisions contained 
               <br />
               in this Bill, I shall ﬁrst take up the ques-

               tion of the division of the Territories into 
               <br />
               two provinces. When we had our ﬁrst inter- 
               <br />
               view with the Prime Minister, and I was 
               <br />
               asked whether I favoured one or two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, my reply was that I favoured two 
               <br />
               provinces. But I want to say, with all due 
               <br />
               respect to the Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid Lau- 
               <br />
               rier, that even if he to-day wanted to extend 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba west, he could not 
               <br />
               do it and there is nobody else in this country 
               <br />
               who can do it. The people in the Northwest

               miles along the boundary of Manitoba—— 
               <br />
               would not tolerate it. Talk about agitation 
               <br />
               —--there has been no agitation whatever in 
               <br />
               the west over this school question, but if 
               <br />
               this government or any other government 
               <br />
               or any power on earth tried to coerce us 
               <br />
               into the province of Manitoba, you would 
               <br />
               see an agitation that would be remem- 
               <br />
               bered. The first mistake that was made in 
               <br />
               deﬁning the boundaries of the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba was made by the Conservative 
               <br />
               government. These gentlemen opposite now 
               <br />
               endeavour to put the blame on this govern- 
               <br />
               ment or on the leader of this government 
               <br />
               for not extending the province of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               but the real blame res-ts with the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Sir John A. Macdonald. During 
               <br />
               the years between 1884 and 1896 many of us 
               <br />
               were in favour of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extendinu‘</span> Manitoba away 
               <br />
               up west to Moose-jaw, and the matter was 
               <br />
               discussed not only among the settlers, but 
               <br />
               among the more prominent politicians of 
               <br />
               that territory. W'hen a brighter day dawned 
               <br />
               in 1896, and we thought that possibly we 
               <br />
               would be able to have this mistake of the 
               <br />
               Conservative government remedied, as well 
               <br />
               as a great many other mistakes of theirs, 
               <br />
               the matter was discussed very fully in the 
               <br />
               west, and a year or two afterwards the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of Manitoba <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> invited to 
               <br />
               East Assiniboia to discuss the question. A 
               <br />
               meeting was held at Indian Head and Mr. 
               <br />
               Roblin advocated his case, and Mr. Haul— 
               <br />
               tain, one of his own political friends, took 
               <br />
               the other side. And, because the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Roblin</span> got the worst of the debate he lost 
               <br />
               his temper a little bit, and with some of 
               <br />
               those characteristics of his that we in the 
               <br />
               west are familiar with, he undertook to 
               <br />
               threaten the people of East Assiniboia and 
               <br />
               the people of the Northwest as to what would 
               <br />
               happen if we did not agree to join the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba. He told us that if we 
               <br />
               persisted in remaining a part of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               Lnen Manitoba would regulate our freight 
               <br />
               rates and would not allow us to build rail- 
               <br />
               roads across that province, thus endeavouring 
               <br />
               to coerce us into joining with Manitoba. On 
               <br />
               that occasion, for ever was lost the chance 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eVel',</span> only a sentimental reason. We ob-

               which would elect as prime minister a man 
               <br />
               who harboured the thought, that because we 
               <br />
               did not agree with him he would coerce us 
               <br />

               <br />
               jected on that ground, we objected ten times 
               <br />
               more to being annexed to a province which 
               <br />
               would elect a premier, who having harbour-

               other and a far greater reason why 
               <br />
               we object now to being annexed to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ance.‘</span> The province of Manitoba had in 
               <br />
               1898 liabilities amounting to about $7,000,- 
               <br />
               000; but since that time those liabilities 
               <br />
               have been increased to nearly $30,000,000. 
               <br />
               The province of Manitoba has given guar- 
               <br />
               antees to one railway company alone to 
               <br />

               <br />
               the last session of the Manitoba legislature 
               <br />
               guarantees amounting to some'$2,000,000 or 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">513,000,000</span> were given to the same railway

               company, one of which was for terminals 
               <br />
               in the city of Winnipeg. Did anybody ever

               hear ot“ such a thing in the Dominion of

               <br />
               I noticed in the Bill that passed through the 
               <br />
               legislature that there was also a guarantee 
               <br />
               of bonds for $10,000 a mile on an old truck 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seven</span> miles long running into a gravel pit

               <br />
               railway. These are the Ways in which the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba is piling up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its.</span> lia— 
               <br />
               bilities, and this is the reason we would not 
               <br />
               listen to the proposition of that provmce to 
               <br />
               enlarge its boundaries westward. So that 
               <br />
               it‘ the province of Manitoba is not enlarged 
               <br />
               towards the west, it is not the fault of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of the Dominion. The mem— 
               <br />
               bers from the west are prepared to take 
               <br />
               the responsibility of standing in the way of 
               <br />
               that extension. A little while ago two of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Manitoba</span> ministers were down <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here,</span> 
               <br />
               and one of the reasons they gave Why 
               <br />
               Manitoba should have all the country north 
               <br />
               was that it had always governed that coun- 
               <br />
               try. That is not a proper statement of the 
               <br />
               case. It is true, the Lieutenant-Governor 
               <br />
               of Manitoba had jurisdiction there; but 
               <br />
               he was paid out of the Dominion treasury 
               <br />
               for all the expenditure in connection With
