               is not very desirable legislation. If gambl- 
               <br />

               planation. This House has already passed 
               <br />
               legislation with respect to gambling and 
               <br />
               betting. Now it appears that some persons 
               <br />
               feel it is desirable to have that legislation 
               <br />
               somewhat softened down in certain direc- 
               <br />
               tions. Is it desirable in the public interest 
               <br />
               and in public morality to pass that legisla- 
               <br />
               tion ? I think not.

               Mr. CLARKE. I think the passing of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               this amendment by the House would be 
               <br />
               a very retrograde step. There are two, 
               <br />
               provisions in the law as it now stands. 
               <br />
               One of these forbids betting houses and 
               <br />
               the other is in regard to the registration 
               <br />
               on bets on horse races. I happen to reside 
               <br />
               in a city where we have horse races, where 
               <br />
               there is a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deal</span> of betting, and I can 
               <br />
               say that there is no greater curse to the 
               <br />
               community than this race track. The horse 
               <br />
               races are incidental ; the gambling and bet- 
               <br />
               ting is the main issue. I know nothing 
               <br />
               that has ruined more young men in that 
               <br />
               vicinity than this very race track. It has 
               <br />
               been my experience to have to prosecute 
               <br />
               several young men who were in trusted 
               <br />
               positions, but who had squandered the 
               <br />
               money of their employers, all traceable to 
               <br />
               this race track. The object of this Bill 
               <br />
               is to permit betting on a regular race track. 
               <br />
               There is nothing to prevent that at the 
               <br />
               present time; there is nothing in the pre- 
               <br />
               sent law to prevent people betting if they 
               <br />
               choose to on the horse races. The deci- 
               <br />
               sion in the Ontario case in which I happen- 
               <br />
               ed to be interested, was that although you 
               <br />
               can bet all you like and register bets you 
               <br />
               are not to set up a betting stand or booth. 
               <br />
               In order to evade the law, they brought 
               <br />
               up a few old plugs to the race track, horses 
               <br />
               that could run perhaps ten miles an hour 
               <br />
               in order to show that this was a boua <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂde‘</span>

               race <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hack.</span> The real attraction was the 
               <br />
               betting inside on the races at Latonia, 
               <br />
               Nashville and several other places. I see
