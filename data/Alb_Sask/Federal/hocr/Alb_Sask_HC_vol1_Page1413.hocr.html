               denominational schools? The Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance said it established national schools, 
               <br />
               but gave opportunity for a half-hour's reli- 
               <br />
               gious training after 3.30 in the afternoon. 
               <br />
               Yet we have the statement of the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice that the Act of 1875, section 11, 
               <br />
               gives the people in any school section 
               <br />
               the right to establish any kind of a school 
               <br />
               they see ﬁt. Could anything be plainer‘? 
               <br />
               I would like hon. gentlemen opposite to 
               <br />
               get the Act of 1875 and read section 11, 
               <br />
               which the Minister of Justice says he in- 
               <br />
               tended to have read into this Act.

               Now, let me reply to my hon. friend who 
               <br />
               spoke of the references that have been made
