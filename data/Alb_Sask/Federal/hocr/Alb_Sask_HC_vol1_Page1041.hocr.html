               Mr. H. GUTI—IRIE <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(South</span> Wellington). 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, in rising at this late stage of 
               <br />
               the debate, at a time when the chief point 
               <br />
               of controversy has been most thoroughly 
               <br />
               discussed from almost every point of view, 
               <br />
               namely, the educational clauses of this mea- 
               <br />
               sure, one would almost require some excuse 
               <br />
               for trespassing further on the time of the 
               <br />
               House. I merely rise on this occasion 
               <br />
               to state, in as few words as possible, 
               <br />
               my own feeling and my own posi— 
               <br />
               tion in regard to this Bill. without en- 
               <br />
               tering into details or repeating arguments 
               <br />
               except in the most general way, in order 
               <br />
               to justify the faith which is in me with 
               <br />
               regard to this measure. When this Bill 
               <br />
               was before the House upon a former occa- 
               <br />
               sion, I stated that I was unal-terably in 
               <br />
               favour of the measure as it was then be- 
               <br />
               fore the House. So I say now, I was 
               <br />
               in favour of it, as I then under- 
               <br />
               stood it, so I am, as I understand it at 
               <br />
               the present time, to be a measure to con- 
               <br />
               tinue in the Northwest provinces that 
               <br />
               school system which they now enjoy and 
               <br />
               which for many years past they have en- 
               <br />
               joyed. If the amendments which have 
               <br />
               been introduced to the Bill since I spoke 
               <br />
               on a former occasion, give more precision 
               <br />
               to the present state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> in regard to 
               <br />
               education in the Northwest Territories, 
               <br />
               than did the original draft, then I think 
               <br />
               they have been wisely introduced. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve further that the measure as now be- 
               <br />
               fore the House is acceptable to the vast 
               <br />
               majority of the people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories; and if so, then, apart from my 
               <br />
               own convictions altogether on this subject— 
               <br />
               I may say that my convictions are entirely 
               <br />
               favourable to the measure—but apart from 
               <br />
               them altogether. I would feel it my duty 
               <br />
               to support the measure, always with this 
               <br />
               provision. that this House has the power, 
               <br />
               that this parliament has the constitutional 
               <br />
               authority, to pass this measure, and that 
               <br />
               in so doing we in no way hamper, or in- 
               <br />
               fringe upon, or deny any of those rights 
               <br />
               which we know under the general term 
               <br />
               of provincial rights. Now, Mr. Speaker, I 
               <br />
               atﬁrm the constitutional right of this par— 
               <br />
               liament to pass this measure, and I deny 
               <br />
               that in so doing we in any way infringe 
               <br />
               upon provincial rights properly so-called. I 
               <br />
               am well aware that in taking that stand 
               <br />
               and in discussing this measure from that 
               <br />
               point of view—which is the only point of
