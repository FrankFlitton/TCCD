               <br />
               Speaker. The question came up once before 
               <br />
               on, I think, a precisely similar matter, and 
               <br />
               the decision was—I am speaking from 
               <br />
               memory—that as the method adopted in the 
               <br />
               House was one purely of convenience, a 
               <br />
               record of the Votes and Proceedings should 
               <br />
               be made precisely in the same way as if the 
               <br />
               division had taken place. It was only a 
               <br />
               method of saving the time of hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               in this House. But When it comes to re- 
               <br />
               cording the names, they should appear as if 
               <br />
               the division had taken place ; that is to say. 
               <br />
               that you should have a record as if the 
               <br />
               House had actually voted, because every one 
               <br />
               in the House is supposed to consent to the 
               <br />
               course adopted.

               position. If you were to record the

               Hon. DAVID TISDALE. It seems to me

               that if we are to declare this record correct, 
               <br />

               <br />
               visions, because I am quite certain that the 
               <br />
               gentlemen on this side of the House would 
               <br />
               have insisted on another vote if they thought 
               <br />
               they were not to be recorded again. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Of</span> 
               <br />
               course the Speaker must decide that. If the 
               <br />
               practice is that we must have a new divi- 
               <br />
               sion under these circumsrances in-order to 
               <br />
               get a record of the names, then we must 
               <br />
               always put the House to that trouble. I had 
               <br />
               always understood, though I have not 
               <br />
               bothered my head much about these rules, 
               <br />
               that when it was a division such as was 
               <br />
               agreed to last night, the names were re- 
               <br />
               corded the second time, and that when we 
               <br />
               consent to the division in that way the 
               <br />
               names are always to be recorded, because 
               <br />
               the object of the division is to have a record 
               <br />
               of the names. But if that is not the case,

               then my hon. friend from East Elgin (Mr. 
               <br />
               Ingram) is right, and the minutes ought to 
               <br />
               be amended, if we have power to amend 
               <br />
               them. I do not know myself what proceed- 
               <br />
               ing we ought to take.

               <br />
               ought to be informed as to what the prac- 
               <br />
               tice of the House has been. This has 
               <br />
               occurred a hundred times in the House and 
               <br />
               in my opinion such votes have always 
               <br />
               been recorded as if the vote had been given 
               <br />
               at the time. You can very well ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               what the practice has been and if the prac- 
               <br />
               tice has been as I state then it is your 
               <br />
               duty to see that the Minutes of the House 
               <br />
               are revised and printed in accordance with 
               <br />
               the practice.

               Mr. SPEAKER. I desire to inform the

               hon. member (Mr. Haggart) that I have 
               <br />
               asked the clerk what the practice has been
