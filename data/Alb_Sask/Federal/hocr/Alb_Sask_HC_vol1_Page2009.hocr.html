               a law passed in 1877. which provides for

               the use of the French language. We do

               language. That restrictive provision is to

               be found in article 93, with which we are 
               <br />
               all familiar. The provision relating to the 
               <br />
               French language is limited only to the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec. and to the federal parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, and it applies nowhere else. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Could</span> the 
               <br />
               government impose this new restriction on 
               <br />
               the western provinces, the more so as our 
               <br />
               French speaking fellow-countrymen are so 
               <br />
               few in numbers there that they would not 
               <br />
               even speak French in the legislature, were 
               <br />
               they given that right ? The French Cana— 
               <br />
               dian population in the west represent but 
               <br />
               about four per cent of the total population ; 
               <br />
               such being the ﬁgures laid before the House 
               <br />
               without being challenged by anybody. Each 
               <br />
               legislature will have 25 members, making 
               <br />
               .50 in all. According to that ratio of 4 per 
               <br />
               cent. there would only be one French member ' 
               <br />
               in each legislature. That there may be an 
               <br />
               assembly, at least three people are needed, 
               <br />
               and as that French member would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alone.</span> 
               <br />
               he would have to speak French to himself.

               To my mind it is not a matter of senti-

               matter, and I say that we should not im—

               of min-e tallies with the statement I made 
               <br />
               on the ﬁrst reading of the Bill. The hon.

               <br />
               different opinion, and I regret very much 
               <br />
               that I cannot see this matter in the same

               light as he does. For us, it is a very delicate
