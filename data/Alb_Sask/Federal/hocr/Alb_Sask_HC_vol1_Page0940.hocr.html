               pre—eonfederation debates must realize that

               public platform and debated it during the 
               <br />

               <br />

               recognize that Sir A. T. Gait in demanding 
               <br />
               these privileges for the minority of the pro—

               all decency and in all fairness similar privi—

               <br />
               be no dispute about that, and indeed ever

               since confederation that principle has been

               crystallized in the legislation of this parlia-

               I consider myself fortunate that I was 
               <br />
               brought up in _a province in which people 
               <br />
               of different races and different creeds are 
               <br />
               able to work harmoniously together for the 
               <br />
               welfare of our common country ; I consider 
               <br />
               myself fortunate in this because it has given 
               <br />
               me the opportunity to understand seine 
               <br />
               things which men situated differently have 
               <br />
               not had the opportunity of realizing. At 
               <br />
               confederation, in 1867, the Protestant min— 
               <br />
               ority of Quebec were granted separate 
               <br />
               school privileges, and the carrying out of 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understanding</span> was placed largely in 
               <br />
               the hands of the Catholic majority. I am 
               <br />
               prepared to say here, Sir, that from 1867 to 
               <br />
               the present day not only has the spirit of 
               <br />
               our constitutional guarantee been faithfully 
               <br />
               adhered to by the Roman Catholic majority, 
               <br />
               but that the majority has shown itself in all 
               <br />
               respects and at all times generous in its 
               <br />
               treatment of the Protestants and has done 
               <br />
               everything it possibly "could to promote 
               <br />
               good feeling and harmony. I am happy to 
               <br />
               be able to state in this parliament of Can- 
               <br />
               ada to-day that there is perhaps no country 
               <br />
               in the world where people of different origins 
               <br />
               and different creeds live together in such 
               <br />
               accord as in the province of Quebec. There 
               <br />
               is no country, I believe, which affords such a 
               <br />
               good example of the good that can be brought 
               <br />
               about where the majority and the minority 
               <br />

               <br />

               future as though this debate had never taken 
               <br />
               place. The policy of the majority in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec has ever been to treat 
               <br />
               the Protestant minority in a spirit of fair 
               <br />
               play, and I would ask if that is not a good 
               <br />
               policy; good for the majority, good for the 
               <br />
               minority and good for the welfare of our

               It would seem to me, Mr. Speaker, that 
               <br />
               in starting these new provinces on their 
               <br />
               career, a constitution that is good enough 
               <br />
               for the province of Quebec, and which, by 
               <br />
               the way, is good enough for the great pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario, ought to be good enough 
               <br />
               for Alberta and Saskatchewan. A few 
               <br />
               moments ago I glanced over a manifesto 
               <br />
               issued under the authority, or at any rate 
               <br />
               with the approval, of my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               East Grey (Mr. Sproule). The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man starts out in this manifesto by declar- 
               <br />
               ing how desirable it is that in a country like 
               <br />
               Canada we should have peace, but he im- 
               <br />
               mediately proceeds to make for peace by a 
               <br />
               declaration of war. It is contended that 
               <br />
               the schools in the Northwest should be na— 
               <br />
               tional schools, and I know that the argu- 
               <br />
               ment is often made that national schools 
               <br />
               are absolutely non-sectarian and that an ad- 
               <br />
               herent of any particular faith might go to 
               <br />
               a national school without doing violence to 
               <br />
               his religious convictions or his conscientious 
               <br />
               scruples in any way. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               we might as well discuss this question frank— 
               <br />
               ly, fairly and candidly. That statement is 
               <br />
               not founded on fact. The views of Protest- 
               <br />
               ants and Catholics in respect to education 
               <br />
               are so radically different that there is no 
               <br />
               possibility of reconciling them, and that
