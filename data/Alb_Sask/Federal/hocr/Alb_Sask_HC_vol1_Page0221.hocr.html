               other day, they passed a law quite in accord

               with the letter and with the spirit of clause 
               <br />
               11 of the Act of 1875. They passed a law 
               <br />
               similar to the one we have in Quebec, a law 
               <br />
               by which Catholics had the management 
               <br />
               of their own schools, had the choice of 
               <br />
               their own text books, and had the right to 
               <br />
               have their schools inspected by men of their 
               <br />
               own creed—but all under government 
               <br />
               supervision. They enjoyed separate schools, 
               <br />
               not only in name but in fact, as the member

               for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) well stated the 
               <br />
               other day. The inspectors had to be appoint- 
               <br />
               ed by the government, but they were chosen 
               <br />
               by the Catholic section, just as in the pro-

               vince of Quebec Protestant schools are in-

               <br />
               ant section of the Board of Education. The 
               <br />
               books used in the separate schools of the
