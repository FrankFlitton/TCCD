               this contest. But the great point the House 
               <br />
               wants to understand is how hon. gentlemen 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the Minister of the Interior with what 
               <br />
               they have told us about the feeling of the 
               <br />
               people in Edmonton. They have told us 
               <br />
               about people being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«bound</span> and shackled and 
               <br />
               robbed of their liberties. And one hon. gen-

               tleman on the other side, I think, ended his 
               <br />
               speech with the words, ‘give me liberty or 
               <br />
               give me death.’ One would think, if the 
               <br />
               feeling were so strong as these hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               men say, there would have been enough dis-

               satisﬁed electors, even dissatisﬁed Liberals, 
               <br />

               Conservative caucus, to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alter</span> opposition to

               <br />
               portunity for protest was offered. There 
               <br />
               are thousands of English-speaking Pro-

               Mr. PATERSON. That would not be a 
               <br />
               test. The people of Centre Toronto were 
               <br />
               not being bound or shackled. Their hearts 
               <br />
               were not being wrung and their liberties 
               <br />
               being taken from them. Why, in various 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conSmuencies</span> we ﬁnd independent parties,

               bers do not claim to have great wealth. 
               <br />
               They nominate candidates in many cases 
               <br />
               where they have no expectation of carrying 
               <br />
               them and tell you so. They put up the ne— 
               <br />
               cessary deposit though they may feel sure 
               <br />
               that they are going to lose it. But here, 
               <br />
               though there was, according to hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen opposite, this feeling of indignation 
               <br />
               because men were being shackled and 
               <br />
               bound, their hearts wrung and their peace 
               <br />
               destroyed, not four men to nominate and 
               <br />
               one to accept and a deposit of only $200 
               <br />
               could be found to make a protest when the 
               <br />
               opportunity offered. To ask why we did 
               <br />
               not put up a candidate in Centre Toronto 
               <br />
               is no reply. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»‘Ve</span> have never said there

               have sent and the resolutions they have 
               <br />
               passed. Only ﬁve men were required to give 
               <br />
               expression to any public dissatisfaction that 
               <br />

               any other that could be afforded. As to

               <br />
               not do him credit. He read an extract from 
               <br />
               a newspaper and applied it to an organiza- 
               <br />
               tion to which he referred—though the news- 
               <br />
               paper had not so applied it—and waxed in- 
               <br />
               dignant because he says these references 
               <br />
               are offensive. He speaks of petitions. He 
               <br />
               knows these petitions came in properly. The 
               <br />
               signers were not afraid to express them- 
               <br />
               selves. And, of course, they had a perfect 
               <br />
               right to petition. Now, to answer those 
               <br />
               who who sent in those petitions is not to
