               national school system of that country. I 
               <br />
               take issue with the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               there. Had it not been for the national 
               <br />
               school system of the United States, that 
               <br />
               country would never have been able to

               digest the great foreign element that has 
               <br />
               come into it. And I contend that if you im- 
               <br />
               pose separate schools, ecclesiasticalschools, 
               <br />

               gress upon which they have so hopefully 
               <br />
               entered. The public school system is the 
               <br />
               hope of the United States. If they have 
               <br />
               great problems, the men who are being 
               <br />
               trained in their public schools are the men 
               <br />
               who will solve them. I have often spoken
