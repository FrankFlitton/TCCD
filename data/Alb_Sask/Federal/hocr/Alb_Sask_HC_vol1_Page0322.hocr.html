               friend if I did forget it. It may be said: 
               <br />
               Why was there not an appeal or, why were 
               <br />
               not those amendments vetoed by the govern- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Thompson has been brought into the discus- 
               <br />
               sion. Sir John Thompson’s opinions were 
               <br />
               well known on such subjects. I would not like

               to trouble the House with a great deal of 
               <br />
               reading, but I Wish to point out ﬁrst of all 
               <br />
               that when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of the ordinance of 
               <br />
               1592 was felt it was found that it was an 
               <br />
               enactment of something which had been 
               <br />
               decided in 1891, and that the time within 
               <br />
               which it could have been disallowed was 
               <br />
