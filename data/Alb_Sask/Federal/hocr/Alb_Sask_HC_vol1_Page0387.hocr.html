               One of the questions which had to be 
               <br />
               considered in connection with this matter 
               <br />
               was the question of the number of Dro- 
               <br />
               vinces—whether there should be one pro- 
               <br />
               vince, as was contemplated in the request 
               <br />
               made by the Northwest government and 
               <br />
               legislature, or more than one province. I 
               <br />
               may be permitted to say that I was my— 
               <br />
               self quite strnngly in favour of the propo- 
               <br />
               sition that only one province should be 
               <br />
               created; and even yet, looking at the ques- 
               <br />
               tion purely from the local and territorial 
               <br />
               point of view, I can see no reason why one 
               <br />
               government, one legislature, one set of ma- 
               <br />
               chinery, should not have been sufﬁcient for 
               <br />
               that territory. But, on the other hand, I 
               <br />
               was bound to recognize, as the people of 
               <br />
               the Territories generally have recognized. 
               <br />
               that the other partners in confederation had 
               <br />
               a right to an opinion in this matter, and 
               <br />
               the decision which has been come to, to 
               <br />
               create two provinces, is, I think, generally 
               <br />
               satisfactory to the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west as a whole. Except for the protest in 
               <br />
               the letter of Mr. Haultain, which was 
               <br />

               Qu’Appelle (Mr. Lake) last evening, I know 
               <br />
               of no protest raised in the Northwest Ter-

               ritories against the creation of two pro-

               <br />

               My hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. M. S. 
               <br />
               McCarthy), speaking two or three nights 
               <br />

               ing line which has been selected, the fourth

               been farther east, and pointing out that

               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex-M‘inis‘ter</span> of the Interior had contend-

               ed that the line should have been sixty'

               miles farther east. Well, the question of 
               <br />
               the dividing line was not looked upon, on 
               <br />
               my part at least, as being a contentious 
               <br />
               matter. From my point of view, it would 
               <br />
               have been better for my province, in one 
               <br />
               sense, to have had the dividing line brought 
               <br />
               farther east, because if the ﬁnancial rposi- 
               <br />
               tion of each province were to be the same 
               <br />
               it would be better for the province the

               smaller it was. But on the basis that each 
               <br />
               should have equal ﬁnancial strength, each 
               <br />
               member in giving advice was under great 
               <br />
               responsibility as regards the line to divide 
               <br />
               the area. I may say that my own advice 
               <br />
               was that the present eastern boundary Of 
               <br />
               Alberta should be selected as the dividing 
               <br />
               line and I still believe that the future will 
               <br />
               Show that that would have been the most 
               <br />
               equitable dividing line between the two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, looking to their future populations. 
               <br />
               It must not be forgotten that the province 
               <br />
               of Alberta will have in the extreme north a 
               <br />
               large habitable area, the counterpart of 
               <br />
               which the province of Saskatchewan will 
               <br />
               not possess. My hon. friend from Calgary 
               <br />
               suggested that the area covered by the 
               <br />
               foothills in the Rocky Mountains should, so 
               <br />
               l'ar as population is concerned, be elimi- 
               <br />
               nated. I do not agree with him at all in 
               <br />
               that regard. There are immense coal de- 
               <br />
               posits in that area, and I have no doubt 
               <br />
               that in the years to come there will be im- 
               <br />
               mense coal—mining towns in the southern 
               <br />
