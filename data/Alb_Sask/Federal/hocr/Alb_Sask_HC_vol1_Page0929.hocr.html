               lieve in that at all. They may blame our 
               <br />
               system of separate schools. We may lack 
               <br />
               in that respect, but that is a thing they do 
               <br />
               not teach there. Of course they may have 
               <br />
               a bad habit of going too far back as my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Dundas (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Broder)</span> has 
               <br />
               said, to ﬁnd examples, but, when it comes 
               <br />
               to appealing to the musket, the pistol or the 
               <br />
               sword, as the hon. member for Victoria and 
               <br />
               Haliburton (Mr. Hughes) does, we are not 
               <br />
               taught that.

               Mr. SAM. HUGHES.

               Minister?

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BUREAU.</span> No, the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               can only handle justice and equity. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister can handle the minority and 
               <br />
               give them their dues. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               will never talk musket or rebellion to get a 
               <br />
               political advantage out of it. It has been 
               <br />
               charged in this House by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron)—of course 
               <br />
               these remarks are a little disconnected, but 
               <br />
               when interruptions are made we have to 
               <br />
               answer them—that we are making a right 
               <br />
               one way in Quebec and the other way in 
               <br />
               Ontario. I desire to deny that entirely. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister has always had one line of 
               <br />
               conduct and one policy and one measure 
               <br />
               for all concerned be it in Ontario or Quebec. 
               <br />
               I deny most emphatically this double game 
               <br />
               that we are charged With, and I would say 
               <br />
               that on the contrary the statement refers 
               <br />
               to the speeches delivered and the practices 
               <br />
               followed by hon. gentlemen opposite. I will 
               <br />
               now continue my little circular. I have a 
               <br />
               great. liking for this little circular. It tells 
               <br />
               a lot when you analyse it.
