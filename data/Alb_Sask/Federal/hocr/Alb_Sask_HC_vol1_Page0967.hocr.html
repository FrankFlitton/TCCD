               <br />
               told us in eiïect that the government were

               not able to draw a legal document, that 
               <br />
               they did not know the meaning of a legal

               document, that it was drawn by an ofﬁce 
               <br />
               boy, or a draughtsman—I think the latter 
               <br />
               Was the word used—that a draughtsman 
               <br />
               must have drawn the ﬁrst educational 
               <br />
               clauses of this Bill. When that statement 
               <br />
               was made I did not notice any signs of hum— 
               <br />
               iliation upon the face of the Postmaster Gen- 
               <br />

               <br />
               tice. If I understood correctly, the speech 
               <br />
               of the ex-minister, taken in connection With 
               <br />
               the accompanying circumstances, he him- 
               <br />
               self must have drawn these amendments. 
               <br />
               This is a great game, it seems to me. It 
               <br />
               has not been customary for the hon. Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice ‘to sit silent when charges 
               <br />
               of that kind have been made in respect to 
               <br />
               his work. The hon. Minister of Justice does 
               <br />
               not lack courage and it is rather a peculiar 
               <br />
               position in which we ﬁnd that hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man. We see him sitting docile and calm, 
               <br />
               taking the thrusts of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Brandon. Is it because there is any brother- 
               <br />
               ly love that we do not know of, or alrection, 
               <br />
               or charity existing between these hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen? Is it out of the generosity of his 
               <br />
               heart that he is not going to pay any at- 
               <br />
               tention to these things? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rNo,</span> it is not that. 
               <br />
               it is a larger game, a bigger game. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Brandon knew‘, when he 
               <br />
               made that statement in reference to the 
               <br />
               draughtsman, that it was impossible for the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Justice to answer him. He 
               <br />
               knew he could not answer him. The hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice wants a law enacted 
               <br />
               granting the privilege that the amendment 
               <br />
               is designed to grant, the privilege of sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools by Dominion legislation, and 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Justice knew that if 
               <br />
               he got up and contradicted the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Brandon in respect to the amendments 
               <br />
               being radically different from the original 
               <br />
               clauses that the‘ Minister of Justice having 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[following</span> in this House and his legal

               tional system has developed, the attendance 
               <br />
               has improved and there are better courses of
