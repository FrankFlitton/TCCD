               <br />
               have desired to have read everything else 
               <br />
               that has been said on this very important 
               <br />
               subject, because, with the rest of the hon. 
               <br />
               members <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bt“</span> this House and in common with 
               <br />
               them, I look upon it as the most important 
               <br />
               matter that has been before this House, as 
               <br />
               far as I know, since confederation. But, 
               <br />
               Sir, I am impressed by a further fact. This 
               <br />
               debate, in some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure,</span> has drifted, I re— 
               <br />
               gret to say, into abuse. If there is one thing 
               <br />
               more than another that I admired in the 
               <br />
               speech of the right hon. First Minister in 
               <br />
               which he introduced this Bill, it was the 
               <br />
               suggestion that we should proceed to its 
               <br />
               consideration with calmness, with modera- 
               <br />
               tion and with some effort to conceive that 
               <br />
               others besides ourselves might have honest 
               <br />
               convictions in respect to this very important 
               <br />
               matter; but I deeply regret that some of 
               <br />
               the followers of the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               have not seen ﬁt to approach this important 
               <br />
               question with that feeling which the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman so well expressed. Why, Sir. 
               <br />
               how can it be fairly or reasonably said 
               <br />
               for one moment that the city of Toronto, 
               <br />
               in which I happen to live is bigoted and 
               <br />
               intolerant ? Were it a fact true, .how dis— 
               <br />
               graceful it would be to throw up to us that 
               <br />
               we were so ignorant, so far behind the rest 
               <br />
               of the people of this country in our knowl- 
               <br />
               edge <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ot"</span> what is reasonable and just, 
               <br />
               how disgraceful that such language should 
               <br />
               be addresed to us rather than the 
               <br />
               language <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'of</span> kindness, consideration and 
               <br />
               conciliation ? I wish to say, Sir, that the 
               <br />
               constituency which I have the great honour 
               <br />
               to represent in this House, no later than the 
               <br />
               25th of January last, gave a majority of 
               <br />
               2,800 votes in favour of a Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               (Hon. J. J. Foy), and I want to say 
               <br />
               also that, bigoted as we are, or as 
               <br />
               we are said to be, we have the greatest 
               <br />
               affection and admiration for all our fellow- 
               <br />
               countrymen, whether they are Catholics or 
               <br />
               Protestants. whether they are of English, 
               <br />
               Irish, Scotch or French descent. We make 
               <br />
               and we endeavour to make no distinction, 
               <br />
               and I sincerely trust that no member of 
               <br />
               this House will in future feel constrained 
               <br />
               to use any such language as that to which 
               <br />
               I have referred towards any part of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario. But, dealing for the mo—

               people naturally expect abuse, but I 
               <br />
               did not think the Liberal party would be

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(imposed</span> to use any such epithets towards 
               <br />
               the leading Liberals of Ontario. Now, Sir, 
               <br />
               we have been told that there has been a'

               compromise in respect to this Bill. I .wili

               <br />
               compromise in respect to this Bill, what 
               <br />
               has been the lever that has brought about 
               <br />
               this compromise? Has it been the argument 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend the leader of the opposi— 
               <br />
               tion (Mr. R. L. Borden)? Not at all. If 
               <br />
               any compromise has taken place, it has 
               <br />
               taken place because of the vigorous, united 
               <br />
               and strong protests that have come to this 
               <br />
               House from nearly every Liberal consti- 
               <br />
               tuency in Ontario. I venture to say that 
               <br />
               in 1896 no Liberal ever got a warmer, more 
               <br />
               enthusiastic, heartier or more cordial recep- 
               <br />
               tion than that accorded to the right hon. 
               <br />
               First Minister, when he came to the city 
               <br />
               of Toronto. Mr. Speaker, if that was the 
               <br />
               feeling of the people in the city of Toronto, 
               <br />
               in 1896, since when have they suddenly 
               <br />
               become bigoted and intolerant? If their 
               <br />
               hearts and minds and feelings were stirred 
               <br />
               with admiration of the right hon. Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, then in a constituency which, in 
               <br />
               1896, returned a Liberal candidate (the late 
               <br />
               Mr. Justice ’Lount), which, later on, returned 
               <br />
               a Liberal (Mr. Bertram), and which was 
               <br />
               barely wrested from the Liberal party in 
               <br />
               1900, in a constituency which, in 1904, with 
               <br />
               the most popular candidate the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive party could put in the ﬁeld, was barely 
               <br />
               won by such candidate (the late Mr. E. F. 
               <br />
               Clarke) by a majority of 200, how is it no 
               <br />
               Liberal candidate came forward in April 
               <br />
               last? What was the change? What facts 
               <br />
               had intervened? The people were not 
               <br />
               bigoted in 1896. They objected to the coer- 
               <br />
               cion of Manitoba. What facts intervened 
               <br />
               between the election in November and the 
               <br />
               election by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'acclamatlon</span> in April last? 
               <br />
               Nothing assuredly but the introduction into 
               <br />
               parliament of these Bills. Now, Sir, I dare 
               <br />
               say it has been quoted to you, and I do not 
               <br />
               propose to dwell on this matter at length, 
               <br />
               but I do feel that some justice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should.</span> be 
               <br />
               .done to the people who honestly believe 
               <br />
