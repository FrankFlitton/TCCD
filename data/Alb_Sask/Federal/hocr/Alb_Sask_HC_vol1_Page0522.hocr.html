               -I am sure that if the object of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) was to 
               <br />
               raise this discussion out of the rut into

               race and religion he has signally failed 
               <br />
               in doing so; because during all the

               long years in which I have sat in par- 
               <br />

               and I think the House will agree with me, 
               <br />
               that I have not the slightest objection to the

               <br />
               admiration for the moral teaching of the

               Church of Rome, although I do not believe 
               <br />
               in its tenets. But I do say as a citizen of 
               <br />
               this country that when the allegation is 
               <br />
               made that the Papal delegate, who comes 
               <br />
               here properly enough to fulﬁl the purpose 
               <br />
               for which he was brought—though the man- 
               <br />
               ner in which he was brought might not be 
               <br />
               acceptable to many of us who sit on this

               side of the House—though he came here 
               <br />
               properly enough to supervise the affairs of 
               <br />
               the church of which he is a distinguished 
               <br />
               dignitary; but I say that when it is alleged 
               <br />
               by the newspapers and by a leading mem- 
               <br />
               ber of the government of Manitoba, that 
               <br />
               that gentleman has interfered in a matter 
               <br />
               that does not belong to the domain of the 
               <br />
               Church of Rome at all, then I say that the 
               <br />
               people of this country, and at all events 
               <br />
               those of us who sit on this side of the

               <br />
               Sir, what are the facts in relation to this 
               <br />
               matter? I am not here to relate the facts,

               the right hon. leader of the government that 
               <br />
               he had no knowledge of these negotiations
