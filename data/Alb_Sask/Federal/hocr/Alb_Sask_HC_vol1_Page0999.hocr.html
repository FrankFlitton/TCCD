               entirely different from the question before 
               <br />
               us to-day. The province of Manitoba had 
               <br />
               passed an Act giving the Roman Catholics 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afterwards</span> repealed the law they had pass— 
               <br />
               ed. The minority appealed the new law to 
               <br />
               the highest court, and that court said they 
               <br />
               must go to the Dominion authorities for 
               <br />
               a remedial order. The position to-day is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entirely</span> different. We are dealing with a 
               <br />
               wholly new situation. There is no legis-

               The right hon. Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid

               <br />
               the position in 1896 from that which he 
               <br />
               takes now. He was riding up and down 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario and Manitoba, in 
               <br />

               members of the Conservative party at that

               time, some of them very prominent Orange-

               safely say that the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               while in Manitoba and Ontario was riding 
               <br />
               the Protestant horse. I do not know whe- 
               <br />
               ther it was the proverbial white horse or

               not, but it was evidently the Protestant 
               <br />
               horse. And in Quebec he was saying to 
               <br />
               the people: Trust Laurier; he is one of

               would do in connection with the remedial 
               <br />
               legislation. So, it was one game in Quebec 
               <br />
               and another game in Ontario, and by this 
               <br />
               means the right hon. gentleman won power. 
               <br />
               We were told in Ontario that it was a ﬁght 
               <br />
               between the hon. gentleman and the clergy 
               <br />
               of Quebec. Yet, hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               now say that we are intolerant and that 
               <br />
               we speak disrespectfully of the clergy. But 
               <br />
               I say there has never been a word of that 
               <br />
               kind on this side of the House. These ex- 
               <br />
               pressions came from the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man’s party in 1896, when they said that 
               <br />
               the priests and bishops of Quebec were go- 
               <br />
               ing to excommunicate the members of the 
               <br />
               Church who did not support Tupper. In 
               <br />
               that way he appealed to the ultra Protest- 
               <br />
               ant electors and thereby had many mem- 
               <br />
               bers of his party elected. Though the cry 
               <br />
               of hon. gentlemen opposite in 1896 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was:</span>

               ciple was party expediency—anything for 
               <br />
               power. And party expediency is the COD-
