               pathetic appeal which the Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance made to persuade himself that he was 
               <br />
               in favour of this Bill, he will ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance looked down at his 
               <br />
               venerable chief, and he pictured the disaster 
               <br />
               that would overtake the country if Sir Wil- 
               <br />
               frid Laurier were to resign. Great Heavens; 
               <br />
               there would not be another immigrant come

               <br />
               would be a laughing stock. Well, if the

               Prime Minister resigned I think the country 
               <br />
               would be fairly resigned also. The Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance pictured what would happen if

               <br />
               of a cent if the Prime Minister resigned. I 
               <br />
               venture to say that not one immigrant less 
               <br />
               would come into this country this year, and 
               <br />
               that the business of the country would go 
               <br />
               on and continue to be quite as prosperous 
               <br />
               as it is. The Prime Minister is being lauded 
               <br />
               as the man of conciliation. I say that in 
               <br />
               the manner in which he has introduced this 
               <br />
               Bill he has done more to cause racial and 
               <br />
               religious strife in this country than all his 
               <br />
               previous life of conciliation could counteract; 
               <br />
               and when his biography is written, instead 
               <br />
               of his epitaph being conciliation, as the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Agriculture suggested, it will be the 
               <br />
               reverse. In this one act, be it as honest, as 
               <br />
               straight, as simple in intention as it is 
               <br />
               claimed to be, yet, from the fact that he 
               <br />
               consulted outsiders and ignored the men 
               <br />
               who ought to have been consulted, he has 
               <br />
               brought about a state of things in Canada 
               <br />
               the effects of which not one man in this 
               <br />
               House will live to see wiped out.
