               <br />
               It seems to me to be an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extraordinarily</span> 
               <br />
               foolish thing to invade provincial rights and

               to create so much ill-feeling if it is only 
               <br />
               for a shadow. Mr. Speaper, it is not yet 
               <br />
               too late for the government to retrace its 
               <br />
               steps. I trust that the Prime Minister and 
               <br />
               his government will withdraw these objec- 
               <br />
               tionable educational clauses and leave this 
               <br />
               matter in the hands of the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest. I can assure the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman that he will make no mistake in 
               <br />
               trusting to the generosity of the people of 
               <br />
               the new provinces. The gentlemen on 
               <br />
               the Treasury benches and their supporters 
               <br />
               have been mistaken in their estimate 
               <br />
               of the character of the people of the 
               <br />
               Territories. I can tell them that the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest are a just and broad- 
               <br />
               minded people ; I can tell them that the free 
               <br />
               air of the prairies has inspired the people 
               <br />
               with as great or a greater love for freedom 
               <br />
               than possibly exists down here. The people 
               <br />
               of the Territories will not be driven, and 
               <br />
               will not be coerced. It is foolish to try to 
               <br />
               coerce them ; trust them and they will show 
               <br />

               It is a most extraordinary thing that the 
               <br />
               member for Brandon should have been 
               <br />
               ignorant of the proposed action of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in regard to the educational clauses 
               <br />
               of the Bill. No man has occupied a more 
               <br />
               prominent position than he on the question 
               <br />
               of separate schools. It is incredible that 
               <br />
               he did not have this matter under his close 
               <br />
               attention and consideration or that he did 
               <br />
               not take steps to keep the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               well informed as to his views. However, 
               <br />
               he appears not only to have been kept in 
               <br />
               ignorance of the whole thing, but to have 
               <br />
               kept himself in blissful ignorance too. The 
               <br />
               reference of the member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster) to the bolting of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment supporters on this question and his 
               <br />
               comparison of it to the bolting of a ﬂock 
               <br />
               of sheep reminds me of the experience of an 
               <br />
               old friend of mine who was taking his 
               <br />
               ﬂock to a new ground where the pasturage 
               <br />
               was exceptionally good. The shepherd 
               <br />
               found he had to take his sheep through a 
               <br />
               narrow and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> passage right in the 
               <br />
               centre of which was a large boulder. The 
               <br />
               sheep took alarm at the boulder and began 
               <br />
               to bolt in every direction. The shepherd 
               <br />
               had however a very sagacious old bell-wether 
               <br />
               in his ﬂock and a brilliant idea struck him. 
               <br />
               He gave the bell-whether a kick behind and 
               <br />
               sent him off with the rest. When the sheep 
               <br />
               got well away he rolled the stone over so 
               <br />
               that it did not look the same as before. The 
               <br />
               plan answered to perfection, he soon got 
               <br />
               the ﬂock together again and they safely

               The Minister of the Interior is responsible 
               <br />
               for the immigration pamphlets which are 
               <br />
               issued by his department. I have here one 
               <br />
               of those pamphlets, and I am told there 
               <br />
               are others, in which the system of educa- 
               <br />
               tion which exists in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories is set forth as entirely different from 
               <br />
               what he stated it to be. Further than that, 
               <br />
               I believe he has induced to come into this

               country a very large number of settlers 
               <br />
               from the United States, in the belief that 
               <br />
               they were coming into a country where a 
               <br />
               public school system existed. These are the 
               <br />
               words of one of these pamplets : ' The 
               <br />
               schools are non-sectarian and are national 
               <br />
               in character.’ How about the rights of 
               <br />
               those people whom the Minister of the In- 
               <br />

               Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that I'have al— 
               <br />
               ready occupied the time of the House at far 
               <br />
               too great a length. I appeal to this House 
               <br />
               to endorse the amendment which has been 
               <br />
               moved by the leader-of the opposition, and 
               <br />
               to subscribe to the principle stated therein, 
               <br />
               which is the very principle upon which con- 
               <br />
               federation was accomplished. That reso- 
               <br />
               lution sets forth that ‘subject to and in 
               <br />
               accordance with the provisions of the British 
               <br />
               North America Acts, 1867 to 1886, the legis- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ilatures</span> of the new provinces are entitled 
               <br />
               to and should enjoy full powers of provin- 
               <br />
               cial self-government, including the power 
               <br />
               to exclusively make laws in relation to edu- 
               <br />
               cation.’ If this principle is not embodied 
               <br />
               in the legislation now before the House, 
               <br />
               and if the rights of the new provinces are 
               <br />
               restricted and limited, then I wish to say, 
               <br />
               so far as I am concerned, and I believe so 
               <br />
               far as the Northwest is concerned, that the 
               <br />
               question is not settled ﬁnally. We shall 
               <br />
               take such further action, constitutional ac— 
               <br />
               tion, as we see ﬁt ; and I am mistaken in the 
               <br />
               spirit of the men of the Northwest if they 
               <br />
               do not ﬁnally secure their full rights in this 
               <br />
               matter. The Prime Minister in his speech 
               <br />
               has appealed to precedent in regard to edu- 
               <br />
               cation a-nd in regard to public lands. In 
               <br />
               each case the precedent which he has select- 
               <br />
               ed has been the exception to the general rule. 
               <br />
               He proposes to use these precedents to cur- 
               <br />
               tail the rights of the people of the new prov- 
               <br />
               inces. In British history, Mr. Speaker, it 
               <br />
