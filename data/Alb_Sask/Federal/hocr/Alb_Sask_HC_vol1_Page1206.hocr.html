               a matter of buying and selling Ilands, but of

               the resolution was based altogether, in the

               <br />
               recognized by the terms of the proposed 
               <br />
               statute, would continually come back upon 
               <br />
               the government with the plea that the lands 
               <br />
               had much improved in value, and

               not simply eliminate all reference to the

               question to be considered, as the amend-

               <br />
               allude to a remark made by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Qu’Appelle (Mr. Lake) as to the value 
               <br />
               which has been received for lands sold by the 
               <br />
               land companies. On that value he proposed to 
               <br />
               base a comparison with the value of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other'</span> 
               <br />
               lands in the Territories. I point out that 
               <br />
               the lands sold at that value were lands 
               <br />
               specially selected by the railway company, 
               <br />
               lands that, in many cases had been specially 
               <br />
               advantaged by the construction of the rail- 
               <br />
               way. The value of these lands. of course, 
               <br />
               is no fair basis of comparison in estimating 
               <br />
               the value of the lands remaining. The fact 
               <br />
               that these lands have been selected and 
               <br />
               taken out of the possibility of revenue for 
               <br />
               either this government or the provincial 
               <br />
               government absolutely reduces the value of

               the remaining part of the lands.

               lands it is only the best lands that have 
               <br />
               been sold, in most cases. A high valuation 
               <br />
               is placed on the school lands, and if they do 
               <br />
               not bring that price they are not sold at all. 
               <br />
               In the last sale of school lands in Assiniboia, 
               <br />
               the lowest price was $7, and anything that 
               <br />
               purchasers did not think worth that was not 
               <br />
               sold, but still remains the property of the 
               <br />
               government. The same thing applies, to a 
               <br />
               large extent, to the Hudson Bay Company’s 
               <br />
               lands. The company put a high price per 
               <br />
               acre and hold these lands until the particular 
               <br />
               part of the country in which they are be— 
               <br />
               comes well settled, and so they get a high 
               <br />
               price. This policy is carried out even when 
               <br />
               it is necessary to hold the lands for many 
               <br />
               years. And, in case of the school <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lands,</span> the 
               <br />
               government still hold the lands which Will 
               <br />
               not bring a good price.
