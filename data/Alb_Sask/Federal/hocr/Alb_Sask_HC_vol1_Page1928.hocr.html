               Mr. MONK. There is an item of nearly $2,000 
               <br />
               here for the translation of statistics into 
               <br />
               French. I do not deny that that may be neces- 
               <br />
               sary, but it seems to me that in future some 
               <br />
               scheme might be devised by which that ex- 
               <br />
               pense should be avoided. The statistics are 
               <br />
               perfectly well understood in English, just as 
               <br />
               well as in French by the members in the prov- 
               <br />
               ince of Quebec, amd it seems to me that some- 
               <br />
               thing might be done—say if it were placed in 
               <br />
               the hands of a. committee of French members 
               <br />
               to prevent this expenditure. Most of the ex- 
               <br />
               pressions used in our province with reference 
               <br />
               to the statistics are English expressions, and 
               <br />
               this would consequently appear to be an abso-

               lute waste of money.

               <br />
               Cartier whether, when he decided to intro- 
               <br />
               duce the motion which is now before the 
               <br />
               House, he had in mind the one he moved in 
               <br />
               1896 '? He contends that the amount was 
               <br />
               excessive, but if that 'as truly the motive 
               <br />
               which urged the hon. gentleman to act on 
               <br />
               that occasion, I may be allowed to inquire 
               <br />
               whether he might not have attained his 
               <br />
               object otherwise than by asking as he did 
               <br />
               that the French translation be done away 
               <br />
               with. That is direct evidence that the mo- 
               <br />
               tion introduced by the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> is not 
               <br />
               the outcome of a desire to promote the 
               <br />
               French language, but has an entirely dif- 
               <br />
               t‘erent object. “'e all know in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec that the hon. member for Jacques 
               <br />
               Cartier is a most distinguished jurist, an 
               <br />
               eminent lawyer, a highly considered pro-_ 
               <br />
               fessor of Laval University; and it is that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman who now brings in a pro- 
               <br />
               posal which, as he himself stated a moment 
               <br />
               ago, is absolutely without any meaning. 
               <br />
               In fact, what does the hon. member ask for? 
               <br />
               He is quite willing that provision be made 
               <br />
               for the ofﬁcial use of both English and 
               <br />
               French, in the new Western provinces; 
               <br />
               but he wishes. at the same time, that this

               right be a matter left to the tree will of the 
               <br />
               legislatures of the new provinces, whose. 
               <br />
               members will be at liberty to do away with 
               <br />
               it whenever they think ﬁt. If the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman had been in earnest, he would have 
               <br />
               struck out the latter part ot his motion, in 
               <br />
               the way suggested a moment ago by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Labelle. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, Mr. Chairman, why did the hon. 
               <br />
               member add that second part to his motion? 
               <br />
               For a very simple reason. I do not wish 
               <br />
               to be unfair or to unduly impute motives, 
               <br />
               but at the same time we should endeavour 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd out the true motive of his action. 
               <br />
               Why has the hon. member added to his 
               <br />
               motion the last clause whereby he asks 
               <br />
               that this right he dependent‘on the consent 
               <br />
               of the legislature ? It is in order that, in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec, the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               and his friends may be in a position to say: 
               <br />
               we have asked that in the Territories, pro— 
               <br />
               vision be made for the use of the French 
               <br />
               language. And these gentlemen will also 
               <br />
               be free to add: the Liberal members from 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec have voted against 
               <br />
               that motion. On the other hand. the latter 
               <br />
               part of the motion meets the requirements 
               <br />
               of the province of Ontario. Then these 
               <br />
               gentlemen may state to their friends in 
               <br />

               but it had no meaning since its carrying out

               was left entirely in the hands ot the legis- 
               <br />
