               It turned out subsequently that Sir John

               <br />
               will see that it was their policy to do justice

               <br />
               that was uttered by Sir John Macdonald at 
               <br />

               <br />
               hurriedly pass over it. That Bill was intro-

               in. Sir John Macdonald was in the House

               <br />
               had taken place in regard to the different 
               <br />
               Bills of Rights, did What ? Did he get up 
               <br />
               in 1875 and oppose the granting of these 
               <br />
               rights to the minorities in that country? 
               <br />
               No, Sir. He knew what had taken place 
               <br />
               earlier and he conceded to the minority 
               <br />

               1 do not ﬁnd so much objection on t e 
               <br />
               part of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestant</span> Conservatives as I 
               <br />
               do on the part of the Protestant Liberals 
               <br />
               because the Protestant Liberals have been 
               <br />
               educated in this matter for some years. 
               <br />
               The Protestant Liberals, in 1896, were 
               <br />
               educated to oppose the rights of the minority 
               <br />
               in that country. That is the reason that 
               <br />
               when I go through my constituency I hear 
               <br />
               a great deal more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objection</span> on the part <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               Protestant Liberals than I do on the, part 
               <br />
               of Protestant Conservatives. But, now, 1 
               <br />
               say we did not hear very much of this mat— 
               <br />
               ter until this unfortunate agitation occurred 
               <br />
               in the province of Manitoba. And I say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite. that if there is 
               <br />
               trouble <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> in the Dominion ot Canada 
               <br />
               it is not owing to anything the Conservative 
               <br />
               party have done in the past, but it is 
               <br />
