               ceeded stage by stage upon this ground: 
               <br />
               What was our public school? It was a 
               <br />
               national school. What was the provision for

               national school or a public school, 
               <br />
               practically no difference‘ whatever, ex-

               cept the half hour’s religious instruc-

               public school or a national school; and he 
               <br />
               explained that whatever was intended by 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875 in the way of a confessional 
               <br />
               school or a church school, that had all been 
               <br />
               done away with by the ordinances, and we 
               <br />
               have no such thing as an ecclesiastical or 
               <br />
               separate school, it “was practically a public

               school, and that public school we regard as 
               <br />
               a national school. That was, as I understand

               it, the argument which he presented to this

               House. _ And yet we are told by the Minister

               of Justice that the ordinances do not take 
               <br />

               Mr. FIELDING. My argument was that

               a church school and a separate school are 
               <br />

               <br />
               gentleman make that statement before in the 
               <br />
               House, that a national school may be a sep- 
               <br />
               arate school. Let us call a spade a spade. 
               <br />
               A. separate school defeats the very object of 
               <br />
               a national school. The moment you segre- 
               <br />
               gate a particular creed and educate them 
               <br />
               apart from the others in the community, that 
               <br />
               moment you defeat the object of a national 
               <br />
               school. 'Is it not well known? All the 
               <br />
               writers upon the subject of education call 
               <br />
               a national school a school where all classes 
               <br />
               in the community <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(mingle</span> together and re- 
               <br />
               ceive their education together. The moment 
               <br />
               you segregate one class or one creed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> the 
               <br />
               community from the rest, you defeat the 
               <br />
               very object of a national school. What is 
               <br />
               the use of blinking the fact ? Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lic writers upon the subject admit the 
               <br />
               principle that you defeat the object of a 
               <br />
               national system of education when you have 
               <br />
               a separate school in the community. But 
               <br />
               they argue on a different ground altogether, 
               <br />
               on the ground of morals, a higher conception 
               <br />
               of the Deity; but they never argue on the

               possible in a community to have a national

               system of education and at the same time 
               <br />
               have separate schools.

               Mr. FIELDING. I cannot discuss with 
               <br />
               my hon. friend what Roman Catholic writers 
               <br />
               say about separate schools. We are dealing 
               <br />
               with so-called separate schools in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories of Canada. Let us consider 
               <br />
               what those schools are, not what they may 
               <br />
               be elsewhere, not what Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               writers elsewhere may say, but What these 
               <br />

               Mr. FIELDING. They may be under the 
               <br />
               law just what they are now. I have said, 
               <br />
               and I repeat, that the separate schools in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, though they are called 
               <br />
               separate schools, contain every essential ele- 
               <br />
               ment of a national school system. If I 
               <br />
               may deﬁne what I regard as the esssential 
               <br />
               elements of a national school system, I under- 
               <br />
               stand that if a system is created under a 
               <br />
               statute of the legislature, if it is administered 
               <br />
               by the public authorities, if it is brought 
               <br />
               under the same system of inspection as the 
               <br />
               other public schools, if the course of study 
               <br />
               is the same, if the teachers have to submit 
               <br />
               to the same examination, if the whole 
               <br />
               machinery is conducted in the same way as 
               <br />
               in the other schools, even though they may 
               <br />
               be separate schools to the point of having 
               <br />
               half an hour’s religious instruction, they are 
               <br />
               in all respects the same, and are essentially 
               <br />
               national schools.
