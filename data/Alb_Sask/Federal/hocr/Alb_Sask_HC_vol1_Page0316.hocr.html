               It is contended that the word province

               <br />
               by the word ‘province.’ Subsection 13 of 
               <br />

               land, as regards the word legislature. It 
               <br />
               is as follows: Any authority other than 
               <br />
               the imperial government empowered to pass 
               <br />
               laws within the British possessions. So

               that, according to the imperial interpreta-

               tion Act itself, the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               were governed by a legislature and the

               laws passed by that body are the laws of 
               <br />

               Prime Minister, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'alled</span> him a tyrant and 
               <br />
               what not. It is not many years since I 
               <br />
               entered this House. but I have in the mean- 
               <br />

               the other side as regards provincial rights. 
               <br />
               In 1902. in the course of a debate. the hon. 
               <br />
               member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">South</span> York spoke as follows:

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I say that the interpretation of the law that 
               <br />
               has been given by the English Privy Council 
               <br />
               in regard to the distribution of rights as be- 
               <br />
               tween the provinces, and the federal power. 
               <br />
               has been against the interest of the country 
               <br />
               as; a whole. That I regret. I agree with the 
               <br />
               honourable member for Lanark (Hon. Mr. Hag- 
               <br />
               gart) that some day we will have the whole 
               <br />
               jurisdiction in this parliament and in some way 
               <br />
               we will work it out, and in some way we will 
               <br />
               increase the federal power and Wipe out gradu- 
               <br />
               ally the provincial power. I take issue directly 
               <br />
               with the honourable gentlemen who oppose 
               <br />
               that view, I say that provincial government 
               <br />
               and the enlargement of provincial rights has 
               <br />
               not been in the interest of this country, and I 
               <br />
               say that Sir John A. Macdonald was right, 
               <br />
               and was a most far-seeing statesman if he be-
