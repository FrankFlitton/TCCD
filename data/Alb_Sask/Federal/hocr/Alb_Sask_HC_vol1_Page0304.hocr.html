               <br />
               tion 16 and the result would be that section 
               <br />
               93 of the British North America Act would

               deal with the question of schools would be 
               <br />
               absolute. It is so in the provinces of British 
               <br />
               Columbia and Prince Edward Island. In 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutions</span> of these provinces there 
               <br />
               is not a word about education or separate 
               <br />
               schools, and therefore, according to the ar- 
               <br />
               gument of these hon. gentlemen, the logical 
               <br />
               conclusion would be that these provinces 
               <br />
               could not deal with education at all. That 
               <br />
               is where their argument would land them. 
               <br />
               Now, what does it all mean? It means 
               <br />
               simply this—and everybody of common 
               <br />
               sense can see it—that if the Dominion par- 
               <br />
               liament, in constituting a province, does 
               <br />
               not deal with the question of education, 
               <br />
               then the question can be dealt with by the 
               <br />
               province. Nobody can get away from that 
               <br />
               conclusion with the intelligent electorate 
               <br />
               of any province of this Dominion. 
               <br />
               They will say: Why did you not, as &amp; 
               <br />
               government of the Dominion, leave that 
               <br />
               matter in the hands of these new 
               <br />
               provinces as you did all other local ques- 
               <br />
               tions, giving them provincial autonomy in 
               <br />
               every respect? Is the case for separate 
               <br />
               schools in those provincse good or not? If 
               <br />
               I were going Ito-morrow to live in the prov- 
               <br />
               ince of Alberta, and made up my mind that 
               <br />
               I wanted separate schools there, I would 
               <br />
               condemn the leader of this government for 
               <br />
               the manner in which he brought this ques- 
               <br />
               tion into this House and spoiled my chance 
               <br />
               of getting them. If he is honestly in favour 
               <br />
               of separate schools, and is not simply play- 
               <br />
               ing the game of politics, if he is really sin— 
               <br />
               cere in his appeals to keep racial and re- 
               <br />
               ligious questions out of this House, Why 
               <br />
               does he bring them in? If this Bill were 
               <br />
               passed without section 16, everybody knows 
               <br />
               that the provinces would have the power to 
               <br />
               deal with education, and this question would 
               <br />
               not have been brought into this House. 
               <br />
               Does the premier understand that the new 
               <br />
               provinces are not going to give separate 
               <br />
               schools? Then, if he thinks they are wrong 
               <br />
               on that question he should not give them 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">autonomyp</span> But it he thinks the provinces 
               <br />
               have a right to decide the question, then he 
               <br />
               should leave clause 16 out of the Bill, be- 
               <br />
               cause they have the power-without men- 
               <br />
               tioning it in the Bill. Does he think, on the 
               <br />
               merits of the question, having in view the 
               <br />
               future welfare of those provinces, that the 
               <br />
               majority will not be in favour of separate 
               <br />
               schools? If he thinks they have no right 
               <br />
               to that opinion, then, as an honest man, he 
               <br />
               should say, I will not give them autonomy 
               <br />
               for ten years yet, because I do not think 
               <br />
               they are sufﬁciently educated to deal with 
               <br />
               the subject of education. But that is not his 
               <br />
               position. He knows that the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest are entitled to autonomy, and he 
               <br />
               practically says, I am afraid that in ex- 
               <br />
               ercising their right they will or may not

               common sense to this question as would a

               in his heart of hearts that the premier really

               or three years ‘I could not say whe-

               be asked to vote upon this question; for that

               same reason the supporters of hon. gentle-

               men opposite ought not to be asked to vote 
               <br />
               upon this question; for that same reason 
               <br />
               the premier ought not to have brought this

               our of separate schools or not, ought to vote 
               <br />
               against the Bill. It is a matter entirely of 
               <br />
               local concern which you are only in a posi- 
               <br />
               tion to decide after you have lived out 
               <br />
               there and understand all the conditions. You 
               <br />
               do not wan-t to take newspaper reports, let— 
               <br />
               ters from friends, sketches or literature of 
               <br />
               any kind; you have actually to live in a

               community before you know how to deal

               <br />
               berta two or three years, I would be a 
               <br />
               strong advocate of separate schools there, 
               <br />
               or it may be that I would think separate

               schools were not good things for that prov—

               The hon. Postmaster General, in the 
               <br />
               course of his remarks, said that if you trace 
               <br />
               the history of the constitutions of other 
               <br />
               provinces and the various changes in them, 
               <br />
               you will ﬁnd that no two of them are exact- 
               <br />
               ly alike, and he instanced the divorce courts 
               <br />
               which he seemed to think were a wonder- 
               <br />
               ful instance of that fact. But he gave the 
               <br />
               Whole thing away by saying that it was be- 
               <br />
               cause the provinces with divorce courts had 
               <br />
               established them before those provinces 
               <br />
               came into the union. Although the British 
               <br />
               North America Act assigned divorce to the 
               <br />
               Dominion, yet it provided that those prov- 
               <br />
               inces should continue to have them. That 
               <br />
               is the constitution, and therefore there is 
               <br />
               no straining of the constitution in that pro- 
               <br />
               vision. Yet here is the Postmaster General, 
               <br />
               a self—styled statesman, objecting to this be- 
               <br />
               ing done on legal grounds. If I did not 
               <br />
               know otherwise. I might suppose that the 
               <br />
               Postmaster General had never been near a 
               <br />
               law ofﬁce or had never seen a statute. I 
               <br />
               am told that he is a lawyer, though he does 
               <br />
               not want to be called a lawyer, and I under- 
               <br />
               stand why. Because lawyers are men of
