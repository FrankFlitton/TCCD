               and I was told they were not here. Im- 
               <br />
               mediately I wrote to our agent in London 
               <br />
               to get these opinions it they were deliber— 
               <br />
               ately expressed opinions. I have not yet 
               <br />
               heard from him in answer to my inquiry 
               <br />
               as to whether or not the opinions are on 
               <br />
               record in the Home Ofﬁce.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. Of course, it would

               be important to know whether they are deal-

               which ‘are very briefly reported in the de-

               bates of the House of Lords, was that the

               opinion expressed by the law ofﬁcers of the 
               <br />
               Crown was in respect to the doubts which 
               <br />
               were expressed here and which doubts, I 
               <br />
               think, were limited, as far as I can gather, 
               <br />
               to the question of representation. I do not 
               <br />
               think they went beyond that; at least I 
               <br />
               would not gather that from what Lord 
               <br />
               Kimberley said. My argument, however,
