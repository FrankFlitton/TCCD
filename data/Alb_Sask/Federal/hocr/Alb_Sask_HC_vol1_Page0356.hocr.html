               The Prime Minister has appealed to the 
               <br />
               precedent of Manitoba as a reason for with-

               <br />

               <br />
               precedent in 1898 when he had a Bill passed 
               <br />
               through parliament giving to the province

               <br />
               more satisfactorily than it could possibly

               is any similarity whatever between the 
               <br />
               conditions which prevailed in Manitoba in 
               <br />
               the year 1870, when Manitoba became a 
               <br />
               province of this Dominion, and the condi~ 
               <br />
               tions of the Territories in this year 1905. If 
               <br />
               there is no similarity whatever in condi- 
               <br />
               tions, there can be no precedent. At that 
               <br />
               time Manitoba was under the paternal gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the Hudson Bay Company. In 
               <br />
               the debates of 1870, you will ﬁnd the opin- 
               <br />
               ion expresscd that the people of Manitoba 
               <br />
               were scarcely lit for a provincial form of 
               <br />
               government. A doubt was expressed as 
               <br />
               to tho <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘ﬁtness</span> of a people just emerging 
               <br />
               from the conditions of serfdoni’—that was 
               <br />
               one of the phrases used. They were also 
               <br />
               referred to as an ignorant people. They 
               <br />
               comprised in all some twelve thousand 
               <br />
               souls, and they were at that very time in 
               <br />
               the throes of rebellion. Is there any sim- 
               <br />
               ilarity whatever in the condition of Manitoba 
               <br />
               at that time and the present condition of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, who have a 
               <br />
               responsible government, a constitution, 
               <br />
               limited certainly as to its powers, but one 
               <br />
               which they have enjoyed for a great many 
               <br />
               years past; who have carried on a liberal 
               <br />
               and progressive government, a government 
               <br />
               which is, I think, second to none in any of 
               <br />
               the other provinces of the Dominion, and
