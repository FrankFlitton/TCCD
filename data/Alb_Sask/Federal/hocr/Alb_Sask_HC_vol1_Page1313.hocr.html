               trusting to my memory, however, I was

               shown a copy of the estimates of the cur-

               <br />
               sum of $100,000 is asked for, or is to be 
               <br />
               asked for when these estimates are voted 
               <br />
               for the year 1905-6, for the construction of 
               <br />
               a fence along the international boundary 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories. But accom— 
               <br />
               panying that statement in the estimates of 
               <br />
               the current year, in the proper column, 
               <br />
               there is also set out a statement that $100,— 
               <br />
               000 was voted last year, which entirely 
               <br />
               misled me, and I rose in my seat to apolo- 
               <br />
               gize to the House yesterday for having 
               <br />
               made a statement which it appeared, by 
               <br />
               the estimates which are before us now, was 
               <br />
               not correct. ‘ I now ﬁnd out on inquiry, and 
               <br />
               am credibly informed that no estimate was 
               <br />
               voted last year at all, and that the estimates 
               <br />
               that are put in our hands this year are not 
               <br />
               correct. Why that $100,000 is inserted as 
               <br />
               having been voted last year I am entirely 
               <br />
               at .a loss to know. I would not like to say, 
               <br />
               but it seems to me there is a history to it. 
               <br />
               The hon. the minister had been attempting 
               <br />
               to let a contract, a contract in advance of 
               <br />
               an estimate, without the sanction of parlia- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment,</span> and in order to cover up the trans- 
               <br />
               action, apparently, the estimates which are 
               <br />
               placed in our hands are so ﬁlled up as to 
               <br />
               give the impression that $100,000 was voted 
               <br />
               last year for this purpose.

               cessary, that my ﬁrst statement was correct, 
               <br />
               that there was no estimate, there was no 
               <br />
               appropriation in the previous year, that no 
               <br />
               appropriation existed for the construction 
               <br />
               of this fence, and that whoever was under- 
               <br />
               taking to let a contract—because there was 
               <br />
               an attempt to let a contract for the con- 
               <br />
               struction of this fence—was certainly pro- 
               <br />
               ceeding too rapidly, not knowing whether 
               <br />
               this House would approve of the matter at 
               <br />
               all. Now whilst I make this apology for 
               <br />
               having as I then believed misled the House, I 
               <br />
               think some member of the government owes 
               <br />
               an apology to me for having misled me. 
               <br />
               I do not know what explanation can be 
               <br />
               given of this error—and I will not call 
               <br />
               it by any other name, I assume it is an 
               <br />
               error, but certainly it was a very misleading 
               <br />
               one. Under all the circumstances it seems 
               <br />
               to me that possibly there might have been 
               <br />
               a purpose in the error, owing to the fact 
               <br />
               that an attempt was made to let a contract 
               <br />
               for the constructiOn of this public work, 
               <br />
               when no parliamentary appropriation had

               —I addressed a letter to the McGregor-Banwell 
               <br />
               Wire Fence Company of Walkerville, Ontario, 
               <br />
               advising them that it had been decided to erect 
               <br />
               a fence at the boundary line in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories, 100 miles of which was to be con- 
               <br />
               structed this year and the balance next year, 
               <br />
               and asking that company to state the price for 
               <br />
               constructing a. fence, known as a woven wire 
               <br />
               fence, to be 200 miles long, running east and 
               <br />
               west from Coutts on the boundary line south 
               <br />
               of Lethbridge; to be made of No. 9 wire, with 
               <br />
               iron posts, either solid or of pipe driven at least 
               <br />
               three feet into the ground, properly guyed and 
               <br />
               otherwise supported, and built in a thoroughly 
               <br />
               substantial way, having gates every ﬁfteen 
               <br />
               miles. The price was to include the stringing 
               <br />
               of a telephone wire along the fence but not 
               <br />
               the putting in of instruments. The department 
               <br />

               Now I have heard this fence frequently

               spoken of as a barbed wire fence. Let me say 
               <br />
               that a woven fence could not possibly be a
