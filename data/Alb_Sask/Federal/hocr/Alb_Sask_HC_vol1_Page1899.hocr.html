               that he is a Britisher to the core, because 
               <br />
               I remember that some years ago when the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister went to England and de- 
               <br />
               clared in a speech that he was a Britisher 
               <br />
               to the core, my hon. friend (Mr. Bergeron) 
               <br />

               <br />

               vince of Quebec, tried to fasten a crime on 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman because he had 
               <br />
               used that expression. I have heard my 
               <br />
               hon. friend himself in his own county 
               <br />
               stating: Sir Wilfrid Laurier is not one of 
               <br />
               us, see what he said in England; British 
               <br />

               Mr. BERGERON. It is very easy for 
               <br />
               the Solicitor General to make a man of 
               <br />
               straw for the purpose of knocking him 
               <br />
               down. He has attributed words to me that 
               <br />
               I did not use. I did not say I was British 
               <br />
               to the core; I said I was a British subject. 
               <br />
               I live under the British ﬂag and you can- 
               <br />
               not class me as anything else than British. 
               <br />
               If you call me a Canadian then it is all 
               <br />
               right. That is the title I am most proud 
               <br />
               of, but if in the columns of nationality 
               <br />
               you class me as French, then it must mean 
               <br />
               that I am old country French, and that 
               <br />
               is not a correct description.
