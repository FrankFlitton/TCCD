               <br />
               that occasion in Toronto. In the speech, as 
               <br />
               it is reported, he was not meeting with a 
               <br />
               very responsive welcome, and during the 
               <br />
               course of his address certain things that he 
               <br />
               mentioned were hissed by the audience, and 
               <br />
               he saw that he had to go the Protestant

               horse. And what did he do ? He made ex- 
               <br />
               actly that kind of an appeal knowing of 
               <br />
               course it might touch the palate of the

               <br />

               <br />
               gentleman then as usual had two strings 
               <br />
               to his bow. His language then was very 
               <br />
               diiferent from that in his address at a great 
               <br />
               meeting in the province of Quebec when 
               <br />
               he said that he thanked God there was not 
               <br />
               an Orangeman in the Liberal party. And 
               <br />
               how they cheered him to the echo when he 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">volunteered</span> that statement voluntarily to 
               <br />
               them ! The right hon. gentleman has never 
               <br />
               denied that statement since. I have heard 
               <br />
               it charged in this House, I have seen gentle- 
               <br />
               men with stacks of declarations of gentle-

               men who were present and what was the re- 
               <br />
               sult, there was no speciﬁc denial that he 
               <br />
               had made those statements. The fact is he 
               <br />
               has been pirouetting on both toes and ‘he 
               <br />

               As far as this meeting between these 
               <br />
               gentlemen from Manitoba and the Papal 
               <br />
               ablegate is concerned, I have only this to 
               <br />
               say that I believe the Papal ablegate was 
               <br />
               quite within his commission and his duties 
               <br />
               in inviting these gentlemen to meet him. 
               <br />
               He had a perfect right to do that. The 
               <br />
               Papal delegate came to this country at the 
               <br />
               request of the right hon. gentleman and 
               <br />
               his political friends and he has been in 
               <br />
               close touch with the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               all through these proceedings and has had 
               <br />
               frequent consultations with the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman in reference to the terms to be 
               <br />
               contained in these Bills. These statements 
               <br />
               have all gone forth speciﬁcally, that the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman had these meetings 
               <br />
               and the right hon. gentleman has had ample 
               <br />
               opportunity to deny it but has not done so. 
               <br />
               It is with the night hon. gentleman that 
               <br />
               the quarrel of the people of this country 
               <br />
               rests and not with the Papal ablegate at 
               <br />
               all. The Papal ablegate has a perfect 
               <br />
               right to be in this country just as any other 
               <br />
               gentleman might have asa plenipotentiary or 
               <br />
               ambassador to any power, but I do say that 
               <br />
               the people of this country will hold the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman and the members of 
               <br />
               his government responsible for what has 
               <br />
               gone on. Talk about the right hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               man leading a responsible and united party 
               <br />
               which is behind him on this question. Why 
               <br />
               it is openly seen by the attitude of the On- 
               <br />
               tario members not only of the cabinet, but 
               <br />
               of the House that they are all in a condi- 
               <br />
               tion of doubt and fear on this question. 
               <br />
               The hon. Postmaster General will not dare
