               foregoing draft Bill, I have also to direct your

               attention to, and to press for the removal by 
               <br />
               ancillary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> of the exemption from 
               <br />
               taxation granted to the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way Company under clause 16 of the schedule 
               <br />
               to chapter 1 of the Dominion statutes of 1881. 
               <br />
               The exemption as is well known is two—fold. 
               <br />
               First that in the words : ‘ The Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway, and all stations and station grounds, 
               <br />

               <br />
               rolling stock and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appurtenances</span> required and 
               <br />
               used for the construction and working thereof, 
               <br />
               and the capital stock of the company, shall be 
               <br />
               for ever free from taxation by the Dominion, or 
               <br />
               by any province to be hereafter established, or 
               <br />
               by any municipal corporation therein,’ and, 
               <br />
               second, in that part of the clause which reads 
               <br />
               ‘ and the lands of the company in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories, until they are either sold or 
               <br />
               occupied, shall also be free from such taxation 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.‘for</span> twenty years after the grant thereot from 
               <br />
               the Crown.’ The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of these exemptions is 
               <br />
               to prohibit any province which may be estab- 
               <br />
               lished—or any municipal corporation therein— 
               <br />
               from requiring the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               Company to assist in the administration of the 
               <br />
               country or the maintenance of ‘ peace, order and 
               <br />

               respect to another part for a limited period of

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">areas</span> reserved for that purpose. This particu- 
               <br />
               lar grant is that made on account of the con- 
               <br />
               struction of the central section of the railway, 
               <br />
               namely, that from Selkirk to Kamloops, which 
               <br />
               has been deﬁnitely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ascertained</span> to be a distance 
               <br />
               of 1,250 miles. This distance is divisable as fol- 
               <br />
               lows: Manitoba, 220 miles; Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">760</span> miles ; British, Columbia, 270 miles. 
               <br />
               It is therefore apparent that a proportionate 
               <br />
               area, based upon the mileage <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span> the pro-

               prairie portion of the central section (220 miles 
               <br />
               at 12,500 acres per mile, being 2,750,000 acres) 
               <br />
               has not been taken from Manitoba lands, and 
               <br />
               that in addition to this shortage of 26,000 acres 
               <br />
               the whole of the grant earned by con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               mountain rate of 16,666'66 acres per mile)

               as regards the construction of the railway 
               <br />
               through the Territoiries, it is not thought that 
               <br />
               the Territories can in equity be required to bear 
               <br />
