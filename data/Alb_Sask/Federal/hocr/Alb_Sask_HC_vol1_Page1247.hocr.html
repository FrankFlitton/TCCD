               <br />
               One reason why we did not go to Edmon- 
               <br />
               ton can be found in the remarks addressed 
               <br />
               to this House a few years ago by the pre- 
               <br />
               sent Minister of the Interior himself. It 
               <br />
               has been said that we did not contest Ed— 
               <br />
               monton because there was a certain number 
               <br />
               of Catholic voters in that constituency. 
               <br />
               That is not the case. One of the reasons 
               <br />
               why we did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go,</span> is the reason assigned 
               <br />
               by the present Minister of the Interior, that 
               <br />
               his constituency is largely populated by a 
               <br />
               class of people who are not acquainted with 
               <br />
               British institutions, who do not understand 
               <br />
               our laws, and who would not understand 
               <br />
               the schools question or the land question. 
               <br />
               Now, What did that hon. gentleman state in

               There the member for West <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assiniboia“</span> 
               <br />
               has one reason why the Conservative oppo- 
               <br />
               sition did not see ﬁt to challenge an ex- 
               <br />
               pression of opinion from these people, who 
               <br />
               are depicted by the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               as illiterate, ignorant of British institutions 
               <br />
               and of our laws and politics. Now, there 
               <br />
               has been something, I think, kept back by 
               <br />
               this government, some reason why they did 
               <br />
               not wish to hand over these lands to the 
               <br />
               provinces, something beneath the surface. 
               <br />
               I think it has been touched upon by some 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen in some of their speeches. 
               <br />
               and I think I pointed it out myself when 
               <br />
               speaking on the second reading. But any 
               <br />
               person who lives in the west knows whereof 
               <br />
               I speak when I say that one reason why the 
               <br />
               government are retaining those lands in 
               <br />
               their possession is that they desire to have 
               <br />
               the wonderful leverage which they will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> 
               <br />
               at election time by holding all these lands 
               <br />
               in their own hands. Every homestead inspec— 
               <br />
               tor, you might say, is an active political par- 
               <br />
               tisan, an election agent during the course ot 
               <br />
               a campaign. Yes from one end of the year to 
               <br />
               the other. I do not have, to go outside my 
               <br />
               own constituency to find examples of what. 
               <br />
               occurred during the last campaign. Une 
               <br />
               homestead inspector in my riding openly 
               <br />
               appeared at the polls in that contest, stood 
               <br />
               there in company with a mounted police- 
               <br />
               man with his side arms on, and in company 
               <br />
               with an interpreter from the Yorkton land 
               <br />
               ofﬁce—the three of them—and the electors 
               <br />
               had to run the gauntlet of the three of them 
               <br />
               before coming in, each one bringing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preg-</span> 
               <br />
               sure to bear upon them, threatening them 
               <br />
               with retaining their homestead patents if 
               <br />
               they voted for your humble servant.

               These people were simply intimidated.
