               <br />
               made a statement to the very opposite effect. 
               <br />
               We come down to this point now, that our 
               <br />
               friends opposite are unable to'support their 
               <br />
               contention that an outrage has been per- 
               <br />
               petrated by any other argument than that 
               <br />
               members on this side of the House are prac- 
               <br />
               tically wholly responsible for these plans 
               <br />
               of distribution. I made the statement that 
               <br />
               the leader of the government suggested to 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain——who is certainly not a Lib- 
               <br />
               eral and who is certainly not prejudiced 
               <br />
               against the gentlemen opposite—I made the 
               <br />
               statement that Mr. Haultain was asked by 
               <br />
               the leader of the government to take the 
               <br />
               responsibility of getting an agreement, and 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain called that meeting to get such 
               <br />
               agreement. My hon. friend from Qu’Ap- 
               <br />
               pelle says he never heard anything about 
               <br />
               any suggestion for an agreement with re- 
               <br />
               gard to the constituencies. Who is responsi- 
               <br />
               ble for that ? The leader of the government 
               <br />
               is not responsible; we are not responsible; 
               <br />
               I fancy that responsibility will have to fall 
               <br />
               upon his friend Mr. Haultain, who certainly 
               <br />
               received the suggestion from the leader of 
               <br />
               the government and called a meeting for 
               <br />
               that purpose. If my hon. friends from Al- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               berta and Calgary never heard of the sug— 
               <br />
               gestion, as I understand they contend, it 
               <br />
               must be their friend Mr. Haultain who neg- 
               <br />
               lected to follow the suggestion that was 
               <br />
               made him by the leader of the government.
