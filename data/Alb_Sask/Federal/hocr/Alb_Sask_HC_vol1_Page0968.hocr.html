               but what I contend for and what I hold is 
               <br />
               that We should leave that question to them, 
               <br />
               and that we should not start out by em- 
               <br />
               phasizing by Dominion legislation the im— 
               <br />
               portance of dividing the children up into 
               <br />
               different camps and cliques. It may be 
               <br />
               necessary to do that; it may be in the in- 
               <br />
               terest ofthe people of the Northwest that 
               <br />
               there should be religious education, but what 
               <br />
               I say is that We should not emphasize the 
               <br />
               fact at this time taking everything into con- 
               <br />
               sideration by our legislation. The new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces should be permitted to deal with this 
               <br />
               question in the way which may seem best 
               <br />
               suited to their conditions as time goes on. 
               <br />
               What are their conditions? In these North- 
               <br />
               west Territories we have colonies of Swedes, 
               <br />
               Finns, Bohemians, Hungarians, Jews, Aus- 
               <br />
               trians, Germans, Russians, Icelanders, Men- 
               <br />
               nonites, Galicians and Doukhobors. The 
               <br />
               question is how to assimilate these races 
               <br />
               and how to secure their co—operation in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vouild-</span> 
               <br />
               ing up the nation. It requires every effort 
               <br />
               we can possibly think of to establish this 
               <br />
               union, and I think, Mr. Speaker, in no way 
               <br />
               can this great task he better accomplished 
               <br />
               than by national public schools. This, Sir, 
               <br />
               is a provincial question. It is a provincial 
               <br />
               question in the province of Quebec notwîth- 
               <br />
               standing the British North America Act. If 
               <br />
               there were not a word in the British North 
               <br />
               America Act in reference to the situation 
               <br />
               in Ontario and Quebec, the school system 
               <br />
               would be precisely the same as it is at the 
               <br />
               present time, because it is by provincial leg- 
               <br />
               islation that these matters are regulated and 
               <br />
               the people of Quebec, Ontario and all the 
               <br />
               other provinces know better how to regulate 
               <br />
               these matters to suit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> conditions than 
               <br />
               we do in this parliament. One condition is 
               <br />
               necessary in the province of Quebec where 
               <br />
               certain conditions prevail, another system 
               <br />
               in Ontario, another system in Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               and New Brunswick, and perhaps another 
               <br />
               system in Manitoba or in our great North- 
               <br />
               west which is growing and into which so 
               <br />
               many different nationalities are going. I 
               <br />
               say it is essentially a provincial question. 
               <br />
               It is a provincial question in Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec, notwithstanding the fact that ref— 
               <br />
               erence is made to it in the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. I believe that upon the seven 
               <br />
               members from the Northwest must rest the 
               <br />
               responsibility for this legislation, because 
               <br />
               if these gentlemen had insisted upon the 
               <br />
               question being left to the provinces, there 
               <br />
               is no doubt but what they would have won 
               <br />
               the day. I am sorry for the course which 
               <br />
               events have taken. I believe that if the 
               <br />
               question had been left to the provinces the 
               <br />
               government would have been less embar- 
               <br />
               rassed than they are at the present time by 
               <br />
               reason of the course which they have taken. 
               <br />
               I and other hon. members have said that it 
               <br />

               ment saw ﬁt at this time to bring down a 
               <br />
               Bill to create these provinces, and, as an 
               <br />
               adjunct to that Bill and an incident in the 
               <br />
               creation of these provinces, the school ques- 
               <br />
               tion had to come up and be discussed; and 
               <br />
               I presume that it will be discussed as calm- 
               <br />
               ly and as intelligently as possible, and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">de</span> 
               <br />
               cision arrived at, and that decision will 
               <br />
               settle the matter for all time to come. The 
               <br />
               question is, what shall that decision be, 
               <br />
               what settlement shall we make of the ques- 
               <br />
               tion now before us ? We are creating pro- 
               <br />
               vinces in the Northwest, large provinces, 
               <br />
               which will in the near future, I believe, con- 
               <br />
               tain a population larger than the present 
               <br />
               population of Canada ; and we desire to set 
               <br />
               those provinces on their way in a happy 
               <br />
               and contented condition, with an oppor— 
               <br />
               tunity to extend and grow, and with all the 
               <br />
               people now living in or hereafter coming 
               <br />
               into those provinces satisﬁed with their 
               <br />
               condition.
