            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               What was done by ordinance? At 
               <br />
               ﬁrst there was a system under which a 
               <br />
               board of twelve was appointed—six Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics and six Protestants. Later on that 
               <br />
               was changed by_ another ordinance and 
               <br />
               the board consisted of eight—ﬁve Pzro— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">testants</span> and three Reman Catholics. That 
               <br />
               might be said to be a change to the dis- 
               <br />
               advantage of Roman Catholics, inasmuch 
               <br />
               as instead of having one half the board 
               <br />
               they hadonly three-eights. But there was no 
               <br />
               question about its validity, although it did 
               <br />
               affect the Roman Catholics, and it was 
               <br />
               never disallowed or questioned. But both 
               <br />
               those ordinances did give a very substan- 
               <br />
               tial privilege to Roman Catholics or Pro- 
               <br />
               testants as the case might be. Both pro- 
               <br />
               vided that the three or the six Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics, had the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">control</span> of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic schools, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Protestants had 
               <br />
               a like control, and supervision of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Pro- 
               <br />
               testant schools. That undoubtedly was a 
               <br />
               boon and privilege to those who took 
               <br />
               an interest in their own schools. But 
               <br />
               subsequently there were changes, and 
               <br />
               in 1892, the ordinances were very mater- 
               <br />
               ially changed. The board was abolished, 
               <br />
               and a council of public instruction estab- 
               <br />
               lished. That council consisted of members 
               <br />
               of the executive with four appointed mem- 
               <br />
               bers—two Roman Catholics and two Pro- 
               <br />
               testants—but the appointed four were to 
               <br />
               have no vote. That was a material change, 
               <br />
               and the sectional control of separate schools 
               <br />
               was removed. Instead, the control, both of 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic and Protestant schools, was 
               <br />
               given to the whole board. That was com- 
               <br />
               ing nearer to the Ontario system. In On-

               tario, the whole board controls all schools,

               <br />
               and coloured schols. I may say that in 
               <br />
               Ontario a separate school may consist 
               <br />
               of coloured people, and I do not know 
               <br />
               that because they are coloured people, there 
               <br />
               is any religious instruction to be implied.

               <br />
               vigorous protest; and in 1893 an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">applica—»</span> 
               <br />
               tion was made to the Governor General 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council</span> to disallow those ordinances on 
               <br />
               thei ground that they had taken away pri- 
               <br />
               vileges previously enjoyed. The subject 
               <br />
               was very carefully gone into by» a com- 
               <br />
               mittee of the Privy Council, and the result 
               <br />
               was a refusal to disallow the ordinances of 
               <br />
               1892. That committee seemed to think 
               <br />
               that perhaps some hardship had been 
               <br />
               suffered, and they recommended those 
               <br />
               who had been complaining to see the Lieu- 
               <br />
               tenant Governor in Council and endeavour 
               <br />
               to get some modiﬁcation ; but there was no 
               <br />
               decision that nhe ordinances was not strictly 
               <br />
               Within the power of the Lieutenant Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor in Council. That ordinance of 1892 
               <br />
               is practically 29 and 30, but instead of two 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholics</span> and two Protestants, they have 
               <br />
               now three Protestants and two Catholics. 
               <br />
               Separate or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sectional,</span> control is not 
               <br />
               aillowed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">except</span> that there are separate 
               <br />
               school trustees, who appoint teachers, 
               <br />
               &amp;c. After that disallowance there was 
               <br />
               a very vigorous complaint from his 
               <br />
               Grace Archbishop T-aché and others. 
               <br />
               On the 7th March, 1894, the archbishop 
               <br />
               addressed the Governor in Council, and in 
               <br />
               the memorial which he presented h'e com— 
               <br />
               plained very bitterly of what had been 
               <br />
               done. The whole subject was fully discuss- 
               <br />
               ed, with the result that no action was taken, 
               <br />
               except to refer the matter to the Territorial 
               <br />
               authorities. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">_So,</span> Mr. Speaker, the ordinances 
               <br />
               29 and 30, which are now introduced into the 
               <br />
               Bill before the House, were never disallow- 
               <br />
               ed, and are undoubtedly Territorial law. 
               <br />
               But the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«ex—Minister.</span> of the Interior <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Sifton) was apparently afraid that the 
               <br />
               changes in the ordinances might be ultra 
               <br />
               vires, and that some of the old privileges 
               <br />
               might be brough back to life, he thought a 
               <br />
               report of Sir John Thompson on the 10th of 
               <br />
               January, 1900, supported his View. But 
               <br />
               the report of Sir John Thompson was on a 
               <br />
               very different subject. It had nothing to 
               <br />
               do with school regulation, nothing to do 
               <br />
               with any change of one ordinance by an- 
               <br />
               other ordinance. I do not think anybody 
               <br />
               questioned that the ordinance Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson dealt with was ultra <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vires..</span> Un- 
               <br />
               der the Act of 1875, it had been provided 
               <br />
               that the minority, Roman Catholic or Pro- 
               <br />
               testant, could establish separate schools. 
               <br />
               BUt as the ordinance Sir John Thompson 
               <br />
               reported on was worded, it was provided 
               <br />
               that only after a public school district had 
               <br />
               been formed could the minority establish
