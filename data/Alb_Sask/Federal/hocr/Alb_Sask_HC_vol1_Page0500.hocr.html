               Christopher Robinson’s opinion which shows 
               <br />
               a still further difference. Now, I do not

               pretend to know anything about constitu-

               know anything about constitutional law. I 
               <br />

               ed. and I propose to say something about 
               <br />
               them. I know what they have been for a 
               <br />
               long time back. Over twenty years ago I 
               <br />
               was a member of the Territorial legislature 
               <br />
               when the ﬁrst school ordinance was passed 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1884,</span> passed under the Northwest Terri— 
               <br />
               tories Act of 1875. Previouslyto 1892 we 
               <br />
               had a system of separate schools, the same 
               <br />
               hind of schools they had in the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. Those schools were not satis- 
               <br />
               factory,; everybody knows that; they were 
               <br />
               not even satisfactory to our Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               [riends and ratepayers. They were not sa- 
               <br />
               tisﬁed with the class of schools given them. 
               <br />
               and were as anxious to have them changed 
               <br />
               as anybody else. In the year 1892 the local 
               <br />
               legislature. under Mr. Hanltain, changed the 
               <br />
               Old system, and from that year up to the 
               <br />
               present day there has not been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one’word</span> of 
               <br />

               The people of the Northwest Territories

               <br />
               and I want to say again that since 1892, 
               <br />
               since the present law was passed, there has 
               <br />
               never been a word of complaint from Pro- 
               <br />
               testants or Catholics or from the Northwest 
               <br />
               government in any shape or form, or any 
               <br />
               statement that the law was not a good one. 
               <br />
               I say that the law as it exists in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories to—day—and it is the only 
               <br />
               law that we are putting in force—is the 
               <br />
               most satisfactory law that you can get, 
               <br />
               because we have proof of it in the fact that 
               <br />
               it has been in force for thirteen years with- 
               <br />
               out ever a complaint having been made. 
               <br />
               What does that law give them ? As 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Jacques Cartier 
               <br />
               (Mr. Monk) stated the other day, if 
               <br />
               church schools were what were given 
               <br />
               to the Roman Catholics in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories by the Act of 1875, there 
               <br />
               is only a small vestige of them left, and 
               <br />
               for this reason : That the separate Catholic 
               <br />
               school in the Northwest, or the public Ca— 
               <br />
               tholic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schoolwit</span> does not matter much which 
               <br />
               —is to all intents and purposes a public 
               <br />
               school. It is exactly the same as a public 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">School.</span> The teachers of the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               separate school must attend the same normal 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">school</span> and get the same certiﬁcates exactly 
               <br />
               as the teachers in the public schools. The 
               <br />
               school has to be inspected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«before</span> lany 
               <br />
               grant can be paid, by a public school in- 
               <br />
               spector. The only difference is that in the 
               <br />
               first and second readers the text is a little 
               <br />
               different, but even these books have to be 
               <br />
               authorized by the Minister of Education. 
               <br />
               There is no church or clerical control in any 
               <br />
               shape, form or manner over the Catholic 
               <br />
               separate schools of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories to-day. They are all under the control 
               <br />
               of. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> local legislature, every one of them, 
               <br />
               and the only difference—and it is not much 
               <br />
               of a difference either, because the public 
               <br />
               schools have the same right if they choose 
               <br />
               to use it—is that between half—past three 
               <br />
