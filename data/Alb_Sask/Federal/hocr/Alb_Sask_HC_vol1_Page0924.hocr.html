               look up the history of these people who are 
               <br />
               charged with religious zealotism, you will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the crime in the United States does 
               <br />
               not rest at their door, but at the door of the 
               <br />
               foreign element coming to the United States 
               <br />
               and from countries where there were no 
               <br />
               public schools either. Not only is that 
               <br />
               the case, but the crime is due largely to the 
               <br />
               civil conditions and the race complications 
               <br />
               that exist in the southern states. When 
               <br />
               the northern ﬂag was unfolded over the 
               <br />
               south, the puplic school was instituted. Pre- 
               <br />
               vious to the _civil war the south had the 
               <br />
               advantage in higher schools and colleges 
               <br />
               because the planters were wealthy and they 
               <br />
               wanted to educate their sons and daughters, 
               <br />
               but the common school was neglected and 
               <br />
               not until the northern army was victorious 
               <br />
               was the public school system established in 
               <br />
               the southern states. I think that the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman made a mistake in charg— 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               in that country to a greater extent than 
               <br />
               in Canada. But the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               forgot another fact. To hear him speak 
               <br />
               you would think that there was not a reli- 
               <br />
               gious school in the United States. That 
               <br />
               is not so. So far back as 1846 the brothers 
               <br />

               most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eifective</span> schools—the brothers of the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">city:</span> of Baltimore. In 1848 they came to

               New York, in 1852 they went to St. Louis 
               <br />
               and to-day there are 35,000 pupils <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.attend-</span>

               It is possibly due to the attitude of these

               <br />
               owe something to this country as citizens? 
               <br />
               It is their home, it is the land of their

               credit if men of his race go out and tight

               <br />
               I have said, the hon. member for Labelle

               forgot to mention one instance in which 
               <br />
               the bishops of Quebec were anxious to 
               <br />
               stand by the rights of their people and in 
               <br />

               <br />
               right hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier and his 
               <br />
               friends. In 1896 the bishops felt they 
               <br />
               should stand by the rights of their people 
               <br />

               that he would do certain things if certain 
               <br />
               other things were not done, and several

               ister was returned to power and the Min- 
               <br />
               ister .of Justice and his friends got into 
               <br />
               oﬂice, they undertook to override the wishes 
               <br />
               of these reverend gentlemen who certain- 
               <br />
               ly ought to know more about their home

               alfairs than a man who would come from 
               <br />
               a foreign country. Anyhow, the bishops 
               <br />
               were overridden in their wishes and for 
               <br />
               some reason or other they have been kept

               the hon. gentleman from Labelle failed to
