               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thon.</span> ex-Minister of the Interior declared 
               <br />
               was the purpose of the clause Now this 
               <br />
               ought to give food for thought not only to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> the people of the Northwest but to the peo— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fple</span> of this country through and through. 
               <br />
               Then, I put this question to the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister: If, before the last elec- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fion</span> he had made known his intention to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> develop two provinces out of the Territories 
               <br />
               and in giving them autonomy to withhold 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{from</span> them the power over their lands and 
               <br />
               the unlimited power to control their educa— 
               <br />
               tional interests, how many men would he 
               <br />
               have had back here from the Northwest ? 
               <br />
               I ask the right hon. gentleman what would 
               <br />
               have been his status in this country to-day ? 
               <br />
               Is it to his credit that he kept back from 
               <br />
               the people that information 01' even an in- 
               <br />
               timation of it and secured a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">following:</span> 
               <br />
               absolutely unpledged and without a man- 
               <br />
               date on this subject ? My hon. friend knows 
               <br />
               that there is only one answer to that. I will 
               <br />
               put another question to him. If the hon. ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior had stood out on 
               <br />
               his principle as he called it, would one 
               <br />
               single member from the Northwest have 
               <br />
               dared to go against him ‘? If he had stood 
               <br />
               out and if the rest had stood out with him 
               <br />
               would the right hon. leader of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment have dared to have attempted to put 
               <br />
               through his Bill ? That is the question. 
               <br />
               Therefore, there was an incentive and a 
               <br />
               motive either for the use of the pistol or 
               <br />
               the soporiﬁc. One or the other has been 
               <br />
               used undoubtedly as no man would have 
               <br />
               repudiated his principles and the record of 
               <br />
               a lifetime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> a most grave question, unless 
               <br />
               there had been some further inducement 
               <br />
               than the ex-Minister of the Interior de— 
               <br />
               clared before us here the other day.
