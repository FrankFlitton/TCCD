               organizing the Northwest Territories was

               passed; but you will notice that in that

               <br />
               the Territories or in the courts. It was only 
               <br />
               in 1877, in a Bill introduced by the late 
               <br />
               Hon. Mr. Mills, and moved in the Senate 
               <br />

               <br />

               At that time there was a comparatively 
               <br />
               large French Canadian element in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. That Act passed the House 
               <br />
               of Commons and became the law of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, and remained so until 
               <br />
               1890. The House is aware of the agitation 
               <br />
               which took place as a result of the cam- 
               <br />
               paign led by the late Mr. Dalton McCarthy. 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy advocated the abolition of the 
               <br />
               separate schools system, and the abolition 
               <br />
               of the French language in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories and in the Manitoba legislature. 
               <br />
               The older members of this House are con- 
               <br />
               versant with the Bill which was introduced 
               <br />
               during the memorable session of 1890 by 
               <br />
               Mr. Dalton McCarthy. In the preamble of 
               <br />
               that Bill Mr. McCarthy declared that it was 
               <br />
               essential to the welfare of the country that 
               <br />
               there should be one language only; but the 
               <br />
               enacting clause only proposed to abolish the 
               <br />
               use of the French language in the Northwest 
               <br />
               assembly. I may say that a few months or 
               <br />
               perhaps a year before, the Northwest as- 
               <br />
               sembly had practically unanimously decided 
               <br />
               to expunge the French language from its 
               <br />
               records and its deliberations. The Bill of 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy was of a very radical nature, 
               <br />
               especially the preamble, which conveyed the 
               <br />
               idea that if it were passed by the House of 
               <br />
               Commons of Canada, it meant that not only 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories the French 
               <br />
               language be abolished, but that it would be 
               <br />
               the signal of a camrpaign against the use of 
               <br />
               that language in this parliament and even 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec. In fact, Mr. Mc- 
               <br />
               Carthy and several other gentlemen made a 
               <br />
               very bitter campaign against the separate 
               <br />
               school system and the dual language. What 
               <br />
               happened then ? The Bill was introduced in 
               <br />
               the House of Commons by Mr. McCarthy. 
               <br />
               Our late colleague (Mr. Davin) who repre- 
               <br />
               sented the constituency of Assiniboia and 
               <br />
               who at that time, when the Northwest was 
               <br />
               represented, I think, only by two or three 
               <br />
               members, was the spokesman of his fellow 
               <br />
