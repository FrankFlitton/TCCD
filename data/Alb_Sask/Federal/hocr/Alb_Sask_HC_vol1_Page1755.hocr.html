               then, if I look at the subject from a larger

               point of view and endeavour to give a re-

               The Conservative party has taken the posi- 
               <br />
               tion upon this question that the govern- 
               <br />
               ment are invading provincial rights. When 
               <br />
               I say that the Conservative party has taken 
               <br />
               this position, perhaps I make a mistake; 
               <br />
               perhaps I should not use so wide and 
               <br />
               general an expression, because it happens 
               <br />
               that upon this question the Conservative 
               <br />
               party has no policy. It is not too much to 
               <br />
               say that on this question the Conservative 
               <br />
               party is an assembly of contradictory opin- 
               <br />
               ions without any separate idea upon what 
               <br />
               to rally. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘When</span> my hon. friend the leader

               upon the second reading of the Bill he was

               It is true that after that, one important sec-

               ducing this legislation violated the principle

               of provincial rights. The answer I have to 
               <br />
               offer to that assertion, the simple answer, 
               <br />
               the categorical peremptory and paramount 
               <br />
               answer, is that in matters of education there 
               <br />
               is no such thing under our constitution as 
               <br />
               absolute provincial rights.

               this important matter of education, there is
