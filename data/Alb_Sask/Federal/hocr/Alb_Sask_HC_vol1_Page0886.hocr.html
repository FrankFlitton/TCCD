               Mr. Speaker, I cannot help thinking that

               many of the supporters of the present gov- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ernment</span> are shrinking to-day from the

               <br />
               a ﬁght against the Roman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ca-tli‘blic</span> church,

               or against our fellow Roman Catholic citi-

               bers opposite are mistaken when they talk 
               <br />
               to us as though we were here representing 
               <br />

               with being prejudiced against our Catholic

               fellow citizens. That is not the case. Some 
               <br />
               of the best friends I have in private and 
               <br />

               <br />
               interviewed a number of these men, and I 
               <br />
               have failed to ﬁnd a man yet that will jus-

               to do, the educational clauses of this Bill.

               We need fearless criticism of this measure, 
               <br />
               we need fearless criticism of all acts, honest

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Since</span> the introduction of this Bill we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> 
               <br />
               had very interesting and strange proceed- 
               <br />
               lugs. On the 21st of February the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman introduced this Bill with 
               <br />
               great blowing of trumpets and well rounded, 
               <br />
               periods, proclaiming to this nation that he 
               <br />
               was standing on the rock of the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion. But since the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               has shattered his arguments to fragments. 
               <br />
               we scarcely ﬁnd a man on the government 
               <br />
               side to—day who will dare stand up and de- 
               <br />
               fend the constitution, as we have a right to 
               <br />
               expect it tobe defended by hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               supporting the government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">V‘Vell,</span> in a few 
               <br />
               days after the introduction of the Bill the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior arrived, and took a 
               <br />
               bold and brave stand in opposition to it; and 
               <br />
               the people throughout our land said that 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(ax-minister</span> was going to stand by pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights. They expected of course 
               <br />
               that the western men would follow him, al- 
               <br />
               though they did pound their desks when this 
               <br />
               Bill was presented to the House in its ori- 
               <br />
               ginal form. But the ex-minister has since 
               <br />
               that time swallowed his principles, and 
               <br />
               stands today as a self condemned man in 
               <br />
               the eyes of the people of Canada.
