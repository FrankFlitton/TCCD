               of dogma in the public schools in this 
               <br />
               age of ours. I certainly did not eXDeCt 
               <br />
               to hear in this House a plea of that 
               <br />
               nature. I had hoped that in this twen- 
               <br />
               h'eth century we had arrived at an era 
               <br />
               When those dogmas would not again be the 
               <br />
               dividing line between the various denomina— 
               <br />

               <br />
               man thinks differently. Let me ask him to 
               <br />
               cast his attention back to what happened 
               <br />
               only in the century just ﬁnished. In 1829, 
               <br />
               in the British House of Commons, the Cath- 
               <br />
               olic Emancipation Bill was introduced by 
               <br />
               Mr. Peel. That was not a hundred years 
               <br />
               ago, but still in that time the Roman Cath- 
               <br />
               olic Church was suﬁt'ering under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disv</span>

               abilities which had afﬂicted it for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generav</span> 
               <br />
               tions. But in the year 1829 all these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,bar-</span> 
               <br />
               riers were swept away. I have here upon 
               <br />
               the desk the report of the deb-ate that took 
               <br />
               place in the British House on that occasion. 
               <br />
               In reading it I have noticed how the vari- 
               <br />
               ous Protestant bodies in England decided 
               <br />
               that they would lay aside those differences 
               <br />
               and would emancipate for all time the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Roman Catholic Church from 
               <br />
               those disabilities under which they had 
               <br />
               laboured for generations. Surely that is a 
               <br />
               step of which the hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               would approve. Surely hon. gentlemen will 
               <br />
               not forget that advances have been made 
               <br />
               along this line in many various ways during 
               <br />
               the past few years, and that in recent times 
               <br />
               these advances have been greater than ever 
               <br />
               before. Are we in this House to say that 
               <br />
               the conditions of the past shall continue, 
               <br />
               that those divisions that have existed be— 
               <br />
               tween the peoples of the world in past gene- 
               <br />
               rations shall be continued for all future 
               <br />
               time ? When the Almighty ﬁrst created this 
               <br />
               vast universe, He set up the various na- 
               <br />
               tions of the earth and He divided them by 
               <br />
               various natural barriers, which, in those 
               <br />
               days, were considered insuperable, and 
               <br />
               which for ages and for generations remain- 
               <br />
               ed the dividing lines between the nations. 
               <br />
               The Almighty stretched out vast mountain 
               <br />
               chains that divided one nation from another; 
               <br />
               He caused vast rivers to ﬂow between coun— 
               <br />
               tries, and these constituted natural boun— 
               <br />
               daries ; He set the mighty oceans to divide 
               <br />
               the various nations of the earth. All these 
               <br />
               divisions existed for ages and generations, 
               <br />
               but those who read the history of the past 
               <br />
               will see that, according to the divine work- 
               <br />
               ing from the day of the creation down to 
               <br />
               the present time, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Almighty</span> has, by one 
               <br />
               great system of evolution, caused these se- 
               <br />
               parations between the nations to gradually 
               <br />
               and by one means after another disappear 
               <br />
               and vanish away. Mountains that for gen- 
               <br />
               erations had stood between nations on the 
               <br />
               continent of Europe have been tunnelled, 
               <br />
               so that now these nations are no longer 
               <br />
               hedged in by the mountains that originally 
               <br />
               separated them. These vast oceans on both 
               <br />
               the east and west of this vast continent are 
               <br />
               now traversed as freely as people would 
               <br />
               cross a small lake in the days gone by. 
               <br />
               All this by the mighty hand of Him who 
               <br />

               <br />
               more closely to each other; the barrier of 
               <br />

               that tended to keep these peoples separate

               <br />
               constant visitors to one another. And thus 
               <br />
               we see that through an all-wise plan the 
               <br />
               nations of the earth and the religions of the 
               <br />
               earth have day by day come closer to one 
               <br />
               another. It is a gradual and slow process, 
               <br />
               but no one looking at the records of the 
               <br />
               past can fail to see that although the pro- 
               <br />
               cess is slow it is none the less sure. And 
               <br />
               yet, although it has been a matter of time, 
               <br />
               these barriers have one by one disappeared ; 
               <br />
               and I ask you, Mr. Speaker, in the light of 
               <br />
               the history of the past, is it too much to 
               <br />
               expect that in the generations to come a 
               <br />
               further appoac‘h shall be made between those 
               <br />
               who differ in race, in religion and in creed ? 
               <br />
               1, Sir, for one, believe that we have here 
               <br />
               but the beginning of that vast rapproche- 
               <br />
               ment made by the various tribes, tongues, 
               <br />
               nations and religions of the world. Is it 
               <br />
               [right then, in view of the fact that the 
               <br />
               races are being drawn closely and more 
               <br />
               closely together; is it right, in view of the 
               <br />
               history of the past and of what is happen- 
               <br />
               ing and has happened in this country dur- 
               <br />
               ing the last few years, that we in setting 
               <br />
               aside these two new provinces should say 
               <br />
               that for all time there shall be no nearer 
               <br />
               approach than is contained in these two 
               <br />
               school clauses in that Bill ? I think this is 
               <br />
               a responsibility that this House should be 
               <br />
               very slow to fasten upon these new pro-

               I am not in a position to discuss the con-

               stitutional questions that have been raised 
               <br />
               with regard to our power to place upon 
               <br />
               these new provinces the restrictions which 
               <br />
               this Bill contains. I have heard these clauses 
               <br />
               argued pro and con. The question has been 
               <br />
               ably argued, but I must say that as a layman 
               <br />
               the argument has not been convincing to me. 
               <br />
               It has not been an argument that I should

               say was absolutely certain one way or the

               other. So far as I have been able to judge, 
               <br />
               there has been no better argument <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“13011</span> the 
               <br />
               constitutional points than that enunciated 
               <br />
               by my esteemed leader (Mr. R. L. Borden). 
               <br />
               I believe that upon the constitutional ques- 
               <br />
               tion his speech has perhaps carried as much 
               <br />
               weight as that of any gentleman who has 
               <br />
               spoken on this great question. Whether or 
               <br />
               not he has the correct idea with regard to 
               <br />
               all our powers in dealing with these new

               <br />
               but if there is such a great element of doubt 
               <br />
               in this matter, it seems to une that this gov— 
               <br />
               ernment has taken a very unwise course 
               <br />
               in thrusting upon this House a discussion 
               <br />
               such as this, not yet knowing even in their

               own minds whether or not they have the 
               <br />
