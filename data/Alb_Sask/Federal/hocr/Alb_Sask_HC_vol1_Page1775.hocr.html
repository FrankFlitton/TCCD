               the intention they had in passing the sta- 
               <br />
               tute. I say we must interpret the word 
               <br />
               ‘ majority’ in the second paragraph of that 
               <br />
               Act in the same way as the word ‘ minority ’ 
               <br />
               in the third paragraph; that is, it means 
               <br />
               that if the majority were Catholics it could 
               <br />
               establish Catholic schools, and if the ma— 
               <br />
               jority were Protestant it could establish Pro— 
               <br />
               testant schools ;' but if the minority were 
               <br />
               of a different creed they could separate from 
               <br />
               the majority and establish such schools as 
               <br />
               they saw ﬁt. Now, to that the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man makes an objection that would leave 
               <br />
               no schools to any other class of people than 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholics and the Protestants. 
               <br />
               I never contended that, and I think _it would 
               <br />
               be a senseless contention. .

               the ordinance of 1892 was passed. But 
               <br />
               I say that in so far as separate schools 
               <br />
               are concerned it meant nothing but Pro— 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               of mine which I expressed the other day 
               <br />
               and he cited the opinion of the Supreme

               <br />

               <br />
               simple, layman way of reading a document 
               <br />
               I have read that judgment and what I 
               <br />
               found I thought was this, that the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court of New Brunswick decided ﬁrst that 
               <br />
               under the Parish School Law or under the 
               <br />
               Common School Law, Catholics enjoyed no 
               <br />
               rights which they could claim as rights un- 
               <br />
               der section 93 of the British North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span>

               Act, that whatever religious exercises were

               <br />
               provided for under clause 93 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. They decided secondly 
               <br />
               that denominational schools, as provided to." 
               <br />
               under subsection 1 of section 93 meant the 
               <br />
               schools of any denomination, any Protest- 
               <br />
               ant denomination, or the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               but in so far as separate schools are con- 
               <br />
               cerned and as provided for by subsections 
               <br />
               2, 3 and 4, they meant Catholic schools on 
               <br />
               one side and Protestant schools on the other. 
               <br />
               I quote from the judgment: 
               <br />

               It is contended, in this case, that the words
