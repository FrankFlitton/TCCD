               Take, for instance, the subject of correspond- 
               <br />
               ence. How easy it is to write, in the address, 
               <br />
               N.Y., N.-S., Va., B.C., &amp;c. But how about the 
               <br />
               names now applied to the new provinces? 
               <br />
               ‘ Alb.’ would not be easily written with a pen, 
               <br />
               because of the loops in ‘ l ’ and ‘ b.’ But what 
               <br />
               are we to say about ‘ Saskatchewan ? ' Shall we 
               <br />
               make the contraction ‘Sask.’ ? If we do, then 
               <br />
               we have the name, ‘Saskey,’ and that would 
               <br />
               not be digniﬁed. Referring to Alberta, I ima-

               Saskatchewan should certainly be dropped, for
