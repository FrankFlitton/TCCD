               territory, which comprises the half of Al- 
               <br />
               berta, discontent prevails <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> over 
               <br />
               the government schedule which lies on the 
               <br />
               table. I have just one more word to say. 
               <br />
               l think that I have shown that when the 
               <br />
               government put into the Bill these words, 
               <br />
               "having due regard to the distribution of 
               <br />
               population and existing local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">divisions:</span> they 
               <br />
               put in something that was not true. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span> 
               <br />
               Las not been due regard paid to population, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> existing local divisions have been abso- 
               <br />
               lutely ignored. And the dangerous part of 
               <br />
               it is that the people of Alberta know and 
               <br />
               dceply feel the injustice that is being placed 
               <br />
               on the southern half of the-population.

               Now, I want to submit this question to 
               <br />
               this House in, as near as I can, an .absolu- 
               <br />
               tely impartial spirit. You are about to 
               <br />
               create a new province; you are about to 
               <br />
               give to that new province a legislature 
               <br />
               which will be called upon to enact laws 
               <br />
               for the government of that province. That 
               <br />
               legislature, when it ﬁrst meets. will un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly have much important business 
               <br />
               which will require its immediate attention. 
               <br />
               If that legislature is elected under that 
               <br />
               schedule, do you suppose that it will be 
               <br />
               able to give to that business its closest at- 
               <br />
               tention? If the legislature is elected on 
               <br />
               that schedule, it will be composed of men 
               <br />
               a large majority of whom at least will be 
               <br />
               burning with resentment at the wrong done 
               <br />
               to them, and will endeavour to right that 
               <br />
               wrong. Is it wise for this House to 
               <br />
               launch the new province under such aus— 
               <br />
               pices as that? Is it wise to throw apples 
               <br />
               of discord into the midst of this new legis- 
               <br />
               lative body, and practically damn it at 
               <br />
               the commencement of its career with a 
               <br />
               quarrel which it will take years to settle? 
               <br />
               Why does the government endeavour to so 
               <br />
               juggle the cards that the north will have 
               <br />
               an advantage over the south in the selec- 
               <br />
               tion of the capital ? Why does it put a 
               <br />
