               Bill I do not think anything need be said. 
               <br />
               We have received in the past at the hands 
               <br />
               of this government very fair consideration. 
               <br />
               We have received representation in this 
               <br />
               House and in the upper chamber. We have 
               <br />
               received reasonable ﬁnancial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration,</span> 
               <br />
               increasing as our needs increased, although 
               <br />
               possibly not fully up to the mark of our re— 
               <br />
               quirements. And now, that it has seemed 
               <br />
               good to the government of the day and to, I 
               <br />
               think, the large majority of the people of 
               <br />
               the country to erect these Territories into 
               <br />
               provinces, it is certainly something of which 
               <br />
               we may very well be proud that we enter 
               <br />
               confederation upon such favourable terms. 
               <br />
               We only regret that this particular subject 
               <br />
               should have been the occasion of such a 
               <br />
               great amount of what I may be justiﬁed in 
               <br />
               calling malicious misrepresentationfor the 
               <br />
               purpose of making party capital. We had 
               <br />
               hoped that our entrance into confederation 
               <br />
               as full ﬂedged provinces would be under 
               <br />
               altogether auspicious circumstances. With 
               <br />
               this exception they are altogether auspici- 
               <br />
               ous and perhaps when we have threshed out 
               <br />
               this question in parliament we will all 
               <br />
               understand each other better, we will all 
               <br />
               know where we severally stand on this im-

               portant question and perhaps it will be the
