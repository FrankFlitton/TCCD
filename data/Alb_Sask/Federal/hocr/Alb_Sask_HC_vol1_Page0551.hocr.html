               nounced that they are not in favour of

               separate schools. The Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               has told us that he is opposed to separate 
               <br />
               schools ; the member for Edmonton told us, 
               <br />
               as he stated many times on the public plat- 
               <br />
               form that he was opposed to separate 
               <br />
               schools. He is an old war horse who fought 
               <br />
               for provincial rights in the past, and who 
               <br />
               stated that he would never consent that sepa- 
               <br />
               rate schools should be inﬂicted on the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories, but now he has changed his 
               <br />
               mind, like many others, in order to save 
               <br />
               his party. For my part I would be sorry 
               <br />
               to deprive any people of their just rights, 
               <br />
               but the people of the new provinces them- 
               <br />
               selves know best What rights should be 
               <br />
               respected. It has been argued that because 
               <br />
               we have separate schools in Quebec and 
               <br />
