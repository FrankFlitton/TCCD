               the principle is wrong. I think it does not 
               <br />
               conduce to economy in the administration 
               <br />
               of the affairs of the provinces. Where the 
               <br />
               province is handed over a bulk <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sum,</span> a large 
               <br />
               sum of money to be expended at will by the 
               <br />
               government of the province, there is little 
               <br />
               or no incentive to economy in the adminis- 
               <br />
               tration of its affairs. I say it is not a sound 
               <br />
               principle lto <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> one man furnish the 
               <br />
               money and another one expend it. The 
               <br />
               spending body should be the taxing body, if 
               <br />
               you are going to have economy in the ad- 
               <br />
               ministration. Throughout the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario there is a grievance at the present 
               <br />
               day along the same line. The government 
               <br />
               of Hon. Mr. Ross changed the law with re- 
               <br />
               spect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tolcounty</span> councils and provided a 
               <br />
               spending body which was supplied by the 
               <br />
               minor municipalities with all the money it 
               <br />
               required. I am aware that there is a feel- 
               <br />
               ing growing up in that province that a mis- 
               <br />
               take was made, and that they ought to come 
               <br />
               back to the old principle where the reeves 
               <br />
               and deputy reeves constituted the county 
               <br />
               council, and where the same corporation 
               <br />
               that taxed the people spent the money that 
               <br />
               was derived from taxation. I consider that 
               <br />
               if we had a principle of that kind incorpor- 
               <br />
               ated in this Bill there would be less liability 
               <br />
               for these new provinces extravagantly to 
               <br />
               expend the provision which is made for the 
               <br />
               government of the country, and I think now 
               <br />
               that opportunity is offered.

               We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[propose</span> under this Bill to take from 
               <br />
               the new provinces all the public lands within 
               <br />
               their area. Now, I say here and now, with- 
               <br />
               out hesitation, having thought over this mat- 
               <br />
               ter for some time, I would rather see the 
               <br />
               provinces given all the public lands within 
               <br />
               their area. Instead of taking the lands and 
               <br />
               administering them by the Dominion govern-

               <br />
               I believe were they given the public lands

               they would administer their public affairs 
               <br />

               <br />
               desire to preserve their own interests, and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in,</span> the end I am sure it would result in no

               loss to the people ot‘ the Dominion of Can-

               being imposed upon the people of the entire 
               <br />
               Dominion may seem triﬂing, but depend 
               <br />
               upon it, Mr. Speaker, they will grow as time 
               <br />
               passes by, and there will be a time when 
               <br />
               this ﬁnancial assistance will not satisfy the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘people</span> of these new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(provinces,</span> and they will

               <br />

               <br />
               acres of land. How do we know that inside 
               <br />
               of ten or ﬁfteen years they will not make 
               <br />
               a demand upon us for a further settlement

               is that danger, and I believe we had better

               meet the question fairly and squarely now.

               <br />
               brieﬂy to refer is one that has been men- 
               <br />
               tioned by only a few members in this House; 
               <br />
               I refer to the tax exemption of the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Paciﬁc Railway passing through those 
               <br />
               Territories. Now, What I am going to say 
               <br />
               is entirely on my own responsibility, I have 
               <br />
               not consulted any one on this side of the 
               <br />
               House as to whether the view I hold is 
               <br />
               right or wrong. But I say without hesita- 
               <br />
               tion that I have no sympathy with those 
               <br />
               from the Northwest Territories Who are in- 
               <br />
               sisting that the tax exemption of the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Paciﬁc Railway for their line, their 
               <br />
               station houses, their plant and everything 
               <br />
               they own in those new provinces should be 
               <br />
               removed. I have no sympathy with that 
               <br />
               feeling. I believe this road was constructed 
               <br />
               for the beneﬁt of those Territories, it was 
               <br />
               constructed certainly for the beneﬁt of the 
               <br />
               entire Dominion from the Atlantic to the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc. We all take a great interest in it. 
               <br />
               We realize to—day that we are all beneﬁted 
               <br />
               largely by the construction of that road and 
               <br />
               I hold that these new provinces are more 
               <br />
               especially beneﬁted by it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than,</span> any other 
               <br />
               part of Canada. Without the construction 
               <br />
               of that road the Territories comprised in 
               <br />
               those two provinces to-day would practically 
               <br />
               be a nonentity. It was necessary that 
               <br />
               that country should be opened up. To 
               <br />
               my mind the people have derived a 
               <br />
               greater advantage by the opening of 
               <br />
               the country than the disadvantage they 
               <br />
               have been obliged to suffer through being 
               <br />
               deprived of that public revenue by the ex— 
               <br />
               emption of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. 
               <br />
               I do not think that the people going into 
               <br />
               that country have any great reason to com- 
               <br />
               plain because the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               was allowed that exemption. Besides, it was 
               <br />
               one of the conditions on which this railway 
               <br />
               was constructed ; it was a part of. the con- 
               <br />
               sideration for the building of the road. We 
               <br />
               remember that the government were obliged 
               <br />
               to give 25,000,000 acres of land and $25,- 
               <br />
               000,000 of subsidy, besides handing over 
               <br />
               a large part of the road already con- 
               <br />
               structed practically a ﬁnancial consider— 
               <br />
               ation equal to about $62,000,000, apart 
               <br />
               from the 25,000,000 acres of land. The ex- 
               <br />
               emption from taxation was just as much 
               <br />
               a part of the bonus or subsidy which pro- 
               <br />
               cured the construction of that road as were 
               <br />
               the subsidies of land and money. If we 
               <br />
               are to ask the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway now 
               <br />
               to forego their right to this tax exemption ;

               this parliament might as well ask them to 
               <br />
               refund the subsidy and restore the land 
               <br />
               which was given them. I say I have no sym- 
               <br />
               pathy with a proposal of that kind. This

               <br />
