               <br />

               revolt, if we can believe what we read in 
               <br />
               the newspapers. I refer to the province of 
               <br />

               <br />
               then face to face with a very serious crisis? 
               <br />
               A great question is now before us for de- 
               <br />
               termination, namely, the establishment of 
               <br />
               two new provinces out in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. What ownership shall these 
               <br />
               provinces have in the soil? What repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives shall they possess? What legis- 
               <br />
               lative power shall be given them ? What 
               <br />
               interference shall we make with what they 
               <br />
               believe to be their undoubted rights in the 
               <br />
               future ? All these great questions are be- 
               <br />
               ing discussed by this parliament, and these 
               <br />
               Territories have no voice at the council 
               <br />
               board. They had a voice there not long 
               <br />
               ago. but their representative resigned as a 
               <br />
               rebuke against the high—handed and unwar- 
               <br />
               ranted conduct of the government on the 
               <br />
               Autonomy Bill. A Minister of the Crown, 
               <br />
               representing that country, gave practical ex- 
               <br />
               pression of his dissent from that policy by 
               <br />
               resigning his portfolio. Under the circum- 
               <br />
               stances, it certainly is the duty of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to ﬁll that portfolio at the earliest 
               <br />
               possible moment and have a united cabinet 
               <br />
               on the policy which they are submitting to 
               <br />
               parliament. Why are they not acting in 
               <br />
               accord with the principles of constitutional 
               <br />
               government? Why do they not appoint a 
               <br />
               minister and let him go before the people, 
               <br />
               so that the people may have an opportunity 
               <br />
               of endorsing or condemning the policy of 
               <br />
               the administration ? The reason, Sir, is 
               <br />
               evident. They dare not do it. They want 
               <br />
               to force the Bill through without giving 
               <br />
               the people chieﬂy interested an opportunity 
               <br />
               of declaring their will regarding it. They 
               <br />
               refuse to respect the sovereign rights of the 
               <br />
               people. They are acting in utter disregard 
               <br />
               ‘of the great electorate which can make 
               <br />
               and unmake parliament? Are they afraid 
               <br />
               to appeal to that power ? I am justiﬁed by 
               <br />
               their conduct in coming to the conclusion 
               <br />
               that they are afraid to trust the people. 
               <br />
               Then, are we not justiﬁed in raising our 
               <br />
               voice in rebuke of the conduct of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment? Are we not justiﬁed in calling 
               <br />
               public attention to that conduct as a viola- 
               <br />

               ernment under which we live ? We should 
               <br />
               clearly be doing less than our duty if we 
               <br />
               refrained from inviting public attention to 
               <br />
               the present condition of affairs. As I have 
               <br />
               said, it is clear that the government dare 
               <br />
               not allow the people to speak, to signify 
               <br />
               their agreement or disagreement with the 
               <br />
               measure now before the House. At best,

               the representation of the Northwest in regard 
               <br />
               to this measure could only be indirect so 
               <br />
               far as the cabinet is concerned. The peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the Northwest Territories sent their 
               <br />
               Prime Minister, their accredited representa-

               tive. Except for this delegate they are 
               <br />
               representedonly by a few members in this 
               <br />
               House whose voices are but little heard. 
               <br />
               The government has acted in a most high- 
               <br />
               handed and tyrannical fashion in its treat- 
               <br />

               Now, when a member is selected for the 
               <br />
               cabinet, he is selected on two grounds— 
               <br />
               his ﬁtness for the position and the locality 
               <br />
               he represents. And Who is to determine 
               <br />
               his ﬁtness ? First, the Prime Minister who 
               <br />
               chooses him. But the judgment of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister must be endorsed by the 
               <br />
               people, for, according to our constitutional 
               <br />
               forms, a minister, on his appointment, must 
               <br />
               go before the people to be endorsed by 
               <br />
               them. Have the government dared to ap— 
               <br />
               point a minister and so seek the judgment 
               <br />
               of the people on their policy? They have 
               <br />
               not. This policy was not before the peo- 
               <br />
               ple in the last election, and so there has 
               <br />
               not been the opportunity for the people to 
               <br />
               express themselves upon it. The only con- 
               <br />
               clusion that we can come to is that the 
               <br />
               government are afraid of the pEOple and 
               <br />
               dare not take the step of appointing a min- 
               <br />
               ister to fill the present vacancy because the 
               <br />
               effect of that would be to give the people 
               <br />
               an opportunity to express their opinions upon 
               <br />
               this important measure. The ﬁnancial in- 
               <br />
               terests of that great country in the North- 
               <br />
               west are involved; their whole future is 
               <br />
               involved. Yet, they have no one in the cab- 
               <br />
               inet to speak for them or determine their 
               <br />
               rights,—the people of the Northwest must 
               <br />
               go into the " Blind pool’ to which the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) referred 
               <br />
               last year. Yet, the Prime Minister declares 
               <br />
               over and over again that he admires the 
               <br />
               British constitution and tries tofollow it. 
               <br />
               His conduct, in my opinion, is the very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re«</span> 
               <br />
               verse of all that; he violates every prin-

               ciple of constitutional government by the 
               <br />
               course he pursues. He acts like the Czar 
               <br />
               of Russia, deliberately against the people’s 
               <br />
               rights and wishes. The people are given 
               <br />
               no opportunity to determine what their leg- 
               <br />
               islative rights shall be with regard to their 
               <br />

               dited representative, their Prime Minister, 
               <br />
