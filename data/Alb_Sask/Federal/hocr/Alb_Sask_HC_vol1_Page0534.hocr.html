               I have no rparticnlar fault to ﬁnd with 
               <br />
               the $50,000 given for the support of the 
               <br />
               government and legislature in each of the 
               <br />
               new provinces, or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">80</span> cents per head 
               <br />
               on the estimated population of 250,000. I 
               <br />
               think perhaps that these grants are fairly 
               <br />
               reasonable, and I do not suppose there is 
               <br />
               a man in this House who would want to 
               <br />
               deal by these provinces in any oher way 
               <br />
               than fairly and squarely and with the view 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assisting</span> them in every possible manner. 
               <br />
               But I am entirely opposed to the policy 
               <br />
               of the government with reference to the 
               <br />
               lands. The land-s naturally belong rto the 
               <br />
               provinces. In agreeing to pay each of the 
               <br />
               provinces a certain amount for its lands, 
               <br />
               we. really concede that they belong to them. 
               <br />
               The only plea I have heard why the lands 
               <br />
               are not given to the provinces is that that 
               <br />
               would interfere with our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immigration</span> pol- 
               <br />
               icy. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">IVith</span> that view I entirely disagree. 
               <br />
               I have taken pains to ﬁnd out what ar— 
               <br />
               rangements were made with the older pro- 
               <br />
               vinces with regard to immigration, and I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that there has been no difﬁculty ex- 
               <br />
               penienced in bringing immigrants to this 
               <br />
               country and locating them wherever the 
               <br />
               government thought best. Is it likely that 
               <br />
               the new provinces, which will be deeply 
               <br />
               interested in attracting settlers, would not 
               <br />
               be as much alive to the necessity of get- 
               <br />
               ting in population as possibly can be the 
               <br />
               Dominion government? It seems to Ine 
               <br />
               that the provinces could administer their 
               <br />
               own public lands better than we can and 
               <br />
               would be more interested in securing a good 
               <br />
               class of settlers. I have had occasion to 
               <br />
               speak several times with reference to the 
               <br />
               immigration into Canada, and the fault <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I,</span> 
               <br />
               have found iis not that we are getting too 
               <br />
               many immigrants, but too many of an in— 
               <br />
               ferior class. Only the other day, the On- 
               <br />
               tario inspector of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘asylums</span> said that in the 
               <br />
               Brockville Lunatic Asylum, out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">six,</span> 
               <br />
               hundred lunatics, sixty were immigrants, 
               <br />
               or ten per cent of the whole, which is en- 
               <br />
               tirely out of proportion to the number of 
               <br />
               immigrants located in that section of the 
               <br />
               country. It is not necessary for me to go 
               <br />
               into the details of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span> amounts that have 
               <br />
               been realized by the Dominion government 
               <br />
               from time to time on the sale of public. 
               <br />
               lands, but I will content myself with saying 
               <br />
               that I am entirely opposed to the policy of 
               <br />
               the Dominion keeping these lands. I think 
               <br />
               it would be better to at once hand them 
               <br />
               over to the provinces and let the provinces 
               <br />
               administer them as they see ﬁt. Let me 
               <br />
               give here the ﬁgures showing what we have 
               <br />
               received from the sale of lands, and l take

               <br />

               from 1891 to 1900 there was again an ex- 
               <br />
               cess of expenditure amounting to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$184,-</span>

               <br />
               there was an excess of expenditure over re- 
               <br />
               ceipts of $11,733.49. Taking the whole per- 
               <br />
               iod from 1870 up to date, therefore, the 
               <br />
               administration of lands in the Northwest 
               <br />
               has cost this Dominion $687,055.25 in excess

               <br />
               total of $1,017,005.25 of deﬁcit. I fail to 
               <br />
               see how the government arrived at the 
               <br />
               amount they could give as a payment for 
               <br />
               these lands. They claim that there are 
               <br />
               twenty-ﬁve millions of acres of land to 
               <br />
               each province, which are worth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$37,500,000,</span> 
               <br />
               and on which of course they pay interest 
               <br />
               from time to time until it reaches a cer- 
               <br />
               tain amount. I do not see why the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment took it into their heads to keep 
               <br />
               these lands when it costs more t'o adminis- 
               <br />
               ter them than we are getting out of them. 
               <br />
               I .hope that the government will reconsider 
               <br />
               this question, but I can quite understand 
               <br />
               why the hon. member for Edmonton (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver) should have declared that he was 
               <br />
               perfectly willing to accept this arrangement 
               <br />
               provided the government kept the lands for 
               <br />
               the settlers. We can quite understand that 
               <br />
               position. The province gets the beneﬁt of 
               <br />
               the lands inasmuch as it gets the people 
               <br />
               who settle on them, and it gets the money 
               <br />
               besides, While we are giving away our 
               <br />
               lands from time to time. but continuing for 
               <br />
               all time to pay that subsidy. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There is another point. The right hon. 
               <br />
               the First Minister based his whole argument 
               <br />
               for submitting this legislation to the House, 
               <br />
               especially clause 16 dealing with separate 
               <br />
               schools, on constitutional grounds. If l 
               <br />
               understood him rightly, he claimed that he 
               <br />
               had to do this because the constitution de- 
               <br />
               manded it. That is not the way, Sir, that I 
               <br />
               understand the constitution, and I do not 
               <br />
               think that is the way this House under— 
               <br />
               stands it. Not only that but I think he used 
               <br />
               synonymously the names ‘province’ and 
               <br />
               ‘territory.’ He used the words ‘province’ 
               <br />
               and ‘territory’ as if they were synonyms. 
               <br />
               l can quite understand that if these had 
               <br />
               been provinces it might have been that we 
               <br />
               would have had to give these rights but as 
               <br />
               they are territories I think it is quite differ- 
               <br />
               ent. We have been trying for a good while 
               <br />
               to induce Newfoundland to come into the 
               <br />
               Dominion. We have been anxious at times 
               <br />
               for this and I think we would be glad at 
               <br />
               any time to have her come in because that 
               <br />
               would round off the Dominion, and it is a 
               <br />
               province which we very much desire to have. 
               <br />
               If it had been a territory we would not have 
               <br />
               had to ask their consent; we would simply 
               <br />
               have brought them in under the constitution. 
               <br />
               That is what we are doing, as I understand, 
               <br />
               with the provinces in the west. We are not 
               <br />
               obliged to ask their consent to bring them 
               <br />
               in; we simply pass an Act and they come 
               <br />
               in of necessity and we give them such terms
