               venture to submit that they cannot have 
               <br />

               council of the Territories by the words I

               have just quoted: ‘The Lieutenant Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor, by and with the consent of the coun— 
               <br />
               cil or assembly, may make all necessary 
               <br />
               ordinances with respect to education.’ But 
               <br />
               if you take the view of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice. you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">absolutely</span> take out of the

               hands of the council the legislative power 
               <br />
               with regard to the character of the schools, 
               <br />
               and you would have absolute self—govern- 
               <br />
               ment, in respect of the character, the re- 
               <br />
               gulation. the superintendence and the con- 
               <br />
               trol of the schools, conferred upon the ma- 
               <br />
               jority in each district. That, I submit, is 
               <br />
               not the meaning of the words ‘may estab- 
               <br />
               lish such schools therein as they see ﬁt.’ 
               <br />
               Those words are always subject to the con—

               trolling power of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               Legislature with regard to education. To 
               <br />
               give them any other meaning would ab-

               <br />

               <br />
               derstand what my hon. friend the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice meant by saying that the Act 
               <br />

               <br />
               nance. Let us understand the situation. 
               <br />
               Under the Act of 1875, you might establish 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> dual system of schools, if you saw fit. 
               <br />
               but you were not obliged to do so. That 
               <br />
               is the distinction. There was the power 
               <br />
               but no obligation. The Act of 1875 did not 
               <br />
               mean that the majority of ratepayers of the 
               <br />
               Northwest in any particular district could 
               <br />
               make those ordinances with regard to edu- 
               <br />
               cation, the power to make which had al- 
               <br />
               ready been conferred on the Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor, acting by and with the advice 
               <br />
               of the council or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assembly.</span> Yet the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> 
               <br />
               reverse is the construction to which we 
               <br />
               would be driven by the argument of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend this afternoon. ‘May establish 
               <br />
               such schools therein as they may think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁt.’</span> 
               <br />
               But those schools must be established sub- 
               <br />
               ject to the controlling power of the council 
               <br />
               or assembly. Therefore it does not seem 
               <br />
               to me that-this new and very ingenious 
               <br />
               point, suggested for the first time tO-day 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice, is consistent 
               <br />
               with a reasonable interpretation of the 
               <br />
               statute. The Lieutenant Governor in 
               <br />
               Council makes ordinances regarding educa— 
               <br />
               tion, and he must give power to the ma- 
               <br />
               jority to establish such schools as they 
               <br />
               think ﬁt, but not schools of such character 
               <br />
               as they think ﬁt or subject to such regul— 
               <br />
               ations as they think ﬁt. or subject to such 
               <br />
               superintendence or control or inspection as 
               <br />
               they think ﬁt, because with regard to all 
               <br />
               these matters the power has been conferred. 
               <br />
               not upon the majority in each district, but 
               <br />
               upon the Lieutenant Governor, by and with
