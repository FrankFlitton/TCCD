               A province may have an absolutely free

               and non-sectarian system of schools when 
               <br />

               tem to a denominational system, but, that 
               <br />
               being once done, it can never change back 
               <br />
               again without violating the constitution and 
               <br />
               prejudicially <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁecting,</span> as it is said, the

               rian system of education when it enters the

               can never be altered under our constitu— 
               <br />
               tion. I think it may be assumed then, in 
               <br />
               dealing with education, that we have a quali- 
               <br />
               ﬁed power, not, however, inconsistent with 
               <br />
               or contrary to the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. We have a pregnant illustration of 
               <br />
               this in the case of Manitoba. The Act of 
               <br />
               1870, which admitted that territory as a 
               <br />
               province into the Dominion of Canada, in 
               <br />
               respect of education, in a material and im- 
               <br />
               portant sense varied the conditions and 
               <br />
               principles of one subsection of section 93 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act by incor- 
               <br />
               porating therein the words, ‘or practice.’ 
               <br />
               These words have an important signiﬁca- 
               <br />
               tion taken in connection with the history 
               <br />
               and particularly the constitutional history re- 
               <br />
               specting the province of Manitoba. These 
               <br />
               words are important considered in the light 
               <br />
               of the tWo cases, namely, the city <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Winni- 
               <br />
               peg vs. Barrett, in 189], and Brophy vs. 
               <br />
               the Attorney General of Manitoba in 18.94. 
               <br />
               These two cases really comprise the consti- 
               <br />
               tutional history of the struggle which went 
               <br />
               on with all its irritation, all its disturbing 
               <br />
               aspects and phrases and uncomfortable con- 
               <br />
               ditions during these years in the history of 
               <br />
               our Dominion. The system of education in 
               <br />
               1870 in Manitoba was a purely denomina- 
               <br />
               tional or church system and the schools were 
               <br />
               maintained wholly by voluntary contribu- 
               <br />
               tions made up from the fees of the parents 
               <br />
               of the children and of the respective 
               <br />
               churches interested in these schools. None 
               <br />
               of these schools was established by law at 
               <br />

               Manitoba was brought in, which shows to 
               <br />
               my mind the jealous anxiety of this parlia-

               ment to preserve and perpetuate the system 
               <br />

               <br />
               try not only by law but by practice. The 
               <br />
               debates, such as we have of that period, 
               <br />
               show that this school question was wholly 
               <br />
               overshadowed by other considerations of 
               <br />
               more importance, but, Sir, the school ques- 
               <br />
               tion provoked little or no discussion, little 
               <br />
               or no opposition from any quarter or from 
               <br />
               either side of the House. While this par- 
               <br />
               liament in the exercise of its right was 
               <br />
               perpetuating to the people of Manitoba the 
               <br />
               denominational system of schools which they 
               <br />
               had when they came into the union, not a 
               <br />
               voice was raised against the adoption of that 
               <br />
               principle then. no dissent. no objection what- 
               <br />
               ever. and I apprehend that every man who 
               <br />
               participated in that debate and who partici- 
               <br />
               pated in the formation of that province be- 
               <br />
               lieved that he was carrying out the spirit 
               <br />
               and true intention of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. In 1867, the Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               of the province of. Ontario, then Upper Can- 
               <br />
               ada, had a system of separate schools 
               <br />
               and the Protestants of Lower Canadaii 
               <br />
               at the time of confederation, insisted 
               <br />
               upon having the same principle incorporated 
               <br />
               into the compact of confederation. Some 
               <br />
               persons associate the term ‘separate schools’ 
               <br />
               with the idea of Roman Catholic schools. 
               <br />
               It is a mistake, Sir, to so confound the 
               <br />
               notion of. separate schools with the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics of this country. Looking at the 
               <br />
               institution of separate schools from the point 
               <br />
               of view of the British North America Act it 
               <br />
               will be seen that they are distinctly and em- 
               <br />
               phatically Protestant schools because it was 
               <br />
               by the persistence of the Protestants and 
               <br />
               the representation of the Protestant minority 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec that the very prin-

               <br />

               schools was incorporated in the Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation Act. This is no reproach, Sir, to 
               <br />
               the Protestants and it comes as no shock 
               <br />
               to me as one of that persuasion to know 
               <br />
               that it is the case. for I regard it as 
               <br />
               an expression of a sentiment indicative of 
               <br />
               liberality, tolerance and respect for the re- 
               <br />
               ligious convictions of those who cannot
