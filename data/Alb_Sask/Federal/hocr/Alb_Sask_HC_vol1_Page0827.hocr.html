               that would trammel the action of those

               two great provinces ? Our friends opposite, 
               <br />
               notably the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Labelle</span> (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bourassa) and the hon. the Solicitor General 
               <br />
               (Mr. Lemieux) evinced a very sudden liking 
               <br />
               for the British system of education. That: 
               <br />
               was surely a strange position, for the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman is usually anti-imperialist in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every</span> respect. Whenever we wish to draw 
               <br />
               the ties closer, the hon. member for Labelle 
               <br />
               refuses, and says, we do not wish to come 
               <br />
               any closer. But .he develops suddenly a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> great liking for British institutions, 
               <br />
               and on a matter that is very poorly chosen, 
               <br />
               and which, of all others, has led to more 
               <br />
               friction and is at present causing more 
               <br />
               heartburnings than have been experienced 
               <br />
               in the British Islands in a generation. And 
               <br />
               yet the hon. member for Labelle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tells</span> us 
               <br />
               that the British system is what he would 
               <br />
               imitate. I have always looked upon the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Labelle as the Henry La- 
               <br />
               bouchere of this House. When anything 
               <br />
               imperial is proposed in the British House, 
               <br />
               Mr. Labouchere opposes it ; and I have al— 
               <br />
               ways looked upon the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Labelle as the counterpart in this House 
               <br />
               of Mr. Labouchere in the British House, 
               <br />
               because he is always opposed to anything 
               <br />
               imperial. On the educational question, Mr. 
               <br />
               Labouchere has a record. I had the pleasure 
               <br />
               of sitting in the British House when a ﬁerce 
               <br />
               and acrimonious debate took place on this 
               <br />
               very question, in which Mr. Labouchere 
               <br />
               made light of the very system that the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Labelle admires. Lord 
               <br />
               Hugh Cecil had held the attention of the 
               <br />
               House while he argued that religious in- 
               <br />

               all of which come pretty close. If that is

               well; it is pleasing; but what I submit

               to this House, and what this country knows, 
               <br />
               is that it is impracticable. The First Min-
