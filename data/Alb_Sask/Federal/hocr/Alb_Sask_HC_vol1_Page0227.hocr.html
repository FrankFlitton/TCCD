               didate was an Irish Canadian without a 
               <br />
               drop of French blood in his veins. The Con—

               <br />
               was the result ? The French Canadian who

               Mr. Speaker, may I be allowed to speak 
               <br />
               of a little experience I have had in this 
               <br />
               1elation? It shows the working of the 
               <br />
               school laws in my province. There is a 
               <br />
               small country newspaper in the county of 
               <br />
               Quebec which has declared that the result 
               <br />
               of the separate school law in Quebec was 
               <br />
               to drive the Protestants out of the province. 
               <br />
               I refer to the Huntingdon " Gleaner.’ And 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
               <br />
               has re-echoed that declaration. I passed most 
               <br />
               of my life—and my happiest days, because 
               <br />
               they were before I entered public life—- 
               <br />
               in a small village on the borders of the 
               <br />
               Ottawa river forming one municipality of 
               <br />
               eight hundred souls. This village was separ- 
               <br />
               ated municipally and for school purposes 
               <br />
               from the parish in which it was situated 
               <br />
               and which also contained some eight hun- 
               <br />
               dred souls. in these two municipalities there 
               <br />
               were three English-speaking Protestant 
               <br />
               families. The father of one family was the

               head of a large lumbering ﬁrm and the 
               <br />
               fathers of the other two families were the 
               <br />
               other’s clerks. These three families lived 
               <br />
               in the village. They organized a separate 
               <br />
               school under the law. Then the lumbering 
               <br />
               company bought immense properties in the 
               <br />
               parish. 'Under our ‘p’riest-administered <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’;“</span> 
               <br />
               law, the Protestant ratepayers—as they 
               <br />
               were entitled to do by law—annexed this 
               <br />
               property to the village for school purposes, 
               <br />
               thus depriving the Catholic ratepayers of 
               <br />
               the parish of all the receipts of their schools 
               <br />
               on account of that land. But there was not 
               <br />
               a word of dispute. There came a time when 
               <br />
               the separate school was not carried on 
               <br />
               according to law, because, in our province 
               <br />
               as in others, it requires a certain school 
               <br />
               attendance to make a school under the law. 
               <br />
               There came a time when all the taxes paid 
               <br />
               by the Protestants went to support a school 
               <br />
               where there were only ﬁve or six children, 
               <br />
               which is only half or one—third of the num- 
               <br />
               ber required under the law. One of the 
               <br />
               Catholic ratepayers suggested : ‘ Why don’t 
               <br />
               we abolish the separate school and get all 
               <br />
               that money ‘2’ I put my foot upon the pro- 
               <br />
               position at once. I said: ‘ My friend, if you 
               <br />
               think as I do and as, I believe, the people of 
               <br />
               this parish and of this village do, you will 
               <br />
               never ask a man, rich or poor, to contribute 
               <br />
               a cent to the maintenance of a school system 
               <br />
               in which he does not believe.’ And the whole 
               <br />
               population was with me. That whole 
               <br />
               ‘priest-ridden population ’—and they were 
               <br />
               poor farmers—preferred to pay twice as 
               <br />
               much as they otherwise would rather than 
               <br />
               ask these Protestant ratepayers to contri- 
               <br />
               bute, as they were legally bound to do, to 
               <br />

               <br />
