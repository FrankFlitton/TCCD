               There is no difference in the item, grant

               for government. No one will contend that

               that is a better grant than the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are drawing. There is no substantial 
               <br />
               difference in the per capita subsidy. There 
               <br />
               is just one province, Nova Scotia, up to the

               souls. Their population now is 460,000. 
               <br />
               But, except in that case there is no differ- 
               <br />
               ence at the present moment in the per capita

               arrangement made for these provinces and 
               <br />
               the arrangement at present in existence with 
               <br />
               other provinces. There is no difference in 
               <br />
               the debt account ;——no other suggestion

               would be listened to with regard to the debt.

               therefore, the administration of lands in
