               <br />
               express my deep gratitude to the House 
               <br />
               that I have the opportunity of taking part 
               <br />
               in such an important discussion as the one 
               <br />
               now going on. We must all feel gratiﬁed 
               <br />
               that this debate has been carried on in such 
               <br />
               a manner that the citizens of Canada must 
               <br />
               feel proud of this parliament. In fact. we 
               <br />
               have not heard throughout the whole debate 
               <br />
               any expression which could hurt the feelings 
               <br />
               of any member of this House. The debate 
               <br />
               has been carried on in a digniﬁed way, and 
               <br />
               I will try, in the few remarks which I intend 
               <br />
               to offer, to follow the example set by those 
               <br />
               who have preceded me. The ﬁrst ques- 
               <br />
               tion which we have to consider is whether 
               <br />
               we should create new provinces in the 
               <br />
               Northwest, and, if so, what constitution we 
               <br />
               should give to those provinces. The unani- 
               <br />
               mous feeling in this House is in favour of 
               <br />
               granting provincial autonomy to the North- 
               <br />
               west. It has been suggested that we should 
               <br />
               have only one province instead of two; 
               <br />
               but generally the opinion of the members 
               <br />
               is strongly in favour of the creation of two 
               <br />
               provinces. Now, what constitution should 
               <br />
               we give to those provinces ? On that 
               <br />
               question there has been some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> of 
               <br />
               opinion, especially with regard to the school 
               <br />
               question, and I will try to give the reasons 
               <br />
               why I think the'educational clauses of the 
               <br />
               Bill, as amended should be supported by the 
               <br />

               west Territories. I shall prove this by re- 
               <br />
               ferring to what occurred in 1869 and 1870, 
               <br />
               and that consequently the parliament of 
               <br />

               <br />
               schools to the new provinces. I need not 
               <br />
               refer to the treaties which were passed be- 
               <br />
               tween England and France in 1763, because 
               <br />
               those treaties cannot be called upon to estab- 
               <br />
               lish any rights or privileges with regard to 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. We know very 
               <br />
               well that Rupert’s Land or the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories were under the sovereignty of 
               <br />
               England for more than two centuries. We 
               <br />
               know very well that.they were under the 
               <br />
               laws and constitution of England from 1670 
               <br />
               to 1870, when they were brought under the 
               <br />
               control of the Canadian government. We 
               <br />
               well recollect that in 1869 or 1870 there was 
               <br />
               a disturbance in the Northwest. The Cana- 
               <br />
               dian government, without having the neces- 
               <br />
               sary authority, sent up some persons to 
               <br />
               that country to take possession of it. At 
               <br />
               that time there was no law which had been 
               <br />
               passed by the British parliament, there was 
               <br />
               no proclamation issued by the British par- 
               <br />
               liament, handing this territory over to the 
               <br />
               Canadian government. However, the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian government took upon itself to send 
               <br />
               people up there to exercise the sovereign 
               <br />
               power. An agitation and disturbance en- 
               <br />
               sued, and a very serious agitation it was in- 
               <br />
               deed. The imperial government then tried 
               <br />
               by all means to adjust the differences of 
               <br />
               opinion which existed at that time between 
               <br />
               the settlers of the west and the Canadian 
               <br />
               government. Lord Granville, then Colonial 
               <br />
               Secretary, sent a despatch to Sir John 
               <br />
               Young, then Governor General of Canada, 
               <br />
               in 1869, and Sir John Young wrote to Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor Mc’l‘avish, of the Territories, a letter
