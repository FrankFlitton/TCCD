               ernment and voice his opposition to that 
               <br />
               measure. Is that a good Liberal principle 
               <br />
               to—day? Is it, or is it not ? That is the 
               <br />
               only raison d’être that the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior had. He has not abjured his prin- 
               <br />
               ciples, he keeps them still. He declares that 
               <br />
               it is with reluctance that he will vote for 
               <br />
               the measure. He says, “ section 1 is an in- 
               <br />
               terference, and he wishes it were not there ; 
               <br />
               but on one consideration he will vote for 
               <br />
               that interference. Why ? Because it is sup- 
               <br />
               plemented by a subsection which declares 
               <br />
               that money shall be put behind the inter- 
               <br />
               ference to make it effective. There is con-

               sistency for you. He. hates the plague, he 
               <br />
               says it destroys the family, it decimates 
               <br />
               society, but if only you support it by a 
               <br />
               money vote by which you can scatter the 
               <br />
               plague far and wide, then he welcomes it. 
               <br />
               That is the argument, that is the reason— 
               <br />
               ing of the Minister of the Interior, if he 
               <br />
               has any left at all. He declares that his

               <br />
               way repudiates them by his vote. The man

               <br />
               with the free life of two great provinces in 
               <br />
               the west, enduring and irrevocable. Time

               <br />
               as strong as that on so grave an

               <br />
               does he do it ? Why? I am not going to 
               <br />
               search for any reasons at all, I am going to 
               <br />
               give the reason that he gives—the King’s 
               <br />
               government must go on. The Finance Min-

               ister says, the King’s government must go 
               <br />
               on. Do they not mean in their heart of 
               <br />
               hearts that the Liberal government must 
               <br />
               go on ? It is the Liberal government which

               never to hear such an argument again. If

               <br />
               going to enact. But there are men on the 
               <br />
               street and men on the street. I can con- 
               <br />
               ceive of a manon the street who cultivates 
               <br />
               a very valuable farm out in Carleton county. 
               <br />

               let us discuss what is the best method of 
               <br />
               cultivating that farm. What does the man 
               <br />
               on the street say to me ? The ﬁrst thing 
               <br />
               he says is, Sir, don’t you think I had better 
               <br />
               know ﬁrst how the title reads ? If the title 
               <br />
               in in me, I wil take your advice, but I will 
               <br />
               not take your domination ; if the title is in 
               <br />
               you, I may give you advice, but I will not 
               <br />
               try to dominate you. My ﬁrst duty is to as- 
               <br />
               certain the title of the property. I will dis-

               What right has the Minister of Finance to
