               This is a statement over the signature of 
               <br />
               the premier of Ontario that the government 
               <br />
               of Ontario had deposited with the govern- 
               <br />
               ment at Ottawa $2,848,000, and they so 
               <br />
               stated in their ﬁnancial statement to the 
               <br />
               people of Ontario at that time. Thus they 
               <br />
               were enabled, by the placing of that amount 
               <br />
               to the credit of Ontario, held by the Do- 
               <br />
               minion government in trust, to put before 
               <br />
               the electors of Ontario the statement that 
               <br />
               they had a surplus of money when the fact 
               <br />
               is they had no surplus. And then it was 
               <br />
               the great question of debate in the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture of Ontario for many years, and was a 
               <br />
               great question before the electors in that 
               <br />
               province. I believe that the'Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance, and particularly the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, should be very careful now when 
               <br />
               they are legisl-ating for the new provinces

               to remove altogether the word ‘interest,’

               and make it so plain that the people of west—

               the courts or by any government, that the

               province of Alberta was entitled to call 
               <br />
               upon this capital sum the province would 
               <br />
               not only be entitled possibly to call upon 
               <br />
               that capital sum but would be entitled to

               capitalize the annual payment at the current 
               <br />
               rate of interest. I have made a calculation. 
               <br />
               Suppose Alberta established the fact that

               Canada—and wherever there is interest there

               must of necessity be principal—they would 
               <br />
               certainly have just as much right to capital- 
               <br />
               ize that at 3 per cent as at 5 per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent‘if</span>

               the English language can possibly make it

               clear beyond a doubt I would say decidedly, 
               <br />
               make it clear. I do not want to rob those

               <br />
               to the exact sum they are entitled to get. 
               <br />
               The illustration I have given of what might 
               <br />
               be the demand of the province of Alberta 
               <br />
               is simply a repetition of a calculation made 
               <br />
               by the Hon. Mr. Ross, in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario. He contended that he had a right 
               <br />
               to capitalize his interest at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3%</span> per cent 
               <br />
               when money was worth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3}</span> per cent and 
               <br />
               showed a very much larger amount of cap- 
               <br />
               ital in the hands of the Dominion than he 
               <br />
               was actually entitled to in the ﬁrst instance, 
               <br />
               when in fact there was practically <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">110</span> 
               <br />
               capital. But in this instance we admit 
               <br />
               there is capital because there is interest and 
               <br />
               Where there is smoke there is generally ﬁre, 
               <br />
               according to the old saying: where there 
               <br />
               is interest we consider there must be capital, 
               <br />
               there must be something behind it, what I 
               <br />
               fear is the dangerous word -‘interest.’ I ap— 
               <br />
               prehend that even if we satisfy ourselves 
               <br />
               now, possibly ten or ﬁfteen years hence 
               <br />
               there may be men who will take a different 
               <br />
               view of that interest.

               <br />
               will refer to the debates in this House to 
               <br />
               ascertain its meaning. We must make it 
               <br />
               clear and if we have not done so let us do 
               <br />
               so. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But</span> since the hon. member frein Peel 
               <br />
               (Mr. Blain) has also read the letter which 
               <br />
               I addressed to the Hon. Mr. Ross, whether 
               <br />
               that letter was wise or unwise, right ol‘ 
               <br />
               wrong, it was based on the language of 
               <br />
               the statute as it then existed. That is 
               <br />
               not the same language as we have here, and 
               <br />
               therefore we do not get any assistance by 
               <br />
               importing into the discussion that letter 
               <br />
               giving an opinion, possibly an erroneous one, 
               <br />
               based on the statute as it then existed. The 
               <br />
               statute here is in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> terms and is 
               <br />
               designed for a diiïerent purpose. If my 
               <br />
               hon. friend (Mr. Henderson) ﬁnds, after 
               <br />
               he consults his legal friends, that this lan- 
               <br />
               guage fails to express the intention of the

               committee I have no desire to adhere to 
               <br />
               the words used.
