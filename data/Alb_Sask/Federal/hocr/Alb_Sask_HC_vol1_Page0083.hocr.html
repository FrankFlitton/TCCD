               will not gloss over the inconsistency he has

               shown or make more tenable the unstable

               <br />
               to contrast the position he took in 1895 
               <br />
               and 1896, when he was on this side of the

               speeches. And I would refer the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman to the words of the Hon. George 
               <br />

               <br />
               consistency that ought to be the ornament

               and the crown of the Prime Minister of a 
               <br />
               country of the importance of Canada. In 
               <br />
               1896 the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier) took a certain position in order to 
               <br />
               obtain power. And now, after his third re- 
               <br />
               turn, we have him laying down a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">policy;</span> 
               <br />
               which is the absolute negation of that which 
               <br />
               he contended for in 1896. Let him consider 
               <br />
               the words of Hon. George Brown: ‘If, Sir, 
               <br />
               a public man can avow certain principles, 
               <br />
               agitate those principles and seek to over- 
               <br />
               throw the government of the day to estab- 
               <br />
               lish those principles, and, when he obtains 
               <br />
               power laughs at his professions and casts 
               <br />
               his principles to the winds, he is aiming a 
               <br />
               blow at public morality.’

               <br />
               the Bill introduced by the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               on the 2151: of February, in view of the 
               <br />
               large number of inquiries that are being 
               <br />
               made from time to time concerning it, and 
               <br />
               in view of the rumours that are in circula-

               tion, I have not been in a position, up to 
               <br />
               this evening, to give a deﬁnite answer to 
               <br />
               those who have asked me whether the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment proposed to carry the Bill through 
               <br />
               the House as it has been introduced or not. 
               <br />
               So, I wish to compliment the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for being so frank 
               <br />
               as he was this evening, for he has stated 
               <br />
               that when he framed this Bill he framed 
               <br />
               it on the line of the legislation already at- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ritories. That being true, I am in a posi-

               tion to state exactly what the government 
               <br />
               propose to do in the matter of this legisla- 
               <br />
               tion. The Minister of Justice stated that 
               <br />
               there could be no peace except it were based 
               <br />
               on justice. There are a large number of 
               <br />
               people in this country who do not believe 
               <br />

               <br />
               to observe, the tone of the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman's</span>

               speech <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight.</span> He has charged hon. mem-

               <br />
               in the ﬁrst session of 1896. Had he been, 
               <br />
               how would he have found his friends oc-

               ing to get it into committee to have it 
               <br />
               considered on its merits. But hon. gentle-

               men opposite then on this side, showed 
               <br />
               no willingness to have this carried om. 
               <br />
               They even remained for one hundred and 
               <br />
               twenty-nine hours without rest, keeping this

               the other hand some condemned it be—

               cause it did not go far enough. Still others

               condemned the ﬁnancial arrangements as

               <br />
               were fanning the ﬂames of prejudice, and 
               <br />
               it was through the existence of these pre-

               <br />
               has expressed his opinion in regard to that 
               <br />
               legislation. They have carefully waited 
               <br />
               to see what the government would do in 
               <br />
               the matter—and rightly so. The leader 
               <br />
               of the government has told us that amend- 
               <br />
               ments {may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introduced.</span> But, thank 
               <br />
               goodness, the Minister of Justice, with his 
               <br />
               frankness has stated exactly the position 
               <br />
               the government is in. And, when the First 
               <br />
               Minister proceeds with the second reading 
               <br />
               of the Bill, I have no doubt that the same 
               <br />
               good judgment will be displayed and the 
               <br />
               same calm criticism given by the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion, whether they agree or disagree with 
               <br />
               the Bill. Whatever hon. members on this 
               <br />
               side may say will be in parliamentary 
               <br />
               form and will be the result of calm consi- 
               <br />
               deration and not of mere prejudice. The
