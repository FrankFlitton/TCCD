               time something of the same feeling that 
               <br />
               exists now, but that feeling was frank 
               <br />
               enough not to take refuge in legal quibbles. 
               <br />
               It was stated then, as it is now outside of 
               <br />
               this parliament, that there should be one 
               <br />
               rule of justice for the Catholics and another 
               <br />
               rule of justice for Protestants; that there 
               <br />
               should not be one law for both the Catho- 
               <br />
               lics and Protestants, but that the Catholics 
               <br />
               should have one law requiring them to re— 
               <br />
               spect the Protestant rights in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec. while in the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               the Catholics should rely upon the generosi- 
               <br />
               ty of the majority. Indeed, the Hon. A. T. 
               <br />
               Galt, then the accredited representative of 
               <br />
               the Protestant minority in Quebec, went to 
               <br />
               England to secure the adoption of clause 
               <br />
               93. Now, eminent legal men in this House, 
               <br />
               eminent jurists, have tried to make out a 
               <br />
               case that this clause 93 in the British North 
               <br />
               America Act should be cut in two, and that 
               <br />
               wherever a Protestant province outside of 
               <br />
               Ontario is concerned you should read only 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst paragraph of it, thereby giving an

               When the British North America Act Was

               presented to the British parliament, Lord 
               <br />
               Carnarvon was ISecretary of State for the 
               <br />
               Colonies and was responsible for the legis- 
               <br />
               lation as such, and Lord Carnarvon has 
               <br />
               given a deﬁnition of what were the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respective</span> powers of the federal and 
               <br />
               provincial authority. I respectfully beg the

               liberty of commending that opinion of Lord 
               <br />
               Carnarvon to the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               in this House. That hon. gentleman (Mr. R. 
               <br />
               L. Borden) has charged the government with 
               <br />
               trying to confuse the federal and the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial powers in this Bill, and throughout 
               <br />
               the country the press has stated that edu- 
               <br />
               cation belonged to the provinces, and that 
               <br />
               there was no interference of the federal 
               <br />
               parliament possible in educational matters, 
               <br />
               unless in Ontario and Quebec. It has been 
               <br />
               stated that the powers of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act are divided into three classes ; 
               <br />
               those that belong exclusively to the federal 
               <br />
               government in clause 91; those that be- 
               <br />
               long exclusively to the provinces in clause 
               <br />
               92 ; and those questions on which both 
               <br />
               the federal and provincial parliaments have 
               <br />
               concurrent jurisdiction. A clearer deﬁ-

               nition was given in the British parliament 
               <br />
               when the Bill was introduced there, and I

               suppose we will all accept the good British
