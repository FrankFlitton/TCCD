               territorial school system. The voting pro- 
               <br />
               blem as I see it is this: Vote with the 
               <br />
               government and in favour of the present 
               <br />
               school system in the Territories—or vote 
               <br />
               with the opposition, who do not propose to 
               <br />
               remove or interfere with these schools, but 
               <br />
               an opposition which when in power put 
               <br />
               themselves on record as in favour of sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools, controlled by the Catholic 
               <br />
               church in Manitoba; and went to wreck 
               <br />
               and ruin on this question, and who never 
               <br />
               have shown even a death bed repentance. 
               <br />
               Or if the member do not vote at all, he 
               <br />
               shows himself an arrant coward pandering 
               <br />
               to the ignorance or bigotry of a few fana-
