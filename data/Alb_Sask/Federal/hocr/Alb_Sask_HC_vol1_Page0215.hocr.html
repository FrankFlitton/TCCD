               'Before leaving this part of the case it may be 
               <br />
               well to notice the arguments urged by the re— 
               <br />
               spondent, that the construction which their 
               <br />
               lordships have put upon the 2nd and 3rd sub- 
               <br />
               sections of section 22 of the Manitoba. Act is 
               <br />
               inconsistent with the power conferred upon

               the legislature of the province to exclusively 
               <br />
               make laws in relation to education. The 
               <br />
               argument is fallacious. The power con- 
               <br />
               ferred is not absolute, but limited. It. is exer-

               <br />
               power of exclusive legislation. Their right to 
               <br />
               legislate is not indeed, properly speaking, ex-

               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'e</span> have here the opinion of Lord Wat- 
               <br />
               son that the federal parliament acted with- 
               <br />
               in its jurisdiction when it exempted Mani- 
               <br />
               toba from all the provisions of section 93, 
               <br />
               that is, when it claimed for Manitoba the 
               <br />
               rights under section 22 of the Manitoba Act 
               <br />
               as opposed to section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act which departed materially 
               <br />
               from it. Therefore we have here the dis— 
               <br />
               sent of Lord Watson from the opinion laid 
               <br />
               down by Mr. Haultain and the leader of 
               <br />
               the oppositionthat we must accept section 
               <br />
               93 without modiﬁcation as applicable to 
               <br />
               these provinces.

               But, Sir, I suppose that when the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories were admitted into cou- 
               <br />
               federation, the Canadian parliament meant 
               <br />
               what it said. I take also for granted that 
               <br />
               when the Imperial Order in Council was 
               <br />
               adopted, the imperial government knew 
               <br />
               what it did. Upon what terms were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> 
               <br />
               Territories admitted ? I will again read 
               <br />
               section 146 to show the point I want to 
               <br />
               make. That section says :
