               Now, Mr. Speaker, I pause here, and l 
               <br />
               want to :ask the hon. gentleman where is 
               <br />
               the badge of inferiority because they have

               separate schools ? I wish the hon. member

               for North Toronto were here, because I 
               <br />
               wanted to ask him what he had in his mind 
               <br />
               when he made that statement. The only 
               <br />
               two provinces in which we have separate 
               <br />
               schools are Ontario and Quebec, and surely 
               <br />
               he would not be so ungrateful as to tax 
               <br />
               Ontario with inferiority, because he owes 
               <br />
               too much to Ontario, the province which has 
               <br />
               launched again on the political sea his

               his mind ? He is a gentleman who chal-

               lenges the world with the statement that he 
               <br />

               Catholics or the French, but he is one of 
               <br />
               those able actors who, when you look at 
               <br />
               them as they speak, convey one impression

               get another and an entirely different im-

               of a man With that ability ? I think he had 
               <br />
               in his mind, if we can judge by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">utter</span>

               gentleman (Mr. Foster) told us that in 1896 
               <br />
               he was the victim of his patriotism and of

               invite him and his friends to come down 
               <br />
               to the province of Quebec, and I can tell 
               <br />
               them that in this year of grace 1905 they 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd in this same hierarchy and amongst 
               <br />
               these same priests, that very devotion which 
               <br />
               existed 200 years ago, and which to-day 
               <br />
               is displayed in making the people of Que- 
               <br />
               bec loyal and patriotic citizens of Canada.

               <br />
               ligious beliefs, the clergy of the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec are men of peace ; they may not 
               <br />
               teach us to handle arms; they may not 
               <br />
               teach 11s how to promenade throughout the 
               <br />
               country preaching rebellion and resistance 
               <br />
