               the attention ot“ the First Minister to the

               my hon. friend from Labelle and my hon.

               will assist me a great deal in making my 
               <br />
               remarks short. I was agreeably surprised 
               <br />
               to see in the ranks of the majority coming 
               <br />
               from the province of Quebec that there 
               <br />
               were some gentlemen with sufﬁcient in- 
               <br />
               dependence to express the opinion which 
               <br />
               they expressed yesterday. It is needless 
               <br />
               for me to say that I think the position 
               <br />
               1 occupy on this question is a sound one. 
               <br />
               When I saw my hon. friends from Labelle 
               <br />
               and Montmagny speaking in the same sense, 
               <br />
               I thought there was still hopé that we might 
               <br />
               be able to convince, if not the government 
               <br />
               to—day, at least the electors later on, that 
               <br />
               the position we have taken is the right one. 
               <br />
               The remarks made by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Labelle must have gone home, it‘ we may 
               <br />
               judge by the reply of my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Solicitor General (Mr. Lemieux) who. in 
               <br />
               a very eloquent harangue, endeavoured to 
               <br />
               draw a herring across the trail, and to weak- 
               <br />
               en the effect of the remarks of ‘my hon. 
               <br />
               friends from Labelle and Montmagny. The 
               <br />
               Solicitor General, who isavery eloquent and 
               <br />
               able man, said certain things which, when 
               <br />
               he comes to think them over, will consider- 
               <br />
               ably dampen his enthusiasm. In speaking 
               <br />
               of the position which the French Canadian 
               <br />
               race has reached in this country, he said 
               <br />
               that what struck him the most was the high 
               <br />
               positions in the state to which some of our 
               <br />
               French Canadians have attained. Naturally 
               <br />
               he mentioned my right hon. friend the pre- 
               <br />
               mier of Canada, he mentioned the Chief. 
               <br />
               Justice of -the Supreme Court, he mentioned 
               <br />
               the lieutenant governor of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories, the lieutenant governor of 
               <br />
               British Columbia. and the chief justice of 
               <br />
               the Court of Appeal for the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. I do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:know</span> whether he 
               <br />
               should have mentioned these things. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend is a reader, and if he has read 
               <br />
               carefully the reports of Lord Durham he 
               <br />
               may conclude that it would have been bet- 
               <br />
               ter not to mention these things. I do not 
               <br />
               think that we can correctly judge of the posi— 
               <br />
               tion of a race by noticing some of the high 
               <br />
               positions which certain of its members may 
               <br />
