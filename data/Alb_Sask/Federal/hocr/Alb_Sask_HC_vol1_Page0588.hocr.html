               of that dignitary by the appointment of a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative</span> in Canada in order to see that

               the system of interference in politics which

               that is so. and everybody knows that the 
               <br />
               reason why Quebec spoke in 1896 as she 
               <br />
               did and as she has spoken since is because 
               <br />
               the great heart of the French people rose 
               <br />
               above all those limitations which had bound 
               <br />
               them and because the people of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province</span> 
               <br />
               recognized that in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> leader they had 
               <br />
               a man who was ever ready to stand for 
               <br />
               equal rights for all and special privileges 
               <br />
               for none. As he stood for the rights of 
               <br />
               the provinces in 1896 so he stands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day</span> 
               <br />
               for the constitutional rights of minorities 
               <br />
               and the recognition of the principles which

               the confederation compact involves and 
               <br />
               which were embodied in the constitution. 
               <br />
               But, cries such as we have heard here to— 
               <br />

               <br />
               against the canvass which was being made 
               <br />
               on behalf of the Conservative party amongst 
               <br />

               will not vote for a Frenchman and a Roman

               Canada will recognize as in days that have
