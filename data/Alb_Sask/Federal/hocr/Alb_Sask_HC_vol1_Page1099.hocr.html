               Brockville (Mr. Derbyshire) came to the res-

               would be supported by the people at the next 
               <br />
               election. What have we descended to ? An 
               <br />
               important Bill, a Bill that is fastening a 
               <br />
               system of schools for all time upon millions 
               <br />
               of people who are not yet in the Territories; 
               <br />
               such a Bill is to be driven through the 
               <br />
               House by the impassioned appeals of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister, by the threats of the Fin- 
               <br />
               ance Minister and by the persuasive elo- 
               <br />
               quence of my hon. friend from Brockville 
               <br />
               who tries to stiffen the backs of gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite by wagering dollars on the result 
               <br />
               of the next election. Shades of George 
               <br />
               Brown ; if Edward Blake or Alexander Mac- 
               <br />
               kenzie came into this House of Commons, 
               <br />
               how they would sigh for these degenerate 
               <br />
               days when Liberal leaders can make such 
               <br />
               appeals for the support of a great constitu- 
               <br />
               tional measure. And if this were notenough, 
               <br />
               my benevolent friend the Minister of Cus- 
               <br />
               toms rises and he cries for, peace, perfect 
               <br />
               peace. There was no argument in his speech 
               <br />
               which all through was pervaded with the 
               <br />
               one sentence : brethren there should be per- 
               <br />
               fect peace, and he ended by saying that he 
               <br />
               loved the premier and by the love he bore 
               <br />
               him' he could not possibly oppose his will. 
               <br />
               Is that the serious way in which important 
               <br />
               legislation should be treated. The Minister 
               <br />
               of Customs excelled himself that night in 
               <br />
               his eulogy of the Prime Minister; he had 
               <br />
               only to go one better to equal the member 
               <br />
               for Centre York (Mr. Campbell) who in a 
               <br />
               spontaneous outburst of enthusiasm de- 
               <br />
               clared that Sir Wilfrid Laurier was the 
               <br />
               greatest man that ever lived. Napoleon 
               <br />
               may have been a great general, but he was 
               <br />
               nothing to Laurier; Vanderbilt may have 
               <br />
               been a Napoleon of ﬁnance, but he wasnot 
               <br />
               in it with Laurier. Hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               seem to be inoculated with the idea that 
               <br />
               whenever they address parliament they must 
               <br />
               raise a paen of idol worship to the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister. I had not the honour of being 
               <br />
               in the House when Sir John A. Macdonald 
               <br />
               was Prime Minister. but I have read a great 
               <br />
               many of the speeches delivered then, and it 
               <br />

               <br />

               of perfect peace be will vote for the govern-

               <br />
               the Minister of Agriculture who gave to us 
               <br />
               bigots from Ontario a lesson <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in‘</span> peace and

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I was rather surprised that the Post- 
               <br />
               master General did not take up the cudgels 
               <br />
               as an Ontario representative, and deal the

               from North Ontario did it to his heart’s 
               <br />
               content. I do not wonder that these hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen have no feeling of kindness to- 
               <br />
               wards the city of Toronto, in which they al- 
               <br />
               ways thought they had such magniﬁcent 
               <br />
               voting chances, where in 1896 Mr. Lount 
               <br />
               was elected by a handsome majority in the 
               <br />
               same riding which Mr. Bertram a year 
               <br />
               or two afterwards succeeded in carrying by 
               <br />
               a considerable majority. The fact of the 
               <br />
               matter is that the Ontario representation 
               <br />
               in this cabinet is so weak and this policy 
               <br />
               of the government is so weak that they 
               <br />
               dare not make any attempt to carry a 
               <br />
               Toronto constituency. But my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the Minister of Customs says : Peace, per- 
               <br />
               fect peace. Does the hon. gentleman believe 
               <br />
               that majorities have no rights in this coun— 
               <br />
               try—that we are always to yield to the 
               <br />
               will of the minority ? Does he not know 
               <br />
               that the old rule must prevail, that the 
               <br />
               majority should rule ? How does he expect 
               <br />
               that there is going to be peace in this coun- 
               <br />
               try if, when the majority have the law 
               <br />
               and the constitution behind them, they are 
               <br />
               expected to pander to the wishes of some 
               <br />
               politicians who want to retain their posi- 
               <br />
               tions as Cabinet ministers, with the accom- 
               <br />
               panying salaries, and in return are to have 
               <br />
               the support of a lot of hon. gentlemen who 
               <br />
               are to seek seclusion in a few years in fat 
               <br />
               government oﬂices ? I need not go into 
               <br />
               the question of who are to be rewarded.
