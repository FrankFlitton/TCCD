               under the necessity of the case, under our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system‘of</span> confederation, necessarily has a 
               <br />
               greater interest in securing the establish—

               ment of a settler upon land in the North— 
               <br />
               west than the provincial government has. 
               <br />
               As I understand it the Dominion revenue is 
               <br />
               principally derived from customs and ex- 
               <br />
               cise, and each individual in the country con- 
               <br />
               tributes on an average about $$ or $40 per 
               <br />
               year for a family of ﬁve. I do not know 
               <br />
               that these ﬁgures are exactly correct but 
               <br />
               they will do for the purpose of comparison. 
               <br />
               When you consider the different expendi- 
               <br />
               tures of those settled on lands in the North— 
               <br />
               west as compared with the dwellers in 
               <br />
               eastern cities, I think it will be admitted 
               <br />
               that a family in the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               is worth a great deal more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$40</span> per 
               <br />
               year to the Dominion revenue. I would be 
               <br />
               inclined to think that such a settler’s fam— 
               <br />
               ily established on their land would be worth 
               <br />
               perhaps $100 per year instead of $40. To 
               <br />
               the provincial revenue they are worth ab- 
               <br />
               solutely nothing; the province does not 
               <br />
               levy direct taxation upon these settlers. It 
               <br />
               is true that a school district or a local im- 
               <br />
               provement district may be organized and 
               <br />
               the settlers may contribute to them by dir- 
               <br />
               ect taxation, but under the system that has 
               <br />
               prevailed so far, the establishment of a 
               <br />
               school district or a local improvement dis- 
               <br />
               trict does not mean relief to the provincial 
               <br />
               treasury. Every group of settlers coming 
               <br />
               into the Territories may be taken to mean 
               <br />
               the establishment of a new school district 
               <br />
               and local improvement district, which in 
               <br />
               turn means a direct charge upon the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial government just as their settlement 
               <br />
               means a direct contribution of the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion treasury. The local government is 
               <br />
               consequently not in the same position to 
               <br />
               derive revenue from the inﬂux of settlers 
               <br />
               that the Dominion government is, and 
               <br />
               therefore it cannot afford to spend money 
               <br />
               in attracting settlers. The Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment for a number of years has ex- 
               <br />
               pended about a million dollars a year 
               <br />
               to secure an inﬂux of immigrants, and no 
               <br />
               provincial government would be in a posi- 
               <br />
               tion to make such an expenditure because 
               <br />
               there is no source from which, according 
               <br />
               to our system of confederation, the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial government could acquire a com— 
               <br />
               pensating amount in revenue. The inﬂux 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settlers</span> means increased revenue to the 
               <br />
               Dominion, irrespective of the value of the 
               <br />
               land. The Dominion government can well 
               <br />
               aﬂord to spend large sums in attracting 
               <br />
               the attention of prospective immigrants and 
               <br />
               in providing for the security of life and

               which has a very important bearing upon 
               <br />
               the question of immigration and which at

               <br />
               Diest business transaction, if we expect 
               <br />
               to have inducements held out to people to 
               <br />
               settle on our vacant lands, and if we ex- 
               <br />
               pect to have law and order maintained, 
               <br />
               there is no question but that we have bet- 
               <br />
               ter grounds for looking to the Dominion an- 
               <br />
               thorities than to the provincial authorities. 
               <br />
               If we do not reach that conclusion by any 
               <br />
               other process we might very well reach it 
               <br />
               by looking at the conditions in the various 
               <br />
               provinces. British Columbia has a very 
               <br />
               large land area which is under the control 
               <br />
               and administration of the province, but so 
               <br />
               far as I know. within recent years British 
               <br />
               Columbia has not spent a dollar in attract- 
               <br />
               ing immigration to that province. The 
               <br />
               province of Ontario has a vast area of va- 
               <br />
               cant land, and I do not know that Ontario 
               <br />
               has spent a dollar in attracting immigrants 
               <br />
               within recent years. The same may be 
               <br />
               said of Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick, all of which provinces own their own 
               <br />
               lands. The reason for this is that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro—</span> 
               <br />
               vinces cannot afford to do so; there is not 
               <br />
               enough in it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> these provincial govern- 
               <br />
               ments. The interests of the entire Dominion 
               <br />
               depend upon the successful ﬁlling up of these 
               <br />
               prairies with desirable settlers and neither 
               <br />
               the Dominion nor any interest in the Domin— 
               <br />
               ion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span> afford to place the responsibility in 
               <br />
               hands other than those best ﬁtted by cir— 
               <br />
               cumstances to discharge that responsibility. 
               <br />
               It is not by reason of any greater business 
               <br />
               ability, or any greater honesty. but because 
               <br />
               the Dominion gets $40 revenue per family 
               <br />
               While the provincial government is billed 
               <br />
               with $20 say, annually of additional ex- 
               <br />
               pense for each family. Another feature 'of 
               <br />
               the case is this. The leader of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition has said. and said truly, that the 
               <br />
               inﬂux of settlers increases the value of the 
               <br />
               land and that the increased value of the 
               <br />
               land is of beneﬁt to the province. But, 
               <br />
               we cannot have an inﬂux of settlers unless 
               <br />
               we take means to secure it. and the suc— 
               <br />
               cess of the immigration policy is due main— 
               <br />
               ly to the fact that the settlers have been 
               <br />
               able to get free lands. We send immigra— 
               <br />
               tion agents to different parts of the world; 
               <br />
