               <br />
               yet, we are engaged in legislation that has 
               <br />
               appealed to the sentiments and feelings 
               <br />
               of the whole Canadian population. In

               some places an intense feeling has been 
               <br />
               aroused. We have a great responsibility

               You say you are tolerant to the Protestant

               And, Sir, I say that if that language ap- 
               <br />
               plies to the treatment by a Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               majority of a Proestant minority, it ought to 
               <br />
               apply equally well and with just as great 
               <br />
               force to the treatment by a Protestant ma- 
               <br />
               jority of a Roman Catholic minority. i 
               <br />
               believe that the only arrangement and the 
               <br />
               only settlement in connection with this mat- 
               <br />
               ter which can be ﬁnally and permanently 
               <br />
               satisfactory will be an arrangement that 
               <br />
               will give fair and impartial justice alike to 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics and Protestants, to ma- 
               <br />
               jorities and to minorities. I think, Sir, that 
               <br />
               justice can only be done <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by,</span> giving to the 
               <br />
               minorities in the west that which they have 
               <br />
               had so long both by law and by practice; 
               <br />
               nothing less and nothing more. Less would 
               <br />
               be unjust to the minorities, more would be 
               <br />
               unjust to the majorities ; for I do not think 
               <br />
               that whatever the new provincial govern- 
               <br />
               ments may do of their own accord, there is 
               <br />
               anything in law, gospel or reason, to warrant 
               <br />
               or to authorize this government to give any 
               <br />
               increased or added rights or privileges. This 
               <br />
               is the position .I have taken on the matter 
               <br />
               from the beginning. When the original Bill 
               <br />
               was introduced, I said to my own constitu- 
               <br />
               ents by word and by letter, Protestants and 
               <br />
               Catholics; that if a Bill were introduced 
               <br />
