               <br />
               convinced that the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick) had had a great deal to do with 
               <br />
               the framing of this clause 16, and recog- 
               <br />
               nizing in the manner in which that clause 
               <br />
               was drafted the high qualiﬁcations which 
               <br />
               we all know that hon. gentleman to possess, 
               <br />
               I thought that I recognized in it a kind of 
               <br />
               vindication of the position taken by the Lib- 
               <br />
               eral party in 1896 upon a similar question. 
               <br />
               To my mind it was the only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thine</span> the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman could do. and I shall say 
               <br />
               why. In the discussion which ‘is taking 
               <br />
               place, I was not here one evening when 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick) took some part in it and made 
               <br />
               some remarks, which of course do not give 
               <br />
               any idea of what he will say when he 
               <br />
               speaks at length on the measure. But some 
               <br />
               hon. members have said that clause 93 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act settles the 
               <br />
               case. I think that is pretty well the opin- 
               <br />
               ion expressed b_v_ my hon. friend from St.
