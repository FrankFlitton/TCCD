               <br />
               to surrender all these to this government. 
               <br />

               We even heard the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               in the old days claiming that the settlers 
               <br />

               <br />

               Bill it intended for the one express pur-

               pose. and that is to fasten this vexatious 
               <br />
               school legislation on the people. IIn order to 
               <br />
               do that, the government are treating the peo- 
               <br />
               ple as wards, not competent to make their 
               <br />
               own laws on education, or administer their 
               <br />
               own lands, or have a voice in the ﬁxing 
               <br />
               of the boundaries of their own provinces. 
               <br />
               In the same way also Manitoba is being 
               <br />
               punished for its course on the school ques- 
               <br />
               tion. Everything that is taking place in 
               <br />
               connection with this Bill, has its origin in 
               <br />
               the school policy and has for its object the 
               <br />
               forcing of that obnoxious policy on the peo- 
               <br />
               ple. Are not the people in the west capable 
               <br />
               of administering their own lands just as 
               <br />
               well as this Dominion government ? In my 
               <br />
               opinion they could administer them much 
               <br />
               better and create out of them a great re- 
               <br />
               serve fund which would save them from 
               <br />
               taxation for years. But if this Bill passes, 
               <br />
               they will have to resort to municipal taxa- 
               <br />
               tion of all kinds to enable them to carry 
               <br />
               on their own affairs and will be dependent 
               <br />
               on this government for whatever income 
               <br />
               they may get. What we should do instead 
               <br />
               is give these provinces a fair start and 
               <br />
               then let them manage for themselves. The 
               <br />
               First Minister declared that he was com- 
               <br />
               pleting the freedom of the Northwest. Well, 
               <br />
               there never was a province so hampered as 
               <br />
               these two are going to be. They are to be 
               <br />
               cribbed, cabined and conﬁned in every sense 
               <br />
               of the term. and by men who have always 
               <br />
               posed as the advocates of their rights. If 
               <br />
               the people had control of their own public 
               <br />
               lands, they might ﬁnd in them a means of 
               <br />
               freeing themselves from the tyranny o_t the 
               <br />
               railway companies or from any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railway</span> 
               <br />
               monopoly. I am not in favour myself of giv- 
               <br />
               ing land bonuses to railways, but a solution 
               <br />
               of the great transportation problem might 
               <br />
               be found in the control by the provinces of 
               <br />
               their own lands. But under this Bill, these 
               <br />
               lands are to be administered by the Domin- 
               <br />

               Mr. SCOTT. My hon. friend the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition repeated this afternoon 
               <br />
               some remarks which he had made on several 
               <br />
               previous occasions. He appears very much 
               <br />

               doubt to the wrong partner. It is held by

               <br />
               South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) and not 
               <br />
