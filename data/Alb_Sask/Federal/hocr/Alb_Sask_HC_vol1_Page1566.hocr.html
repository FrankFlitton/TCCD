               and the southern half must be entitled to

               greater representation. On ‘the same basis 
               <br />
               of calculation, the city of Montreal would be

               entitled to greater representation than all

               <br />
               lar argument he used with regard to the 
               <br />
               receipts of the land ofﬁces and the receipts 
               <br />
               from timber and other dues. Well, the 
               <br />
               amount of receipts indicate the amount of 
               <br />
               trade and the wealth of the country; and 
               <br />
               no one disputes that in this southern coun- 
               <br />
               try, with its nine hundred miles of railway 
               <br />
               and its investment of capital for many years, 
               <br />
               there is a greater aggregation of wealth 
               <br />
               than in the northern part with only one 
               <br />
               hundred miles of railway in operation. But 
               <br />
               it does not follow that the northern part 
               <br />
               shall be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disfrarnchised</span> because its people 
               <br />
               have not as much money in the bank or 
               <br />
               because the customs receipts or the land 
               <br />
               ofﬁce receipts are less. It is the people 
               <br />
               who vote and not their money. Winnipeg 
               <br />
               has more customs receipts and handles. I 
               <br />
               suppose, more business than all the rest of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, yet it has only one representa— 
               <br />
               tive. It has 100,000 of a population ap- 
               <br />
               proximately, which I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘presume,</span> is twice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> 
               <br />
               many as any other constituency in that 
               <br />
               province, but still it has only one represen- 
               <br />
               tative. The statements of the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man may possibly be correct, but they have 
               <br />
               no bearing on the question. The question 
               <br />
               is as to the number of people who are to 
               <br />

               My hon. friend has suggested that be- 
               <br />
               cause great irrigation works are going 
               <br />
               on in the vicinity of Calgary, there must 
               <br />
               be a large population there. But he knows 
               <br />
               that these irrigation works were undertaken 
               <br />
               because there was no population to speak 
               <br />
               of in that country, because it was not a 
               <br />
               country suitable for a large population. 
               <br />
               As a matter of fact, this great district, in 
               <br />
               which these irrigation works are situated, 
               <br />
               and which has something like 200 miles of 
               <br />
               railway, passed &amp; vote at the last election 
               <br />
               of about 700 or 800 votes. Because a 
               <br />
               country has 900 miles of railway, he says 
               <br />
               it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘must</span> contain a large aggregation of 
               <br />
               people, but here is a district with 200 miles

               of railway which only cast 700 or 800 votes. 
               <br />
               The extension of railways is not an evid-

               My hon. friend does not desire to consider 
               <br />
               area at all ; but the purpose of representa— 
               <br />
               tion is to forward the general interests, and 
               <br />
               the general interests include the develop-

               ment of unoccupied country. That is the

               great interest which we in this Dominion

               lt is the undeveloped area that is our source

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> exclude area from representation is

               certainly detrimental to the well-being of
