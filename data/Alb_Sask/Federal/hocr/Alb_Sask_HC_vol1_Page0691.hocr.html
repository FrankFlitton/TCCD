               years ago to his own constituents in the 
               <br />

               b‘er that there was a time in the life of John 
               <br />
               Bright when he was mobbed and booted and 
               <br />
               burned in efﬁgy, because that he, in his day, 
               <br />
               as the Prime Minister of Canada in this day, 
               <br />
               spoke for peace while others clamoured for 
               <br />
               strife. I have quoted from Mr. Willison; I 
               <br />
               have read wih a great deal of. pleasure and 
               <br />
               I trust with considerable proﬁt the bio- 
               <br />
               graphy written by Mr. Willison and pub- 
               <br />
               lished but two short years ago, a biography 
               <br />
               written in two volumes of between 400 and 
               <br />
               500 pages each, and I read upon almost 
               <br />
               every page of that biography expressions 
               <br />
               from Mr. Willison of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admiration</span> for and 
               <br />
               conﬁdence in the Prime Minister of Canada 
               <br />
               admiration because of his purity of life, 
               <br />
               because of his nobleness of purpose, because

               of his splendid ability ; because of his great 
               <br />
               courage, and particularly for the courage
