               The hon. member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) 
               <br />
               seemed to fear greatly that if the control of 
               <br />
               the public domain should be given to the pro- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">xinces,</span> the provinces would use the lands for 
               <br />
               revenue and would not settle the outlying 
               <br />
               districts. Well, Sir, I am not so willing 
               <br />
               as he is to suspect the foresight and busi- 
               <br />
               ness—like management of the local assembly. 
               <br />
               That assembly has undertaken no function 
               <br />
               up to date that the people of that country 
               <br />
               would consent to have abrogated, and the 
               <br />
               enlargements heretofore made in the pow- 
               <br />
               ers of the local assembly have been amply 
               <br />
               justiﬁed by the results. The hon. member 
               <br />
               for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) also entertained 
               <br />
               a different view of this question in days 
               <br />
               gone by, and on the 24th of July, 1884, he 
               <br />
               moved in the local legislature a resolution 
               <br />
               which expressed his views at that date, and 
               <br />
               which are not his views of to—day. He 
               <br />
               tells us that the lands might be exploited 
               <br />
               by the people of the west, but let me ask 
               <br />
               him if the people of the west are not tlhe 
               <br />
               most interested in the proper administration 
               <br />
               of these lands, and do they not realize that 
               <br />
               by settling these lands they would be en- 
               <br />
               hancing the value of their heritage. For 
               <br />
               my part, Sir, I am not prepared to say that 
               <br />
               if the immigration policy we‘re handed over 
               <br />
               to the local government, they would con- 
               <br />
               tinue the present system in its entirety. I 
               <br />
               do not know that a large expenditure out 
               <br />
               of the immigration vote for campaign liter- 
               <br />
               ature would be carried on ; I do not know 
               <br />
               that the large army of oﬂicials now in the 
               <br />
               Northwest would be continued in oﬂ‘ice, 
               <br />
               and I do not know that the local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governH</span>

               ment would hand over its lands in blocks 
               <br />
               of 250,000 acres at one dollar an acre.

               We are told now, Sir, and it is common

               have become too onerous for one man. We 
               <br />
               were told that the eX-minister (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               was so broken down in health that he of 
               <br />

               the statements that have been made, I

               think it is only fair to this House and to 
               <br />
               the people of that country that these hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen should give the grounds for the 
               <br />
               conclusions at which they have arrived. 
               <br />
               The hon. the Solicitor General was very 
               <br />
               pleased to exalt and extol the British con— 
               <br />
               stitution. He thought very much Of the 
               <br />
               British constitution in certain respects; but 
               <br />
               if the British constitution applies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> one 
               <br />
               direction, why should it not apply in the 
               <br />
               other ? If we are going to follow the Brit- 
               <br />
               ish constitution in respect of education, 
               <br />
               why should we depart from it in regard to 
               <br />
               the important matter of the control of the 
               <br />
               public domain? Are hon. gentlemen oppo- 
               <br />
               site, in withholding from the new provinces 
               <br />
               the control of the public domain, following 
               <br />
               the British colonial policy? What was 
               <br />
               that policy ? It is perhaps unnecessary for 
               <br />
               me to state to the House that the original 
               <br />
               ideaot the British statesmen was to con- 
               <br />
               trol the lands in the colonies; but when 
               <br />
               they tried to put that idea into practice, 
               <br />
               they had to abandon it for a better policy. 
               <br />
               namely, that the people on the spot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> 
               <br />
               best qualiﬁed to manage their own lands, 
               <br />
               and that was the policy they adopted. They 
               <br />
               felt that with local representation the man- 
               <br />
               agement of the lands would be better looked 
               <br />
               after. Is that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[principle</span> not equally applic- 
               <br />
               able <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today?</span> Here we have a territory two 
               <br />
               thousand miles away, represented in this 
               <br />
               House by only ten members. If those 
               <br />
               lands are handed over to the local govern- 
               <br />
               ment, there will] be ﬁfty members looking 
               <br />
               after their management in the interest of 
               <br />
               the people; and if mistakes or jo-bbery are 
               <br />
               liable to happen. are these not more likely 
               <br />
               to be detected by governments represent- 
               <br />
               ing ﬁfty members than by a government 
               <br />
               representing only ten ? I say that to 
               <br />
               withhold from the provinces the manage- 
               <br />
               ment of their own lands is directly con- 
               <br />
               trary, not only to British colonial policy, 
               <br />
               but to the spirit of confederation. When 
               <br />
               confederation was formed, what was the 
               <br />
               arrangement made between the various 
               <br />
               provinces ? Was it not that each province 
               <br />
               retained the right to administer the public 
               <br />
               domain, while the customs and excise du- 
               <br />
               ties were surrendered to the Dominion? 
               <br />
               That was the policy carried out with regard 
               <br />
               to Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New 
               <br />
               Brunswick. Then, in what spirit are these 
               <br />
               provinces being created to—day ? I take it 
               <br />
               that it is under section 146 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, which especially pro- 
               <br />
               vides that the admission shall be ‘s-ubject 
               <br />
               to the provisions of this Act.’ The spirit is 
               <br />
               also in section 109, if the letter is not. un- 
               <br />
