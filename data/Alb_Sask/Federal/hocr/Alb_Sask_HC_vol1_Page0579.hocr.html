               This letter, which was sent by the forty 
               <br />
               immortals of this country to His Holiness 
               <br />
               the Pope, complained of certain political 
               <br />

               <br />
               supporting the request already made that 
               <br />
               he would send a delegate to this country 
               <br />
               to look after their interests and to protect 
               <br />
               them from what is here set forth, namely, 
               <br />
               the unfair interference of the clerics in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec with the rights of the 
               <br />
               electors. and especially with the rights of 
               <br />
               members of parliament. I must say that 
               <br />
               I am rather disappointed in the opinion I 
               <br />
               had formed of the clergy of Quebec after 
               <br />
               the high commendation of their conduct 
               <br />
               given by the member for Labelle (Mr. Bour- 
               <br />
               assa) last night, when I see that he has 
               <br />
               stigmatized, more than any one I know, 
               <br />
               with these forty immortals from Quebec, 
               <br />
               the clergy of that province. They have 
               <br />
               charged them with all kinds of political in- 
               <br />
               terference, they charged them with inter- 
               <br />
               fering with the rights of the people to vote, 
               <br />
               and they asked His Holiness to interfere 
               <br />
               with these clergy in the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec, so that when the hon. member for La- 
               <br />
               belle says that members from Ontario have 
               <br />
               been throwing stones at the clergy of Que- 
               <br />
               bec. he has evidently forgotten that he and 
               <br />
               forty others signed this document to have 
               <br />
               a delegate sent out here to regulate the 
               <br />

               Mr. W F. MACLEAN. We will see about 
               <br />
               that. We have heard about a bolt in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia over this Bill and we will hear more 
               <br />
               of it. What else has fanned the ﬂame? 
               <br />
               The thing that fanned the ﬂame was the dis- 
               <br />
               covery by the great Protestant element of 
               <br />
               this country that the right hon. Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister had deceived them. He told them by 
               <br />
               his conduct in the elections of 1896 that 
               <br />
               the Manitoba question had been settled, 
               <br />
               that in this country there was to be no 
               <br />
               more coercion, that the sunny ways had 
               <br />
               settled this question and these people took 
               <br />
               him at his word. They accepted the pledge 
               <br />
               which he made when, as the hon. Minister
