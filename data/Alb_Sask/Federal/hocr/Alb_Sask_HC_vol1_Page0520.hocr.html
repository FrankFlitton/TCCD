               With reference to the request made by

               the Catholic members of the Liberal party

               I have taken my share in that action; I

               a British subject, under the British Crown, 
               <br />
               I was proud to ask the highest moral au— 
               <br />
               thority of the church to which I belong 
               <br />
               to send here a Papal ablegate who would 
               <br />
               see that good and proper relations existed 
               <br />
               between the clergy and laity of Quebec, to 
               <br />
               see that relations between the clergy and 
               <br />
               laity would be such that there would not 
               <br />
               be any cause of misunderstanding such as 
               <br />
               those which occurred at certain times in 
               <br />
               the past. The cause which induced the 
               <br />
               Liberal Catholic members of this House 
               <br />
               to seek the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointment</span> of an ablegate here 
               <br />
               was that we could not see eye to eye with 
               <br />
               a certain part of our clergy as to the right 
               <br />
               way of dealing with certain political ques- 
               <br />
               tions. And, Sir, in that respect I want to 
               <br />
               remind the House of the words of one of 
               <br />
               the greatest Protestant writers and philoso- 
               <br />
               phers of the nineteenth century, who has 
               <br />
               said that the Catholic church was a great 
               <br />
               school of respect. Appealing to the head 
               <br />
               of the church, we found justice, enlighten- 
               <br />
               ment, breadth of view and respect for the 
               <br />
               rights of the people. At one time or an— 
               <br />
               other there was trouble between the clergy 
               <br />
               and people of Quebec. Hon. gentlemen op- 
               <br />
               posite are always talking about the priest- 
               <br />
               ridden people of Quebec, about the clerical 
               <br />
               domination under which the poor habitant 
               <br />
               is resting; but, Sir, do you know that we 
               <br />
               never stood from our clergy the kind of 
               <br />
               sermons and political interference that has 
               <br />
               been going on for the last month in On- 
               <br />
               tario? For what reason did we ask the 
               <br />
               Pope to send an ablegate out here ? EX- 
               <br />
               actly to prevent What is going on now in 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario. And this was not 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst time that an ablegate was sent to 
               <br />
               Canada. The same thing was done in 1876 
               <br />
               and later on in the 80's. But how was it in

               this high ground of national feeling and

               ber of people who would still believe in 
               <br />
               the old tales about the Gunpowder Plot, the 
               <br />
               Guy Fawkes conspiracy, and other matters 
               <br />

               the poorest schoolmaster in England would

               be ashamed of mentioning, except possibly 
               <br />
               as the remnant of a legend which existed 
               <br />
               in the times of cred-ulity in that country. 
               <br />
               That may appear to be exaggerated. But 
               <br />
               not later than a few days ago I read in a 
               <br />
               newspaper that proposes to enlighten the 
               <br />
               people of Canada, a statement to the effect 
               <br />

               of the province of Quebec, headed by the 
               <br />
               hierarchy that was trying to prevent the 
               <br />

               <br />
               liberty, could be related to the same man, 
               <br />
               to the same power and the same inﬂuences 
               <br />
               that brought about the Gunpowder conspir- 
               <br />
               acy! I have seen that statement printed 
               <br />
               in the columns of either the ‘ News’ or the 
               <br />
               ‘World,’ because these two papers consti-

               tute a pair, and I cannot say which is the 
               <br />
               silliest. But, Sir, even when I read such 
               <br />
               things, printed in the twentieth century, 
               <br />
               in leading newspapers, published in a city 
               <br />
               like Toronto, and in a province like Ontario, 
               <br />
               I refuse to believe that you would ﬁnd a 
               <br />
               majority of the people of Ontario who would 
               <br />
               believe such silly talk. I cannot believe it, 
               <br />
               and I must say that the member for South

               York (Mr. W. F. Maclean), in the allusions 
               <br />
               he has made to-day, just as in the cartoons 
               <br />
               which are published every day in his news- 
               <br />

               greatest slur that could be cast on it by 
               <br />

               House and say that the province of Ontario
