               question, I suppose, from the standpoint ot 
               <br />
               the legal construction which a court of law 
               <br />
               would put upon it. Is he doing that. or is 
               <br />
               he talking about something else? Is the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman talking about its real con- 
               <br />
               struction which would be given to it in a 
               <br />
               court- of law, or is he. talking about some— 
               <br />
               thing else ? 
               <br />
