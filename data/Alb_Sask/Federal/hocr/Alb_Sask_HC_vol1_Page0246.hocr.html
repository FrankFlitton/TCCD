               tion 93 applies only to the four original

               me state what occurred in the province of 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island. That province came 
               <br />
               into confederation. in the year 1873. Al— 
               <br />
               though the delegates met at Charlottetown, 
               <br />
               although they had debated the union in 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island, yet in 1867 that 
               <br />
               province declared that she would not join 
               <br />
               confederation, and she did not join at that 
               <br />
               date. Before 1873, there had existed in 
               <br />
               that province a system of public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools”</span> 
               <br />
               and side by side with it had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grownl</span> 
               <br />
               up a system of separate schools. There= 
               <br />
               were French schools in several parishes, 
               <br />
               and in 1875 an Act was passed by 
               <br />
               the local legislature of Prince Edward Is- 
               <br />
               land. abolishing the separate schools system. 
               <br />
               An appeal was made to the Governor Gen-

               quite obvious. In 1871, doubts had arisen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span>

               as to the right of the federal parliament to

               interpretation of the British North America

               <br />
               vinces back to July 15, 1870—because, for- 
               <br />
               sooth, at that time there was no system of 
               <br />
               separate schools established by law—such 
               <br />

               admit provinces—according to section 2 of

               It is only this year that this Bill will be 
               <br />
               in force; it is only on the ﬁrst of July next 
               <br />
               that the Northwest Territories will join the 
               <br />
               union as provinces, and therefore the legis- 
               <br />
               lation enacted in- 1875 by this parliament 
               <br />
               granting a system of separate schools, can 
               <br />
               be retained by the present legislation. I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\could</span> cite the a-blest authorities on the Am- 
               <br />
               erican constitution, Cooley, Randolph Tuck- 
               <br />
               er, Sutherland. and others. to show that 
               <br />
               when the Territories are acquired they do 
               <br />
               not become states, and so it is with our own 
               <br />
               Territories. When they were purchased by 
               <br />
               Canada they did not become full-ﬂedged pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. And how did these Territories come 
               <br />
               into Canada ? We are aware that there was 
               <br />
               some doubt expressed as to the validity of 
               <br />
               the Act of 1870. Some people believed that 
               <br />
               we could not carve provinces out of these 
               <br />
               Territories, and therefore Sir John Macdon- 
               <br />
               ald, who was Prime Minister, applied to 
               <br />
               the imperial authorities to have the legis- 
               <br />
               lation of 1870 conﬁrmed by an imperial 
               <br />
               statute. It is well to refer to the memoran- 
               <br />
