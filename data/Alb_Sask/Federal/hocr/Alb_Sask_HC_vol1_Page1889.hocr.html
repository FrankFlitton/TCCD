               liament, to see that this agreement is main- 
               <br />
               tained is, it seems to me, to raise a push- 
               <br />
               lanimous objection. It was urged in the

               debate of 1890 and Sir Hector Langevin, 
               <br />

               I will not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">answer</span> that objection because it

               does not seem to me to be an objection

               which I have the honour to submit to this 
               <br />
               committee. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">People</span> have gone so far as to

               say that if this particular constitutional

               and to the Icelanders. But the members of 
               <br />
               this committee must see that the position of 
               <br />
               the French language in that country is a 
               <br />
               very different one from that of the lan- 
               <br />
               guages of these other people. because these 
               <br />
               people are modern immigrants who have 
               <br />
               recently gone into that country. The others 
               <br />
               were the pioneers of the country and, as 1 
               <br />
               stated before, they obtained that guarantee 
               <br />
               which to us ought to be sacred. Besides, 
               <br />
               there are thousands of the descendants of 
               <br />
               these men in that country, and even if they 
               <br />
               were fewer, still I consider that that fact 
               <br />
               has nothing to do with the duty which we 
               <br />
               have to perform here. From the remarks 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> made by my hon. friend the

               of the opinion that this might be considered 
               <br />
