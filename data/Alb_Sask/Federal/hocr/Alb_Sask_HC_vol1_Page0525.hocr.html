               Mr. SPROULE. I inferred from what ap—

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peared</span> in the paper that by some means or

               other there was an intimation conveyed to 
               <br />
               Mr. Whitney that it was desired that he 
               <br />
               should put up some claim. At all events 
               <br />
               the suggestion was made in the speech of 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister, and I have no doubt 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> had friends enough to bring that to the 
               <br />
               attention of Mr. Whitney. At all events, On- 
               <br />
               tario set up a claim and this government 
               <br />
               took advantage of that to say: We cannot 
               <br />
               settle the boundary of Manitoba because 
               <br />
               Ontario has set up a claim to that territory. 
               <br />
               Why did the First Minister say that a set- 
               <br />
               tlement could only be reached after a con- 
               <br />
               ference between Quebec, Ontario and Man- 
               <br />
               itoba ? What interest had Quebec in it; 
               <br />
               it did not touch the boundaries of that pro- 
               <br />
               vince in any way. However, the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister since abandoned that contention. 
               <br />
               \\e do ﬁnd h wever, that according to the

               Manitoba will not grant separate schools; 
               <br />
               and we find that the provisions of the Bill

               we can believe what appears in the press,

               fasten separate schools on these new pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               only accepted by the members from the west 
               <br />
               when some amendments were proposed, 
               <br />
               which amendments were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">submitted</span> to the 
               <br />

               Then I ask is this Papal ablegate going

               beyond his duty ? Is he interfering with 
               <br />
               the rights of the state ? In my judgment 
               <br />
               he is. So long as he conﬁnes himself to the 
               <br />
               rights of his church. we have not a word to 
               <br />

               <br />
               the right of any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dignil‘ary</span> representing that

               church, for which we have the greatest

               respect, or representing any other church, 
               <br />
               to come here and interfere with the rights

               <br />
               we protest against it; in the name of con-

               stitutional government, which we represent,

               sponsible for this unprecedented act? The

               When all these negotiations were going on

               edge that the Papal ablegate was taking a 
               <br />
               particular interest in it was so apparent, 
               <br />
               where were the Protestant members of the 
               <br />
               cabinet? Where was the Minister of Cus— 
               <br />
               toms (Mr. Paterson) who took such an in- 
               <br />
               terest in the subject the other night? Where 
               <br />
               was the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding), 
               <br />
               who made such a pitlable excuse for the Bill, 
               <br />
               and declared that government could not be 
               <br />
               carried on in this country if it were de- 
               <br />
               feated, because there would have to be a 
               <br />
               Protestant government formed ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">XVhere</span> 
               <br />
               was the lynx—eyed Postmaster General (Sir 
               <br />
               William Mulock), the only Protestant re- 
               <br />
               presentative on that subcommittee to which 
               <br />
               the Bill was submitted ? Where is there 
               <br />
               any evidence that he lodged any protest 
               <br />
               against the improper interference of the 
               <br />
               Papal ablegate '? Where was the Minister 
               <br />
               of Trade and Commerce (Sir Richard Cart- 
               <br />
               wright)? And, lastly, where was the ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton), who 
               <br />
               fought so vigorously before against inter- 
               <br />
               ference with the rights of Manitoba ‘? It 
               <br />
               is true, he lodged his protest against the 
               <br />
               government and went out as a rebuke to 
               <br />
               them for their improper conduct; but to 
               <br />
               day he is silenced, he is chloroformcd. And 
               <br />
               the other ministers seem to be chloroformed, 
               <br />
               for we have not a word from them. 
               <br />
               Who among them represents the great Pro- 
               <br />
               testant element of this country? You can 
               <br />
               speak freely on behalf of the other side; 
               <br />
               but if you raise your voice as a Protestant, 
               <br />
               it would seem as if you were almost a fugi- 
               <br />
               tive from justice. That is the kind of tol- 
               <br />
               eration that we are treated to in this 
               <br />
               House. It is toleration all on one side, 
               <br />
               with no evidence of any on the other side. 
               <br />
               Let us have a little more of it on that side. 
               <br />
               Let charity begin at home. Let our Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic friends show some charity and tol- 
               <br />
               erance towards those opposed to them, and 
               <br />
               then they will have very much less trouble 
               <br />
               in this country. I do not wish to continue 
               <br />
               ‘thisdiscussion longer, but I did wish to say, 
               <br />
               and I repeat it, that we are to-day as ﬁrmly 
               <br />
               opposed to church interference with the 
               <br />
               state as we ever were in this country. It 
               <br />
               must come to an end, and it must come to 
               <br />
               an end now. What is the logical sequence 
               <br />
               of all this? It is admitted, and the cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances justify the conclusion, that 
               <br />
               Manitoba’s boundary is not extended be- 
               <br />
               cause of the interference of the Papal able- 
               <br />
               gate. There is no doubt about it whatever. 
               <br />
