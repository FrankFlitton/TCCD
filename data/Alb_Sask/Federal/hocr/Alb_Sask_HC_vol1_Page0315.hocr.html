               So much has been said about this section 
               <br />
               93 that I need not quote it, every one of us 
               <br />
               knows it by heart. However, I shall ven- 
               <br />
               ture to say one word as to its construction. 
               <br />
               There are two ways of interpreting a stat- 
               <br />
               ute: liberally, and literally. If I give it its 
               <br />
               liberal interpretation there can be no doubt 
               <br />
               that the ﬁrst clause of section 93 applies 
               <br />
               under the circumstances. Mr. Robinson, in 
               <br />
               giving the aforementioned opinion claimed 
               <br />
               that no part of section 93 applied. If that 
               <br />
               section has no application, then it will be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contended</span> that section 92 settles the point. 
               <br />
               Notwithstanding my deep respect for Mr. 
               <br />
               Robinson. I have no hesitation in saying 
               <br />
               that his View of the case is evidently wrong. 
               <br />
               The Privy Council have decided so in the
