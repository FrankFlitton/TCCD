               Mr. BENNETT. I happened to be in the 
               <br />
               Northwest a couple of years ago, when the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition held a series of 
               <br />
               public meetings throughout that country, 
               <br />
               and I must say that this question of the 
               <br />
               owners-hip of public lands attracted a great 
               <br />
               deal of attention at the different <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meetings,</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               ronto (Mr. Foster) and those advanced by 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) in 
               <br />
               this House had been presented, I think that 
               <br />
               my friend from North Toronto (Mr. Foster) 
               <br />
               would have scored rather heavily on the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver). As I 
               <br />
               understand it, and I have listened very care— 
               <br />
               fully to the Minister of the Interior, he 
               <br />
               bases the claim that the Dominion should 
               <br />
               still hold the lands on two important points. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst one is the policy that more money 
               <br />
               was gained by the Dominion as a whole 
               <br />
               than by these provinces from the introduc- 
               <br />
               tion of settlers into that country. Now, if 
               <br />
               that is a good argument, it is not one that 
               <br />
               was relied upon by the ex-Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior (Mr. Sifton), for this reason, that 
               <br />
               a settler in the Northwest, if you are going 
               <br />
               to look only at what you get out of him in 
               <br />
               the way of customs duties, would be no 
               <br />
               more valuable than a settler in Ontario. I

               asking people to come into the old provinces

               other than the west. This is rather a re- 
               <br />
               ﬂection on the province of Ontario, because 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite will remember that 
               <br />
               when the Grand Trunk Paciﬁc Bill was be- 
               <br />
               fore the House one of the greatest pleas that 
               <br />
               was advanced for the taking up of that 
               <br />
               measure by this parliament was the fact 
               <br />
               that we had in Onta-rioa vast area known as 
               <br />
               the clay belt, which was one of the greatest 
               <br />
               assets in the whole Dominion, and the min- 
               <br />
               isters from Ontario upheld their position by 
               <br />
               continually referring to that great asset of 
               <br />
               Ontario, and yet the ex-Mi-niister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior (Mr. Sifton) apparently in this atlas 
               <br />
               pays little or no attention to that, so that 
               <br />
               his view was that the asset <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> the coun-

               <br />
               draw customs duties, but rather it was that a 
               <br />
               settler should come into the country, become 
               <br />

               in return bring back the money and spend 
               <br />
               that money among our own people, and I 
               <br />
               think that is the great basis of success, not 
               <br />
               only of this province, but of the whole Do-

               <br />
               next point the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver),took was on the question of immi— 
               <br />
               gratiion, that immigration could he more 
               <br />
               successfully handled and induced by the 
               <br />
               department over which he presides than by 
               <br />
               provincial departments. It would be very 
               <br />
               easy for any province to imitate the methods 
               <br />
               which the Department of the Interior has 
               <br />
               employed to induce that immigration. In 
               <br />

               <br />
               politics out of this matter to a great extent 
               <br />
               it would have been much better. One of 
               <br />
               the greatest experiments for inducing 
               <br />
               settlers to come to this country from Eng- 
               <br />
               land was the sending of a number of settlers 
               <br />
               from Manitoba and the Northwest to the 
               <br />
               old country who lectured "at diﬁerent points 
               <br />
               and endeavoured to persuade the people 
               <br />
               that this was a desirable ﬁeld for immigra- 
               <br />
               tion. I have no fault to ﬁnd with that; I 
               <br />
               think it was an admirable plan. These were 
               <br />
               men speaking from actual experience, and 
               <br />
               I believe no better system could have been 
               <br />
               pursued in the old country than that. It 
               <br />
               was asserted at that time that these lectur- 
               <br />

               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite. Be that as it may, 
               <br />
               I think that if the provinces had the hand-

               do it better than the Dominion, but the fact

               North Toronto, settlement has gone in there
