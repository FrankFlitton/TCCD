Since then some fifty miles of the <lb/>railway ha been constructed and arrange<lb break="no"/>ments are not being made to complete the <lb/>road.  In the course of making the neces<lb break="no"/>sary financial arrangement, the question<lb/>was raised whether the charter rights of<lb/>the company has not expired because of a<lb/>certain omission in the legislation secured<lb/>in this parliament.  In order to remove this<lb/>doubt-- and the question was never raised<lb/>until two or threee days ago-- the Vancouver,<lb/>Victoria and Eastern Railway Company<lb/>come to this parliament and ask for the <lb/>legislation necessary to that end.  It is<lb/>purely a technical matter.

I must admit, with re<lb break="no"/>ference to this matter, that probably the <lb/>default was due to the solicitor of the com<lb break="no"/>pany.  Mr. Irving is the manager of the com- <lb/>pany.

     this stage of the debate, Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     shall not pretend to review the whole of 
     <lb/>
     the discussion which has taken place in 
     <lb/>
     this House on the Bill now before us, nor 
     <lb/>
     shall I attempt to deal with all the clauses 
     <lb/>
     in that Bill. I propose to confine my re<lb break="no"/>marks to that part of the measure which 
     <lb/>
     has created so much sensation, not only. in 
     <lb/>
     this House, but in the country as well. I 
     <lb/>
     refer to the clause dealing with education. 
     <lb/>
     Having listened very faithfully to the de<lb break="no"/>bate which is taking place, I am of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that the views which have been ex<lb break="no"/>pressed on both sides, even those most op 
     <lb/>
     posite to my own, have been given in good 
     <lb/>
     faith and with but one object in view, the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. The view that I

     take of this matter may be a very weak 
     <lb/>
     one, but it is held in all sincerity and frank<lb break="no"/>ness; and in giving expression to it I trust 
     <lb/>
     that I shall not say anything likely to hurt 
     <lb/>
     the feelings of any one. You will under<lb break="no"/>stand, Mr. Speaker, that it would be much 
     <lb/>
     easier for me to address yourself and the 
     <lb/>
     House in my native tongue, but as I want 
     <lb/>
     my words to be understood, especially by 
     <lb/>
     those of my hon. friends who do not en<lb break="no"/>joy the advantage of understanding the 
     <lb/>
     beautiful French language, I shall endeavour 
     <lb/>
     to use the language of the majority. And 
     <lb/>
     if my English is not of the first quality, I 
     <lb/>
     ask you, Sir, and this House, for your kind

     indulgence.

            <p>

            <p>
     If ever, Sir, there was a right well estab<lb break="no"/>lished. if ever there was a right based on 
     <lb/>
     justice and equity. it is the right of the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics of the Northwest to their separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools. That is a right which comes 
     <lb/>
     to them naturally, constitutionally and poli<lb break="no"/>tically. By virtue of natural law, it is the 
     <lb/>
     right of the parent to bring up his children 
     <lb/>
     in the way he thinks best calculated to 
     <lb/>
     make them good Christians and good citi<lb break="no"/>zens, and it is the parent who is finally 
     <lb/>
     responsible for the education of his child<lb break="no"/>ren. That is so true that a simple <choice><sic>compar<lb break="no"/>sion</sic><corr>comparison</corr></choice> will make itself evident. to hon. 
     <lb/>
     members opposite. Suppose, for instance. 
     <lb/>
     that my hon. friend from East Grey (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule) or my hon. friend from South York 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. W. F. Maclean) should have no child<lb break="no"/>ren and I should have six.

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. I have children.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. I am simply put<lb break="no"/>ting an hypothetical case for the sake of ar<lb break="no"/>gument, but as I apparently was not very

     hon. friend, I shall take instead the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Victoria and Haliburton (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sam. Hughes). Suppose these hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen had no children and I had six, does 
     <lb/>
     it not belong to me and not to them to de<lb break="no"/>cide how my children shall be educated ?

     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. I am a French 
     <lb/>
    Canadian and it will be all right. Is it 
     <lb/>because my hon. friends are in the majority 
     <lb/>that they can impose on me, against my 
     <lb/>conscience, their views, and dictate to me 
     <lb/>how I shall have my children educated? 
     <lb/>The child is not the property of the state, 
     <lb/>but of his parents, and it is they who have 
     <lb/>the right to decide how he shall be brought 
     <lb/>up and to have him brought up according 
     <lb/>to the dictates of their conscience. Hence 
     <lb/>we have seen outside the organization of 
     <lb/>the state, private societies or associations 
     <lb/>such as schools. The family constitutes a 
     <lb/>private society. at the head of which is the 
     <lb/>parents, and for the protection of which 
     <lb/>public society has been established. The 
     <lb/>civil society has been instituted for the pro<lb break="no"/>tection of natural law, not to annihilate it: 
     <lb/>and for the public society to deny the right 
     <lb/>to existence of these private societies would 
     <lb/>be to destroy its own foundation, because 
     <lb/>both derive their source in the same princi<lb break="no"/>ple, the sociableness of mankind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     It is on that instinct of sociableness, al<lb break="no"/>ways mainfesting itself, that confederation 
     <lb/>
     has been established. The British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act defines the principles on which 
     <lb/>
     the different provinces have rested that 
     <lb/>

     The British North America Act defines the

     agreement to it. This compact is eminently   
     <lb/>
     synallagmatic, providing for mutual and 
     <lb/>
     reciprocal obligations and common duties. 
     <lb/>
     In the British North America Act lies the 
     <lb/>
     common ground on which the different pro<lb break="no"/>vinces formed the confederation which is 
     <lb/>
     now the Dominion of Canada. But, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that confederation was not looked 
     <lb/>
     upon at first favourably by some of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, fears were expressed on behalf of 
     <lb/>
     the minorities in the various provinces, 
     <lb/>
     especially by the Protestant University of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, and inducements had to be held out 
     <lb/>
     to the minorities in order to gain their con<lb break="no"/>:sent. Let me quote to you some of the pro<lb break="no"/>mises that were made to the provinces, from 
     <lb/>
     which you can judge what was the idea of 
     <lb/>
     the fathers of confederation. Hon. D'Arcy 
     <lb/>
     McGee, who I understand was one of the 
     <lb/>
     fathers of confederation, speaking, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     in 1864, said:

     Well, Sir, inducements and promises of 
     <lb/>
     that kind were relied upon, and the various 
     <lb/>
     provinces agreed to form a confederation. 
     <lb/>
     They passed some resolutions and then went 
     <lb/>
     to the imperial parliament and obtained 
     <lb/>
     what is now termed the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, which is the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. That Act defines the powers of the 
     <lb/>
     central government, and the exclusive powers 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces. Among the latter is juris<lb break="no"/>diction in the matter of education, but a 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction which is not exclusive, but is 
     <lb/>
     limited by the terms of the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act itself. My hon. friend from Lincoln 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Lancaster) the other night said that 
     <lb/>
     section 91 defined the powers of the central 
     <lb/>
     government and section 92 defined the ex<lb break="no"/>clusive powers of the provinces ; and when 
     <lb/>
     he was asked by my hon. friend from St. 
     <lb/>
     John and Iberville (Mr. L. P. Demers) if 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction over education was contained 
     <lb/>
     in section 92. he was obliged to admit that 
     <lb/>
     it was not. There is a special section of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, section 93, which 
     <lb/>
     gives to the provinces jurisdiction in the 
     <lb/>
     matter of education. but one whch is limited 
     <lb/>
     by the terms of the section itself, subsec<lb break="no"/>tions 1, 2, 3 and 4. Now we are told that in 
     <lb/>
     order to ascertain the meaning of any 
     <lb/>
     statute we must go back and inquire what 
     <lb/>
     was the intention of the legislators. Well, 
     <lb/>
     when this Act was passed in the British 
     <lb/>
     parliament, the mover, Lord Carnarvon, then 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of State to the colonies, made a 
     <lb/>
     statement which was quoted last night by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Cape Breton (Mr. D. D. 
     <lb/>
     McKenzie) ; but I may be permitted to read 
     <lb/>
     it again, because I consider it very pertinent. 
     <lb/>
    Coming to section 93 the mover said :

     Well, Sir, on the 22nd of February of the 
     <lb/>
     same year the Earl of Shaftesbury presented 
     <lb/>
     a petition to the House of Lords on behalf 
     <lb/>
     of the Protestants of the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, asking that their rights be protected 
     <lb/>
     under the British North America Act that 
     <lb/>
     was then passing through parliament. What 
     <lb/>
     was the answer of Lord Carnarvon ? Here 
     <lb/>
     I will call upon my hon. friend from East 
     <lb/>
     Hastings (Mr. Northrup) to make good his 
     <lb/>
     promise when he said that if we could show 
     <lb/>
     him some words in which we are in honour 
     <lb/>
     bound to give separate schools to the North<lb break="no"/>west. then he would be in favour of them. 
     <lb/>
     I call the attention of that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     to these words I am about to quote, and 
     <lb/>
     then ask him to keep his pledge. Lord Carn<lb break="no"/>arvon, On the 22nd of February, in answer<lb break="no"/>ing the Earl of Shaftesbury, said:

     Hence the House would perceive that it was 
     <lb/>
     almost impossible for any injury to be done to 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant minority. The real question at 
     <lb/>
     issue between the Protestant and Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic communities was the question of education, 
     <lb/>
     and the 93rd clause, after long controversy, in 
     <lb/>
     which the views of all parties had been repre<lb break="no"/>sented, had been framed. The object of that 
     <lb/>
     clause was to guard against the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     the members of the minority suffering from un<lb break="no"/>due pressure by the majority. It had been to 
     <lb/>
     place all these minorities, whatever religion, 
     <lb/>
     on precisely the same footing, and that, whe<lb break="no"/>ther the minorities were in esse or in posse.

     Now is not that the case of the North<lb break="no"/>west which was then a minority in posse 
     <lb/>
     and did not then form part of the confeder<lb break="no"/>ation ? Thus the Roman Catholic minority 
     <lb/>
     in Upper Canada and the Protestant minor<lb break="no"/>ity in Lower Canada and the Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic minority in the maritime provinces would 
     <lb/>
     all be placed on a footing of precise equa<lb break="no"/>lity, Now, Sir, the time has come when the 
     <lb/>
     pledge made by Lord Carnarvon in the 
     <lb/>
     House of Lords, when he was speaking of 
     <lb/>
     minorities, must be kept, and when we ought 
     <lb/>
     to do them the justice that was promised 
     <lb/>
     in the House of Lords. The hon. member 
     <lb/>

     Well, Sir, why does not the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for North Toronto still believe in the con<lb break="no"/>stitution ? I have always understood that a 
     <lb/>
     man who had principles and who believed in 
     <lb/>
     his principles stuck to them and tried to 
     <lb/>
     convince the people that they were wrong 
     <lb/>
     and not be convinced by the people that he 
     <lb/>
     was wrong. I think the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Toronto has been long enough in poli<lb break="no"/>tics and has been long enough in this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment not to allow himself, when he believed 
     <lb/>
     that he had the right view of the question, 
     <lb/>
     and when he believed in the right of the 
     <lb/>
     minority, to be convinced that he was wrong 
     <lb/>
     even by a thrice expressed opinion on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the people, especially so, when dur<lb break="no"/>ing the elections of 1900 and 1904, that ques<lb break="no"/>tion was not in the least talked of. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) was 
     <lb/>
     quite right the other day when he said that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     changed his mind because he found 
     <lb/>
     that his former view was not to his 
     <lb/>
     political advantage and it did not pay. 
     <lb/>
     These are the principles of hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on the other side of the House. They 
     <lb/>
     have principles but they cannot stick to 
     <lb/>
     them. They do not believe in any thing that 
     <lb/>
     does not pay and is not to their political ad<lb break="no"/>vantage. It is not the statesmen who try 
     <lb/>
     to enlighten the mob, but it is the mob that 
     <lb/>
     tries to enlighten the political statesmen of 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party. We have an ex<lb break="no"/>pression of opinion by the highest tribunal 
     <lb/>
     in the British empire; we have on this 
     <lb/>
     question the opinion of the judicial commit<lb break="no"/>tee of the Privy Council which was given 
     <lb/>
     in the Manitoba case. We have the opinion 
     <lb/>
     of Lord Herschell, and I hope that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Toronto who has been 
     <lb/>
     much longer in politics than I have and who 
     <lb/>
     ought to know better than I do will pay some 
     <lb/>
     attention to that opinion and that he will be 
     <lb/>
     convinced that the correct view of this case 
     <lb/>
     is not to be found in the expression of 
     <lb/>
     public opinion on such a question as this. 
     <lb/>
     Lord Herschell, speaking in regard to the 
     <lb/>

     Mr. Speaker, when the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories entered the union they came under 
     <lb/>
     the principle of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act which is the basis of confederation and 
     <lb/>
     which is the principle upon which all the 
     <lb/>
     sovereign states have met to form this con<lb break="no"/>federation. This was the principle and it 
     <lb/>
     was so well understood that when a law 
     <lb/>
     was passed relating to separate schools in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories it met, in the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons, with little if any oppo<lb break="no"/>sition. The men of that time, the Blakes, 
     <lb/>
     the Mackenzies, and Sir John Macdonald un<lb break="no"/>derstood perhaps better than our hon. friends 
     <lb/>
     to-day what was the spirit of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion because they were closer to it. Were 
     <lb/>
     there any doubt left in the minds of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen about the right of the Catholics of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories to their separate 
     <lb/>
     schools the law of 1875 should remove it 
     <lb/>
     immediately. That law, which I need not 
     <lb/>
     read to the House, as has been said by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Beauharnois (Mr. Berge<lb break="no"/>ron), is the law of to-day. That law was 
     <lb/>
     passed under the provisions of section 93 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act. it is the 
     <lb/>
     aw of today and the meaning of the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Act is that when separate 
     <lb/>
     schools have been established they have been 
     <lb/>
     established for good. Why was it that the 
     <lb/>
     law of 1875 was passed ? Was it not passed 
     <lb/>
     at the request of the Protestant minority in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, under section 93 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, to make clearer and 
     <lb/>
     to relieve any doubt there may have been re<lb break="no"/>lating to the rights of the Protestant mino<lb break="no"/>rity of the west ? When that law was pass<lb break="no"/>ed by parliament, the Protestant minority as 
     <lb/>
     it then existed believed that the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories would be a second province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and that the French Catholics would 
     <lb/>
     have a majority there. That is so clear that 
     <lb/>
     you cannot find any speech against it, not 
     <lb/>
     even a speech by George Brown himself, and 
     <lb/>
     I defy hon. gentlemen opposite to show me 
     <lb/>
     one single article in the Protestant papers 
     <lb/>
     of that time against the law of 1875. What 
     <lb/>
     was the attitude of the ' Globe ' then ? Can 
     <lb/>
     we find a single word in the 'Globe ' of 1875 
     <lb/>
     against the law which gave separate schools 
     <lb/>
     to the minority of the Northwest Territories? 
     <lb/>
     Nor, can we find a single word of protest in 
     <lb/>
     the 'Mail.' which, I believe. is the organ of 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party to-day. Well Sir,

     when this law was passed in 1875 to pro<lb break="no"/>tect the rights of the Protestant minority of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories it was passed 
     <lb/>
     without any obstruction from the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     majority of the west, and if it was passed 
     <lb/>
     with the complete acquiescence of the Cath<lb break="no"/>olic majority of the west why should our 
     <lb/>
     Protestant friends of the west to-day be any 
     <lb/>
     more narrow-minded than the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     were in 1875 ? Why should they not stand 
     <lb/>
     to-day as we stood in 1875 ready to give to 
     <lb/>
     our Protestant fellow-citizens what was 
     <lb/>
     their right and what we claim to be our 
     <lb/>
     right to-day, because we are now in the 
     <lb/>
     minority ? I suppose, that our hon. friends 
     <lb/>
     on the other side of the House will want 
     <lb/>
     to know when the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     enter confederation, and I suppose that the 
     <lb/>
     old war cry that we have heard very often 
     <lb/>
     in this discussion, without, it seems to me 
     <lb/>
     any reason, will be again heard that we are 
     <lb/>
     making an attack upon provincial rights. 
     <lb/>
     Well, Sir, my view is that the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories are not yet members of the con<lb break="no"/>federation of Canada. We know that they 
     <lb/>
     have not the rights of a province in the 
     <lb/>
     matter of education, that we have absolute 
     <lb/>
     and unlimited jurisdiction as far as the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories go, and I think I can 
     <lb/>
     fairly say, Mr. Speaker, that the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories in the matter of education or in 
     <lb/>
     any other matter have not even the colour 
     <lb/>
     of a right. The question has arisen : When 
     <lb/>
     do they enter the union, or when do they 
     <lb/>
     become a party to the compact formed in 
     <lb/>
     1867 between Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     and New Brunswick ? Was it in 1870, or is 
     <lb/>
     it to-day or will it be to-morrow ? Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain, the premier of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories says that the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     entered the union on the 15th July, 1870. 
     <lb/>
     One might ask by virtue of what law did 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories become a party 
     <lb/>
     to the contract which implies the possession 
     <lb/>
     of all the powers which were conceded to 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces by the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment in 1867, only by a fiction of interna<lb break="no"/>tional law. But, let us for the moment 
     <lb/>
     accept the argument of Mr. Haultain, let us 
     <lb/>
     suppose that the Territories entered the 
     <lb/>
     union in 1870 ; by the terms of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, separate schools having 
     <lb/>
     been established in the west since by the 
     <lb/>
     federal government which was the compe<lb break="no"/>tent authority, and that law having been 
     <lb/>
     ratified by the legislature of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, separate schools were established 
     <lb/>
     for ever and we cannot now abolish them. 
     <lb/>
     That, is not my opinion only. I would not 
     <lb/>
     give my own legal opinion on such an im<lb break="no"/>portant question, but in stating this, I give 
     <lb/>
     the opinion which was expressed by Sir 
     <lb/>
     Charles Hibbert Tupper in 1896. Speaking 
     <lb/>
     on the Manitoba school question in 1896, he 
     <lb/>
     quoted and endorsed what Hon. Mr. Mills 
     <lb/>
     said in the House of Commons on March 8, 
     <lb/>
     1875 :

            <p>
     Well, Sir, is not that the case in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories to-day ? In 1896, 
     <lb/>
     Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper was quoting the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. D. Mills, on the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories Act of 1875, and we know 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. David Mills was a high 
     <lb/>
     authority. If we take Mr. Haultain's 
     <lb/>
     opinion, not even this federal parliament, 
     <lb/>
     bound by its constitution and the Act of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, can abolish the schools which 
     <lb/>
     were established after the so-called entrance 
     <lb/>
     into the union by the Act of 1870. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friends on the other side may say that the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act refers only to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces and that the word ' legislature' 
     <lb/>
     in section 93 does not mean the legislature 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest Territories, but if they 
     <lb/>
     take the trouble to read the Canadian In<lb break="no"/>terpretation Act, they will see that ' pro<lb break="no"/>vince ' means the Territories of the North<lb break="no"/>west and the district of Keewatin, and, 
     <lb/>
     they will see that the ' legislature ' means 
     <lb/>
     not only the legislature of the provinces, 
     <lb/>
     but the legislature of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories and the Orders in Council passed 
     <lb/>
     relating to Keewatin. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is true the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     is an imperial statute, but is one worded by 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, passed on Canadian resolutions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the province of Quebec we were at 
     <lb/>
     first greatly impressed by the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition as being a broad-minded 
     <lb/>
     man and a man above prejudices. He 
     <lb/>
     came to our province and his first 
     <lb/>
     words were addressed to the people in the 
     <lb/>
     French language, and that incident en<lb break="no"/>deared him to the heart of the French Can<lb break="no"/>adian, but, Sir, when the leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position had to show that he was really 
     <lb/>
     the leader of his party, never was more ap<lb break="no"/>plicable the saying about a French states<lb break="no"/>man : ' Je suis le chef, il faut bien que je 
     <lb/>
     les suive.' When the hon. gentleman had 
     <lb/>
     to show himself as the leader of his party, 
     <lb/>
     we thought, judging by his short record of 
     <lb/>
     the past, we would see him occupy his posi<lb break="no"/>tion in public life with the mantle of Sir 
     <lb/>
     John A. Macdonald covering his shoulders. 
     <lb/>
     But we were disappointed. Was it too broad 
     <lb/>
     for his shoulders ? I cannot say, but I know 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. gentleman has changed the 
     <lb/>
     mantle which Sir John Macdonald wore 
     <lb/>
     as the leader of the Conservative party : he 
     <lb/>
     has changed that broad mantle for a narrow<lb break="no"/>er one ; one which may not he dignified by 
     <lb/>
     the name of mantle, but which perhaps 
     <lb/>
     might be better described as the short pea 
     <lb/>
     jacket of the old Tories that was worn 
     <lb/>
     by Sir Allan Macnab. However that may 
     <lb/>
     be, we have the consolation of seeing that 
     <lb/>
     the old Tory jacket is perhaps a little too 
     <lb/>
     short for the hon. member for Carleton, 
     <lb/>

     Judging by his seeming uncomfortableness 
     <lb/>
     during this whole discussion. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has told us that he has not been 
     <lb/>
     pressed by his followers into assuming his 
     <lb/>
     present position, and we must accept his 
     <lb/>
     word for it. It would appear then that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman has acted a little bit 
     <lb/>
     of the role of a Czar, which we have heard 
     <lb/>
     so much about from the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     South York (Mr. Maclean), the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition has acted like the dictator 
     <lb/>
     which those who read the Toronto ' World ' 
     <lb/>
     saw described in its columns the other day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. I hope you read 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. Certainly, but I 
     <lb/>
     take an antidote afterwards. The Canadian
     <lb/>
     House of Commons bears the same relation   
     <lb/>
     to the legislature of the Northwest, as the
     <lb/>
     imperial parliament bore towards the Can<lb break="no"/>adian colonies in 1867. These Territories 
     <lb/>
     were acquired by the right of conquest, and 
     <lb/>
     with them this parliament acquired the 
     <lb/>
     power to legislate for their future welfare, 
     <lb/>
     but, did the Northwest Territories really 
     <lb/>
     enter the union in 1870, as is claimed by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain ? Canada was not then treat<lb break="no"/>ing with independent sovereign provinces, 
     <lb/>
     as in the case of Nova Scotia, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, Prince Edward Island and British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia. There was no compact with 
     <lb/>
     these Territories, there was no synallag<lb break="no"/>matic contract, but merely the taking pos<lb break="no"/>session of a portion of territory. That west<lb break="no"/>ern country had no power to treat with us ; 
     <lb/>
     the claims of the half-breeds that they had 
     <lb/>
     that power were not listened to. It would be   
     <lb/>
     fairer to say that since 1870 the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     belonged to the union, but was not a party to   
     <lb/>
     the compact entered into in 1867. The Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories in 1870 were given a provisional 
     <lb/>
     constitution it is true, but it was a transitory   
     <lb/>
     constitution without provincial rights andl 
     <lb/>
     there was an acknowledgment of our sover<lb break="no"/>eignty. It was even argued, here, that the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories had not the right to 
     <lb/>
     send members and senators to the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion parliament, and I need not quote the 
     <lb/>
     speech of the Hon. Mr. Mills in 1875 to that 
     <lb/>
     effect. But, Sir, the surest proof that these 
     <lb/>
     Territories are not a part of the union is 
     <lb/>
     that they have not autonomy, and that to<lb break="no"/>day, without their consent, their domain 
     <lb/>is being divided into two new provinces.<lb/>
    Even take the Bill as presented to this 
     <lb/>House and you will see that the date of the 
     <lb/>union is at the time of the passing of this 
     <lb/>Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     We have heard a good deal about pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights in this House. May I ask, 
     <lb/>
     where are the provincial rights that are 
     <lb/>
     wronged in this matter ? Where are the 
     <lb/>
     provinces that have provincial rights ? They 
     <lb/>do not yet exist, and even were there any<lb/>provinces existing to-day their rights in the<lb/>matter of education would be limited in<lb/>
           

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3754</fw>
      

     matters of education as are the rights of 
     <lb/>
     any other province in the confederation by 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act. Canada 
     <lb/>
     has now to deal with her own property, and 
     <lb/>
     so we are going to create new provinces 
     <lb/>
     and to give them a constitution. I say, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, that it is most important that we 
     <lb/>
     should give them a constitution which shall 
     <lb/>
     be in accordance with the spirit of con<lb break="no"/>federation, and in doing so we must not for<lb break="no"/>get that these lands of the Northwest have 
     <lb/>
     been acquired, not by Protestant Canada, 
     <lb/>
     but by the Canadian confederation, French 
     <lb/>
     and English, Protestant and Catholic. And, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, in view of the condition of certain 
     <lb/>
     minds in the country and in view of the 
     <lb/>
     agitation, fomeuted by certain narrow spirits 
     <lb/>
     it is most expedient that in giving these 
     <lb/>
     Territories autonomy there should be a clear 
     <lb/>
     and precise declaration as to what is con<lb break="no"/>federation and what is the spirit of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act—not a milk and 
     <lb/>
     water declaration, but a declaration, clear 
     <lb/>
     and precise as the principle on which 
     <lb/>
     union has been established, so that 
     <lb/>
      the question may be settled for ever, so that 
     <lb/>the government of these provinces shall be 
     <lb/>protected, not only against agitators from 
     <lb/>the outside, but against itself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     We have been told, Sir, many a time that 
     <lb/>
     we should trust the majority. This might 
     <lb/>
     be true in Quebec, but considering what has 
     <lb/>
     been done in the Territories since 1875 how 
     <lb/>
     can we trust the majority there ? I need not 
     <lb/>
     quote the ordinances passed in 1892, or the 
     <lb/>
     ordinances passed in 1901, for we have the 
     <lb/>
     speech of the Minister of Finance and we 
     <lb/>
     have the speech of the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior—a man who ought to know—in 
     <lb/>
     testimony that separate schools in the North<lb break="no"/>west exist only in name and not in fact. 
     <lb/>
     The Minister of Finance has told us that 
     <lb/>
     from the hour of the opening of the school, 
     <lb/>
     in the morning until half past three in 
     <lb/>
     the afternoon the separate schools and the 
     <lb/>
     public schools in the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     are exactly the same. Let me quote the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of Archbishop Tache on this point :

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     Now, as to what separate schools ought to

     <lb/>
     in the law, a man tolerant and broad mind-   
     <lb/>
     ed and his opinion ought to be worth some<lb break="no"/>thing to us at this juncture. En passant, I 
     <lb/>
     may say that I wish our hon. friends oppo<lb break="no"/>site would read a little more as to what is 
     <lb/>
     going on in Great Britain and a little less 
     <lb/>
     as to what is going on in the United States, 
     <lb/>
     it they want to form a correct view on 
     <lb/>Canadian political or social issues. Is it not<lb/>strange to see the loyalists on the other side<lb/>of the House being taught the British spirit<lb/>

     and the British constitution by what are

     called the rebel and disloyal members from 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec, yes Sir, taught Bri<lb break="no"/>tish principles by the very men who have 
     <lb/>
     been arraigned in the Toronto ' World ' as 
     <lb/>
     being disloyal to British institutions. I wish 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. members on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the House had a little more of the British 
     <lb/>
     spirit and the British training that we 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians have in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec. If they had, Sir, you would per<lb break="no"/>haps hear a little less of their cries about 
     <lb/>
     loyalty and see in them a little more of the 
     <lb/>
     true spirit of loyalty. Lord Watson, speak<lb break="no"/>ing of the idea of denominational schools

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     I rather think that the original idea of de<lb break="no"/>nominational schools is a school of a sect of

     <lb/>
     should be taught in it, and taught in their own 
     <lb/>
     way—a doctrinal religion ; and not only taught 
     <lb/>
     because religion is taught in a non-sectarian 
     <lb/>
     school, but, in the view of those who founded 
     <lb/>
     denominational schools originally, the theory 
     <lb/>
     was that their views of religion and teaching of 
     <lb/>
     their religion should permeate and run through 
     <lb/>
     all the education given in the school—that,

     the afternoon the schools in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     are practically non-sectarian or neutral 
     <lb/>
     schools. Well, Sir, with regard to neutral 
     <lb/>
     schools, I will give you, not the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     any narrow and illiterate French Canadian, 
     <lb/>
     but the opinion of men on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the Atlantic whose reputation has extended 
     <lb/>
     over the world, and men who belong to the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant sects. Mr. Guizot, a Protestant,

     Now, Sir, what do we Catholics ask for ? 
     <lb/>
     We have not the intention of robbing our 
     <lb/>
     fellow-citizens belonging to different creeds 
     <lb/>
     of the smallest piece of their school rights ; 
     <lb/>
     but we claim ours loudly, as must do free 
     <lb/>
     citizens, and with the calm and confident 
     <lb/>
     conscience of Christians. And, Sir, if the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics have a right to their schools, why 
     <lb/>
     should we not give those schools effectively 
     <lb/>
     to them ? The question is not as to the 
     <lb/>
     merits or the demerits of separate schools ; 
     <lb/>
     yet in passing I may give in a few words 
     <lb/>
     some idea of the character of the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools of Quebec. I shall not speak at 
     <lb/>
     length of the results of the neutral schools 
     <lb/>
     of the United States. I may say this, how<lb break="no"/>ever, that we have seen in that country di<lb break="no"/>vorces increasing, the race difficulty increas<lb break="no"/>ing, the fight between capital and labour in<lb break="no"/>creasing, murders increasing, and religion di<lb break="no"/>minishing. I do not want to insult gratu<lb break="no"/>itously the United States as hon. members 
     <lb/>
     on the other side of the House put it ; but, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, have we not a right to be proud of our 
     <lb/>
     Canadian institutions when we compare 
     <lb/>
     them with the institutions of any other coun<lb break="no"/>try, especially those of the country that is 
     <lb/>
     closest to us, and in the light of the facts 
     <lb/>
     which have been put before the public in 
     <lb/>
     the United States themselves ? I said that 
     <lb/>
     religion was decreasing in the United States, 
     <lb/>
     and I can prove that, not on any Canadian 
     <lb/>
     authority, but on the authority of the New 
     <lb/>
     York ' Telegram,' which in 1896 said that the 
     <lb/>
     number of adherents of all the churches in 
     <lb/>
     the United States does not exceed twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     three millions, that is, one-third of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation. Well, Sir, if that is the way the 
     <lb/>
     United States have succeeded with the sys<lb break="no"/>tem of Godless schools, do you not think 
     <lb/>
     that we have a right in this country to guard 
     <lb/>
     our fellow-citizens against the same system 
     <lb/>
     being imposed upon them ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule) said it was his own business whe<lb break="no"/>ther he thought religious teaching in the 
     <lb/>
     schools was right or wrong. I am proud 
     <lb/>
     to say that I am in favour of religious in<lb break="no"/>struction in schools. Very different from 
     <lb/>
     the attitude of the hon. member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey was the opinion of a Methodist, Dr. 
     <lb/>
     Ryerson, which was quoted at Cornwall on 
     <lb/>
     August 31, 1878, by no other than Sir John 
     <lb/>
     A. Macdonald, whom I hope the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for East Grey will not go back upon. 
     <lb/>
     This is what he said of Dr. Ryerson : 
     <lb/>

     Well, Sir, if Sir John A. Macdonald could 
     <lb/>
     state that the Separate School Bill of 1875, 
     <lb/>
     had widened the basis of education. I do

     House. With regard to the system of 
     <lb/>
     schools in the province of Quebec, I must 
     <lb/>
     say that when we look at the facts and 
     <lb/>
     results of those schools, we have nothing 
     <lb/>
     to be ashamed of. I think our system of 
     <lb/>
     schools can compare with any other system 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion of Canada. If I remember 
     <lb/>
     rightly, the system of schools in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec took the first prize at the 
     <lb/>
     World's Fair of 1893 at Chicago, and I think 
     <lb/>
     it was awarded some medals at the World's 
     <lb/>
     Fair in Paris in 1900 ; and I may say this, 
     <lb/>
     in answer to a reverend gentleman—I think 
     <lb/>
     it was Dr. Salton—who, speaking in Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     said that the morality of Quebec was lower 
     <lb/>
     than that of any other province of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me give you a few statistics, showing 
     <lb/>
     the proportion of convictions in each pro<lb break="no"/>vince. In British Columbia we had one con<lb break="no"/>viction to every 56 inhabitants; in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories one in every 77 ; in Ontario 
     <lb/>
     one in 114 ; in Manitoba one in 115 ; in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick one in 144 ; in Nova Scotia one 
     <lb/>
     in 154. And in that fearfully backward pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, we have only one convic<lb break="no"/>tion in every 176 inhabitants. May I then 
     <lb/>
     be permitted to say that our province can 
     <lb/>
     not be so very far behind in the race, judg<lb break="no"/>ing by the statistics under this head. Then 
     <lb/>
     if we take the expenditure since 1900, we 
     <lb/>
     find that the province of Quebec is, in the 
     <lb/>
     matter of expenditure on public education, 
     <lb/>
     far ahead of any province in the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     If my hon. friend denied that, I have the 
     <lb/>
     figures right here. But I shall not weary 
     <lb/>
     the House by going into them. I may say 
     <lb/>
     too that the number of illiterates has de<lb break="no"/>creased in the province of Quebec in a pro<lb break="no"/>portion far greater than in any other pro<lb break="no"/>vince of the Dominion ; and I am sorry to 
     <lb/>
     say that in that province, where we have 
     <lb/>
     abolished separate schools, the province of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, the number of illiterates 
     <lb/>
     has increased. If my hon. friends from East 
     <lb/>
     Grey (Mr. Sproule) or South York (Mr. Mac<lb break="no"/>lean) will go to the province of Quebec, as 
     <lb/>
     we are not afraid to go to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario ; if they would go before the public 
     <lb/>
     of that province as my hon. friend from La<lb break="no"/>belle (Mr. Bourassa) has gone before the 
     <lb/>
     public of Toronto and Kingston and other 
     <lb/>
     places in Ontario—if they would come to 
     <lb/>
     my poor riding—they would see there schools 
     <lb/>
     where the pupils are not all stupid. They 
     <lb/>
     would see a few presbyteries where the 
     <lb/>
     priests are not totally illiterate but men 
     <lb/>
     of culture and learning, who take an inter<lb break="no"/>est in the education of their province. If the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for South York would only 
     <lb/>
     come to the province of Quebec, he would 
     <lb/>
     see that we have there 5,000 primary schools, 
     <lb/>600 superior primary schools, 3 normal 
     <lb/>schools, one engineering school, 3 schools 
     <lb/>of agriculture, also institutions for the blind, 
     <lb/>the deaf and the dumb—I hope my hon. 
     <lb/>friends opposite would go to one of these 
     <lb/>institutions and be treated for the first of 
     <lb/>these diseases. These are facts which any 
     <lb/>
    
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3758</fw>
          

     province would be proud to put before the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada. But those hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen would sooner shut their eyes and 
     <lb/>
     appeal in their newspapers to public pas<lb break="no"/>sion than take the opportunity to obtain a 
     <lb/>
     little enlightment.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. I would like to

     ask the hon. gentleman if I ever made any 
     <lb/>
     reflection on the public schools of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec.

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. I am not charging 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend with having made any such 
     <lb/>
     reflections in this House, but I say that 
     <lb/>
     he ought to go to the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     and learn something about educational mat<lb break="no"/>ters in this country of ours.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Will the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman let me say that I spend nearly 
     <lb/>
     every summer in the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     and have often been in those presbyteries 
     <lb/>
     to which he has referred. I have met the 
     <lb/>
     reverend gentlemen in charge of them, and 
     <lb/>
     have found them to be such as my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend says they are, so that he is giving 
     <lb/>
     me no enlightenment on that subject. He is 
     <lb/>
     instead putting me in the position of having 
     <lb/>
     said things which I did not say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. I do not know whe<lb break="no"/>ther my hon. friend wishes here to escape 
     <lb/>
     responsibility for the brutal cartoons pub<lb break="no"/>lished in his newspaper the Toronto 'World' 
     <lb/>
     -cartoons in which the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     is represented as an illiterate Indian and 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest as most intelli<lb break="no"/>gent, civilized, and claiming they are white 
     <lb/>
     men. What does that mean if it does not 
     <lb/>
     mean that the inhabitants of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec are of mixed origin ? Sir, I would 
     <lb/>
     be prouder to have in my veins the blood 
     <lb/>
     of the noble red man than the blood of some 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite who write in the 
     <lb/>
     Toronto ' World.' I would wish that every 
     <lb/>
     British colony and every province of 
     <lb/>
     this Dominion were peopled by inhabitants 
     <lb/>
     of as pure an origin and with as pure blood 
     <lb/>
     in their veins as the French inhabitants of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. I would wish that 
     <lb/>
     they could trace as good a genealogy as any 
     <lb/>
     inhabitant of that province is able to trace, 
     <lb/>
     not only in this country but in the country 
     <lb/>
     of his forefathers. The cartoons published 
     <lb/>
     in the Toronto 'Globe' are bold, brutal, 
     <lb/>
     stupid and as untrue as they are stupid. It 
     <lb/>
     appears now that my hon. friend from South 
     <lb/>
     York would lead us to infer that he does not 
     <lb/>
     approve of those cartoons, but I do not know 
     <lb/>
     that he has ever gone back on them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But supposing the schools of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec were as bad as they are described 
     <lb/>
     by hon. members opposite and by some peo<lb break="no"/>ple who write in the Ontario papers, I say 
     <lb/>
     that if we have a system of schools in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec at all we have a right 
     <lb/>
     to-day to be proud, because after the treaty 
     <lb/>
     of Paris in 1763, when the last ship for 
     <lb/>
     France took away from our shores the 
     <lb/>
     nobility and the rich people and left be<lb break="no"/>

     hind the poor peasants, ruined by war, left 
     <lb/>
     with a debt from France of 20 million 
     <lb/>
     francs, a whole cloud of adventurers came 
     <lb/>
     to this country and continued on the ruin of 
     <lb/>
     the poor settlers who were left behind. Then 
     <lb/>
     contrary to the Act of capitulation and the 
     <lb/>
     treaty of Paris, the Catholic institutions 
     <lb/>
     were taken away from the French people. 
     <lb/>
     The system of schools we had then were 
     <lb/>
     taken from us. I should like to give my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend a history of the school system 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec if it were pos<lb break="no"/>sible to enlighten him, because although he 
     <lb/>
     tells us he has spent much time in that 
     <lb/>
     province, it is quite evident that he has not 
     <lb/>
     learnt much. From 1760 to 1800 the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian refused to participate in the 
     <lb/>
     schools then existing, because it was against 
     <lb/>
     their conscience to do so, and I consider 
     <lb/>
     that their ignorance was a glorious one. In 
     <lb/>
     1800 there was a school system established 
     <lb/>
     for which the French Canadians were taxed; 
     <lb/>
     the Royal Institution, in which the money 
     <lb/>
     was given to the Protestant schools and to 
     <lb/>
     them only. Again the French Canadians 
     <lb/>
     refused to attend those schools, because it 
     <lb/>
     was against their conscience to do so, and 
     <lb/>
     they remained in their glorious ignorance. 
     <lb/>
     In 1824 we had the first schools worthy of 
     <lb/>
     the name, but as there was no public money 
     <lb/>
     given them, they could not work very well. 
     <lb/>
     In 1837 our rights were still not recognized 
     <lb/>
     and the Protestant minority had still con<lb break="no"/>trol of the public funds. In 1841 the first 
     <lb/>
     move was made towards giving our people 
     <lb/>
     a schools system which they could support, 
     <lb/>
     and in 1846 we had our separate school sys<lb break="no"/>tem established, and our French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     people could go to schools where their rights 
     <lb/>
     were recognized and which they could at<lb break="no"/>tend without a blush of shame. Considering 
     <lb/>
     that we started our school only in 1846, we 
     <lb/>
     have made marvellous progress and to-day 
     <lb/>
     our system is at the head of the whole con<lb break="no"/>federation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Is that so? I understand 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman to say that their school 
     <lb/>
     system is at the head of the confederation 
     <lb/>
     to-day, and I assume that refers to the 
     <lb/>
     intelligence of the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. If my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     would take the trouble to look into the re<lb break="no"/>ports of public instruction of Quebec he 
     <lb/>
     would learn many things which he will 
     <lb/>
     never see in the Orange 'Sentinel.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. May I ask the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber, if I am not improperly interrupting 
     <lb/>
     him-and I do not wish to do that—to ex<lb break="no"/>plain one point ? He speaks of what he 
     <lb/>
     calls the superior educational system of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec. And, if I followed him closely, 
     <lb/>
     this system has been in operation since 
     <lb/>
     1846—that is, for two generations at least. 
     <lb/>
     How is it, then, that in spite of the excel<lb break="no"/>lence of the system, statistics show that 
     <lb/>
     while the number of those who can read 
     <lb/>
     and write is, in the province of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     72 per cent ; in Prince Edward Island, 75 
     <lb/>

     per cent ; in New Brunswick, 70 per cent ; 
     <lb/>
     in Nova Scotia, 72 per cent ; and in On<lb break="no"/>tario, 80 per cent, Quebec has only 67 per 
     <lb/>
     cent—only 67 out of every 100 people who 
     <lb/>
     can read or write ? These figures do not 
     <lb/>
     indicate that this system has succeeded 
     <lb/>
     very well in doing away with illiteracy in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. I am very glad that 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend (Mr. Sproule) has asked me 
     <lb/>
     that question. I will try to enlighten him 
     <lb/>
     a little further. I said that our system of 
     <lb/>
     schools in Quebec was started in 1846. But 
     <lb/>
     it was not in full operation until 1855. And 
     <lb/>
     then, as my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bourassa) has rightly put it, the people 
     <lb/>
     were for a long time very cautious about 
     <lb/>
     the schools. They had long been tyrannized 
     <lb/>
     over, and they saw in the schools, as they 
     <lb/>
     thought, an instrument to rob them of what 
     <lb/>
     they held dear—their language and their in<lb break="no"/>stitutions. Therefore, it was only slowly 
     <lb/>
     and with great caution that they accepted 
     <lb/>
     the work of the schools. But in 1855 the 
     <lb/>
     system was at work almost as completely 
     <lb/>
     as it is to-day. As to overcoming illiteracy, 
     <lb/>
     we have made greater progress in Quebec 
     <lb/>
     than in any other province. Let me give 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman (Mr. Sproule) the figures. 
     <lb/>
     In 1871, in Quebec, there were of illiterates 
     <lb/>
     -people who could neither read nor write— 
     <lb/>
     35 93 per cent of the population. In 1891 
     <lb/>
     only 29 05 per cent of the population were 
     <lb/>
     illiterate. Thus in the twenty years we 
     <lb/>
     have made progress to the extent of 6 89 per 
     <lb/>
     cent. In Ontario, in 1871, there were 7 90 per 
     <lb/>
     cent of the people who could neither read 
     <lb/>
     nor write. In 1891 this had been reduced 
     <lb/>
     to 7.05 per cent, showing progress to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of only 0.85 per cent. In New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, where there are no separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     they had, in 1871, 14.45 per cent of illiter<lb break="no"/>ates, and in 1891 the proportion was 14.99 
     <lb/>
     per cent, or an absolute retrogression to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of .54 per cent. I do not say that 
     <lb/>
     we lead confederation in the proportion of 
     <lb/>
     our people who can read or write ; but I 
     <lb/>
     do say that we lead in the progress that 
     <lb/>
     we have made in extending the blessings of 
     <lb/>
     education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. gentlemen opposite tell us that we 
     <lb/>
     should have in the Northwest a national 
     <lb/>
     system of schools. Sir, do you call it a 
     <lb/>
     national system of schools which is opposed 
     <lb/>
     to the conscience of 40 per cent of the na<lb break="no"/>tion ? Do you call those national schools 
     <lb/>
     against which 40 per cent of the nation 
     <lb/>
     have fought for more than a century ? I 
     <lb/>
     say that what these hon. gentlemen call 
     <lb/>
     national schools are anti-national schools, 
     <lb/>
     because they are forced upon 40 per cent 
     <lb/>
     of the people against their will ; I say that 
     <lb/>
     what you call free schools are the exact 
     <lb/>
     reverse of free, because they deny the liber<lb break="no"/>ty of the individual and make him a slave 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of the state. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) told us that 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec a Protestant boy 
     <lb/>
     was obliged to go to a Catholic school. But 
     <lb/>
  

            <pb n="3761" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-04_Page_3761.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3761</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 4, 1905</fw> 
          

     is it not a fact that where our Protestant 
     <lb/>
     brothers are in the majority in any part of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec they can have a 
     <lb/>
     separate school of their own ? Is it not a 
     <lb/>
     fact that, even though in any district they 
     <lb/>
     may be in the minority, they can establish 
     <lb/>
     a separate school if they have the certain 
     <lb/>
     small number required by the law ? And 
     <lb/>
     is it not a fact that even where the Protest<lb break="no"/>ants have not the legally required number, 
     <lb/>
     the French Canadians are broad enough to 
     <lb/>
     allow their Protestant brethren to have 
     <lb/>
     schools of their own ? But is it not a fact 
     <lb/>
     —and I wish the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto were here to answer—that where<lb break="no"/>ever the Catholics are in a majority in any 
     <lb/>
     district in the Northwest, they have not the 
     <lb/>
     right to establish a separate school, but are 
     <lb/>
     obliged to go to the public schools ? The 
     <lb/>
     treatment meted out to the minority in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and in the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     cannot be compared. Sir, it is as bad to 
     <lb/>
     force the Catholic to send his child to a 
     <lb/>
     school where no religion is taught as to 
     <lb/>
     force him to send that child to a school 
     <lb/>
    where a religion opposed to his own is 
     <lb/>taught. That is the Catholic doctrine ; I 
     <lb/>wish that my hon. friend would understand 
     <lb/> it once for all. We object, not only to being 
     <lb/>obliged to send Catholic children to Pro<lb break="no"/>testant schools, but to being obliged to send 
     <lb/>them to schools where no religion is taught. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Sir, as a French Canadian who has studied 
     <lb/>
     and learned something of British institu<lb break="no"/>tions, and who is loyal to the institutions 
     <lb/>
     given this Dominion by the mother coun<lb break="no"/>try, because he has studied them and be<lb break="no"/>lieves in them, I may ask my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from North Toronto what is British liberty 
     <lb/>
     if the Catholics are not allowed to have 
     <lb/>
     their own schools ? Is not that political 
     <lb/>
     liberty the pride of Englishmen, inclusive 
     <lb/>
     and widely tolerant? Is it a selfish and 
     <lb/>
     narrow liberty, in some sort Protestant 
     <lb/>
     and privileged, and which is only a means 
     <lb/>
     to better shackle some of the people with 
     <lb/>
     the heavy chains of an intolerable despot<lb break="no"/>ism ? Where is the British liberty, I ask these 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen, if the minority, because it 
     <lb/>
     is a minority, cannot enjoy the liberties 
     <lb/>
     which were promised them in the name of 
     <lb/>
     the Sovereign, and which have been formal<lb break="no"/>ly declared in the mandates of that 
     <lb/>
     Sovereign ? Sir, if this House were to fol<lb break="no"/>low racial appeals, the appeals made to pre<lb break="no"/>judice by the hon. member for East Grey, 
     <lb/>
     it would only serve to remind us that we 
     <lb/>
     were the vanquished in 1759. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I desire at once and 
     <lb/>
     flatly to contradict the hon. member (Mr. A. 
     <lb/>
     Lavergne), and to repeat, what I have sald 
     <lb/>
     before, that I never made an appeal to either 
     <lb/>
     race or religion. I call upon the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber to withdraw his statement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. I expected that 
     <lb/>
     denial, and now I am going to prove what 
     <lb/>
     I have said. There is a newspaper called 
     <lb/>
     the 'Sentinel' published in Toronto. It 
     <lb/>
     claims to be the organ of the Orange Order, 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3762</fw>
       

     with which, I understand, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Sproule) has something to do. 
     <lb/>
     Of course, I do not wish to say anything 
     <lb/>
     against the character of my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule). In the province of Quebec, it is 
     <lb/>
     true, that he has a bad reputation, I must 
     <lb/>
     say ; but we who know him know that he 
     <lb/>
     is a good man, and know that he would not 
     <lb/>
     hurt a fly. But in my province we are 
     <lb/>
     often asked : 'You know the member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey better than we do; is it not 
     <lb/>
     true that the Yellow Pope has certain 
     <lb/>
     Peter's pence and is obliged to earn his 
     <lb/>
     money, and that is why he is so violent 
     <lb/>
     against the Catholics and the Romish 
     <lb/>
     Church. In this organ of the Orange Order 
     <lb/>
     —the 'Yellow Hierarchy,' as my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) calls it—in its 
     <lb/>
     issue of March 16th, 1905, I find Brother D. 
     <lb/>
     Pritchard, grand treasurer, quoted as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :

     more than by any other means we may hope 
     <lb/>
     to build up a united people. One school and

     And he adds, the English language is to

     be the one to be taught. Well, Sir, what 
     <lb/>
     does that mean? Does it mean that the

     French language, which is an official lan<lb break="no"/>guage in Canada as well as the English, is 
     <lb/>
     to be abolished by the Orange order when 
     <lb/>
     they get into power ? I can make nothing 
     <lb/>
     else out of it. On February 23, 1905, the

     Reverend Brother Hughes—no, not <choice><sic>Reverned</sic><corr>Reverend</corr></choice> 
     <lb/>
     Brother Hughes, M.P., at a banquet in

     Brantford, gave the history of the Orange 
     <lb/>
     movement and its fight against the Romish 
     <lb/>
     church, and asked all the members to main<lb break="no"/>tain their principles, even if the occasion 
     <lb/>
     demanded that they fought for them. Well, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, I do not say that a man has not a right 
     <lb/>
     to fight for his principles, but I am not quite 
     <lb/>
     sure that the hon. gentleman means a con<lb break="no"/>stitutional fight. I am afraid that he is 
     <lb/>
     appealing to the Orange lodges to fight an<lb break="no"/>other battle of the Boyne. Well, here is 
     <lb/>
     something more. If there is one right of a 
     <lb/>
     British subject which has been claimed by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for East Grey on many 
     <lb/>
     occasions during this session, it is the right 
     <lb/>
     of petition. After the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     began to petition like British subjects for 
     <lb/>
     the maintenance of separate schools in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest, the 'Orange Sentinel' of March 
     <lb/>
     23, 1905, contained the following. under the

     title, 'The glove is thrown down':

     It goes on to ask the Protestants to unite

     and destroy Rome and Quebec. Now, Sir, is 
     <lb/>
     not that language an appeal to racial pre<lb break="no"/>judices? Is it not an appeal to religious 
     <lb/>
     prejudices ? Is it not designed to set race

     against race, creed against creed ? Sir, we

     saw in the paper which is the organ of the

     <lb/>
     East Grey is the Grand Master, language 
     <lb/>
     such as I have quoted, and am I not right

     therefore in saying that the hon. gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     if not in this House, at least in his paper,

     for the sentiments of every one who writes

     us today. That is the position in which

     we are not slaves but partners. In the com<lb break="no"/>pact of confederation we took our part, and 
     <lb/>
     in that compact the French Canadians are 
     <lb/>
     treated as partners. We have been loyal

     loyal to the Canadian constitution. We claim

     of war and rebellion. You have never 
     <lb/>
     heard from the pulpits of our churches the 
     <lb/>
     speeches which have been made in other 
     <lb/>
     churches or in lodges. We submit to the 
     <lb/>
     law. We may oppose the law, we may 
     <lb/>
     conduct a constitutional agitation against 
     <lb/>
     it, but you never heard on our side talk of 
     <lb/>
     war or rebellion because the majority was 
     <lb/>
     against us. We respect the majority, but 
     <lb/>
     it is strange to observe the attitude of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the other side of the House. 
     <lb/>
     When they have the majority with them they 
     <lb/>
     claim that the majority has every right, but 
     <lb/>
     when the majority is against them they 
     <lb/>
     say that they will make war against the

     majority. There is only one right that I 
     <lb/>
     do not recognize in the majority and that 
     <lb/>
     is the right to bring compulsion to bear 
     <lb/>
     upon me in a matter of conscience. If 
     <lb/>
     there are three or four men against me I 
     <lb/>
     say they have no right to endeavour to force 
     <lb/>
     me to do something which I feel that I 
     <lb/>
     cannot conscientiously do. Therefore, I say 
     <lb/>
     in conclusion that in view of all the facts 
     <lb/>
     we should give to the minority in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories their rights generously, not 
     <lb/>
     the shadow of justice, not the mere form of 
     <lb/>
     liberty. We are told that there are only 
     <lb/>
     ten or twelve separate schools in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. Well, Sir, I claim that 
     <lb/>
     it" there was only one separate school in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories we should just the 
     <lb/>
     same render justice to: the minority in respect 
     <lb/>
     to that one school. Is it that the principle of 
     <lb/>
     liberty and of right is to be decided on 
     <lb/>
     the ground of the strength or" those claim<lb break="no"/>ing it to obtain and maintain it? I say 
     <lb/>
     that we should give right to those to whom 
     <lb/>
     it is due and not only to those who have 
     <lb/>
     the strength to maintain their rights. If 
     <lb/>
     there were only one separate school in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories we would be 
     <lb/>
     obliged to do the minority justice the same 
     <lb/>
     as if there were a hundred separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. But, there is more than one and 
     <lb/>
     there would be even more than there are 
     <lb/>
     to—day if by the ordinances of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories the Catholics were not 
     <lb/>
     forced to send their children to the public 
     <lb/>
     schools. It the ordinances which have been 
     <lb/>
     adopted in the Northwest Territories pre<lb break="no"/>vent Catholics from constituting separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, I think it is unfair and unjust to 
     <lb/>
     use that as an argument against them and 
     <lb/>
     to say that there are not enough separate 
     <lb/>
     schools and that therefore we should not 
     <lb/>
     render them the justice to which they are 
     <lb/>
     entitled. Give generously to the minority in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest the right which are due them. 
     <lb/>
     Give them these rights first, because by so 
     <lb/>
     doing we are carrying out the principles of 
     <lb/>
     liberty. Give them these rights because we 
     <lb/>
     owe some gratitude to the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec. And here, I will call the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House to a statement which I am sure 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
     <lb/>
     will not deny. On the 12th July, 1902, which 
     <lb/>
     is a great day, Mr. Robinson who was then 
     <lb/>
     the member for West Elgin, speaking to the 
     <lb/>
     Orangemen in st. Thomas, Ontario, said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     We know that the French of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     have kept this vast Dominion to the British

     empire ; for if these Frenchmen had not been 
     <lb/>

     If this opinion could be expressed to

     tre it has been painted in the Toronto 
     <lb/>
     'World,' but which is the hierarchy which 
     <lb/>
     has kept its people faithful to the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown on many an occasion as my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) has 
     <lb/>
     said. I wish to take the part of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Labelle who has been attacked 
     <lb/>
     in the Ontario papers lately and to say that 
     <lb/>
     he. belongs to a family which has always 
     <lb/>
     been loyal to the British Crown. When the 
     <lb/>
     English Protestant minority of Quebec in 
     <lb/>
     1776 did not know which way to turn, 
     <lb/>
     when as we say in French, they did not 
     <lb/>
     know whether to cry 'Vive la Ligue' or 
     <lb/>
     'Vive Le Roi,' the great grandfather of my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend was on the side of the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown and against the American rebels 
     <lb/>
     and with another French Canadian, La<lb break="no"/>mothe, he carried despatches from Montreal 
     <lb/>
     through the American lines to the English 
     <lb/>
     general in Quebec. Another of my fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     countrymen, Bouchette, brought the English 
     <lb/>
     governor into the besieged city of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     Ever since those days in 1760 when Canada 
     <lb/>
     was ceded to the British Crown we have 
     <lb/>
     kept our compact faithfully, and I main<lb break="no"/>tain that we have a right to claim that 
     <lb/>
     justice should be done to us as we have de<lb break="no"/>served. In finishing my speech, which I can<lb break="no"/>not help but feel has been too lengthy, I de<lb break="no"/>sire to make a comparison. Not far from 
     <lb/>
     here is the great river St. Lawrence which 
     <lb/>
     Separates us from the Anglo-Saxon Republic 
     <lb/>
     to the south. Sweeping past the foot of 
     <lb/>
     the hill upon which this building stands is 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa river which separates the French 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec from the English pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario. These two rivers con<lb break="no"/>verge near the city of Montreal and for a 
     <lb/>
     long time their waters run together With<lb break="no"/>out mixing. On the one side we have the 
     <lb/>
     dark coloured waters of the Ottawa river 
     <lb/>
     and on the other the silvery, bright waters 
     <lb/>
     or the St. Lawrence. They float together 
     <lb/>
     to a common destiny. Is not that the image 
     <lb/>
     of this Dominion of ours ? We have two 
     <lb/>
     nations floating together, not mixing the 
     <lb/>
     one with the other; on the one side the 
     <lb/>
     French race, on the other side the English 
     <lb/>
     nation, on the one side the Protestant creed, 
     <lb/>
     on the other side the Catholic creed. Well, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, could we not model this country after 
     <lb/>
     these beautiful rivers of ours ' Could we 
     <lb/>
     not together float away to a common destiny 
     <lb/>
     without mixing, without amalgamating the 
     <lb/>
     one with the other, and if we do I predict 
     <lb/>
     for this country, which is my country and 
     <lb/>
     to which I am as loyal as any man, a glor<lb break="no"/>ious destiny and in the name of nations a. 
     <lb/>
     glorious immortality.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. I am sure that 
     <lb/>
     our young friend was educated in a national 
     <lb/>
     school. If the same harmony could be 
     <lb/>
     maintained in regard to the affairs of this 
     <lb/>
     country as that which has been manifested 
     <lb/>
     by our young friend in regard to the English 
     <lb/>
     and the French languages, the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada might look forward to a great fu<lb break="no"/>ture for this Dominion. Unfortunately we 
     <lb/>
     find that gentlemen who speak that lang<lb break="no"/>uage, who are of that grand race, a race 
     <lb/>
     with which I claim kindred just as much 
     <lb/>
     as hon. gentlemen who sit on the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the House, displaying a different 
     <lb/>
     spirit outside of this House. If these gentle<lb break="no"/>men would be moderate and show the same 
     <lb/>
     spirit on the platforms and hustings in Que<lb break="no"/>bec and up and down the side roads of that 
     <lb/>
     province, and if they would confine them<lb break="no"/>selves to the same tone as that in which 
     <lb/>
     they address this House it would angur 
     <lb/>
     well for the future of this country. One 
     <lb/>
     would imagine from the remarks of the 
     <lb/>
     young speaker, that we were discussing the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec. I understand that these 
     <lb/>
     Bills with which we are dealing are for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of erecting two new provinces in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest of the Dominion of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and that the province of Quebec has nothing 
     <lb/>
     to do with this any more than any other 
     <lb/>
     province in the Dominion. No attack is 
     <lb/>
     being made on the rights and liberties of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec ; these rights and 
     <lb/>
     liberties are guaranteed by the articles of 
     <lb/>
     conquest and by the Confederation Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question now before the House, sim<lb break="no"/>mered down to a nut shell is as to the au<lb break="no"/>thority, the duty, the policy of this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to enforce separate schools on the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories. The right hon. the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the government told us that this 
     <lb/>
     was a question of the constitution, but his 
     <lb/>
     colleagues have told us that it is not a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the constitution in any sense what<lb break="no"/>ever. One of the ministers ventured to think  
     <lb/>
     that vested rights should he considered but 
     <lb/>
     that plea was abandoned when it was found  
     <lb/>
     that although the Roman Catholics have had  
     <lb/>
     every facility for years to establish separate  
     <lb/>
     schools there are only ten such separate 
     <lb/>
     schools as compared with over 1,000 public 
     <lb/>
     schools in the Northwest Territories. There<lb break="no"/>fore, the question simmers itself down to 
     <lb/>
     one of policy. Now, let us suppose for a 
     <lb/>
     moment that it was our clear duty under the 
     <lb/>
     constitution to establish separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     would our best method be to proceed with 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3768</fw>
         

     a bludgeon in the shape of this Act of par<lb break="no"/>liament held over the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west to force separate schools upon them ? 
     <lb/>
     Would it not be better to omit from this 
     <lb/>
     Bill altogether any provision with regard 
     <lb/>
     to separate schools, and leave it to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the new provinces to carry out the 
     <lb/>
     constitution, for until the first meeting of 
     <lb/>
     the legislative assembly of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces the Act of 1875 will be continued in 
     <lb/>
     force, and would remain in force unless re<lb break="no"/>pealed by the assembly. Sir, when the Bill 
     <lb/>
     now before the House becomes law it 
     <lb/>
     will force on the people of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces the full enactment of the School 
     <lb/>
    Act of 1875, and nothing but mischief 
     <lb/>can result. If the Prime Minister is 
     <lb/>right in his argument, that by the con<lb break="no"/>stitution we are bound to give the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces separate schools, then the provinces 
     <lb/>cannot repeal this law and it will stand for 
     <lb/>ever on the statute-books. If the Prime 
     <lb/>Minister has any confidence in his conten<lb break="no"/>tion, why should he not withdraw his edu<lb break="no"/>cational clause altogether from the Act and 
     <lb/>avoid all the bickering, the heart burnings, 
     <lb/>the contentious spirit that permeates the Do<lb break="no"/>minion of Canada to-day. If it is a question 
     <lb/>of policy, and we maintain that it is, then 
     <lb/>coercion–I think that is the proper term to 
     <lb/>use in relation to this clause—coercion is not 
     <lb/>in conformity with provincial rights ; it 
     <lb/>transgresses the principle of provincial 
     <lb/>rights at the very outset. This is not good 
     <lb/>legislation, as I shall prove from the Prime 
     <lb/>Minister's own lips. It interferes with the 
     <lb/>rights of man as well as with the rights of 
     <lb/>provinces, but over and above all this ques<lb break="no"/>tion of coercion there stands another issue. 
     <lb/>The Prime Minister has instructed the 
     <lb/>House on some of the principles of the 
     <lb/>Roman Catholic religion ; he has told us that 
     <lb/>in addition to the pure question of religion 
     <lb/>there is the great question of dogma which 
     <lb/>enters into the notion of those that hold that 
     <lb/>faith. With the question of religion, with 
     <lb/>the relationship existing between a man's 
     <lb/>conscience and his God I have nothing to 
     <lb/>do. I never allowed any other man to in<lb break="no"/>terfere in the relationship existing between 
     <lb/>my conscience and my God, and I never in<lb break="no"/>sulted any man by interfering with him in 
     <lb/>that respect. But in relation of the question 
     <lb/>of dogma, that is the business end of the 
     <lb/>proposition, and when any church corpor<lb break="no"/>ation—be it Methodist, Roman Catholic, 
     <lb/>Presbyterian or any other—just the same 
     <lb/>as any railway corporation comes before the 
     <lb/>people of this country for legislation, it is 
     <lb/>the bounden duty of every man who com<lb break="no"/>mands his own self respect to deal with it, 
     <lb/>not on the sentimental issue, not to bow 
     <lb/>down before the cry that the church is be<lb break="no"/>hind the organization ; but to deal with it on 
     <lb/>the basis of what is right and what is 
     <lb/>wrong, and considering what is in the best 
     <lb/>interests of the Dominion of Canada and of 
     <lb/>her entire people. On these lines I purpose 
     <lb/>dealing with this question. Taking it as a

     question of dogma, as one who does not want 
     <lb/>
     to grow up in enmity with his Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic neighbour ; as one who does not want to 
     <lb/>
     pass through the world with the people 
     <lb/>
     divided on creed lines, I maintain that when 
     <lb/>
     we coerce the provinces to accept these 
     <lb/>
     separate schools, we are retarding for ever 
     <lb/>
     .the wheels of progress and the up-building 
     <lb/>
     of the national life within these provinces. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think the union of church and state 
     <lb/>
     is for the best interests of humanity. The 
     <lb/>
     nations of the old land have given it up, 
     <lb/>
     and why this young country should adopt 
     <lb/>
     the fads and practices that have been dis<lb break="no"/>carded in Europe is beyond my comprehen<lb break="no"/>sion. I am opposed to this parliament forc<lb break="no"/>ing on any province, against its will, a union 
     <lb/>
     of church and state. By the enactment of 
     <lb/>
     this law, this parliament is placing a blanket 
     <lb/>
     mortgage on the two provinces of the North<lb break="no"/>west which will remain on them to the end 
     <lb/>
     of time and which can never be paid off. 
     <lb/>
     I object in general terms to this legislation. 
     <lb/>
     It is contrary to the spirit of a free parlia<lb break="no"/>ment; it is contrary to the spirit of a free 
     <lb/>
     people. I am afraid that I shall not be able 
     <lb/>
     to bring to bear on this great question the 
     <lb/>
     deeply sanctified and the emotional Christian 
     <lb/>
     spirit displayed by the Prime Minister ; nor

     <lb/>it in a reflective mood. and after the beauti<lb break="no"/>ful exhibition of christian spirit and brother<lb break="no"/>ly love displayed here one evening by the 
     <lb/>Minister of Justice, I went home and re<lb break="no"/>flected and this is the result.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. You should reflect 
     <lb/>
     oftener.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. Perhaps so. The 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice on that occasion dis<lb break="no"/>played on the floor of parliament all the old 
     <lb/>
     time characteristics of the Champlain street 
     <lb/>
     youngster, and he displayed them to the 
     <lb/>
     great edification of the people of this coun<lb break="no"/>try. Nor, Sir, can I bring to bear on this 
     <lb/>
     question the speculative opinions of the Post<lb break="no"/>master General, who has had such an ample 
     <lb/>
     training working hand in hand with the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant Protective Association organiz<lb break="no"/>ation of the province of Ontario throughout 
     <lb/>
     the length and breadth of many constitu<lb break="no"/>encies. Nor can I bring to bear on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject the illogical fanticism or the sparkling 
     <lb/>
     distortion of established facts displayed by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). 
     <lb/>
    I shall endeavour to discuss these questions 
     <lb/>
  
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3770</fw>
         
     without any appeal to prejudice, but simply 
     <lb/>
     on the basis of what are the facts, and what 
     <lb/>
     is for the best interests of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories which are being erected into two 
     <lb/>
     provinces, and for the best interests of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the whole Dominion of Canada.

            <p>
     Now, I trust that the Prime Minister will 
     <lb/>
     excuse me for bringing to his mind some of 
     <lb/>
     his old speeches. In this connection, I may 
     <lb/>
     say that the young gentleman from Mont<lb break="no"/>magny (Mr. Lavergne) struck the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister a very heavy blow beneath the belt 
     <lb/>
     when, in referring to the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Toronto, he said that a man of prin<lb break="no"/>ciples always stuck to his principles, and 
     <lb/>
     never wavered. While saying that, he looked 
     <lb/>
     across to this side of the House, but I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that the Prime Minister, in his heart 
     <lb/>
     of hearts, felt that the reflection was upon 
     <lb/>
     himself and his friends on that side of the 
     <lb/>
     House, who have been 'everything by turns 
     <lb/>
     and nothing long,' and who have never 
     <lb/>
     known where they stood on questions of 
     <lb/>
     principle. On March 3, 1896, the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, as reported in 'Hansard' 
     <lb/>
     at page 2737-8 addressing the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     government of that day said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The hon. gentleman is aware—more than any<lb break="no"/>body else, perhaps, he ought to be aware—that 
     <lb/>
     in a community with a free government, in a 
     <lb/>
     free country like this, upon any question in<lb break="no"/>volving different conceptions of what is right 
     <lb/>
     or wrong, different standards of what is just or

     force the views of any section, but to endeavour

            <p>
     I heartily commend these words to the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister to-day. What are the facts 
     <lb/>
     in regard to this question ? The Hudson 
     <lb/>
     Bay Territory was taken over by the impe<lb break="no"/>rial authorities and transferred by them to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian authorities. I shall not enter 
     <lb/>
     into a description of those vast territories 
     <lb/>
     and their latent resources, and the great 
     <lb/>
    wealth that lies there to be deve<lb break="no"/>loped. These are all well known to 
     <lb/>all the members of this House. Those 
     <lb/>territories were united with the Dominion 
     <lb/>of Canada, and in that Act of union, al<lb break="no"/>though it was known and intended that they 
     <lb/>were sooner or later to be erected into pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, there was no mention of separate 
     <lb/>schools. They were given a constitution by 
     <lb/>the Dominion parliament, and, inasmuch as 
     <lb/>the few people living in the territories spoke 
     <lb/>the French language, the people of Canada 
     <lb/>allowed them to have their own schools. 
     <lb/>That, and that alone, was the reason why 
     <lb/>those schools were given to those people 
     <lb/>without any serious opposition. My hon. 
     <lb/>friend from Montmagny is in error in say<lb break="no"/>ing that it was thought at that time that 
     <lb/>those territories were going to become 
     <lb/>French and Roman Catholic. It was under<lb break="no"/>stood that there would be a large French 
     <lb/>settlement in the province of Manitoba ; but 
     <lb/>with regard to the territories, the under<lb break="no"/>standing from one end of the Dominion to 
     <lb/>

     the other,—and our friends in Quebec knew 
     <lb/>
     it, and they know it to-day,—was that they 
     <lb/>
     would become settled by a large English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking population. That was one reason 
     <lb/>
     why our French friends at that time claim<lb break="no"/>ed that the boundaries of Manitoba should 
     <lb/>
     be enlarged, so that it, being regarded to a 
     <lb/>
     large extent as a French province, would 
     <lb/>
     have more room for development ; but the 
     <lb/>
     expectation was that the new territories 
     <lb/>
     would become English. They were given sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools more on the ground of lan<lb break="no"/>guage than of creed. The teachers in those 
     <lb/>
     schools were principally the priests of the 
     <lb/>
     various localities. There were only five or 
     <lb/>
     six hundred families in all the territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A comparison has been drawn between the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools of the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     and those of the province of Ontario. We 
     <lb/>
     are told that the English minority in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec were granted certain 
     <lb/>
     privileges. Let me tell the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Labelle and the hon. member for Mont<lb break="no"/>magny that the concession in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec was not to the English minority, 
     <lb/>
     but to the French Roman Catholic majority. 
     <lb/>
     At the time of the conquest they were 
     <lb/>
     granted the rights and liberties that had 
     <lb/>
     been won under the auspices of the gentle<lb break="no"/>man under whom my good friend from East 
     <lb/>
     Grey (Mr. Sproule) gets the credit of serv<lb break="no"/>ing, whose memory he reveres—William 
     <lb/>
     Prince of Orange. It was William Prince 
     <lb/>
     of Orange who gave to the British nation 
     <lb/>
     the liberties they enjoy to-day ; and when 
     <lb/>
     Quebec capitulated, the liberties which had 
     <lb/>
     been guaranteed to humanity of all creeds 
     <lb/>
     and all races were given to the people of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec, and have been reli<lb break="no"/>giously observed from that day to the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time. And let me tell the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Labelle and the hon. member for Mont<lb break="no"/>magny that if any one undertakes to de<lb break="no"/>prive our French Canadian fellow country<lb break="no"/>men in the province of Quebec, of the slight<lb break="no"/>est liberty that has been granted to them 
     <lb/>
     under the British constitution, my good 
     <lb/>
     friend the member for East Grey is sworn 
     <lb/>
     to marshall his boys and go down to their 
     <lb/>
     relief, not to their injury. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURE1">Mr. BUREAU</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. So that my good 
     <lb/>
     friend from Three Rivers (Mr. Bureau) need 
     <lb/>
     not have any nightmares about the orange<lb break="no"/>men from the province of Ontario. When 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and Quebec became parts of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada, each had its own 
     <lb/>
     separate school system established by law. 
     <lb/>
     When New Brunswick became part of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada, it had its own school 
     <lb/>
     system established by the votes of its own 
     <lb/>
     people. When Nova Scotia and Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island came in, each had its own 
     <lb/>
     school system established by the votes of 
     <lb/>
     its own people. The Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     occupy an entirely different position. They 
     <lb/>
     came into the Dominion away back in 1870. 
     <lb/>
     They had no school system anterior to the 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3772</fw>
        

     union. The school system that was given 
     <lb/>
     to them, as given without a vote by a 
     <lb/>
     human being in those territories, and that 
     <lb/>
     system has been continued ever since ; the 
     <lb/>
     only difference being that when they became 
     <lb/>
     organized and were represented in this par<lb break="no"/>liament, their representatives had a voice 
     <lb/>
     in the making of the laws which applied to 
     <lb/>
     them. At the present time we are not unit<lb break="no"/>ing those territories to the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada ; we are only transforming them into 
     <lb/>
     provinces, and the people of the whole of 
     <lb/>
     Canada have the making of their charter, 
     <lb/>
     not the people of the territories themselves. 
     <lb/>
     What we contend is that in granting them 
     <lb/>
     their charter, we must apply the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, so far as it relates to the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is the point of diiference we make 
     <lb/>
     between the union of the Territories as 
     <lb/>
     such with confederation and their entry 
     <lb/>
     into it as provinces. There is no union of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories, as provinces, with confed<lb break="no"/>eration. They came into confederation as 
     <lb/>
     Territories. and their creation as provinces 
     <lb/>
     is merely a development. I chanced to be 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest, during the months of De<lb break="no"/>cember and November when the question of 
     <lb/>
     the new autonomy Bills was being discussed. 
     <lb/>
     As I passed along, I heard mention of mys<lb break="no"/>terious trips taken by the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     here and there throughout the country, but 
     <lb/>
     not taken where he could consult his Fin<lb break="no"/>ance Minister or his Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior or his following in the House or Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain and his cabinet in the Territories. 
     <lb/>
     It was understood then that there was ques<lb break="no"/>tion of a clause being put into the measure 
     <lb/>
     creating the new provinces, fastening upon 
     <lb/>
     these provinces separate schools. Last De<lb break="no"/>cember, when that probability was mentioned 
     <lb/>
     to the followers of the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     in this House, they scoffed at the idea. They 
     <lb/>
     said that he who had been the champion of 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy in 1896, who had de<lb break="no"/>claimed then against the coercion of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, who had advocated the policy of hands 
     <lb/>
     off Manitoba, was not likely to consent to 
     <lb/>
     anything which would fetter these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and prevent them from working out 
     <lb/>
     freely their own destinies along the lines he 
     <lb/>
     had laid down with regard to Manitoba in 
     <lb/>
     1896. In that year of 1896, I considered it 
     <lb/>
     my duty to oppose the Bill of my own lead<lb break="no"/>er (Sir Charles Tupper) just as I opposed the 
     <lb/>
     resolution of the right hon. gentleman, and 
     <lb/>
     I opposed both on the ground that I would 
     <lb/>
     vote against any attempt to coerce Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. On that occasion I took a unique 
     <lb/>
     position and have seen no ground for chang<lb break="no"/>ing any of the sentiments I then uttered. 
     <lb/>
     I took the ground then that the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba should be free, that the people 
     <lb/>
     there were eminently well fitted to work out 
     <lb/>
     their own destiny, and should not be fet<lb break="no"/>tered or hampered by the federal power in 
     <lb/>
     that work ; and I would have supported the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman on that occasion, had 
     <lb/>
     his resolution tallied with his professions in 
     <lb/>
     the country. But his declaration to the 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="3773" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-04_Page_3773.jpg"/>

     province of Quebec then was : Put me in 
     <lb/>
    power and I will give the minority in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba greater privileges than they can pos<lb break="no"/>sibly secure from a Tory government. I 
     <lb/>will give them a Bill that will be of some 
     <lb/>service ; while in the provinces of Manitoba 
     <lb/>and Ontario, the cry of himself and his col<lb break="no"/>leagues was: Hands off Manitoba; no 
     <lb/>coercion of free men in the west ; we must 
     <lb/>never bow to the Roman Catholic bishops 
     <lb/>of the province of Quebec ; but must show 
     <lb/>ourselves free men. Much as I wished to 
     <lb/>follow my right hon. friend on that occa<lb break="no"/>sion, there was such great divergence be<lb break="no"/>tween the position he took in Quebec and 
     <lb/>that which he took elsewhere that I was 
     <lb/>not prepared to give him the opportunity 
     <lb/>of coercing Manitoba and consequently 
     <lb/>voted against his resolution as I did against 
     <lb/>the Bill of my own leader. The stand I 
     <lb/>then took was that if the people of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince wanted separate schools, let them es<lb break="no"/>tablish that system themselves ; but if they 
     <lb/>did not, I was determined to defeat any at<lb break="no"/>tempt to place upon that province the bur<lb break="no"/>den of separate schools against its will. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>We may very well ask whence comes this 
     <lb/>demand for this clause in the Bill. I have 
     <lb/>pointed out that the moment those Terri<lb break="no"/>tories become provinces, they have the Act 
     <lb/>of 1875 on their statutes. Supposing the 
     <lb/>educational clauses should be withdrawn en<lb break="no"/>tirely from this measure, the Act of 1875 
     <lb/>will still remain. Therefore if the conten<lb break="no"/>tion of the First Minister be right, if the 
     <lb/>Act of 1875 is the constitution in those Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories to-day and will be the constitution 
     <lb/>of those provinces when created, what has 
     <lb/>he to fear ? If on the other hand, the con<lb break="no"/>tention of my hon. friend the leader of the 
     <lb/>opposition is correct and it will be within 
     <lb/>the powers of those provinces to abrogate 
     <lb/>that law if they choose, why insist upon 
     <lb/>embodying it in this Bill. The Act of the 
     <lb/>First Minister is, I submit, irritating, illegal 
     <lb/>and unconstitutional.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The right hon. gentleman did not consult 
     <lb/>his Finance Minister in relation to the fin<lb break="no"/>ancial clauses nor did he consult his Minister 
     <lb/>of the Interior with regard to the education<lb break="no"/>al clause. He did not consult the men be<lb break="no"/>hind him with regard to this measure. I 
     <lb/>am told that he did not dare to call his party 
     <lb/>together in caucus and consult them. Whom 
     <lb/>then did he consult? Is there any truth in 
     <lb/>the rumour that my right hon. friend had 
     <lb/>for his adviser a gentleman who does not   
     <lb/>owe allegiance to the Dominion and that 
     <lb/>he takes trips to the shores of the Rideau 
     <lb/>and there receives his inspiration ? I have 
     <lb/>not the slightest fault to find with any 
     <lb/>church—either the Church of Rome or the 
     <lb/>Methodist church which is my own or any 
     <lb/>other—for taking all it can get from weak- 
     <lb break="yes"/>backed politicians. Any church will do that. 
     <lb/>We have seen in the province of Ontario, 
     <lb/>Protestant churches taking sops from the 
     <lb/>provincial government and giving in return 
     <lb/>their support to the government. We have 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3774</fw>
         

     seen the hierarchy of Rome do the same 
     <lb/>
     thing—and I make use of that word in the 
     <lb/>
     same sense as hon. gentlemen in that church 
     <lb/>
     use it. The churches are just the same as 
     <lb/>
     electric companies and railway companies 
     <lb/>
     and other corporations. They will take all 
     <lb/>
     they can get and ask for more. It is not the 
     <lb/>
     hierarchy of Rome but the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     government and his colleagues whom the 
     <lb/>
     people will hold responsible, and it is they 
     <lb/>
     who will have to stand the consequences. 
     <lb/>
     For my part I do not blame the churches 
     <lb/>
     for taking all they can get from weak-backed 
     <lb/>
     and weak-kneed politicians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In his speech introducing the Bill now be<lb break="no"/>fore the House, the right hon. gentleman al<lb break="no"/>luded to the separate schools in the United 
     <lb/>
     States, and I must say that, as an old pub<lb break="no"/>lic school teacher, my blood boiled when he 
     <lb/>
     referred to that system in the United States 
     <lb/>
     in the way he did, and incidentally con<lb break="no"/>demned public schools the world over. In 
     <lb/>
     the past the right hon. gentleman was more 
     <lb/>
     less inclined to look to American institu<lb break="no"/>tions. In the old days we had him and his 
     <lb/>
     followers looking to Washington until they 
     <lb/>
     got turned down, and I am satisfied that 
     <lb/>
     whatever may be or may have been his 
     <lb/>
     views with regard to that great nation in 
     <lb/>
     the past, he will not dispute one word I am 
     <lb/>
     about to quote from a well known authority 
     <lb/>
     regarding the value of the public schools of 
     <lb/>
     that country. But before doing that, I may 
     <lb/>
     take the liberty of quoting what Mr. Morley, 
     <lb/>
     a friend of the right hon. gentleman, says 
     <lb/>
     in the 19th Century of the great American 
     <lb/>
     republic. In a recent issue of that review, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Morley says :

     Of a democracy originally British, the most

     I do this not to attack the religion of any       
     <lb/>
     body of people, for the question of dogma     
     <lb/>
     has nothing to do with religion. If any    
     <lb/>
    man is interfered with in the free exercise        
     <lb/>of his religion, that interference should not    
     <lb/>for a moment be permitted. If in a matter        
     <lb/>of conscience any one were to attempt to       
     <lb/>interfere with the right hon. Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister, I would be ready to resent that inter<lb break="no"/>ference and to put the one interfering in      
     <lb/>his proper place. But, if the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister says : This is my dogma and you  
     <lb/>must bow to it, and if we do bow to it, what       
     <lb/>limit can we place upon demands of this         
     <lb/>kind ? Why, we should see repeated over       
     <lb/>and over the humiliating spectacle of the           
     <lb/>Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) who says:        
     <lb/>we must yield because forty-one per cent        
     <lb/>of the people demand it. And next month        
     <lb/>they may demand something else, and so on ;         
     <lb/>we must yield again and again upon the       
     <lb/>plea that it is a question of dogma, until the       
     <lb/>liberties which our ancestors suffered so     
     <lb/>much to gain for us are taken from us at the<lb/>behest of men who are more anxious to<lb/>hang on to office than they are to stand<lb/>by a principle. Martin Van Buren, the<lb/>eighth president of the United States-1837-<lb break="yes"/>1841-said :<lb/>

     <lb/>
     have made the United States a nation that

     divorces. He knows that the facility in 
     <lb/>
     this country is not as great as it is in many 
     <lb/>
     states of the union for divorces. He knows 
     <lb/>
     that in Canada mediation very often comes 
     <lb/>
     in. Friends of the persons concerned and 
     <lb/>
     church dignitaries step in and prevent a 
     <lb/>
     consummation of divorces; and he knows 
     <lb/>
     that if there is one thing that characterizes 
     <lb/>
     Canada, it is the goodness of the women of 
     <lb/>
     Canada in forgiving the derelictions of duty 
     <lb/>
     on the part. of'the men. I am sorry to say 
     <lb/>
     that there is some cause for divorce in Can<lb break="no"/>ada, and that, if the good women of this 
     <lb/>
     country wished it, they might have an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of securing just as many di<lb break="no"/>vorces as they have in the United States. 
     <lb/>
     Then the right hon. First Minister read us 
     <lb/>
     a lecture on unity and harmony in his own 
     <lb/>
     gentlemanly way. He is always gentleman<lb break="no"/>ly. He always throws down the gauntlet 
     <lb/>
     and leaves his radical friends behind him to 
     <lb/>
     create an agitation while he stands and 
     <lb/>
     looks on with calm and placid demeanour, 
     <lb/>
     regretting. of course, the excesses of his 
     <lb/>
     followers, and cries intolerance against 
     <lb/>
     those who oppose him. But we remember 
     <lb/>
     the conduct of the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     and his friends in 1885, which has been 
     <lb/>
     referred to by other hon. gentlemen in this 
     <lb/>
     House, when the right hon. First Minister 
     <lb/>
     himself threatened that if he had been on 
     <lb/>
     the banks of the Saskatchewan he would 
     <lb/>
     have shouldered his musket, because of the 
     <lb/>
     supposed wrongs of the half-breeds of that 
     <lb/>
     country. A lot of land grabbers and land 
     <lb/>
     sharks, knowing that the half-breeds had 
     <lb/>
     obtained their scrip in Manitoba after the 
     <lb/>
     first rebellion, knowing that these half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
    breeds had gone out and settled in certain. 
     <lb/>other spots in the remote west and were 
     <lb/>claiming scrip again, and desiring to get 
     <lb/>control of that scrip, they kept urging them 
     <lb/>to raise a row and make a demand for the 
     <lb/>issue of the scrip. The government of that 
     <lb/>time, after consultation with the bishops 
     <lb/>and clergy of the Roman Catholic Church. 
     <lb/>they being the best educated men of that 
     <lb/>country in that time, and after consultation 
     <lb/>with the officers of the mounted police, de<lb break="no"/>termined, on the advice of and by the re<lb break="no"/>quest of these officials and clergy, to issue 
     <lb/>no more scrip. They said: No; we will 
     <lb/>not issue scrip again. You will sell your 
     <lb/>scrip for a bottle of whisky, you will sell 
     <lb/>
 
<cb/>
     <fw type="num">3784</fw>


     it for a dollar or two, and at the end of the 
     <lb/>
     week you will be as poor as you were be<lb break="no"/>fore; but we will give you your scrip on 
     <lb/>
     condition that you settle on the land. This 
     <lb/>
     was done at the request of the authorities 
     <lb/>
     of the church and the (police. The only ex<lb break="no"/>cuse they had for rebellion was that when 
     <lb/>
     they did settle on the land they want<lb break="no"/>ed the old river survey instead of the 
     <lb/>
     mile-square survey proposed by the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion government ; and from that hour to this 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen have been unable to find 
     <lb/>
     one cause for rebellion other than as to the. 
     <lb/>
     particular form the survey should take. But 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. the Prime Minister said on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion that if he had been 011 the 
     <lb/>
     banks of the Saskatchewan he would have 
     <lb/>
     shouldered his musket and fought for the 
     <lb/>
     liberties of the people.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. We find the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister, not satisfied with these inflamma<lb break="no"/>tory cries in the province of Quebec, com<lb break="no"/>ing to the province of Ontario and seeking 
     <lb/>
     to inflame the public of that province along 
     <lb/>
     other lines when he cried: 'Hands off Mani<lb break="no"/>toba; down with Tupper and his Tory 
     <lb/>
     friends,' and all that sort of thing. And 
     <lb/>
     yet he stands up here to-day preaching unity 
     <lb/>
     and harmony while at the same time he 
     <lb/>
     throws into the arena of Dominion politics 
     <lb/>
     the greatest fire brand that has ever for the 
     <lb/>
     last thirty years been thrown before the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     East Grey (Mr. Sproule) has been charged 
     <lb/>
     with being intolerant. Why, Sir, I have 
     <lb/>
     been surprised at the tolerance displayed 
     <lb/>
     by that hon. gentleman in his speeches in 
     <lb/>
     this House and in his speeches out of the 
     <lb/>
     House. He has displayed a spirit of Chris<lb break="no"/>tian fortitude—if I may use the term, al<lb break="no"/>though I am not much of a judge in this 
     <lb/>
     line—he has displayed a spirit of tolerance 
     <lb/>
     which I commend to my friends on the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the House.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not my intention, Sir, to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional aspect of the question. The 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition dealt with that 
     <lb/>
     phase, and no gentleman of any standing 
     <lb/>
     in law on the other side of the House or in 
     <lb/>
     the country has dared to lay a finger upon 
     <lb/>
     his argument. Minister after minister arose 
     <lb/>
     and they practically had to admit that the 
     <lb/>
     contention of the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     in his interpretation of the law was abso<lb break="no"/>lutely correct. Our good friend the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister claimed that he stood on the rock 
     <lb/>
     of the constitution, but after the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition got through with him it turn<lb break="no"/>ed out that the right hon. gentleman had 
     <lb/>
     landed on a mud bank. It is the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition who stands on the rock of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution and who in doing so pro<lb break="no"/>claims his adhesion to the principles of 
     <lb/>
     equity and justice and fair play for all. The 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition gives to every free 
     <lb/>
     man settling in the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     a fee simple deed to liberty ; the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the government would blanket mortgage 
     <lb/>
     the charter of every settler. The leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition reposes confidence in the peo<lb break="no"/>ple and shows his faith in his fellow man; 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the government mistrusts the  
     <lb/>
     west; mistrusts the people of Canada and 
     <lb/>
     he places a handicap on these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     for the placing of which he has no mandate 
     <lb/>
     from the electorate. The leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position regards his commission from the 
     <lb/>
     freemen of Canada as a sacred trust and 
     <lb/>
     grants to each of his followers full liberty 
     <lb/>
     to vote as he chooses on this question; the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the government refused to place 
     <lb/>
     this issue before the electors at the last 
     <lb/>
     election, for he ignores the people of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The leader of the government also ignores the 
     <lb/>
     territorial government led by Premier Haul<lb break="no"/>tain, who not long since had his policy on 
     <lb/>
     this question endorsed by the people of the 
     <lb/>
     west. The leader of the government ignor<lb break="no"/>

     ed the ex-Minister of the Interior, the re<lb break="no"/>sponsible minister from the district, for he 
     <lb/>
     consulted only the Minister of Justice and 
     <lb/>
     the Postmaster General. The leader of the 
     <lb/>
     government ignored the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     in relation to the great financial issues in<lb break="no"/>volved, and he hastened the Bill into this 
     <lb/>
     House so as to get the party committed to 
     <lb/>
     it while the minister was on his way from a 
     <lb/>
     foreign land. The leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment ignored even his party caucus, because 
     <lb/>
     he knew he dare not consult it; he ignored 
     <lb/>
     his colleagues in the cabinet, consulting 
     <lb/>
     only the gentleman who had the manipula<lb break="no"/>tion of the affairs from the beginning; he 
     <lb/>
     trampled the commission of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada under his feet and cast to the winds 
     <lb/>
     his boasted love of the English constitution, 
     <lb/>
     believing that his followers would meekly 
     <lb/>
     vote as he commanded.

     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName> (Victoria and Hali<lb break="no"/>burton). Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to see 
     <lb/>
     that there is one good representative of the 
     <lb/>
     cabinet present (Hon. Mr. Préfontaine) to 
     <lb/>
     take charge, I presume, of the business be<lb break="no"/>fore the House. Before recess I was point<lb break="no"/>ing out that the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     stood on the principle of equal rights and 
     <lb/>
     equal laws for all, and special privileges for 
     <lb/>
     none, whereas the leader of the government 
     <lb/>
     took the position that it was the duty of 
     <lb/>
     this parliament to coerce the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     in the matter of education—in other words, 
     <lb/>
     to establish in those provinces a union of 
     <lb/>
     church and state. The maxim of the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition was: Is it right, is it just, 
     <lb/>
     is it fair to those splendid people in the 
     <lb/>
     west, for this parliament, representing as 
     <lb/>
     it does all Canada, to seek to enforce upon 
     <lb/>
     them the will of people who have nothing 
     <lb/>
     whatever to do with the schools in that 
     <lb/>
     country, who should have nothing to do  
     <lb/>
     with them, and who are not justified under 
     <lb/>
     the laws or the constitution in interfering 
     <lb/>
     with them ? The leader of the government 
     <lb/>
     takes for granted, as is stated in the press 
     <lb/>
     and hinted at in the addresses of hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite, that the excitement over 
     <lb/>
     this question will soon pass away, and that 
     <lb/>
     in a few weeks all this discussion will be 
     <lb/>
     forgotten. Let me tell the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     that down deep in the hearts of his country<lb break="no"/>men, those who support him as well as those 
     <lb/>who oppose him, is the conviction that he 
     <lb/>has made the mistake of his lifetime—that 
     <lb/>he has destroyed the high opinion in which 
     <lb/>he was held by a great many of the people 
     <lb/>of this country, who had absolute faith in 
     <lb/>his struggles for liberty in 1896 and on other 
     <lb/>occasions in the history of this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Minister of Justice in replying to the 
     <lb/>leader of the opposition, abandoned the 
     <lb/>ground of the constitution and the ground 
     <lb/>of vested rights, and stood simply on the 
     <lb/>

     the people of this country demanded these

     place, that not forty-one per cent, and I be<lb break="no"/>lieve not ten per cent, of the people of this

     the editor of the newspaper being himself 
     <lb/>
     of that faith. I may say that a contributor 
     <lb/>
     to this paper had criticised the action of the

     government in relation to these Autonomy

     What the freely expressed opinion of Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics would be with reference to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools is a matter of speculation, and our 
     <lb/>
     contributor has as much right to his opinion 
     <lb/>
     as the editor of the ' Catholic Record ' has to 
     <lb/>
     his. The very fact that Roman Catholic rate<lb break="no"/>payers are not invited to express an opinion 
     <lb/>
     preparatory to the establishment of a separate 
     <lb/>
     school may be interpreted as meaning either 
     <lb/>
     that their opinion is not considered of any 
     <lb/>
     great value, or that the bishops are afraid to 
     <lb/>
     trust an appeal to it. If our contributor was 
     <lb/>
     so very far wrong in his opinion, why is it 
     <lb/>
     that Roman Catholic ratepayers are not con<lb break="no"/>sulted about the establishment of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools ? Why is it that in so many cases they 
     <lb/>
     are permitted no more say in the management 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools than is necessary to give 
     <lb/>
     an appearance of compliance with the law? 
     <lb/>
     Why is it that the bishop deems it necessary 
     <lb/>
     to invoke the spiritual powers of a church to 
     <lb/>
     compel support and attendance ? Why are 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic ratepayers not allowed the use 
     <lb/>
     of the ballot in the election of trustees ? Why 
     <lb/>
     are the trustees, in some cases at least, not 
     <lb/>
     allowed to act after they are elected ? Is it 
     <lb/>
     bigotry to draw attention to these facts ? It 
     <lb/>
     seems to us that the ' Catholic Record' would 
     <lb/>
     be showing more respect for intelligent Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic sentiment by dealing squarely with 
     <lb/>
     the facts than by imputing motives.

     Should he undertake it, the result will be 
     <lb/>
     that Canada will be bound together more 
     <lb/>
     closely just as the United States has been, 
     <lb/>
     since the great civil war, than it ever was 
     <lb/>
     before. The Minister of Justice will find 
     <lb/>
     that he has not caused the slightest tremour 
     <lb/>
     in the hearts or minds of the people by 
     <lb/>
     threatening rebellion and the destruction of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution, as he did when he said 41 
     <lb/>
     per cent of our people would have their way 
     <lb/>
     in this matter or there would be trouble. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. the Minister of Finance slid off 
     <lb/>
     the rock of the constitution and took to the

     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. Yes, he was thrown 
     <lb/>
     in but clung to the cabinet, and when he 
     <lb/>
     stood up in this House and made the plea 
     <lb/>
     he did, he presented the most abject, pitiable 
     <lb/>
     spectacle it has ever been my privilege to 
     <lb/>
     witness in this parliament, and this is the 
     <lb/>
     sixteenth session I have had the honour of 
     <lb/>
     occupying a seat in it. Just fancy the man 
     <lb/>
     who made the welkin ring from one end of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion to the other in 1896 against 
     <lb/>
     any interference with the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, who has been quoted often in this 
     <lb/>
     House as against any coercion of any pro<lb break="no"/>vince—just fancy this man, when brought 
     <lb/>
     face to face with the issue of his own crea<lb break="no"/>tion, renouncing every shred of principle he 
     <lb/>
     then stood for. Shall I quote his language ? 
     <lb/>
     I really do not think it necessary, and I do 
     <lb/>
     not like to see it any oftener than I can help 
     <lb/>
     in the pages of ' Hansard.' But what was 
     <lb/>
     the pitiable plea he made ? Oh, he said, if 
     <lb/>
     we don't accept this clause the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister will have to resign and we will be all 
     <lb/>
     out in the cold. That was the sum and sub<lb break="no"/>stance of his remarks. Why, the whale and 
     <lb/>
     Jonah were not in it compared with the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman and his principles. The whale 
     <lb/>
     merely swallowed Jonah, but the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Minister swallowed both himself and what<lb break="no"/>ever principles he ever had. He pointed out 
     <lb/>
     that in Nova Scotia the Roman Catholics were 
     <lb/>
     handsomely used by the Protestant majority, 
     <lb/>
     but in the next breath he turned around and 
     <lb/>
     said we cannot trust the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west to do the Roman Catholic minority in 
     <lb/>
     those new provinces what is being done to 
     <lb/>
     that same minority in the province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. That was the result of the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's logic. I might remind him of an 
     <lb/>
     old expression taken from the same au<lb break="no"/>thority as he quoted from :

     settled, and still kept to the water, rather 
     <lb/>
     than have made the exhibition he did in this 
     <lb/>
     House. How a minister who has sworn to 
     <lb/>
     give advice to His Majesty's representatives 
     <lb/>
     according to the dictates of his conscience 
     <lb/>
     can remain in the cabinet after publicly 
     <lb/>
     enunciating the principles he expressed here, 
     <lb/>
     passes my comprehension. Had that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman done his duty, the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     would very quickly have found a way out of 
     <lb/>
     the difficulty. Had he stood to his guns 
     <lb/>
     with the solid province of Nova Scotia at 
     <lb/>
     his back and supported by the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior (Mr. Sifton) with the solid North<lb break="no"/>west behind him, the First Minister would 
     <lb/>
     never have dared to resign and go to the 
     <lb/>
     country, but would at once have removed 
     <lb/>
     the difficulty and left the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest free to deal with their own 
     <lb/>
     schools. Had he adopted the motto taken 
     <lb/>
     from his own favourite author, he would 
     <lb/>
     have been by long odds the most popular 
     <lb/>
     man in this country. If he had taken the

     He would have been master of the admini<lb break="no"/>stration to-day in place of meriting the con<lb break="no"/>tempt of every member of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons. Personally I have always been 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the introduction of religion into 
     <lb/>
     politics and have always endeavoured to 
     <lb/>
     keep the two apart. But at times religious 
     <lb/>
     contentions have been forced on us, as I 
     <lb/>
     shall point out later in answer to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). In the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario we have had, on the 
     <lb/>
     question of separate schools, an agitation, 
     <lb/>
     prompted by differences, to have the im<lb break="no"/>proper amendments made to our school law 
     <lb/>
     removed. I stood up in that fight and we 
     <lb/>
     won and prevented these improper amend<lb break="no"/>ments being perpetuated and put into 
     <lb/>
     practice in our province. I remember well 
     <lb/>
     pointing out that if every adviser of Sir 
     <lb/>
     Oliver Mowat were a member of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic church, it did not matter so long 
     <lb/>
     as he was chosen on the ground of fitness 
     <lb/>
     and ability, but that no one should be chosen 
     <lb/>
     for a cabinet position simply because he hap<lb break="no"/>pened to be an Irishman or a Scotchman or 
     <lb/>
     a Frenchman or an Englishman and a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of a certain church. Let ability be the 
     <lb/>
     test, I contended, and there would be no 
     <lb/>
     trouble. But on all these matters, there 
     <lb/>
     are demagogues who take advantage or 
     <lb/>
     national and religious prejudices, men who 
     <lb/>
     have no qualifications or fitness for public 
     <lb/>
     office other than that they handle the 
     <lb/>
     Irish vote in this locality, or the French 
     <lb/>
     vote in another locality, or some other votes 
     <lb/>
     somewhere else ; and these are the men who 
     <lb/>
     have gained ascendency in the Liberal party 
     <lb/>

     from the days as far back as 1837.  It is 
     <lb/>this class of politicians who create these re<lb break="no"/>ligious and racial agitations throughout the<lb/>country, hoping thereby to gain a promi<lb break="no"/>nence which they cannot achieve in any<lb/>other way. But it is not necessary for the<lb/>men of any race or religion in Canada to<lb/>resort to that kind of thing. There are<lb/>plenty of Irishmen, Scotchmen and French<lb break="no"/>men and men of every nationality who can<lb/>command the respect of their fellow country<lb break="no"/>men without resorting to such pernicious<lb/>methods.  We had another exhibition of <lb/>these methods in the person of the Minister<lb/>of Customs  (Mr. Paterson).    On one oc<lb break="no"/>casion,  when speaking in the city of Brant<lb break="no"/>ford,  that magnificent voice of his was <lb/>raised to such a pitch that just as the audi<lb break="no"/>ence left the building, the roof fell in.  Well, <lb/>the only resemblance between the Minister<lb/>of Customs of to-day and the Minister of <lb/>Customs of years gone by is that sonorous<lb/>voice of his. It was heard in Ontario in<lb/>1896, when he exclaimed in stentorian tones;<lb/>Hands off Manitoba ; down with Tupper and<lb/>the Church of Rome ; we will never be<lb/>ruled by the Bishops of Rome ; let the free<lb/>men of the west show their independence.<lb/>The newspaper speeches and posters of hon.<lb/>gentlemen opposite reeked with this sort<lb/>of thing.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>And he stood up here saying in effect ;<lb/>Pity the sorrows of a poor old man who<lb/>wants to hold on to office ; who has been<lb/>for thirty-two years in the saddle—I think<lb/>that was what he said—with the First<lb/>Minister, and has learned to love him. Well,<lb/>these are great constitutional reasons why<lb/>two provinces of this Dominion should be<lb/>tied hand and foot for all time to come.<lb/>In some of his speeches, the hon. gentleman<lb/>was wont to quote those grand old words<lb/>from Junius, which the Toronto ' Globe '<lb/>years ago adopted for its motto : ' The<lb/>subject who is truly loyal to the chief magis<lb break="no"/>trate will neither advise nor submit to<lb/>arbitrary measures.' But there was not a<lb/>word of independence from him the other<lb/>night. It was only : Let me hold down my<lb/>job in the custom-house ; keep the ship to<lb break="no"/>gether and keep her off the rocks ; I have<lb/>been thirty-two years in the saddle with the<lb/>Prime Minister, and I love the dear old man ;<lb/>and I am not fit for much else. Let me tell<lb/>the hon. gentleman that the rule of life is<lb/>that men go down and give place to others.<lb/>In politics, as in every walk of life in which<lb/>there is struggle, men disappear. But the<lb/>sun rises and sets and the men are soon<lb/>forgotten. Had these hon. gentlemen stood<lb/>to the constitution there would have been<lb/>no danger of the Prime Minister going out<lb/>of office on this question, no danger of the<lb/>government being broken up. On the con<lb break="no"/>trary, it would have been much stronger<lb/>than it is to-day. Had they done this, the<lb/>acting Minister of Public Works (Mr. Hy<lb break="no"/>man) would not have been afraid to face<lb/>his electors ; Centre Toronto would not<lb/>

     have gone by default ; the government 
     <lb/>would not have been obliged to dangle jobs<lb/>before the eyes of their partisans from the<lb/>Northwest Territories ; and, as I am remind<lb break="no"/>ed, the tomato man of the party, the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Centre York (Mr. Campbell) could<lb/>have been made Minister of Agriculture and<lb/>need not have been afraid, on this account,<lb/>to face his electors. Not a constituency in<lb/>the country but would have supported the<lb/>government on this subject. Men come and<lb/>go ; members of this House appear and<lb/>pass. And when every man who has occu<lb break="no"/>pied a place in this House shall have pass<lb break="no"/>ed and been forgotten, the principles that<lb/>are being discussed to-day will live ; the<lb/>principles—or lack of principles—that are<lb/>being fastened upon the people of the new<lb/>provinces will remain to remind the future<lb/>generation of those<lb/>

            <p>Now, Sir, we all admire the open fearless<lb/>dare-devil rather than the sneak ; we ad<lb break="no"/>mire the man who holds up a train or, flying<lb/>the black flag, order the merchantman to<lb/>heave to, but we despise the man who slinks<lb/>around by the back door to commit some<lb/>petty theft.

     suppose that occasion will be found, later on, 
     <lb/>
     to inquire further into this matter. A friend 
     <lb/>
     of mine, always a great admirer of the ex-

     <lb/>

     I am reading carefully all that is being said 
     <lb/>
     and done these days at Ottawa. The situation 
     <lb/>
     is simply appalling. The people are perplexed 
     <lb/>
     and confounded. This is the boldest card ever 
     <lb/>
     played in Canada, and I am afraid that it will 
     <lb/>
     win. I am anxiously waiting Sifton's speech 
     <lb/>
     in the papers to-morrow. My present notion 
     <lb/>
     is, that he will go back to Laurier. If he does 
     <lb/>
     my suspicion is, that the whole thing was a 
     <lb/>
     fake from the beginning. He did not ' go' out, 
     <lb/>
     but was 'sent ' out for the purpose of leading 
     <lb/>
     the Westerners back. He recalls the artful 
     <lb/>
     method resorted to by Armour of Chicago, in 
     <lb/>
     leading his wild steers from the ranchesup to 
     <lb/>
     the slaughter house. As they smell danger 
     <lb/>
     from afar, Armour keeps a large Mexican steer, 
     <lb/>
     fat and sleek, which he has trained to rush into 
     <lb/>
     the bolting stubborn throng, frolic round and 
     <lb/>
     play up 'big ' for a few minutes, then he takes 
     <lb/>
     the lead straight for the slaughter house, when 
     <lb/>
     all the others follow ; the gates close behind, 
     <lb/>
     and the big brute quietly steps to one side into 
     <lb/>
     a stall for a fine feed of boiled oats.

     Now, let me quote an extract or two from 
     <lb/>
     the Reverend Jeremiah Crowley, a Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic priest of the city of Chicago. Re<lb break="no"/>cently the government of France, which 
     <lb/>
     has been Roman Catholic from time im<lb break="no"/>memorial and which had a concordat with 
     <lb/>
     Rome, has abolished that concordat and has 
     <lb/>
     expelled certain religious orders in that 
     <lb/>
     country. The Reverend Mr. Crowley, him<lb break="no"/>self a Roman Catholic priest in good stand<lb break="no"/>ing, against whom his most malignant 
     <lb/>
     enemy has not been able to produce a single 
     <lb/>
     charge as to either his moral or spiritual con<lb break="no"/>duct, points out that these members of these 
     <lb/>
     religious orders come in large numbers to 
     <lb/>
     the continent of America and are encour<lb break="no"/>aged by the higher authorities of the church, 
     <lb/>
     and that they work against the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of the Roman Catholic Church as 
     <lb/>
     well as against the public schools of the 
     <lb/>
     United States. And he closes his argument 
     <lb/>
     upon that subject with these words : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     I submit to the American people this ques<lb break="no"/>tion : Is it to the best interests of the nation 
     <lb/>
     that a multitude (now over a million) of its 
     <lb/>
     children should receive their secular education 
     <lb/>
     in schools which, for their highest supervision, 
     <lb/>
     are subject to ecclesiastics whose perpetual re<lb break="no"/>sidence is in Europe, who have never seen the

     This is a quotation from that gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     I will now come to some of my Irish fellow 
     <lb/>
     countrymen, citizens of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     who have expressed very strong opinions on 
     <lb/>
     these matters. In the United States, as

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3794</fw>
        

     well as in Canada, there is an organized 
     <lb/>
     attempt to force clerical schools upon the 
     <lb/>
     people. There is there what is called a 
     <lb/>
     federation of church societies who are en<lb break="no"/>gaged in this work, openly, there is no se<lb break="no"/>cret about it. I know that it is customary 
     <lb/>
     for some people to speak with bated breath 
     <lb/>
     and bowed head when speaking of corpo<lb break="no"/>rations ; but a corporation is a corporation 
     <lb/>
     the world over, whether in the United 
     <lb/>
     States or the Dominion of Canada. As I 
     <lb/>
     say, there is in the United States a union 
     <lb/>
     of Roman Catholic church societies whose 
     <lb/>
     openly proclaimed object is to bring this 
     <lb/>
     question into the politics of the country, 
     <lb/>
     and to create a great middle party if pos<lb break="no"/>sible, and thus to force the two parties in 
     <lb/>
     the United States to come to its terms. 
     <lb/>
     Now, a number of prominent Irishmen have 
     <lb/>
     been consulted on this matter, Irish Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics, and I will give quotations from 
     <lb/>
     a few of them. Here is one from Mr. John 
     <lb/>
     P. Kelly, a leading resident and business 
     <lb/>
     man of the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin— 
     <lb/>
     these quotations are all from the residents 
     <lb/>
     of the city of Milwaukee: Mr. Kelly says :

     South African war ; and other hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite have very strong views in 
     <lb/>
     favour of the Boers—anything so long as 
     <lb/>
     they can hit the British empire. Now, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     I stated to-day, as one of the offences of 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen against the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, that they had destroyed all respect 
     <lb/>
     for public principles in this Dominion. We 
     <lb/>
     have seen them on the trade question, we 
     <lb/>
     have seen them on every question, box the 
     <lb/>
     compass to suit their own purpose, in various 
     <lb/>ways they have proved themselves true op<lb break="no"/>portunists, with the result that the public

     conscience in the Dominion of Canada to-day 
     <lb/>
     is at the lowest stage it has ever been in the 
     <lb/>
     history of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Public sentiment is gone, honour is prac<lb break="no"/>tically gone, and now they are endeavour<lb break="no"/>ing to disrupt and smash up our public 
     <lb/>
     school system and when any hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man stands up and opposes them the cry 
     <lb/>
     of intolerance is raised. If a man stands by 
     <lb/>
     his rights and opposes these iniquities, why 
     <lb/>
     he is intolerant. These are the charges that 
     <lb/>
     are made by certain hon. gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the House from time to time. 
     <lb/>
     More than that, we have seen the hon. Post<lb break="no"/>master General (Sir William Mulock) stand 
     <lb/>
     up and in place of replying to the argument 
     <lb/>
     advanced by my friend from North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Foster) read a lot of rigmarole stuff, 
     <lb/>
     debates in other Houses and adverse critic<lb break="no"/>ism of my hon. friend the ex-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance and we have seen that sort of 
     <lb/>
     thing going on day after day in this House. 
     <lb/>
     We had the hon. member from Ottawa (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Belcourt) the other night standing up adver<lb break="no"/>sely and unfairly criticising my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from North Toronto and bringing in argu<lb break="no"/>ments that had no force or effect and no 
     <lb/>
     bearing on the question before the House. 
     <lb/>
     That has been the policy of these hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen throughout. They do not meet ar<lb break="no"/>gument with argument or fact with fact, 
     <lb/>
     but seek like ink fish to cover the trail by 
     <lb/>
     improper references. This is not a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of what is right; it is simply a question 
     <lb/>
     of what is expedient. Abandon your princi<lb break="no"/>ples, look to your pocket and position no 
     <lb/>
     matter who is injured. These are the max<lb break="no"/>ims of the hon. gentlemen opposite. Pay no 
     <lb/>
     attention to the pledges given to the people. 
     <lb/>
     They are made to be broken. The max<lb break="no"/>ims of the government are simply trampled 
     <lb/>
     under foot. The principles for which free 
     <lb/>
     men have fought in all ages are taken as 
     <lb/>
     naught. Secret intrigue takes the place of 
     <lb/>
     free discussion and free conference among 
     <lb/>
     the members of the government and among 
     <lb/>
     the members of the party. Is there a min<lb break="no"/>ister in his place to-night who can stand up 
     <lb/>
     and conscientiously say that he was con<lb break="no"/>sulted about that clause ? A great party 
     <lb/>
     following the principles of constitutional 
     <lb/>
     and responsible government and yet, be<lb break="no"/>sides a paltry little committee of the cabinet, 
     <lb/>
     not one member of the government, not one 
     <lb/>
     of their following in the House, not one 
     <lb/>
     member of the territorial legislature and 
     <lb/>
     not one of the members from the west, al<lb break="no"/>though only fresh from the country, is con<lb break="no"/>sulted as to this clause, although it is said 
     <lb/>
     that we are living under constitutional gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Why, the Czar of Russia, sur<lb break="no"/>rounded by the grand dukes, would not at<lb break="no"/>tempt to pass that sort of legislation. It is 
     <lb/>
     worse than taxation without representation 
     <lb/>
     which caused the American war. Now, the 
     <lb/>
     policy laid down by the First Minister, as 
     <lb/>
     well as the second or amended clause, im<lb break="no"/>poses the will of other portions of Canada 
     <lb/>
     on the western freemen. It imposes it in 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3798</fw>
        

     defiance of the constitution of the country 
     <lb/>
     and it establishes a principle of federal in<lb break="no"/>terference in purely provincial matters which 
     <lb/>
     has always been avoided in connection with 
     <lb/>
     the government in Canada heretofore. It 
     <lb/>
     establishes separate schools in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories and perpetuates the union 
     <lb/>
     of church and state in that great country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, we have heard our hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) point out, in the 
     <lb/>
     course of his speech, a great many things, 
     <lb/>
     some of them nonsensical and many of them 
     <lb/>
     very untrue and incorrect. I shall take the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of running through a few of the 
     <lb/>
     choice extracts from his speech. In one 
     <lb/>
     of these he makes an appeal to the English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking majority in this country and says: 
     <lb/>
     Consider what the French Canadians in the 
     <lb/>
     past have done for the development of this 
     <lb/>
     country. He makes the same mistake as 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member from Montmagny (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lavcrgne) of believing that we are dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the province of Quebec, or that the 
     <lb/>
     whole Dominion is the province of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     or vice versa, the province of Quebec is the 
     <lb/>
     whole Dominion. Let me inform him that 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec is only a portion of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, and a very small portion, al<lb break="no"/>though a very important one. He says that:

     schools which he is advocating to-day and

     the system which he is endeavouring to per<lb break="no"/>petuate in this country the continent of 
     <lb/>North America would largely have been 
     <lb/>under the control of the French people to<lb break="no"/>day. Anterior to the date referred to by 
     <lb/>him free Frenchmen had planted colonies in 
     <lb/>Brazil, in the coast of Florida, Georgia and 
     <lb/>the Carolinas, prosperous colonies of free 
     <lb/>Frenchmen, but these colonies were blotted 
     <lb/>'out by the connivance of the French gov<lb break="no"/>ernment engineered by the same system 
     <lb/>that he wishes to perpetuate in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, and the label over the 
     <lb/>graves of the thousands of men who were 
     <lb/>massacred in cold blood was this: 'This is 
     <lb/>not done as to Frenchmen, but as to Luth<lb break="no"/>erans.' Had it not been for the interference 
     <lb/>of an organization such as he is endeavour<lb break="no"/>ing to force on the west the whole contin<lb break="no"/>ent of Nonth America would have been col<lb break="no"/>onized by free Frenchmen—the word

     <lb/>had the improper struggles that are now 
     <lb/>dividing this country. I commend these 
     <lb/>notions to my hon. friend from Labelle. 
     <lb/>Another point he dwelt upon was this— 
     <lb/>I shall not take up his reference to rebel<lb break="no"/>lion to any great extent—but he spoke about 
     <lb/>twenty times in reference to rebellion—the 
     <lb/>rebellion in the Northwest Territories of 
     <lb/>1885, the rebellion in Manitoba—and he 
     <lb/>seemed to regret that there did not spring

     up another rebellion in 1892. Take the re<lb break="no"/>bellion of 1885; as I explained this after<lb break="no"/>noon, when the government wanted the few 
     <lb/>
     settlers at the village of Batoche to take the 
     <lb/>
     square mile survey in place of the long sur<lb break="no"/>vey a rebellion broke out. This hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman claims that rebellion was justified, 
     <lb/>
     and he regrets that he did not bring on a 
     <lb/>
     rebellion in Manitoba at the time the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba Act was passed abolishing separate 
     <lb/>
     schools there. There are occasions when 
     <lb/>
     rebellions are just. I think the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories fully appreciate their 
     <lb/>
     position and that they will make it rather 
     <lb/>
     warm for the right hon. First Minister and 
     <lb/>
     the government of Canada in connection 
     <lb/>
     with this Bill, first by a constitutional agita<lb break="no"/>tion, and then, if it is found out that this 
     <lb/>
     government, in spite of the constitution, are 
     <lb/>
     determined to insist upon forcing this

     Well, let us see what this campaign of

     Sir Oliver Mowat's was, for justice and 
     <lb/>
     equality. The Protestants of Ontario never 
     <lb/>

     perpetuating the separate schools, nor did 
     <lb/>
     they ever attempt to do away with separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in that province. What they did 
     <lb/>
     object to was the illegal, unfair, and unequal 
     <lb/>
     concessions given to the Roman Catholics of 
     <lb/>
     that province, and I am very much surprised

     such a bad cause as to advocate the cam<lb break="no"/>paign of Sir Oliver Mowat. One of the 
     <lb/>
     things that grated on the ears of Protestants 
     <lb/>
     was, that we were classed with the negroes,

     Ontario, all that required to be done to 
     <lb/>
     break that school up would be that a Pro<lb break="no"/>testant teacher should be engaged in the 
     <lb/>school section adjoining. The people after

     <lb/>school and taxing themselves to engage a 
     <lb/>teacher, if the school section from which 
     <lb/>they had separated themselves engaged a 
     <lb/>Protestant teacher that instant their school 
     <lb/>closed up and the people were put to great

     <lb/>
     this : There is a clause in the Ontario Act, 
     <lb/>
     and it is a good one, which allows a Pro<lb break="no"/>testant tenant of Catholic property to deter<lb break="no"/>mine that his taxes shall go to the public 
     <lb/>
     school, and the Catholic tenant of Protestant 
     <lb/>
     property to determine that his taxes shall 
     <lb/>
     go to the separate school. We never ob<lb break="no"/>jected to that in principle, but when I tell 
     <lb/>
     you that my own taxes for two years went 
     <lb/>
     to the separate schools you will see that 
     <lb/>
     there was a necessity for a change in the 
     <lb/>
     law. The clause in the Act is as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Every person paying rates whether as pro<lb break="no"/>prietor or tenant, who by himself or his agent, 
     <lb/>
     on or before the first day of March in any year, 
     <lb/>
     gives to the clerk of the municipality notice 
     <lb/>
     in writing that he is a Roman Catholic and 
     <lb/>
     supporter of a separate school, situated in the 
     <lb/>
     said municipality, or in a municipality con<lb break="no"/>tiguous thereto, shall be exempted from the 
     <lb/>
     payment of all rates imposed for the support 
     <lb/>
     of public schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     We objected to that because the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     landlord could give notice that he wanted 
     <lb/>
     the taxes applied to the separate school and 
     <lb/>
     for years in the province of Ontario that 
     <lb/>
     was done, and although the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     tenant of a Protestant property could send 
     <lb/>
     his taxes to the separate school the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant tenant of Catholic property could 
     <lb/>
     not in very many cases do so. I will give 
     <lb/>
     you another instance: At the village of Dow<lb break="no"/>neyville in the county which I have the hon<lb break="no"/>our to represent, the people were living in 
     <lb/>
     peace and harmony until a few monthe ago. 
     <lb/>
     There were only four Protestant families in 
     <lb/>
     the whole school section and some forty odd 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic families. Thirteen or fif<lb break="no"/>teen of these Roman Catholic families yield<lb break="no"/>ed to the influence of the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     clergyman of the place and they went in for 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3802</fw>
        

     a separate school. The balance of the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic people objected to the es<lb break="no"/>tablishment of the separate school, but 
     <lb/>
     they were all obliged to come into line and 
     <lb/>
     to-day there are four Protestant families in 
     <lb/>
     that school section who cannot afford to get 
     <lb/>
     a teacher of their own, and who either can<lb break="no"/>not send their children to school or have 
     <lb/>
     to drive them miles to an adjoining section. 
     <lb/>
     And because we objected to this sort of 
     <lb/>
     thing some gentlemen stand up and brand 
     <lb/>
     us as intolerant and tyrannical, and not in 
     <lb/>
     favour of equal rights to all. Such a state<lb break="no"/>ment is absurd. Another assertion made by 
     <lb/>
     the member for Labelle was this:

     the right to live side by side ? Will he point

     to any country over which the British flag 
     <lb/>
     floats where liberty is not equally given to 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholic and Protestant subject ? 
     <lb/>
     That is one of the principles for which my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend (Mr. Sproule) who sits beside me 
     <lb/>
     contends. We have heard some jeering

     about him lately, but he is a man who dur<lb break="no"/>ing his life has striven for that principle. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend (Mr. Sproule) is head of an 
     <lb/>
     order in which he as well as the humblest 
     <lb/>
     in its ranks is sworn to give to his Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic fellow-countrymen the same rights 
     <lb/>
     and privileges as he claims for himself. Is 
     <lb/>
     there anything tyrannical or intolerant in 
     <lb/>
     that? You cannot show, in the history of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion of Canada, where any gentle<lb break="no"/>man pretending to live up to the principles 
     <lb/>
     [ have enunciated has refused to grant what 
     <lb/>
     I have stated. I could show in the city of 
     <lb/>
     Hull, in the province of Quebec, the Protes<lb break="no"/>tant stock of four companies—the E. B. 
     <lb/>
     Eddy Company, the Ottawa and Hull Power 
     <lb/>
     Company, the Gilmour and Hughson Com<lb break="no"/>pany and the George Matthews Company— 
     <lb/>
     every member of all these companies being 
     <lb/>
     Protestant, pay $8,966.50 of taxes, of which 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant schools of Hull receive only 
     <lb/>
     $695. In the province of Ontario, were this 
     <lb/>
     stock held by companies, every dollar of 
     <lb/>
     taxes upon that stock would go to the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     the stockholders were Roman Catholics.

     that I would hesitate a long time before

     I would offer to the Roman Catholic people

     or in any part of the country in which 
     <lb/>
     Catholics have any control, do we find 
     <lb/>
     the display of passion and prejudice we are 
     <lb/>
     now witnessing among those who advocate 
     <lb/>
     public schools against separate schools. Well, 
     <lb/>
     I do not believe in quoting newspaper 
     <lb/>
     against newspaper or speech against speech, 
     <lb/>
     but you can take every minister of this 
     <lb/>
     government and you can quote any speech 
     <lb/>
     of his one year against another speech 
     <lb/>
     the following year, any time within the 
     <lb/>
     last fifteen years. And no papers have been 
     <lb/>
     more active than papers supporting the 
     <lb/>
     government in the province of Quebec— 
     <lb/>
     which I presume are Roman Catholic papers 
     <lb/>
     —in exciting religious and race antagonism. 
     <lb/>
     You will find them excelling in charging all 
     <lb/>
     sorts of intolerance against the Protestants 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario, and you will find men like the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Labelle going through that 
     <lb/>
     province and appealing to the fanaticism 
     <lb/>
     and prejudices of that magnificent people. 
     <lb/>
     I have every faith in that people, but we 
     <lb/>
     must admit that they are not as well posted 
     <lb/>
     in public affairs as they should be. I 
     <lb/>
     regret that we have no Chapleau in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec to-day to set the people 
     <lb/>
     right and counteract the schemes of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite. I remember when the 
     <lb/>
     late Sir Joseph Chapleau stood in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec and faced the demagogues 
     <lb/>
     of the Liberal party, led by the late Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Mercier, who sought to inflame the public 
     <lb/>
     mind of that province in connection with 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest rebellion and other matters. 
     <lb/>
     I regret that to-day there is not one 
     <lb/>
     to take the place of that great states<lb break="no"/>man and stem the torrent of fanatic<lb break="no"/>ism which is being spread throughout 
     <lb/>
     that province by the demagogues of 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal party. But I am confident 
     <lb/>
     that the good sense of the Quebec people 
     <lb/>
     will yet assert itself and that in a short 
     <lb/>

     While Papineau and his followers were de<lb break="no"/>claiming against the tyranny of being taxed

     It is evident that Papineau, the great master

     the probable results. He was a brilliant orator, 
     <lb/>
     but no statesman ; a clever partisan leader, but 
     <lb/>
     a miserable general officer ; a braggart in the 
     <lb/>

     storm which he neither knew how to allay nor 
     <lb/>
     direct. Nor had Papineau the excuse of youth 
     <lb/>
     to plead in extenuation of his folly. In 1837 
     <lb/>
     he was 38 years of age, a period of life when 
     <lb/>
     the intellect stands at its meridian. In height 
     <lb/>
     he was of the middle size; a man of good 
     <lb/>
     presence; with features of a Hebrew caste; 
     <lb/>
     while his heavy dark eyebrows shaded, in a 
     <lb/>
     higher arch than usual, a keen lustrous eye 
     <lb/>
     of quick and penetrating glance. He appeared 
     <lb/>
     to be formed by nature for the eloquent agita<lb break="no"/>tor, but not for the wise or prudent legislator ; 
     <lb/>
     to act upon the passions and prejudices of his 
     <lb/>
     ignorant or unreflecting countrymen, not to 
     <lb/>
     make them happier, wiser or better. Familiar 
     <lb/>
     with French literature and all the old lore of 
     <lb/>
     La Nouvelle France, he appealed to the feelings 
     <lb/>
     and prejudices of his countrymen with ir<lb break="no"/>resistible effect, and completely carried them 
     <lb/>
     captive by the force of his oratorical and con<lb break="no"/>versational powers. But while Papineau 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly understood the people of his own 
     <lb/>
     province he knew very little of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Upper Canada; and appeared to be wholly 
     <lb/>
     ignorant of the feeling of loyalty to the Queen

     There we have a description of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec under the rule and subject

     <lb/>
     province of Quebec, or in the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, other agitations started by these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen. The hon. member for Labelle 
     <lb/>
     has inflamed the minds of the people in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec, and has attempted to 
     <lb/>
     justify himself by preaching the same stuff 
     <lb/>
     in other provinces. He recently spoke in 
     <lb/>
     the city of Toronto, and I was asked by a 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who heard him if it was not 
     <lb/>
     scandalous that such things could have 
     <lb/>
     been allowed in the province of Quebec as 
     <lb/>
     had been described by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle ; he really believed the statements 
     <lb/>
     that the member for Labelle had been mak<lb break="no"/>ing. I want the people of this country to 
     <lb/>
     know what the facts were under a Liberal 
     <lb/>
     agitation in the province of Quebec, and 
     <lb/>
     that, in place of their having any just com<lb break="no"/>plaint against our English-speaking fellow-

     country men, the reverse was the case under

     show that the people of Ontario are tolerant. 
     <lb/>
     I have shown that the government practi<lb break="no"/>cally admit now that they have no case 
     <lb/>
     under the constitution for their school 
     <lb/>
     clauses of the Autonomy Bill, that they are 
     <lb/>
     simply governed by policy. I have shown 
     <lb/>
     that by putting this law on the statute- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     book without these educational clauses in<lb break="no"/>serted the separate school law of 1875 will 
     <lb/>
     remain the law in the new provinces. Then 
     <lb/>
     if, as the Prime Minister asserts, the con<lb break="no"/>stitution gives them the right to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, that law must remain on the statute- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     book ; but if the constitution does not de<lb break="no"/>mand that separate schools shall be per<lb break="no"/>

     petuated, then it rests with the free will of 
     <lb/>
     the legislatures of the Northwest either to 
     <lb/>
     perpetuate the present system or to change 
     <lb/>
     it. It stands to common sense that if the 
     <lb/>
     law is as mild and as gentle and as in<lb break="no"/>offensive as hon. gentlemen opposite say it 
     <lb/>
     is, no legislature in the new provinces is 
     <lb/>
     going to step in and take away from the 
     <lb/>
     people the small measure of separate schools 
     <lb/>
     that is given them under that constitution. 
     <lb/>
     Remove the objection and you preserve the 
     <lb/>
     self-respect and honour of the people of 
     <lb/>
     those great Territories ; perpetuate coer<lb break="no"/>cion, and you bring about a struggle in 
     <lb/>
     every province of the Dominion, because 
     <lb/>
     the people of the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     are by no means a unit in favour of coer<lb break="no"/>cion. They have shown in 1896 that 
     <lb/>
     they are not in favour of coercion, 
     <lb/>
     and if you give them an opportunity. I 
     <lb/>
     believe they will show again that 
     <lb/>
     they are not in favour of coercion no 
     <lb/>
     more than are the people of Ontario. 
     <lb/>
     There is not even a suggestion of tyranny 
     <lb/>
     and the freemen of Quebec will not hesitate 
     <lb/>
     to record their votes against tyranny just 
     <lb/>
     the same as the freemen of Ontario. I have 
     <lb/>
     no further desire to discuss this matter until 
     <lb/>
     it reaches the committee stage but I would 
     <lb/>
     appeal, as I appealed in the earlier part of 
     <lb/>
     my address, to the right hon. Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister to remove this coercive clause. If his 
     <lb/>
     contention is right he has all he wants in the 
     <lb/>
     Bill without the coercion at all. If his con<lb break="no"/>tention is wrong I want to point out to him 
     <lb/>
     that the Act of 1875 will be part of the laws 
     <lb/>
     of the new provinces until the legislatures 
     <lb/>
     meet and change it and it must be supposed 
     <lb/>
     that the Roman Catholic minority in these 
     <lb/>
     Territories will have a far greater chance 
     <lb/>
     of succeeding by the kindly means I have

     <lb/>in the Bill which we are now discussing. I 
     <lb/>intend to discuss the subjects which are men<lb break="no"/>tioned in this Bill. During the discussion 
     <lb/>that has taken place, so far I have noticed 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3814</fw>
          

     on the part of almost everybody who has 
     <lb/>
     spoken a desire to make this a school ques<lb break="no"/>tion. I do not wish for one moment to mini<lb break="no"/>mize the importance of the school clauses of 
     <lb/>
     this Bill. On the contrary, I would say that 
     <lb/>
     they are very important. The education of 
     <lb/>
     the youth of any country is of the first im<lb break="no"/>portance, but this is only one of the subjects 
     <lb/>
     dealt with by this Bill and there are others 
     <lb/>
     of equal, and to my mind as a representa<lb break="no"/>tive of that western country of even greater 
     <lb/>
     importance. Mr. Speaker, I notice that hon. 
     <lb/>
     members from other provinces, especially 
     <lb/>
     from the province of Ontario, seem to take 
     <lb/>
     a tremendous interest in that particular 
     <lb/>
     question. I am very glad to see that hon. 
     <lb/>
     members do not treat this question from a 
     <lb/>
     local standpoint, but I would think that 
     <lb/>
     when the people of the Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies are satisfied it ought to be pretty good 
     <lb/>
     ground why the people of the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces should also be satisfied. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some time ago, before this Bill was read a 
     <lb/>
     second time, the hon. leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion (Mr. R. L. Borden) was very anxious 
     <lb/>
     to have the matter discussed, and so was 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Foster), and we heard a great deal about 
     <lb/>
     dissension in the government ranks from 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Toronto. But, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, we do not hear very 
     <lb/>
     much about that now. Why ? Because 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. Prime Minister of this 
     <lb/>
     country (Sir Wilfrid Laurier), is com<lb break="no"/>ing before the country and before this 
     <lb/>
     House with this Bill with practically a solid 
     <lb/>
     support behind his back. We do not hear 
     <lb/>
     anything about dissension now simply be<lb break="no"/>cause when the hon. leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     came down to the second reading of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill he was not able to say that he was lead<lb break="no"/>ing the opposition. He said that he was 
     <lb/>
     leading himself and that was all he was 
     <lb/>
     doing because every hon. member behind 
     <lb/>
     him was going his own way. The members 
     <lb/>
     from the Northwest have been criticised, and 
     <lb/>
     criticised very severely, especially before the 
     <lb/>
     second reading of this Bill, by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Toronto. We were told we 
     <lb/>
     were simply a flock of sheep, that we were 
     <lb/>
     dumb, that we had been muzzled, that we 
     <lb/>
     had been told by the right hon. Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister to get out of the House so that we 
     <lb/>
     would not be called upon to say anything— 
     <lb/>
    This was before the second reading of 
     <lb/>the Bill. He apparently was fishing 
     <lb/>for information and on that occasion 
     <lb/>he seemed to be endeavouring to show hon. 
     <lb/>members on the other side of the House how 
     <lb/>better he could fish than the hon. leader 
     <lb/>of the opposition who was sitting be<lb break="no"/>side him. He criticised us very severely and 
     <lb/>while he was calling us dumb followers I 
     <lb/>could not help thinking that it would have 
     <lb/>been well for him if some kind friend had 
     <lb/>put a muzzle on him on some occasions in 
     <lb/>the past so that he would not have been in 
     <lb/>the position that he is in to-day of having 
     <lb/>his old leader in the other House giving the 
     <lb/>

     correct record of some of the things that had 
     <lb/>
     taken place and putting him in the very 
     <lb/>
     awkward position before the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country of having given an incorrect state<lb break="no"/>ment of the facts. On that occasion he also 
     <lb/>
     told us that he had great pity for the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories—no Minister of the Interior, 
     <lb/>
     not a friend in the government and all the 
     <lb/>
     members from the Northwest dumb and 
     <lb/>
     muzzled. Within five minutes after making 
     <lb/>
     that assertion he made the assertion that 
     <lb/>
     the terms granted to the Territories by these 
     <lb/>
     Bills were so good, were so liberal, were so 
     <lb/>
     magnanimous that they would bring every 
     <lb/>
     other province knocking at the door of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion for better terms. If the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories had not any member in the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and had not any friends in the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and if the Northwest members did 
     <lb/>
     not do anything to help the Territories, they 
     <lb/>
     have not fared very badly according to that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On that occasion he was very anxious that 
     <lb/>
     the portfolio of the Interior should be filled 
     <lb/>
     and, Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that 
     <lb/>
     he is not half as sorry as the members from 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories are that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) is no 
     <lb/>
     longer the Minister of the Interior. Why ? 
     <lb/>
     Simply because we members from the west 
     <lb/>
     know better than any other class of men in 
     <lb/>
     this country just what the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories and what Canada has lost by that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman not being a member of the 
     <lb/>
     government. I had the pleasure of going 
     <lb/>
     to that western country in 1878, just in the 
     <lb/>
     month that Sir John Macdonald came into 
     <lb/>
     power, and I know what the conditions were. 
     <lb/>
     We know what their rule was for eighteen 
     <lb/>
     long years. We saw the Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway built through that country, we saw 
     <lb/>
     thousands and millions of dollars expended, 
     <lb/>
     we saw thousands and thousands of work<lb break="no"/>men brought into that country and we saw 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of thousands of dollars expended 
     <lb/>
     per annum in bringing in immigrants. What 
     <lb/>
     was the result ? The government of Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Macdonald spent money with a lavish 
     <lb/>
     hand in bringing in immigrants but they 
     <lb/>
     passed laws and regulations of such a 
     <lb/>
     nature and carried them out in such a man<lb break="no"/>ner that they drove the people out of the 
     <lb/>
     country. That was the result of their ad<lb break="no"/>ministration for eighteen long years. But, 
     <lb/>
     in 1896 a brighter day dawned for Canada 
     <lb/>
     and especially for the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     and if ever the right hon. leader of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment did one good day's work for Can<lb break="no"/>ada he did it on the day that he appointed 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Clifford Sifton as the member of 
     <lb/>
     his cabinet representing the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. What has taken place since that 
     <lb/>
     day about eight years ago ? The whole his<lb break="no"/>tory and the whole development of that 
     <lb/>
     country have undergone a change and you 
     <lb/>
     would not know the west now comparing it 
     <lb/>
     with what it was eight years ago. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Just to give an instance that can be read<lb break="no"/>ily understood by every hon. member of the 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3816</fw>
        

     House, I may say that at that time we had 
     <lb/>
     four members in this House from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. In 1901, when the census 
     <lb/>
     was taken, we were entitled to six mem<lb break="no"/>bers, and I have no doubt that the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons here thought they were doing 
     <lb/>
     a very generous act, as in fact they were, 
     <lb/>
     when they gave us ten members instead of 
     <lb/>
     six. But, if we had representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation in this House the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories would be represented by not ten mem<lb break="no"/>bers but by fifteen. Whatever advantage 
     <lb/>
     has been obtained for the Northwest in 
     <lb/>
     the past has been brought about largely by 
     <lb/>
     the active and energetic work of the ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior. And, Sir, I am sure I 
     <lb/>
     will meet with the approval of every mem<lb break="no"/>ber from the west when I say, that nothing 
     <lb/>
     would please us better than if it could hap<lb break="no"/>pen that the Hon. Mr. Sifton were again to 
     <lb/>
     take up his portfolio. I believe every mem<lb break="no"/>ber from the west will agree with me that 
     <lb/>
     we have not another man who is in the same 
     <lb/>
     class as he is, as regards ability for carry<lb break="no"/>ing on that work in the west and benefiting 
     <lb/>
     the country generally.

     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) may point 
     <lb/>
     over to this side of the House, but I ven<lb break="no"/>ture to say that neither the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) nor the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott), or any 
     <lb/>
     other man from the west will for a moment 
     <lb/>
     disagree with me, when I say, that there is 
     <lb/>
     no other man in the Liberal party, or in 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party either, in the west, 
     <lb/>
     or in any other part of Canada. who is able 
     <lb/>
     to take the place of Mr. Sifton as a repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of the west—not even the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean).

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. I would say further, that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) 
     <lb/>
     is too young a man and too able a man 
     <lb/>
     that Canada should lose his services. It is 
     <lb/>
     our hope, we Liberals at all events, that 
     <lb/>
     the country will be able to avail itself of 
     <lb/>
     his services before long, and that in 
     <lb/>
     the interests of the whole Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada we shall long retain him. 
     <lb/>
     When the hon. member for North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Foster) was recently fishing for 
     <lb/>
     information, he talked about dangling 
     <lb/>
     the portfolio of the Interior, and sena<lb break="no"/>torships, before the members from the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest in order to get their support for 
     <lb/>
     this Bill. Let me tell him that there is no 
     <lb/>
     member from the west who is not supporting 
     <lb/>
     this Bill on its merits, and the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Foster) went very far astray when 
     <lb/>
     he made the assertion to which I have re<lb break="no"/>ferred. But, of course, he ought to know ; 
     <lb/>
     he has been in the government and he has 
     <lb/>
     been out of the government and he went 
     <lb/>
     back into the government and he probably 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="3817" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-04_Page_3817.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3817</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 4, 1905</fw> 
        

     is in a first-class position to say that cabi<lb break="no"/>net positions are the price for men support<lb break="no"/>ing certain measures; but in the present 
     <lb/>
     instance I can tell him that such a thing 
     <lb/>
     does not exist. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In dealing with the provisions contained 
     <lb/>
     in this Bill, I shall first take up the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the division of the Territories into 
     <lb/>
     two provinces. When we had our first inter<lb break="no"/>view with the Prime Minister, and I was 
     <lb/>
     asked whether I favoured one or two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, my reply was that I favoured two 
     <lb/>
     provinces. But I want to say, with all due 
     <lb/>
     respect to the Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid Lau<lb break="no"/>rier, that even if he to-day wanted to extend 
     <lb/>
     the province of Manitoba west, he could not 
     <lb/>
     do it and there is nobody else in this country 
     <lb/>
     who can do it. The people in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories —eastern Assiniboia espe<lb break="no"/>cially, and my constituency runs for 144 
     <lb/>
     miles along the boundary of Manitoba— 
     <lb/>
     would not tolerate it. Talk about agitation 
     <lb/>
     there has been no agitation whatever in 
     <lb/>
     the west over this school question, but if 
     <lb/>
     this government or any other government 
     <lb/>
     or any power on earth tried to coerce us 
     <lb/>
     into the province of Manitoba, you would 
     <lb/>
     see an agitation that would be remem<lb break="no"/>bered. The first mistake that was made in 
     <lb/>
     defining the boundaries of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba was made by the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     government. These gentlemen opposite now 
     <lb/>
     endeavour to put the blame on this govern<lb break="no"/>ment or on the leader of this government 
     <lb/>
     for not extending the province of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     but the real blame rests with the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Sir John A. Macdonald. During 
     <lb/>
     the years between 1884 and 1896 many of us 
     <lb/>
     were in favour of extending Manitoba away 
     <lb/>
     up west to Moosejaw, and the matter was 
     <lb/>
     discussed not only among the settlers, but 
     <lb/>
     among the more prominent politicians of 
     <lb/>
     that territory. When a brighter day dawned 
     <lb/>
     in 1890, and we thought that possibly we 
     <lb/>
     would be able to have this mistake of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative government remedied, as well 
     <lb/>
     as a great many other mistakes of theirs, 
     <lb/>
     the matter was discussed very fully in the 
     <lb/>
     west, and a year or two afterwards the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of Manitoba was invited to 
     <lb/>
     East Assiniboia to discuss the question. A 
     <lb/>
     meeting was held at Indian Head and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Itoblin advocated his case, and Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain, one of his own political friends, took 
     <lb/>
     the other side. And, because the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Roblin got the worst of the debate he lost 
     <lb/>
     his temper a little bit, and with some of 
     <lb/>
     those characteristics of his that we in the 
     <lb/>
     west are familiar with, he undertook to 
     <lb/>
     threaten the people of East Assiniboia and 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest as to what would 
     <lb/>
     happen if we did not agree to join the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba. He told us that if we 
     <lb/>
     persisted in remaining a part of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     then Manitoba would regulate our freight 
     <lb/>
     rates and would not allow us to build rail<lb break="no"/>roads across that province, thus endeavouring 
     <lb/>
     to coerce us into joining with Manitoba. On 
     <lb/>
     that occasion, for ever was lost the chance 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3818</fw>
           

     of the eastern portion of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories joining the province of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     because we would not be coerced then and 
     <lb/>
     we will not be coerced now. That was, how<lb break="no"/>ever, only a sentimental reason. We ob<lb break="no"/>jected to being annexed to any province 
     <lb/>
     which would elect as prime minister a man 
     <lb/>
     who harboured the thought, that because we 
     <lb/>
     did not agree with him he would coerce us 
     <lb/>
     by increasing our freight rates and prevent<lb break="no"/>ing us from building railroads. But, if we ob<lb break="no"/>jected on that ground, we objected ten times 
     <lb/>
     more to being annexed to a province which 
     <lb/>
     would elect a premier, who having harbour<lb break="no"/>ed such a thought had not any more sense 
     <lb/>
     than to give expression to it. There is an<lb break="no"/>other and a far greater reason why 
     <lb/>
     we object now to being annexed to the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba, and it is this: 
     <lb/>
     We in the Northwest Territories are being 
     <lb/>
     formed into new provinces, without any 
     <lb/>
     debt, and we are getting a large debt allow<lb break="no"/>ance. The province of Manitoba had in 
     <lb/>
     1898 liabilities amounting to about $7,000,<lb break="no"/>000; but since that time those liabilities 
     <lb/>
     have been increased to nearly $30,000,000. 
     <lb/>
     The province of Manitoba has given guar<lb break="no"/>antees to one railway company alone to 
     <lb/>
     the extent of between $19,000,000 and $20,<lb break="no"/>000,000. So that it would be absurd to 
     <lb/>
     suppose that the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Tl'erritories would desire to join with the 
     <lb/>
     people of Manitoba, with these great lia<lb break="no"/>bilities resting upon them. Even during 
     <lb/>
     the last session of the Manitoba legislature 
     <lb/>
     guarantees amounting to some $2,000,000 or 
     <lb/>
     $3,000,000 were given to the same railway 
     <lb/>
     company, one of which was for terminals 
     <lb/>
     in the city of Winnipeg. Did anybody ever 
     <lb/>
     hear of such a thing in the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada before ? You may search the legis<lb break="no"/>lation of any other province in the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion. and you will not find such a thing 
     <lb/>
     I noticed in the Bill that passed through the 
     <lb/>
     legislature that there was also a guarantee 
     <lb/>
     of bonds for $10,000 a mile on an old truck 
     <lb/>
     seven miles long running into a gravel pit 
     <lb/>
     from one of the branch lines of the same 
     <lb/>
     railway. These are the ways in which the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba is piling up its lia<lb break="no"/>bilities, and this is the reason we would not 
     <lb/>
     listen to the proposition of that provmce to 
     <lb/>
     enlarge its boundaries westward. So that 
     <lb/>
     if' the province of Manitoba is not enlarged 
     <lb/>
     towards the west, it is not the fault of the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of the Dominion. The mem<lb break="no"/>bers from the west are prepared to take 
     <lb/>
     the responsibility of standing in the way of 
     <lb/>
     that extension. A little while ago two of 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba ministers were down here, 
     <lb/>
     and one of the reasons they gave why 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba should have all the country north 
     <lb/>
     was that it had always governed that coun<lb break="no"/>try. That is not a proper statement of the 
     <lb/>
     case. It is true, the Lieutenant-Governor 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba had jurisdiction there; but 
     <lb/>
     he was paid out of the Dominion treasury 
     <lb/>
     for all the expenditure in connection with 
     <lb/>

     that unorganized territory. They also claim<lb break="no"/>ed that the magistrates of Manitoba had 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction there. They had   
     <lb/>
    equal jurisdiction. The people of the North<lb break="no"/>west have no objection to the province of 
     <lb/>Manitoba being extended to the north. In 
     <lb/>fact, they think that right and proper, and 
     <lb/>will not stand in the way. But if the 
     <lb/>province of Manitoba wants to get all the 
     <lb/>territory to the north of Manitoba, Ontario 
     <lb/>and Quebec, and if the people of Ontario 
     <lb/>and Quebec are satisfied that their hinter<lb break="no"/>land should go to Manitoba, well and good ; 
     <lb/>there will be no objection raised by the 
     <lb/>people of Saskatchewan. But a portion of 
     <lb/>the old district of Saskatchewan has been 
     <lb/>left out of the proposed province of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan, and has'been left in the unor<lb break="no"/>ganized territory, and on that territory we 
     <lb/>have not relinquished our claim. There 
     <lb/>are a number of settlers there who have a 
     <lb/>right to be consulted: and we propose 
     <lb/>when the time comes. to make a claim to 
     <lb/>have our province extended to Hudson bay. 
     <lb/>\Vc also want a port on Hudson bay. The 
     <lb/>Territories have far more interest in the 
     <lb/>Hudson bay route than the province of 
     <lb/>Manitoba can have. If you take a point in 
     <lb/>the centre of the wheat-growing por<lb break="no"/>tion of Manitoba, you will find that it 
     <lb/>is as near to navigation on Lake Superior 
     <lb/>as it is to Hudson bay ; but when you take 
     <lb/>the centre of the wheat-growing portion of 
     <lb/>the Northwest Territories, you will find 
     <lb/>that a line drawn from there to Port Arthur 
     <lb/>or Fort William is nearly double the length 
     <lb/>of a line from the same point to a port on 
     <lb/>Hudson bay. Not that I think it makes 
     <lb/>much difference whether that port happens 
     <lb/>to be in the province of Manitoba or in 
     <lb/>any other province. I do not agree with 
     <lb/>the remarks made by the premier of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba on that subject at all. At the same 
     <lb/>time, that part. of Hudson bay is nearer 
     <lb/>to our province; and as there is an im<lb break="no"/>mense coast line there. there will be plenty 
     <lb/>of room for each of the provinces—Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan— 
     <lb/>to have a good sea frontage on Hudson bay.

     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. If I understand the hon. 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     having a port on Hudson bay. The Bill does 
     <lb/>
     not provide for that; and yet I under<lb break="no"/>stood the hon. gentleman to say that the

     had been left out of the new province of

     Saskatchewan: it has not been given to

     our boundary extended to the shores of

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. For one reason, because 
     <lb/>
     we are running this thing now. When my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend, after doing penance for another 
     <lb/>
     ten or fifteen years, may come back to 
     <lb/>
     power, he will have the pleasure of doing 
     <lb/>
     things as he has done in the past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Not if he has lived on 
     <lb/>
     the pap of office, as the hon. gentleman has 
     <lb/>
     done under the present administration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. Well, I lived for five years 
     <lb/>
     under a government salary, and I never 
     <lb/>
     worked as hard in my life as I did during 
     <lb/>
     those five years, and I never in my life 
     <lb/>
     earned money better than I did then. What 
     <lb/>
     is more, I gave good value for the money 
     <lb/>
     that was paid me. I was paid $3,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year for doing well the work that the man 
     <lb/>
     appointed by the hon. gentleman's govern<lb break="no"/>ment was paid $5,000 for doing badly. I did 
     <lb/>
     more work in one year than he ever did in 
     <lb/>
     live. It comes with ill grace from the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member to accuse me of living on govern<lb break="no"/>ment pap. I never lived on govern<lb break="no"/>ment pap. I worked for my money. I was 
     <lb/>
     offered the position and refused it; I was 
     <lb/>
     offered it a second time and accepted it; 
     <lb/>
     and I resigned it of my own free will. and 
     <lb/>
     against the wishes of the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. A man who writes his 
     <lb/>
     own certificates of character is extremely 
     <lb/>
     modest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Marquette (Mr. W. J. Roche) took a fling at 
     <lb/>
     the ex-Minister of the Interior because he 
     <lb/>
     had not said anything about the extension of 
     <lb/>
     the boundaries of Manitoba. The ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior knows better than the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Marquette that the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Manitoba are absolutely 
     <lb/>
     safe in the hands of the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who leads the government at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time, and that it was not necessary 
     <lb/>
     for him to have anything at all to say about 
     <lb/>
     that. The otherday. when the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Calgary (Mr. M. S. McCarthy) was criti<lb break="no"/>cising the government for the manner in 
     <lb/>
     which it divided the country into two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. he claimed that the line of division 
     <lb/>
     should have been sixty miles further east. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that my hon. friend is a great 
     <lb/>
     deal more anxious to favour the district of 
     <lb/>
     Calgary than to get a proper dividing line. 
     <lb/>
     IIc said himself that the only difference in 
     <lb/>
     the areas was about 8,000 square miles. 
     <lb/>
     whereas if you put the dividing line sixty 
     <lb/>
     miles further east the difference would be 
     <lb/>
     75.000 square miles. Well. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     that if you were to try for a month, you 
     <lb/>
     would get a more reasonable and fair di<lb break="no"/>
         

            <pb n="3821" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-04_Page_3821.jpg"/>

     viding line than the fourth meridian. It 
     <lb/>
     is a well—known line. and in that respect 
     <lb/>
     more acceptable than any of the lilies be<lb break="no"/>tween the different ranges. One of the 
     <lb/>
     reasons advanced by my hon. friend was 
     <lb/>
     that this dividing line would not include all 
     <lb/>
     the ranching country in the western pro<lb break="no"/>vince; but, Sir, the ranching country ex<lb break="no"/>tends right down to the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. I have in my own constituency, with<lb break="no"/>in thirty or forty miles of Manitoba, dozens 
     <lb/>
     of men who have made their living the 
     <lb/>
     last fifteen or twenty years in ranching- 
     <lb/>
     men who do not grow any grain, but de<lb break="no"/>pend solely on the raising of cattle, and 
     <lb/>
     whose cattle are let loose all summer and 
     <lb/>
     branded just as they are up in southern 
     <lb/>
     Alberta. So that if the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     wanted to make the western province wide 
     <lb/>
     enough to take in all the ranches, he would 
     <lb/>
     have had to bring it down to the borders of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. In addition, let me say that, 
     <lb/>
     from my knowledge of the country, gained in 
     <lb/>
     the course of twenty-seven years' residence 
     <lb/>
     there, during six years of which I was Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of Dominion Lands, the two new 
     <lb/>
     provinces are about as nearly equal as any 
     <lb/>
     one could wish, not only in area. but in their 
     <lb/>
     capacity for supporting population. To 
     <lb/>
     prove that, all I need say is this, that the 
     <lb/>
     different railway companies which had the 
     <lb/>
     right to select railway lands all over that 
     <lb/>
     country, have selected 13,000,000 of acres in 
     <lb/>
     the proposed province of Saskatchewan and 
     <lb/>
     12,000,000 in the proposed province of Al<lb break="no"/>berta; and, from my own knowledge, I 
     <lb/>
     know they would have selected a good deal 
     <lb/>
     less in Saskatchewan and more in Alberta. 
     <lb/>
     were it not for the fact that there are more 
     <lb/>
     railways under construction in the new pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Saskatchewan than in its twin sister 
     <lb/>
     Alberta, so that the lands in the former, 
     <lb/>
     though in some respects not as good as in 
     <lb/>
     the latter, are on that account more saleable. 
     <lb/>
     In the two provinces. therefore, the area of 
     <lb/>
     grain-growing land is about equal. In ad<lb break="no"/>dition. we must not lose sight of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the province of Alberta has the greatest 
     <lb/>
     deposit of coal of any country in the world. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think that even British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     has as great coal deposits as are to be found 
     <lb/>
     in Alberta. Wherever you go into the Rocky 
     <lb/>
     mountains, from the American boundary 
     <lb/>
     right up to the Peace river pass, vast de<lb break="no"/>posits of coal have been discovered. Right 
     <lb/>
     in the Crow's Nest pass there are seams of 
     <lb/>
     from ten to seventy feet in thickness of 
     <lb/>
     bituminous coal, and for hundreds of miles 
     <lb/>
     we find large deposits of coal right up to 
     <lb/>
     Edmonton, the Peace river pass. so that out<lb break="no"/>side the agricultural wealth of that country, 
     <lb/>
     you will have in the years to come large 
     <lb/>
     settlements growing up all along the Rockies 
     <lb/>
     owing to the coal industries there. All 
     <lb/>
     along the Rockies, especially north of the 
     <lb/>
     main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, 
     <lb/>
     there are also thousands of miles of valuable 
     <lb/>
     spruce and fir now beginning to be exploit<lb break="no"/>ed, so that in a few years that country will 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3822</fw>
      

     be able to supply all the timber required 
     <lb/>
     by the settlers in the prairie country and in 
     <lb/>
     the east. So that, although the proposed 
     <lb/>
     province of Alberta may have from 6,000 to 
     <lb/>
     8,000 miles less of area than its twin sister 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan, the deficiency is more than 
     <lb/>
     made up by its coal deposits and timber 
     <lb/>
     limits. In making this comparison, I am 
     <lb/>
     not taking into consideration the great 
     <lb/>
     Peace river country. I do not know per<lb break="no"/>sonally what that country may be. I have 
     <lb/>
     heard reports good and bad about it ; but I 
     <lb/>
     want to say this, that after an experience 
     <lb/>
     of twenty-seven years, I have come to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that there is no one part of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest, from the boundaries of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     to the Rocky mountains, which does not turn 
     <lb/>
     out better than expected the more we learn 
     <lb/>
     about it. I have found that to be the invari<lb break="no"/>able result. In that district where I have 
     <lb/>
     lived many years, the Moose mountain coun<lb break="no"/>try, I remember fifteen years ago the people 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba said you could not grow any 
     <lb/>
     wheat, because it was too dry, yet there is 
     <lb/>
     no liner wheat-growing country in the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories to-day. Why, in the first few years 
     <lb/>
     of grain-growing around Regina, there was 
     <lb/>
     more wheat sown than was reaped, and yet 
     <lb/>
     there is to-day no finer wheat country than 
     <lb/>
     the immense plain around that city. Only 
     <lb/>
     ten years ago, if I were asked myself if 
     <lb/>
     wheat could be grown in southern Alberta, 
     <lb/>
     I would have said no ; but what is the case 
     <lb/>
     to-day ? We have thousands and thousands 
     <lb/>
     of acres of the finest wheat-growing there 
     <lb/>
     every year. In fact, all over the country 
     <lb/>
     you will find that the more you learn about 
     <lb/>
     it the better it turns out. There are vast 
     <lb/>
     stretches in the new province of Alberta 
     <lb/>
     which, a few years ago, were looked upon 
     <lb/>
     as suitable only for ranching, but which 
     <lb/>
     will be producing good crops of wheat every 
     <lb/>
     year within a very short period. In that 
     <lb/>
     whole country of Saskatchewan and Al<lb break="no"/>berta there is not an acre, generally speak<lb break="no"/>ing, which, if not adapted for wheat—grow<lb break="no"/>ing, is not good for cattle or the grazing of 
     <lb/>
     horses, so that there is practically not a 
     <lb/>
     waste acre in all that country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I should like to say a few words on the 
     <lb/>
     financial question. That, I notice, is a mat<lb break="no"/>ter which has scarcely been touched by hon. 
     <lb/>
     members opposite, but which is neverthe<lb break="no"/>less of great importance to us in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. In my opinion, the government has 
     <lb/>
     started us out very fairly. In fact, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) said 
     <lb/>
     that all the other provinces would be knock<lb break="no"/>ing at the door of the federal administration 
     <lb/>
     because of the good terms we had received. 
     <lb/>
     On that point I do not agree with him, be<lb break="no"/>cause, in my judgment, we are being given 
     <lb/>
     pretty much the same terms as were granted 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces. Each of our new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces is to get $50,000 for civil government. 
     <lb/>
     The province of Ontario gets $80,000, Quebec 
     <lb/>
     $70,000 and the lower provinces, with the 
     <lb/>
     exception of Prince Edward Island, get 
     <lb/>
     $50,000 each. So that I do not see any 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="3823" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-04_Page_3823.jpg"/>
          
     <fw type="num">3823</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>  

ground for complaint in that respect. We<lb/>get a debt allowance on our population the<lb/>same as is given the other provinces, so<lb/>that there is no ground of complaint there.<lb/>We get a per capita allowance of 80 cents<lb/>on our population up to 800,000. There<lb/>might perhaps be some criticism of that ar<lb break="no"/>rangement, because the lower provinces,<lb/>Manitoba and British Columbia only get a<lb/>per capita grant up to a population of 400,<lb break="no"/>000, whereas Ontario gets it based on a<lb/>population of 1,400,000 and Quebec on a<lb/>population a little less. These two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces get it on the population they had<lb/>when they entered confederation. I do not<lb/>think, however, that there can be any rea<lb break="no"/>sonable ground for criticism because our<lb/>limit of population has been increased to<lb/>800,000 while some of the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces had theirs left at 400,000.<lb/>They came into confederation some thirty-<lb break="yes"/>seven years ago, and it has taken all these<lb/>years for them to get up to the limit of<lb/>population. Nova Scotia is the only prov<lb break="no"/>ince of the three that has passed the limit,<lb/>and it is only by a narrow margin. So that<lb/>the limitation of population on which we re<lb break="no"/>ceive 80c. per capita will be reached in our<lb/>province in very much less time than thirty-<lb break="yes"/>seven years; in fact, we expect that in a<lb/>few years we shall have reached that popu<lb break="no"/>lation. I, for one, have never been able to<lb/>understand why this limit has been placed<lb/>on any of the provinces; I cannot see why<lb/>that 80c. per capita should not be paid to<lb/>each of the provinces on their actual popu<lb break="no"/>lation. Every additional inhabitant coming<lb/>into these provinces pay, roughly speaking,<lb/>$10 yearly into the revenues of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion government; and I do not know any<lb/>good reason why 80c. of that should not go<lb/>back to the province for the carrying on<lb/>of provincial work, and if, in the future<lb/>the other provinces shall make a demand<lb/>on this government to have that per capita<lb/>grant paid on their actual population, I<lb/>should think they would be within their<lb/>rights, and also that the Dominion would<lb/>be perfectly justified in granting that de<lb break="no"/>mand. And I am sure that the provinces<lb/>of Alberta and Saskatchewan would take<lb/>exactly the same view in asking that the per<lb/>capita grant be made on the actual popula<lb break="no"/>tion of each province. I believe that in this<lb/>matter there is not much to complain of.<lb/>Now, as to what we get in lieu of our lands<lb/>—which, I suppose, is what the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) was re<lb break="no"/>ferring to. I, for one, am perfectly satisfied<lb/>with the arrangement made. I think it is<lb/>a better arrangement than to have handed<lb/>over the lands to the provinces. That was<lb/>made clear by the hon. member from Ed<lb break="no"/>monton (Mr. Oliver), who showed with ab<lb break="no"/>solute clearness that the ideas of the two<lb/>governments, the provincial and the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion, would be absolutely different, that if<lb/>the lands were handed over to the provinces<lb/>they must use them for the purpose of pro<lb break="no"/>ducing immediate revenue, whereas by<lb/>
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3824</fw>
       

     keeping the lands in the hands of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government they would be used<lb/>rather to fill up the country and not neces<lb break="no"/>sarily for the taking of the last dollar out<lb/>of the lands. But, if the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment should decide to change their policy<lb/>and dispose of the odd sections, keeping the<lb/>even sections absolutely for the poor man's<lb/>homestead, if they should decide to sell<lb/>the lands for instance, as they sell their<lb/>school lands, they will eventually accumu<lb break="no"/>late a fund from these lands the interest<lb/>on which will pay the subsidy they are giv<lb break="no"/>ing to the provinces in lieu of the lands.<lb/>So, it appears to me, it is a good arrange<lb break="no"/>ment for the province and a good arrange<lb break="no"/>ment for the Dominion. It is a particularly<lb/>good arrangement for the provinces in this<lb/>respect, that the revenue is a net revenue,<lb/>the provinces have no expenses in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the administration of the lands,<lb/>and it is a revenue that grows with the in<lb break="no"/>crease of population. We only get the full<lb/>revenue from the lands when we have a<lb/>population of 1,200,000 in each of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. So, having it in this shape, I think<lb/>
    the people of the Northwest can congratulate 
     <lb/>themselves upon having received fair and 
     <lb/>handsome treatment at the hands of the 
     <lb/>Dominion government, and that the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion government has also made a bargain 
     <lb/>that is absolutely justifiable. I am pleased 
     <lb/>to say that there has been very little 
     <lb/>criticism in connection with this phase 
     <lb/>of the matter. One thing I might point 
     <lb/>out is that there is no danger of the 
     <lb/>public domain, the source of revenue, being 
     <lb/>squandered. Now, I would not for a mo<lb break="no"/>ment allow that the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>Territories are not as well able to look after 
     <lb/>their own affairs as are any other people 
     <lb/>in the Dominion. But there is this fact 
     <lb/>that we must all acknowledge—that in the 
     <lb/>past the different railway companies have 
     <lb/>managed to get bonuses and guarantees out 
     <lb/>of practically every province in the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion. I cannot say how it is in Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, but I know how it is in every 
     <lb/>other province in the Dominion. Take, for 
     <lb/>instance, the province of Manitoba. As I 
     <lb/>said a little while ago they have gone secur<lb break="no"/>ity for between $19,000,000 and $20,000,000 
     <lb/>for one railway company alone. That rail<lb break="no"/>way may be all right, but we know what 
     <lb/>the history of railway companies has been. 
     <lb/>There is always a chance of that liability 
     <lb/>being called upon. We know what British 
     <lb/>Columbia has done in giving away large 
     <lb/>tracts of land and coal and timber bonuses 
     <lb/>to railways. We know what the lower 
     <lb/>provinces and Quebec and Ontario have 
     <lb/>given in cash or guarantees. And we know 
     <lb/>that the Northwest Territories have been 
     <lb/>for years getting hundreds of miles of rail<lb break="no"/>ways throughout its length and breadth 
     <lb/>without the cost of a single dollar to the 
     <lb/>province in any way ; and if the people of 
     <lb/>the Territories will have the sense to stand 
     <lb/>firm and not give any grants to the railway 
     <lb/>
   

            <pb n="3825" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-04_Page_3825.jpg"/>

     companies they will get the railways built 
     <lb/>
     just as well and just as quickly and just as 
     <lb/>
     nearly where they want them as if they were 
     <lb/>
     giving guarantees or cash bonuses to the 
     <lb/>
     railway companies. So, these provinces are 
     <lb/>
     starting out with everything in their favour, 
     <lb/>
     and here I wish to say that the government 
     <lb/>
     as conducted in the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     for many years past by Mr. Haultaln has 
     <lb/>
     been in every respect a good and satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory government for the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. And I have no doubt that whoever 
     <lb/>
     may be called upon to carry on the govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the new provinces will carry it on 
     <lb/>
     in the same manner; but, not owning their 
     <lb/>
     own lands, they will not have the same 
     <lb/>
     temptation, and they will not have these 
     <lb/>
     magnates after them every day trying to 
     <lb/>
     get bonuses and guarantees as would be 
     <lb/>
     the case if the provinces were the owners 
     <lb/>owners of the public lands. I notice now that hon.<lb/>gentleman on the other side of the House<lb/>are very anxious to hand overthe lands to <lb/>the governments of the new provinces. But<lb/>what has been the record of these hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen? When the province of Manitoba <lb/>asked for its own lands, these gentlemen<lb/>refused. If they were so anxious to con<lb break="no"/>serve the lands of the Northwest Territories<lb/>for the people of these Terrirtories, why did<lb/>they give away the railroads millions and<lb/>millions of acres of those lands? I do not<lb/>say so much about the land grant given to <lb/>the Canadian Pacific Railway, for in those<lb/>days it was difficult to get a road built <lb/>through that part of the country, because<lb/>we did not know it was well as we do now.<lb/>But since then, millions of acres of land in<lb/>the Northwest have been given away as<lb/>bonuses for the building of railways in <lb/>Manitoba. If hon. gentleman on the other<lb/>side are so anxious as they appear to be to<lb/>conserve the lands of the Nortwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories for the people of those Territories,<lb/>why did they act in this manner? It comes<lb/>with a bad grace from hon. gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite to talk of handling over the lands to <lb/>the people of the Northwest when they <lb/>themselves gave away millions of acres of <lb/>the choicest of our land to railway com<lb break="no"/>panies. We in the Northwest Territories, in<lb/>addition, must pay our share of the cash<lb/>bounties given to railways in every part of<lb/>the country.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, I said when I started that I would 
     <lb/>
     be only a short time, and I am going to try 
     <lb/>
     and keep my word. I wish now to deal very 
     <lb/>
     briefly with the school question. As I said 
     <lb/>
     before, I think this question has been given a 
     <lb/>
     great deal too much prominence. And I 
     <lb/>
     want to say that I believe the reason why 
     <lb/>
     we have an agitation of any kind is absol<lb break="no"/>utely from the lack of knowledge on the part <lb/>of the people in the east of the class of
<lb/>schools which we have in the Northwest 
<lb/>Territories.<lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     I believe if every Protestant clergyman in 
     <lb/>
     Canada and every newspaper editor knew 
     <lb/>
     the class of schools we have to-day in the 
     <lb/>
 <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3826</fw>

Northwest Territories, this agitation would
<lb/>cease. We have heard this question dis<lb break="no"/>cussed week in and week out, I have listen<lb break="no"/>ed to it hour after hour, and it has all been
<lb/>about separate schools. Well, Mr. Speaker,
<lb/>I am aware that among Protestants we have
<lb/>been accustomed for the past fifteen or
<lb/>twenty years to think of a separate school
<lb/>as something very bad. But whatever the
<lb/>separate schools may be in Ontario, or
<lb/>may have been in the province of Manitoba,
<lb/>or in the Northwest Territories in former
<lb/>days, we are not dealing with that class of
<lb/>schools at the present time. Let us deal
<lb/>with separate schools such as they exist in
<lb/>the Northwest Territories at the present 
<lb/>day, and I am satisfied that if their true
<lb/>character were known this agitation would
<lb/>drop at once. But I do not think that is
<lb/>line object of a good many, it is not the ob<lb break="no"/>ject of some hon. members on the other side<lb/>of this House, their object is to keep up<lb/>the agitation in order to make some poli<lb break="no"/>tical capital out of it. As on hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man opposite said to me the other day:<lb/>You fellows came in on this question be<lb break="no"/>fore, and we are coming in on it now. And <lb/>judging by the actions of hon. gentlemen <lb/>opposite, it looks very much as it he were<lb/>right.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. If that logic is correct, 
     <lb/>
     the government is going to burst up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. That is what one of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's own supporters said. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
      <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. And the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     says it looks as if he were right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. I said it looked as if the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Grey and his friends 
     <lb/>
     were keeping up the agitation for that pur<lb break="no"/>pose—that is what I meant to say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I desire to tell the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman that there is not one word of truth 
     <lb/>
     in that. The hon. member for East Grey 
     <lb/>
     stood exactly for the same principle in 1896. 
     <lb/>
     and fought in company with gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     occupy the Treasury benches to—day for the 
     <lb/>
     same principle. and he is standing by it 
     <lb/>
     still.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. I know this, that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Grey has gone out of 
     <lb/>
     his way to agitate the people in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">MR. SPROULE</persName>. That is not so.      
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. I know he has had<lb/>printed petition forms sent out to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to be signed and sent back 
     <lb/>
     to him, in opposition to separate schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. No, not at all. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. Well, he mentioned sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools in those petitions<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Not a word. Allow me to 
     <lb/>
     correct the hon. gentleman, there is not a 
     <lb/>
     word in them about separate schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. Well, that is exactly

     have not the courage to come out and say 
     <lb/>
     what they mean, they are hiding behind the 
     <lb/>
     rock of the constitution, so that when an elec<lb break="no"/>tion comes on they can go into the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec and say : We voted against the 
     <lb/>
     government because the government was not 
     <lb/>
     going far enough, was not giving you the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools you were entitled to under 
     <lb/>
     the constitution ; then they can go into the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario and say : We voted 
     <lb/>
     against the government because we wanted 
     <lb/>
     to leave the new provinces the power to do 
     <lb/>
     what they pleased, as the member for Jac<lb break="no"/>ques Cartier (Mr. Monk) said the other day, 
     <lb/>
     so that they may wipe out the last vestige 
     <lb/>
     of the rights given under the Act of 1875. 
     <lb/>
     That is what I object to—these hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men have not the courage to come out 
     <lb/>
     openly and say what they mean. We, on 
     <lb/>
     this side of the House, say what we propose 
     <lb/>
     to do, and if we are doing wrong we can 
     <lb/>
     be punished for it. But hon. gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite don't want to take that position, they 
     <lb/>
     want to hide behind the constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. What did his leader say 
     <lb/>
     about standing on the constitution ? What 
     <lb/>
     was he hiding behind ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. Yes, my leader said he 
     <lb/>
     was standing on the constitution, the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentleman said he was stand<lb break="no"/>ing on the constitution, while the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Jacques Cartier said the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion was altogether a different thing from 
     <lb/>
     what his leader had described it. Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain says the constitution means something 
     <lb/>
     else ; and our friends opposite quote Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Christopher Robinson's opinion which shows 
     <lb/>
     a still further difference. Now, I do not 
     <lb/>
     pretend to know anything about constitu<lb break="no"/>tional law, and the only difference between 
     <lb/>
     myself and the great lawyers on the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the House is that while I do not 
     <lb/>
     know anything about constitutional law, I 
     <lb/>
     am well aware of the fact. Now, Sir, there 
     <lb/>
     has not been a single word said by hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite about separate schools 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest since this discussion start<lb break="no"/>ed, and I propose to say something about 
     <lb/>
     them. I know what they have been for a 
     <lb/>
     long time back. Over twenty years ago I 
     <lb/>
     was a member of the Territorial legislature 
     <lb/>
     when the first school ordinance was passed 
     <lb/>
     in 1884, passed under the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories Act of 1875. Previously to 1892 we 
     <lb/>
     had a system of separate schools, the same 
     <lb/>
     kind of schools they had in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. Those schools were not satis<lb break="no"/>factory,; everybody knows that ; they were 
     <lb/>
     not even satisfactory to our Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     friends and ratepayers. They were not sa<lb break="no"/>tisfied with the class of schools given them, 
     <lb/>
     and were as anxious to have them changed 
     <lb/>
     as anybody else. In the year 1892 the local 
     <lb/>
     legislature, under Mr. Haultain, changed the 
     <lb/>
     old system, and from that year up to the 
     <lb/>
     present day there has not been one word of 
     <lb/>
     protest heard against the schools from 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3828</fw>
        

     no protest has been made either to the local 
     <lb/>
     legislature or to this government. If that 
     <lb/>
     school system had not been satisfactory, do 
     <lb/>
     you think, Mr. Speaker, there would not have 
     <lb/>
     been an agitation ? Don't you think the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest people would have been appeal<lb break="no"/>ing to this House ? The people of the North<lb break="no"/>west are accustomed at all times to kick 
     <lb/>
     vigorously when they think that things are 
     <lb/>
     not right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The people of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     are accustomed to kick very vigorously to the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest legislature if things are not right, 
     <lb/>
     and I want to say again that since 1892, 
     <lb/>
     since the present law was passed, there has 
     <lb/>
     never been a word of complaint from Pro<lb break="no"/>testants or Catholics or from the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     government in any shape or form, or any 
     <lb/>
     statement that the law was not a good one. 
     <lb/>
     I say that the law as it exists in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to-day—and it is the only 
     <lb/>
     law that we are putting in force—is the 
     <lb/>
     most satisfactory law that you can get, 
     <lb/>
     because we have proof of it in the fact that 
     <lb/>
     it has been in force for thirteen years with<lb break="no"/>out ever a complaint having been made. 
     <lb/>
     What does that law give them ? As 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Jacques Cartier 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Monk) stated the other day, if 
     <lb/>
     church schools were what were given 
     <lb/>
     to the Roman Catholics in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories by the Act of 1875, there 
     <lb/>
     is only a small vestige of them left, and 
     <lb/>
     for this reason : That the separate Catholic 
     <lb/>
     school in the Northwest, or the public Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic school–it does not matter much which 
     <lb/>
     —is to all intents and purposes a public 
     <lb/>
     school. It is exactly the same as a public 
     <lb/>
     school. The teachers of the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     separate school must attend the same normal 
     <lb/>
     school and get the same certificates exactly 
     <lb/>
     as the teachers in the public schools. The 
     <lb/>
     school has to be inspected before any 
     <lb/>
     grant can be paid, by a public school in<lb break="no"/>spector. The only difference is that in the 
     <lb/>
     first and second readers the text is a little 
     <lb/>
     different, but even these books have to be 
     <lb/>
     authorized by the Minister of Education. 
     <lb/>
     There is no church or clerical control in any 
     <lb/>
     shape, form or manner over the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     separate schools of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories to-day. They are all under the control 
     <lb/>
     of the local legislature, every one of them, 
     <lb/>
     and the only difference—and it is not much 
     <lb/>
     or a difference either, because the public 
     <lb/>
     schools have the same right if they choose 
     <lb/>
     to use it—is that between half-past three 
     <lb/>
     o'clock in the afternoon and four, they may 
     <lb/>
     impart religious instruction. Now, I am 
     <lb/>
     going to ask in this Canada of ours, in this 
     <lb/>
     British colony, in this country that is sup<lb break="no"/>posed to take its institutions from our 
     <lb/>
     mother country, from that mother country 
     <lb/>
     where they are liberal and broad-minded, 
     <lb/>
     if there is a Protestant amongst us who 
     <lb/>
     would say that he would do away with the 
     <lb/>
     right of our Roman Catholic friends in 
     <lb/>
     their own schools to teach their children and

     to give them religious instruction if they so 
     <lb/>
     desire for half an hour after half past three 
     <lb/>
     o'clock ? I represent a constituency, which, 
     <lb/>
     while it is not the largest in area, is one 
     <lb/>
     of the most populous districts in the North<lb break="no"/>west. In my district they have 234 schools, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not believe there is one per cent 
     <lb/>
     of the people in that country who will ob<lb break="no"/>ject or ever did object to their Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic fellow citizens giving half an hour's 
     <lb/>
     religious instruction in their own schools 
     <lb/>
     if they so desire. When this matter is ex<lb break="no"/>plained to the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, when they understand that no 
     <lb/>
     change is being made, that this is simply 
     <lb/>
     carrying into effect and continuing the exist<lb break="no"/>ing state of affairs that they have brought 
     <lb/>
     about by the ordinances that they have 
     <lb/>
     themselves passed and that they have work<lb break="no"/>ed under for the last thirteen years, when 
     <lb/>they find out that this is all that is being 
     <lb/>done, you will not be able to get up an agita<lb break="no"/>tion against the continuance of that state of  
     <lb/>affairs. I want to say here that personally 
     <lb/>I am not in favour of separate schools. 
     <lb/>I think it would be better if all the child<lb break="no"/>ren went to the public schools, but these 
     <lb/>separate schools in the Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies are so near public schools that I do not 
     <lb/>think it is worth while making any trouble 
     <lb/>over it. It must be remembered that this 
     <lb/>is not a Catholic country, that it is not a 
     <lb/>Protestant country, but that it is a country 
     <lb/>in which Catholics and Protestants live to<lb break="no"/>gether and in which there are nearly as 
     <lb/>many Catholics as Protestants, and I say 
     <lb/>that it would be beneath the generosity, to 
     <lb/>put it on no other ground, of the Protestant 
     <lb/>majority, after making the school a good 
     <lb/>school, a public school in every respect, to 
     <lb/>turn around and say : Because we have 
     <lb/>fifty-eight per cent of the population and you 
     <lb/>have only forty-two per cent we will not 
     <lb/>allow you even to impart half an hour's 
     <lb/>religious instruction to your children after 
     <lb/>half past three, before they go home. A 
     <lb/>great deal of the argument that has been 
     <lb/>addressed to the House from the other side 
     <lb/>has been against separate schools. I do 
     <lb/>not wish to make very much use of the argu<lb break="no"/>ments presented by hon. gentlemen from 
     <lb/>this side of the House, but I think the point 
     <lb/>made by my hon. friend from Edmonton 
     <lb/>(Mr. Oliver) is worth emphasizing, and that 
     <lb/>was that if there was any objection to 
     <lb/>separate schools by hon. members on the 
     <lb/>other side of the House, why have they 
     <lb/>not during the last twenty years come for<lb break="no"/>ward and had the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>Act of 1875 amended ? It was open to 
     <lb/>hon. gentlemen on the other side of the 
     <lb/>House, but no, they had nothing at all to 
     <lb/>say about it, they left it exactly as it was, 
     <lb/>but now, when action is being taken in the 
     <lb/>Northwest, they come forward with the 
     <lb/>argument against separate schools, not the 
     <lb/>schools that exist in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, because we have no ecclesiastical 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3830</fw>
         

     or clerical schools there, but they bring<lb/>forward all the arguments that can be<lb/>to separate schools in other parts of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, and they argue as if they applied to the<lb/>Northwest Territories, and as I said be<lb break="no"/>fore all for the purpose of trying to get into<lb/>power in this question and for no other<lb/>purpose whatever. The schools we have in<lb/>the Northwest Territories, I will venture<lb/>to say, are absolutely satisfactory to 95<lb/>per cent of the whole population, both Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic and Protestant. As I stated the other<lb/>night when my hon. friend from West<lb/>Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) was speaking, I held<lb/>thirty-nine meetings during the campaign.<lb/>At every one of these meetings the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of provincial autonomy was discussed<lb/>and a number of these meetings were held<lb/>in the school-houses and at no meeting from<lb/>the beginning to the end did any man, Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholic or Protestant, mention the 
     <lb/>
     subject of separate schools. Why ? Be<lb break="no"/>cause they were perfectly satisfied with the 
     <lb/>
     school system that exists. Just to show the 
     <lb/>
     House that many of the people there are not 
     <lb/>
     aware of the fact that there are any separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools—there are only nine Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic separate schools in working or<lb break="no"/>der in the Northwest Territories to<lb break="no"/>day—since the question has been up 
     <lb/>
     for discussion I received a letter from 
     <lb/>
     a prominent gentleman in my con<lb break="no"/>stituency asking me to vote against sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools and for the continuance of the 
     <lb/>
     present satisfactory system of schools that 
     <lb/>
     exists in the Northwest Territories. I may 
     <lb/>
     say, further, that the only separate school 
     <lb/>
     that is in working order in my constituency 
     <lb/>
     out of over 200 is almost at this gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     door. It is near his own town where 
     <lb/>
     he lives. So, you will see that the school sys<lb break="no"/>tem we have in the northwest Territories is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely satisfactory to the people there. I 
     <lb/>
     know the argument is made : Why not 
     <lb/>
     trust the people of the Northwest ? Well, 
     <lb/>
     I would be very glad to do that, because I 
     <lb/>
     think that they would not change the system 
     <lb/>
     we have. Mr. Haultain has stated that if 
     <lb/>
     he were a dictator to-morrow he would not 
     <lb/>
     change the system. When Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     prepared his draft Bill what did he do ? 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain proposed in that draft Bill 
     <lb/>
     to give the Roman Catholic minority separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools as they existed under the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1875 and prior to 1892. He put that down 
     <lb/>
     in plain black and white in his draft Bill, 
     <lb/>
     and no gentleman on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House can contradict the assertion. After 
     <lb/>
     preparing that Bill, Mr. Haultain appealed 
     <lb/>
     to the country, and he was returned be<lb break="no"/>cause the people of the Territories were 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with the school system. When Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain passed his ordinance in 1892, he 
     <lb/>
     was not at all certain, (and other members 
     <lb/>
     of the legislature shared his uncertainty) 
     <lb/>
     that the passage of the ordinance did not ex<lb break="no"/>ceed his powers. However, the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the law of 1892 has since remained in force 
     <lb/>
  

            <pb n="3831" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-04_Page_3831.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>   
        

     is some evidence that it was not passed in 
     <lb/>
     excess of the powers conferred on the legis<lb break="no"/>lature. At all events the school law of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories as it exists today is absolutely 
     <lb/>
     a school law that has been given to the 
     <lb/>
     people by their own representatives in their 
     <lb/>
     own legislature. It has been absolutely sat<lb break="no"/>isfactory, and if the people of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     especially the people of Ontario, knew just 
     <lb/>
     exactly what that school system is, there 
     <lb/>
     would be no complaint against it. I ask 
     <lb/>
     the people of Ontario to leave it to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest, and if the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest, through their local legis<lb break="no"/>lature and through their members in this 
     <lb/>
     parliament are satisfied with the existing 
     <lb/>
     conditions—and I think these conditions 
     <lb/>
     are about as nearly right as you can pos<lb break="no"/>sibly get them—then, what necessity is there  
     <lb/>
     for the people of Ontario agitating the ques<lb break="no"/>tion ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have heard a good deal about edu<lb break="no"/>cation in the province of Quebec. I was 
     <lb/>
     born and brought up and lived in that pro<lb break="no"/>vince until I reached the age of manhood. 
     <lb/>
     What education I received in school I re<lb break="no"/>ceived at a public school in a small Scottish 
     <lb/>
     settlement surrounded by French Canadians 
     <lb/>
     and Roman Catholics for a hundred miles 
     <lb/>
     east and west. To that school down there 
     <lb/>
     we paid our own taxes, we paid not one 
     <lb/>
     cent of taxes to any other school, and the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic majority left us absolutely 
     <lb/>
     free to do just as we liked. I don't forget 
     <lb/>
     that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. You had autonomy ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. Yes, the Protestant mi<lb break="no"/>nority had full autonomy there. There was 
     <lb/>
     the greatest tolerance towards us ; intoler<lb break="no"/>ance I never saw in any shape or form in 
     <lb/>
     that province. Would it not be very small 
     <lb/>
     on the part of us Protestants because we 
     <lb/>
     are in the majority in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, that we should not give some free<lb break="no"/>dom to the Roman Catholic minority. The 
     <lb/>
     member for west Assiniboia has pointed out 
     <lb/>
     that when the Act of 1875 was passed in this 
     <lb/>
     parliament its intention was as much to pro<lb break="no"/>tect Protestants as to protect Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lics, because at that date nobody knew 
     <lb/>
     whether the majority in the Northwest was 
     <lb/>
     going to be Protestant or going to be Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic. And, because the Protestants now 
     <lb/>
     happen to be in the majority, are we going 
     <lb/>
     to deprive the Roman Catholic minority of 
     <lb/>
     the protection which the federal parliament 
     <lb/>
     in its wisdom gave to the minority ? Al<lb break="no"/>though the Act of 1875 was passed by a 
     <lb/>
     Liberal government it was assented to un<lb break="no"/>animously by every member of the Conser<lb break="no"/>vative party then in opposition. I am not 
     <lb/>
     well versed in constitutional law, but there 
     <lb/>
     is this that cannot be denied : that from 
     <lb/>
    1875 to the present day the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>minority have had the right to have separate 
     <lb/>schools in the Territories. I believe that their 
     <lb/>rights were diminished by the ordinance of 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3832</fw>
    

     1892, but at all events the minority have had 
     <lb/>
     the right to separate schools from 1875 to 
     <lb/>
    the present time. Would it be fair or would 
     <lb/>it be reasonable on our part ; when we have 
     <lb/>made these schools practically public schools, 
     <lb/>when we have eliminated all clerical and 
     <lb/>church control, when we have made these 
     <lb/>schools in every respect equal to the public 
     <lb/>schools, when we know that there our 
     <lb/>Roman Catholic children will get the same 
     <lb/>sound education they get in the public 
     <lb/>schools ; would it be fair, would it be gener<lb break="no"/>ous to wipe out,—as the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Jacques Cartier has said–the last shred of 
     <lb/>the rights of the minority conferred upon 
     <lb/>them in 1875 ? I claim that it would be 
     <lb/>neither just nor fair, and in saying this I 
     <lb/>am voicing the sentiments of my constituents 
     <lb/>with possibly the exception of an odd man 
     <lb/>here and there, and that only because during 
     <lb/>the last month or so efforts have been made 
     <lb/>to make the people believe that we are now 
     <lb/>fastening a system of separate schools on 
     <lb/>them. If I understand the matter aright, 
     <lb/>what we are doing is fastening a system of 
     <lb/>public schools on the Territories, and we are 
     <lb/>making it clear that if the Conservatives 
     <lb/>come into power ten or fifteen years from 
     <lb/>now, they will not be able to do to the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories what they tried to do to the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>Victoria (Mr. Sam. Hughes) said that the 
     <lb/>class of immigrants coming into this country 
     <lb/>were chiefly noted for ignorance, dirt and 
     <lb/>filth, I have had something to do with the 
     <lb/>immigrants coming into Canada for the past 
     <lb/>few years, and I know whereof I speak. I 
     <lb/>presume the hon. gentleman did not refer 
     <lb/>to the immigrants from the British Isles or 
     <lb/>from the United States, but I can say— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The hon. member (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Turriff) is doing the member for Victoria an 
     <lb/>
     injustice. The member for Victoria (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sam. Hughes) referred to the immigration 
     <lb/>
     coming to the United States for years and 
     <lb/>
     years, and he pointed out what the system 
     <lb/>
     of schools in that country had accomplished 
     <lb/>
     in the fusion of the races. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. I would be the last man 
     <lb/>
     in the House to misrepresent a member, and 
     <lb/>
     especially in his absence. As I could not 
     <lb/>
     hear the hon. gentleman very well from the 
     <lb/>
     seat which I occupied, possibly I may have 
     <lb/>
     misunderstood him, so that I shall not speak 
     <lb/>
     further on that point. Now, Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     have taken up more time than I intended, 
     <lb/>
     but in conclusion I wish to say that I would 
     <lb/>
     ask hon. gentlemen opposite not to push this 
     <lb/>
     agitation further. If hon. gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site think that we Liberal members from the 
     <lb/>
     west do not represent the sentiment of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories though 
     <lb/>
     I claim that we do, I make this proposition 
     <lb/>
     to them. The Hon. Mr. Haultain is working 
     <lb/>
     in unison with them, is trying to help them 
     <lb/>
     out in every way, is doing his utmost to 
     <lb/>
     make this a party question in the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
     Let them get Mr. Haultain to call his legis<lb break="no"/>

     lature together and test the feeling of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories on this 
     <lb/>
     question. If he calls the legislature to<lb break="no"/>gether, either as it stands at present, or with 
     <lb/>
     the vacant seats filled, I venture to say that 
     <lb/>
     he will not have a majority when he tries 
     <lb/>
     to make a party question out of this matter.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Could not the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen's friends make a better test than 
     <lb/>
     that by appointing a Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior and sending him back for re-election ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. The hon. the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister said the other day in my hearing that 
     <lb/>he would appoint a Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>within three months ; and when that time  
     <lb/>comes, if he chooses one of the members 
     <lb/>from the Northwest Territories and he goes 
     <lb/>back for re-election, I promise you that, 
     <lb/>whoever he may be, he will come back here 
     <lb/>with a larger majority than he had on the 
     <lb/>3rd of November last.

            </p>
   
            <p>

     until that election takes place, and see what

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. Do not be a bit alarmed

     Trunk Pacific. We were told in my consti<lb break="no"/>tuency that we were not going to be able 
     <lb/>
     to save our deposit ; but what was the re<lb break="no"/>sult ? Seven of the Liberal members on this

     side of the House from the Northwest have 
     <lb/>
     each an average majority of over 1,200

     In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I would ask 
     <lb/>
     our hon. friends on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House to drop this agitation. Come down 
     <lb/>
     to common sense, and let us deal with the

     Bill that is now before parliament.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Would it not be well

     to give that advice to the Toronto ' Globe ' ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. Let us get on with the 
     <lb/>
     work of the country. Let us start these

     new provinces without hampering them 
     <lb/>
     with an agitation such as hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite are trying to work up. Instead of 
     <lb/>
     that, let us leave them to devote their time 
     <lb/>
     and energies to developing the great natural 
     <lb/>
     resources that Providence has blessed them 
     <lb/>
     with, and in a short time you will see them

     <lb/>
     a remark. Although we have had numerous 
     <lb/>
     speeches on this question, I am advised that 
     <lb/>
     there are still more numerous speeches to 
     <lb/>
     follow, a very large number of members

     desiring to address the House. If that be 
     <lb/>
      the fact, we are likely to have a protracted 
     <lb/>
      debate even under the best conditions, and I 
     <lb/>
     'think it will be necessary for us to work a 
     <lb/>
     little harder and sit a little later. There<lb break="no"/>fore, I hope that if a motion like this is 
     <lb/>
     hereafter made at this early hour, it may 
     <lb/>
      not be pressed, but we may sit a little later 
     <lb/>
     and get the debate finished.
