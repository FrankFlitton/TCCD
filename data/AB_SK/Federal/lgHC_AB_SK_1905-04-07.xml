            <p>He said: The committee has thought it 
     <lb/>desirable that a good deal of the evidence 
     <lb/>given before it, and which is of a most im<lb break="no"/>portant character, should be printed as soon 
     <lb/>as possible and distributed in the agricul<lb break="no"/>tural districts. The report recommends that 
     <lb/>20,000 copies of the evidence of J. A. Rud<lb break="no"/>dick, Dairy Commissioner, be printed in 
     <lb/>pamphlet form, 16,900 copies to be distri<lb break="no"/>buted to members of parliament. 3,000 
     <lb/>copies to the Department of Agriculture for 
     <lb/>distribution, and 50 copies for the use of the 
     <lb/>committee. It also recommends that 20,000 
     <lb/>copies of the evidence of Dr. William Saun<lb break="no"/>ders, Director of the Dominion Experimental 
     <lb/>Farm, be printed : that 20,000 copies of the 
     <lb/>evidence of each member of the official 
     <lb/>staff at the central experimental farm be 
     <lb/>printed, 19,400 copies of which shall go to 
     <lb/>members of parliament for distribution, 550 
     <lb/>copies to each of the officials and 50 copies 
     <lb/>for the use of the committee, the proportion 
     <lb/>of French and English copies to be as usual. 
     <lb/>This was the unanimous report of the com<lb break="no"/>mittee, in which I agree, and I trust the 
     <lb/>House will adopt the report.

            <p><persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. D. HENDERSON</persName>. I do not rise to

     <lb/>given before the Committee on Agriculture 
     <lb/>should have as Wide distribution as possible 
     <lb/>throughout the country. However, I find 
     <lb/>that instead of having this evidence prompt<lb break="no"/>ly printed and distributed, the greater part 
     <lb/>of the reports of last year's committee are 
     <lb/>
 

<cb/>

still lying within the precincts or this House. 
     <lb/>An effort should be made to have these re<lb break="no"/>ports distributed more expeditiously, for 
     <lb/>if they are not put in the hands of mem<lb break="no"/>bers before the end of the session the facili<lb break="no"/>ties for distributing them will not be so

     <lb/>those in authority to have the reports print<lb break="no"/>ed as soon as possible and given to the

            <p>Mr. Rogers says that the ablegate made this

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>This invitation was accepted and His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency then presented the following memo<lb break="no"/>randum, remarking that if we would place this 
     <lb/>on the statute-book of our province it would 
     <lb/>greatly facilitate an early settlement of our 
     <lb/>mission, the fixing of our boundaries, which 
     <lb/>would be extended to the shores of Hudson 
     <lb/>bay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>As to that, I have no reason to make any

            <p>His Excellency further added that our failure

            </p>
            <p>Well, Sir. I cannot conceive how the Papal 
     <lb/>ablegate, or anybody else, could have stated 
     <lb/>that the failure of the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>to amend the School Act prevented the ex— 
     <lb/>tension ot its boundaries westward, and that 
     <lb/>if such had been done it would have facilitated 
     <lb/>this extension. I cannot conceive how it is 
     <lb/>possible that such a. statement could have 
     <lb/>been made, considering the fact that since 
     <lb/>the month of July, 1896, when we came into 
     <lb/>office, up to the month of January, 1905, we 
     <lb/>never received from the government of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba a communication asking for the extension 
     <lb/>of the boundaries of that province. There 
     <lb/>may have been resolutions passed by the legis<lb break="no"/>lature, asking for the extension, of their bound<lb break="no"/>aries; I do not know. I am told there have

     The right hon. gentleman conveyed the 
     <lb/>
     impression that there had been no applica<lb break="no"/>tion made on behalf of the legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba to this government for an exten<lb break="no"/>sion of the boundaries of that province, and 
     <lb/>
     that the only information he had gleaned in 
     <lb/>
     reference to the resolutions passed by the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of Manitoba was gleaned from 
     <lb/>
     the public press, or that he was told that 
     <lb/>
     such resolutions had been passed. He fol<lb break="no"/>lowed that up in yesterday's speech, in re<lb break="no"/>ferring to the interview which was said to 
     <lb/>
     have taken place with Monseigneur Sbar<lb break="no"/>retti, by saying:

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     In that interview Monseigneur Sbarretti was

     matters if these gentlemen would consent to 
     <lb/>
     the restoration of separate schools in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, and that if that had been done before it

     would have facilitated the extension of their

     I may say that Mr. Rogers did not meet

     It will be seen that the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man tried to cast an aspersion upon the ac<lb break="no"/>curacy of the statement of Mr. Rogers in 
     <lb/>
     reference to the extension of the boundaries 
     <lb/>
     stating that no application had been made 
     <lb/>
     to this government from 1896 up to January, 
     <lb/>
     1905. When the right hon. gentleman made 
     <lb/>
     that remark, I had some faint recollection 
     <lb/>
     of having myself presented some petition 
     <lb/>
     or memorial on behalf of the legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba to this House, and I took the trou<lb break="no"/>ble of looking up the journals of the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons. I find in volume xxxvi., of 
     <lb/>
     the Journals for 1901, under date of Friday, 
     <lb/>
     26th April, 1901, at page 223, the following:

     I desire to draw this to the attention of

     prided himself on having; and, in view of 
     <lb/>
     what I have stated, he would probably

     after the statement of my hon. friend. I

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. It appears 
     <lb/>
     that my hon. friend laid that memorial on

     <lb/>
     many memorials and petitions are brought

     here and very little attention is paid to

     them. When I read the statement of Mr.

     this government by the government of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. I inquired of my colleagues, and they

     were of the same opinion as myself. To

     make sure, I asked the clerk of the Privy

     Council if any petition had been received 
     <lb/>
     from the government of Manitoba, and he 
     <lb/>
     gave me this memorandum:

     From June, 1896, to January, 1905, there is 
     <lb/>
     no record in the Privy Council office of a claim 
     <lb/>
     advanced by the province of Manitoba for the 
     <lb/>
     extension of its boundaries. In May, 1902, there 
     <lb/>
     was a protest from the Northwest Territories

     What my hon. friend shows to-day is that 
     <lb/>
     a petition was passed by the legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and was presented at this table 
     <lb/>
     by my hon. friend. But I have no recollec<lb break="no"/>tion of it, and I cannot bring it down, 
     <lb/>
     because it is not in the archives of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, but is already in the archives of 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons. Therefore, my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend will see that after all I was 
     <lb/>
     not inaccurate.

     perhaps, but I would be inclined to think 
     <lb/>
     that the right hon. gentleman is rather in<lb break="no"/>accurate. It is quite true, as he says, that 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions of the Manitoba legislature 
     <lb/>
     were not followed by executive action in 
     <lb/>
     one sense; but he said something else.

<p>
     When a petition of the legislature of a 
     <lb/>
     province is laid on the table of the House 
     <lb/>
     by a member of this House, I would think 
     <lb/>
     that was a very distinct calling of the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the government to that peti<lb break="no"/>tion. The right hon. gentleman is leader 
     <lb/>
     of the government, but he is also leader of 
     <lb/>
     this House. We always refer to him in 
     <lb/>
     that way ; and when a petition for aid 
     <lb/>
     or a petition for extension of boundaries 
     <lb/>
     is laid upon the table of the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons, I would very respectfully submit that 
     <lb/>
     it is called to the attention of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment just as effectively as if a copy were 
     <lb/>
     sent to the government direct. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know of what use it would otherwise be to 
     <lb/>
     present such a petition to parliament. All 
     <lb/>
     of us know that legislation of that kind 
     <lb/>
     could only be initiated by the government, 
     <lb/>
     and it is idle to present any such peti<lb break="no"/>tion to parliament unless it is intended by 
     <lb/>
     so doing to bring it to the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the government in order that they may 
     <lb/>
     initiate the legislation necessary to carry 
     <lb/>
     out the request. I think my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, on looking carefully over that por<lb break="no"/>tion of his remarks to which attention has 
     <lb/>
     been called, will see that the impression it 
     <lb/>
     left upon our minds, certainly the impression 
     <lb/>
     left upon my own mind, was that he had 
     <lb/>
     no knowledge whatever of the resolutions of 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba legislature except what he had 
     <lb/>
     derived from the public press of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. I have no doubt that the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman made that statement in the most 
     <lb/>
     perfect good faith, but at the same time 
     <lb/>
     it was hardly accurate under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. If I may be 
     <lb/>
     permitted, Mr. Speaker, to reply to my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend, I must say that when I spoke 
     <lb/>
     I had no knowledge of those resolutions 
     <lb/>
     except what I had derived from the press 
     <lb/>
     of the country. It turns out now that a 
     <lb/>
     petition was laid on the table of this 
     <lb/>
     House. I have no recollection of that and 
     <lb/>
     I doubt if any one else has any recollection 
     <lb/>
     of it or took much interest in it ; because 
     <lb/>
     dozens of petitions are presented to the 
     <lb/>
     House to which very little attention is paid, 
     <lb/>
     and unless my attention were specially 
     <lb/>
     called to it, I would probably know nothing 
     <lb/>
     about it. But the executive government 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba never took any action on this 
     <lb/>
     matter until the month of January, 1905.

     Mr. Speaker, in resuming this debate I 
     <lb/>
     wish to say that the tenor of my remarks 
     <lb/>
     has been somewhat altered from what it 
     <lb/>
     would otherwise have been owing to cer<lb break="no"/>tain remarks which were made yesterday 
     <lb/>
     and also to certain remarks that have fallen

     from the lips of the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion (Mr. R. L. Borden) and the member 
     <lb/>
     for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron) during this 
     <lb/>
     debate. It I understood the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition aright he stated that the late 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Dalton 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy) had been 'established' in the 
     <lb/>

     I had thought that such statements as 
     <lb/>
     those were things of the past and would 
     <lb/>
     not be repeated. I had thought that the 
     <lb/>
     action of this country in 1896 had well 
     <lb/>
     answered these questions, but apparently 
     <lb/>
     they live to be repeated by hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen in this House, and just so long as I 
     <lb/>
     have the honour of having a seat in the 
     <lb/>
     House I shall be prepared on every <choice><sic>occa<lb break="no"/>ison</sic><corr>occasion</corr></choice> to refute such charges. So far as my 
     <lb/>
     own position is concerned I feel that no 
     <lb/>
     remarks which I make to-day will lead any 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman to place the charge at my 
     <lb/>
     door that I am seeking political preferment 
     <lb/>
     from the leader of either political party, 
     <lb/>
     because, Sir, I am forced to the conclusion— 
     <lb/>
     and I speak most diffidently and respect<lb break="no"/>fully, because I recognize tile posi<lb break="no"/>tion of these two hon. gentlemen in the 
     <lb/>
     country—but I am forced to differ from 
     <lb/>
     them both in the conclusion to which I 
     <lb/>
     have come. The reason why I differ from 
     <lb/>
     them both is that I make bold to say that 
     <lb/>
     the policy of the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. R. L. Borden) if carried to its ultimate 
     <lb/>
     conclusion will be found to be practically 
     <lb/>
     in accord with the policy of the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the government. It is perhaps difficult at 
     <lb/>
     present to realize that, but I hope before I 
     <lb/>
     conclude to be able to demonstrate it. I 
     <lb/>
     do hope, and I say it with all sincerity, 
     <lb/>
     that no remarks which I make on this 
     <lb/>
     occasion will have the effect of inflaming 
     <lb/>
     an already too much inflamed country upon 
     <lb/>
     this question which can surely be discussed 
     <lb/>
     without a display of passion, and without a 
     <lb/>
     raising of sectarian cries. It ought to be, 
     <lb/>
     in my humble judgment, a question of 
     <lb/>
     policy ; policies should be enunciated by 
     <lb/>
     the two parties in this House, but appar<lb break="no"/>ently it is being dealt with in quite a 
     <lb/>
     different way. Charges are thrown across 
     <lb/>
     the House of inflaming public opinion and 
     <lb/>
     raising cries of race and religion. It is 
     <lb/>
     impossible to prevent that so long as hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen behave as they are doing and 
     <lb/>
     as they have done in the past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     By reason of the remarks to which I have 
     <lb/>
     referred, it becomes necessary—at least I 
     <lb/>
     deem it necessary and incumbent upon me 
     <lb/>
     in the discharge of my duty—to review 
     <lb/>
     briefly the past history of the political 
     <lb/>
     parties on this and similar questions. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place we have the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act passed by the Imperial House 
     <lb/>
     in 1867. Although that Act has been quoted 
     <lb/>
     many times I am going to again read section 
     <lb/>93 :—<lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     The enactment of that provision was pre<lb break="no"/>ceded by what is alleged to be a compact 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>


     founded upon resolutions passed at con<lb break="no"/>ferences which took place at Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere. It was passed by the assent

     and with the consent of all parties, of all 
     <lb/>
     creeds and of all nationalities in the country 
     <lb/>
     at that time. The compact has been re<lb break="no"/>ferred to very many times in this debate. 
     <lb/>
     It also was referred to very many times 
     <lb/>
     during the discussion on the Manitoba

     school question. In order that the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman may see how difficult it is to 
     <lb/>
     rely upon the construction of such a con<lb break="no"/>tract, and in order to show the elasticity of 
     <lb/>
     that compact I desire to quote the words 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Foster) when speaking as Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance in 1896 in regard to that contract and

     again when speaking in 1905.

     <lb/>
     effect: Yes, we will do that but we will simply 
     <lb/>
     put this rider on it, save and except as to the 
     <lb/>
     interests of the two Canadas. That is all 
     <lb/>
     that was done at Quebec. That is all to the 
     <lb/>
     very letter, and that was passed by the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of Upper and Lower Canada. There were 
     <lb/>
     present representatives from the maritime 
     <lb/>
     provinces and also the representatives from 
     <lb/>
     these two provinces of Upper and Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada. That was their compact, and that 
     <lb/>
     was all of it. But that gave no right for any<lb break="no"/>body to say that because they saved by that 
     <lb/>
     compact the rights of the minorities in those

     two provinces, when forty or fifty years later 
     <lb/>
     you make provinces out of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, you are, on account of that com<lb break="no"/>pact, to establish separate schools for the 
     <lb/>
     minorities in those provinces.

     Now, hon. gentlemen will see how elastic 
     <lb/>
     a compact this is when it can be construed 
     <lb/>
     in 1896 to apply to all the provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     can be construed by the same hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man in 1905 to apply to only two of them. 
     <lb/>
     It is quite evident that what occurred in 
     <lb/>
     1867—and there is no dispute about it— 
     <lb/>
     was a compromise. This compact was made 
     <lb/>
     applicable, it is alleged by some, to only 
     <lb/>
     two provinces, and applicable, as alleged 
     <lb/>
     by others, to all the provinces. The lan<lb break="no"/>guage of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     I would submit, clearly applies to all 
     <lb/>
     those entering the union. So, there was 
     <lb/>
     no difference between the parties at that 
     <lb/>
     time, nor any difference between the creeds. 
     <lb/>
     In 1870, Sir John Macdonald and his gov<lb break="no"/>ernment created the province of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     There is no doubt that at that time, the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman sought to place upon that 
     <lb/>
     province the separate school and the dual 
     <lb/>
     language system. That was acquiesced 
     <lb/>
     in by the Liberals. In 1875, a Liberal 
     <lb/>
     administration was in power. They in<lb break="no"/>troduced a Bill for the better govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the Northwest Territories, pro<lb break="no"/>viding—not as originally brought down, 
     <lb/>
     but as subsequently amended in committee 
     <lb/>
     —for separate schools under what is now 
     <lb/>
     clause 14 of that Act, and likewise providing 
     <lb/>
     for the dual language system. I desire to 
     <lb/>
     read clause 14, because I shall have to refer 
     <lb/>
     to it later on:

     upon the Lieutenant Governor by this section

     is hereby declared to have been vested in him

     from the seventh day of May, 1888. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That clause, was acquiesced in by 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party. The only objection 
     <lb/>
     raised to it at all was in the Senate, 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. George Brown, who warned 
     <lb/>
     this country and warned this parliament 
     <lb/>
     that if this legislation was enacted it 
     <lb/>
     would give foundation for a claim such as 
     <lb/>
     that which is now being urged. So, at this 
     <lb/>
     time we have both political parties practi<lb break="no"/>cally at agreement on this subject. In 1880, 
     <lb/>
     this parliament again dealt with the North<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>

west Territories in a point directing to an<lb break="no"/>other branch of my argument. In that year 
     <lb/>
     a portion of the district of Keewatin was 
     <lb/>
     added to the province of Manitoba. And 
     <lb/>
     parliament added that territory to Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     without any restriction ; it took away what<lb break="no"/>ever rights Keewatin had and placed the 
     <lb/>
     territory on the same basis as the rest of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. So, that portion added to Mani<lb break="no"/>toba in 1880 was made subject to the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba charter, and released entirely by this 
     <lb/>
     parliament from any laws, rights or privi<lb break="no"/>leges which it had up to 1880. The point 
     <lb/>
     I make is that we have on this occasion 
     <lb/>
     equal freedom to deal with these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and to give them a charter such as 
     <lb/>
     we deem in their best interest. In 1889 
     <lb/>
     or 1890 this question was mooted in 
     <lb/>
     this country. Notwithstanding the dis<lb break="no"/>paragaing remarks made by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Simcoe (Mr. Bennett) 
     <lb/>
     to the effect that I showed too much 
     <lb/>
     pride in my ancestors and in my 
     <lb/>
     family, I can only say that if I did so it is 
     <lb/>
     because I cannot help it. And I am not 
     <lb/>
     ashamed of it, but proud of it, and care 
     <lb/>
     not who knows it. In 1889, Mr. Dalton Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy pointed out to this House certain 
     <lb/>
     things ; he pointed out to this country cer<lb break="no"/>tain things. He said in that year that the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools system of Manitoba was 
     <lb/>
     not a wise system; he said that the dual 
     <lb/>
     language system imposed upon Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     was not a wise system. He said also that 
     <lb/>
     the dual language and the separate school 
     <lb/>
     systems of the Northwest Territories were 
     <lb/>
     not wise. Hon. gentlemen who were in the 
     <lb/>
     House at that time will remember the 
     <lb/>
     motions made and the discussions that took 
     <lb/>
     place. It was only after many defeats, 
     <lb/>
     many rebuffs, that the first sign of success 
     <lb/>
     on his part was seen. Sir John Thompson 
     <lb/>
     agreed to the passing of a motion which re<lb break="no"/>legated to the Territorial government of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories the right to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the language question. It is worthy of note 
     <lb/>
     that at that time Sir John Thompson made 
     <lb/>
     a clear distinction between the language 
     <lb/>
     question and the school question. He gave 
     <lb/>
     in on the language question, but on the 
     <lb/>
     school question he refused to give in, as 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen who were here at the time 
     <lb/>
     will remember. This happened in the ses<lb break="no"/>sion of 1892. Both parties acquiesced in 
     <lb/>
     that, I believe, though there may have been 
     <lb/>
     some dissentient voices—I am not sure about 
     <lb/>
     that. But, in the December following, Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Thompson being then premier, saw 
     <lb/>
     fit to read out of the Conservative party 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Dalton McCarthy because that gentle<lb break="no"/>man dared to give utterance to views which 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman opposite are expressing to<lb break="no"/>day. There were only two questions on 
     <lb/>
     which he was giving expression to opinions 
     <lb/>
     not acceptable to the government of that 
     <lb/>
     day, and they were the separate school ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Manitoba and the separate school 
     <lb/>
     question of the Northwest Territories. As 
     <lb/>
     a matter of fact, the language question had 
     <lb/>

     been settled so far as Mr. Dalton McCarthy 
     <lb/>
     was concerned, having been relegated to the 
     <lb/>
     Territorial goverment to deal with as they 
     <lb/>
     saw fit. Mr. Dalton McCarthy did not seek 
     <lb/>
     to raise the race or religious cry, but simply 
     <lb/>
     said : Let us hand over this matter to the 
     <lb/>
     local authorities to deal with exclusively, 
     <lb/>
     and you will have peace and harmony ; you 
     <lb/>
     will not have constant friction arising in this 
     <lb/>
     House and in the country. However, Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Thompson would not acquiesce in the 
     <lb/>
     demands made to relegate either to the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba or to the government of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories the right to deal with their 
     <lb/>
     educational questions. Therefore. in 1894, 
     <lb/>
     a Bill was introduced in this House by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Dalton McCarthy to repeal the separate 
     <lb/>
     school clauses of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     Act, section 14 being the section I have quot<lb break="no"/>ed. Quite a long debate took place on that 
     <lb/>
     motion ; and according to my way of think<lb break="no"/>ing that debate is the pivot upon which the 
     <lb/>
     discussion of this question almost wholly 
     <lb/>
     turns. That debate was so important, it 
     <lb/>
     had so much to do with the question now 
     <lb/>
     before us, that I am amazed that hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite have not devoted more 
     <lb/>
     time and attention to it, because their leader 
     <lb/>
     at that time made the situation clear and 
     <lb/>
     plain. In that year, Sir John Thompson 
     <lb/>
     speaking in answer to Mr. Dalton Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy, said, as will be found at page 6127 
     <lb/>
     of 'Hansard' of that year :

            </p>
   
    
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     One other important characteristic was to be 
     <lb/>
     considered in regard to the Territories while 
     <lb/>
     they were to remain in the Territorial condi<lb break="no"/>tion, and that was in view of the peculiar cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances of the Territories, the fact that we 
     <lb/>
     were inviting all races, creeds and denomina<lb break="no"/>tions, there was to be the widest toleration 
     <lb/>
     while the Territories existed. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     That was the corner stone of the whole ; the 
     <lb/>
     corner stone which the hon. member for Sim<lb break="no"/>coe (Mr. McCarthy) proposes to remove, on the 
     <lb/>
     ground that there can be no good reason given 
     <lb/>
     for its existence. As the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition has said to-night, no man knew 
     <lb/>
     better than those who were engaged in framing 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1875, the difficulties which sectarian 
     <lb/>
     disputes might create in that new country. No 
     <lb/>
     one realized better the fact, that in so far as 
     <lb/>
     the population was to be gathered into the 
     <lb/>
     Territories from the older provinces, it was to 
     <lb/>
     be gathered from different races, and from 
     <lb/>
     amongst men who had strong lines of difference 
     <lb/>
     as regards religious belief. While the popula<lb break="no"/>tion should be going in there, and while the 
     <lb/>
     Territories should remain under our control 
     <lb/>
     at least, there was to be the broadest tolera<lb break="no"/>tion for every belief, and for the races, as re<lb break="no"/>gards worship, and as regards language, and as 
     <lb/>
     regards instruction in the schools.

     We claim therefore that the constitutional

    schools and with regard to language in 1875 
     <lb/>ought to be maintained for the same reasons

     in 1905. Mr. McCarthy said that Sir John

     <lb/>it is not a declaration. Let the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion take its course; that is not a declara<lb break="no"/>tion that the constitution applies automati<lb break="no"/>cally. It is a declaration to this parliament, 
     <lb/>and to those men who were endeavouring 
     <lb/>to get rid of that clause to prevent any 
     <lb/>such argument being used as is now used. 
     <lb/>Keep quiet, be still, because when the time 
     <lb/>comes—as if has come now—you will be 
     <lb/>free to act as you see fit. Mr. McCarthy 
     <lb/>replied to him in these words:

            <p>I am very glad that the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>has explained it in that way, and perhaps I 
     <lb/>was wrong in my understanding or his remarks. 
     <lb/>Of course it is an important declaration from 
     <lb/>the First Minister. Now, the House will have 
     <lb/>to use its own judgment on this question. What 
     <lb/>I say is this : that it this question of separate 
     <lb/>schools is to remain in its present position 
     <lb/>until we grant provincial autonomy to any por<lb break="no"/>tion of the Northwest. it will be practically 
     <lb/>impossible, unless there is an enormous change 
     <lb/>in public opinion, to deny them what every 
     <lb/>other province that has joined the confedera<lb break="no"/>tion has been entitled to, what Manitoba was 
     <lb/>entitled to, and what I submit under the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances every province would be entitled to. 
     <lb/>Now, let me draw attention to the constitution 
     <lb/>conferred upon Manitoba in that regard. I 
     <lb/>have not got it under my hand, but it will be 
     <lb/>found on consulting it that when we conferred 
     <lb/>autonomy upon the province of Manitoba we 
     <lb/>did it by reference to the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca. Act. What we declared was, that where 
     <lb/>not otherwise provided for in the Act, all the 
     <lb/>provisions of the British North America Act 
     <lb/>should apply to the province of Manitoba, and 
     <lb/>I think the very same words were contained 
     <lb/>in the resolutions which were passed at the 
     <lb/>time British Columbia and the province of 
     <lb/>Prince Edward Island came into the union. So 
     <lb/>that we have got that precedent before us; 
     <lb/>that was the promise upon which we admitted 
     <lb/>Manitoba, and looking at the character or the 
     <lb/>legislation, I do not think there can be any 
     <lb/>doubt that the same rule must apply when we 
     <lb/>admit the provinces to be created out of the 
     <lb/>Northwest Territories.

            <p>Now, Sir, what happened? There are 
     <lb/>many hon. gentlemen sitting opposite who 
     <lb/>were present on that occasion. The hon. 
     <lb/>member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule), I 
     <lb/>think, is the only gentleman in this House 
     <lb/>on that side who is consistent to-day. He 
     <lb/>said: You should not give them a chance, 
     <lb/>or let them have an argument that they 
     <lb/>can use for fastening separate schools on 
     <lb/>the new provinces under the constitution. 
     <lb/>But of course he might have justified himself 
     <lb/>in voting with the then premier by saying: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     When the time comes we will be free—as 
     <lb/>
     the then premier said. But they were 
     <lb/>
     warned that when this time did come that 
     <lb/>
     would happen which is happening to-day. 
     <lb/>
     Again, what happened? The vote was 
     <lb/>
     taken, and 114 members to 21 maintained 
     <lb/>
     that clause on the statute-book, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the warnings which were then 
     <lb/>
     given, and we are now face to face with 
     <lb/>
     the position that was then foreseen. Now, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, up to that point which brings us to 
     <lb/>
     1894, there cannot be any cavilling, there 
     <lb/>
     cannot be any quibbling over the statement 
     <lb/>
     that from the standpoint of policy both 
     <lb/>
     political parties were of the same mind. 
     <lb/>
     There were independent men who broke 
     <lb/>
     away from party lines on that question 
     <lb/>
     and who chose to think for themselves as 
     <lb/>
     I do. First, there was George Brown. Then 
     <lb/>
     later there were my revered uncle, Dalton 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy, the member for East Grey (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule), Col. O'Brien, the Hon. Clarke Wal<lb break="no"/>lace, Clifford Sifton, Joseph Martin, John 
     <lb/>
     Charlton, and several others—there are men 
     <lb/>
     who have always spoken their minds freely 
     <lb/>
     and from conviction. Then we come to 1895, 
     <lb/>
     when the agitation began with reference to 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba schools. We then had, as you 
     <lb/>
     will remember, a fight in Haldimand. The 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. Montague sought re-election after 
     <lb/>
     the remedial order was passed; we faced 
     <lb/>
     him in Haldimand and we were defeated. 
     <lb/>
     We fought the question over again in Card<lb break="no"/>well and we won. As to what took place 
     <lb/>
     in Cardwell, I will have more to say, be<lb break="no"/>cause upon that occasion a gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     has grown very eloquent in this House, 
     <lb/>
     spent a considerable time in that riding. A 
     <lb/>
     platform, upon which Mr. Stubbs, the Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy candidate was elected, was formu<lb break="no"/>lated, and the third plank in that platform 
     <lb/>
     was as follows:

     opposed us when we were asking Cardwell 
     <lb/>
     to endorse that plank in the platform which 
     <lb/>
     I have read. Then follows the meeting of

     what occurred then when that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man and some of his followers bolted in and

     out of the government. Suffice it to know

     that we have heard in another chamber the

     1895, and when I have had to read, as I 
     <lb/>
     have read and reread, the bitter, venomous

     <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. L. G. McCARTHY</persName>. Well, we won on 
     <lb/>
     two occasions; not a bad record. Then 
     <lb/>
     parliament met. Sir Charles Tupper was 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister; he formed his cabinet 
     <lb/>
     and attempted to push the Coercion Bill 
     <lb/>
    through, and from that time on a great 
     <lb/>many speeches were made in the House. 
     <lb/>The position of the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>Toronto was well defined. That brings us 
     <lb/>down to 1896. The government went to the 
     <lb/>country, and the country refused to endorse 
     <lb/>the coercion policy. In that election we 
     <lb/>certainly were, in the province of Ontario, 
     <lb/>denouncing the government because of its 
     <lb/>coercion policy. The Liberals, on the other 
     <lb/>hand, were saying: Return us to power, 
     <lb/>and by methods of conciliation we will 
     <lb/>settle this question. The Conservatives 
     <lb/>made it clear that they intended, if returned, 
     <lb/>to pass the Remedial Bill. The country re<lb break="no"/>turned the Liberals, and some kind of a 
     <lb/>settlement was made which was placed on 
     <lb/>the statute-book of Manitoba in evidence 
     <lb/>of its being a settlement. To my amaze<lb break="no"/>ment, I heard things yesterday that I had 
     <lb/>never heard before or dreamed of. It ap<lb break="no"/>pears that there are some difficulties and 
     <lb/>disputes yet in regard to this question. 
     <lb/>There seem to be difficulties among 
     <lb/>the members of the church in the province 
     <lb/>of Quebec which I never knew of until 
     <lb/>yesterday. But I do not think that any hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman will seriously say that the school 
     <lb/>question has formed a controversial question 
     <lb/>in politics from 1897 down to 1905. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On the 21st February last the Bill which 
     <lb/>is now before the House was introduced. 
     <lb/>It contained clause 16. It contained a clause 
     <lb/>which did effectually fasten upon the new 
     <lb/>provinces, in my opinion, separate schools. 
     <lb/>The right hon. leader of the government (Sir 
     <lb/>Wilfrid Laurier) introduced it in a very elo<lb break="no"/>quent speech. He justified it upon grounds 
     <lb/>that I cannot agree with. He maintained 
     <lb/>that the constitution required him to do it, 
     <lb/>but nevertheless be justified it on grounds 
     <lb/>of policy; he said he was in favour of 
     <lb/>separate schools, that the minority were en<lb break="no"/>titled to them, and it was in the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country that this clause should 
     <lb/>be enacted. He made that very plain. No<lb break="no"/>body can doubt or dispute that. My hon. 
     <lb/>friend the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. 
     <lb/>L. Borden), true to the traditions of his 
     <lb/>party, spoke on that occasion, and I call 
     <lb/>the attention of the House to these words, 
     <lb/>in view of what has been said in respect to 
     <lb/>the immoderate language which it is alleged 
     <lb/>was heard upon that occasion. The hon.

            <p>From my point of view I was very much 
     <lb/>disgusted with that declaration. I was 
     <lb/>here prepared to oppose legislation of this 
     <lb/>kind and I think there were several other 
     <lb/>hon. members—perhaps not very many— 
     <lb/>who were prepared to do the same thing. 
     <lb/>Then the hon. ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>(Mr. Sitton) returned and resigned saying 
     <lb/>that he could not accept the principles of 
     <lb/>clause 16. For one month we were delayed, 
     <lb/>nothing was done and I think it may fairly 
     <lb/>be said that the right hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>government was sparring for wind. Every<lb break="no"/>body was wondering what was going to be 
     <lb/>done by the hon. leader of the opposition. 
     <lb/>Everybody wanted to know what the great 
     <lb/>Conservative party was going to do upon 
     <lb/>this question. We had to wait a month 
     <lb/>during which time there were petitions filed 
     <lb/>and meetings of protest held. There were 
     <lb/>meetings of protest held which hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite did not attend. The hon. 
     <lb/>member for Lennox (Mr. U. Wilson) rather 
     <lb/>jeered and sneered at my daring to attend 
     <lb/>a meeting of protest, but I will cast back 
     <lb/>the sneer and the jeer. I ask : Where were 
     <lb/>the hon. members from Toronto when a 
     <lb/>meeting was held in that constituency to 
     <lb/>protest against the passing of any such 
     <lb/>legislation ? They were not present and 
     <lb/>yet they are influential members of the 
     <lb/>party and men of prominence in the coun<lb break="no"/>try. A Compromise was effected and the 
     <lb/>Bill was brought down for the second read<lb break="no"/>ing on the 22nd March. I am not able my<lb break="no"/>self to accept the compromise. I am not 
     <lb/>able to agree with it. I am going 
     <lb/>to oppose it. But, I do not think 
     <lb/>that the hon. leader of: the opposition 
     <lb/>has spoken as he ought to have spoken 
     <lb/>upon this question. I reiterate and I re<lb break="no"/>peat that when the predecessor of the leader 
     <lb/>of a party, who also occupied the position 
     <lb/>of the leader of the government and of 
     <lb/>attorney general of the Dominion of Canada, 
     <lb/>I refer to Sir John Thompson, makes a de<lb break="no"/>claration that when this important juncture 
     <lb/>arrived we shall be free to act as we see 
     <lb/>fit, that that declaration ought to be binding 
     <lb/>on the party of which he was the leader. 
     <lb/>Now, Sir. what do we find ? That the leader 
     <lb/>of the opposition does not apparently agree 
     <lb/>with me in that opinion, nevertheless I 
     <lb/>do put it forward as my idea of the duty 
     <lb/>of the leader of a great party. The leader

     policy. He said: The constitution applies 
     <lb/>
     automatically ; let the constitution take its 
     <lb/>
     course. Let me ask him if that is in con<lb break="no"/>sonance with the declaration which his

            <p>Sir, as I conceive the responsibility which 
     <lb/>rests upon the leader of the Conservative 
     <lb/>party, owing to the declaration which Sir 
     <lb/>John Thompson made in 1894, the leader 
     <lb/>of the opposition in arguing thus did not 
     <lb/>discharge his duty. And as to this argu<lb break="no"/>ment of the leader of the opposition I dif<lb break="no"/>fer just as strongly with it, as I am 
     <lb/>opposed to the contention of the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister that the constitution required him to 
     <lb/>pass this legislation. I quite conceive that 
     <lb/>the declaration of the Prime Minister was 
     <lb/>based upon, not only the legal obligation, 
     <lb/>but upon the moral obligation as well, yet 
     <lb/>even so I cannot agree with him. I ven<lb break="no"/>ture respectfully to say, that the conclu<lb break="no"/>sion that one must come to is, that if we 
     <lb/>are to dispose of this question properly 
     <lb/>and to accept our responsibilities, in the 
     <lb/>true spirit, there should be a declaration 
     <lb/>from both parties as to their policy on this 
     <lb/>question. There should be a declaration as 
     <lb/>to whether you are prepared to say: As a 
     <lb/>matter of policy, as a matter of fairness, 
     <lb/>as a matter of justice, these provinces 
     <lb/>should be deprived of the exclusive right 
     <lb/>to manage their own educational system, 
     <lb/>or, if you are not prepared to say that or 
     <lb/>to controvert it, then, you are not dis<lb break="no"/>charging the responsibilities which rest 
     <lb/>upon you. It is very easy for the leader 
     <lb/>of the opposition to say : Let the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion take its course. That standard is 
     <lb/>broad enough to cover every member of 
     <lb/>this House. I hope there are none here 
     <lb/>who are not prepared to abide by the law 
     <lb/>and the constitution, but at all events the 
     <lb/>Conservative party in this country cannot 
     <lb/>get united under that banner, and cannot 
     <lb/>subscribe to the device written on it. We 
     <lb/>have heard from three or four of the gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite that they are not prepared 
     <lb/>to come under that standard. The hon. 
     <lb/>member for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron), 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. 
     <lb/>Monk), two of the Conservative leaders 
     <lb/>from the province of Quebec, have told 
     <lb/>us that they are going to support the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on this issue and that they will 
     <lb/>not subscribe to the splendid device: let 
     <lb/>the constitution take its course. Far be it 
     <lb/>from me to suggest that these gentlemen are 
     <lb/>not loyal ; I would rather say, that it makes 
     <lb/>one hesitate as to whether that device so 
     <lb/>applied is not a sham. Is it a device that 
     <lb/>conveys a meaning which is hidden, or is 
     <lb/>it written so that the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion and his friends may seek shelter un<lb break="no"/>der it, and so that they may not have to 
     <lb/>declare their policy upon this question, but 
     <lb/>rest content with saying, in the words of 
     <lb/>their leader:

            <p>Sir, the question whether separate schools

     <lb/>which might well have been debated in 1863 
     <lb/>when that system was adopted for the province

     <lb/>grounds of courage, on grounds of justice, on 
     <lb/>grounds of good faith, make your answer to 
     <lb/>those who appeal, make your answer to Canada

     night that Sir Charles Tupper, the then 
     <lb/>
     leader of that party, at that time in oppo<lb break="no"/>sition, with the hon. member North Tor<lb break="no"/>onto sitting at his side, declared that he 
     <lb/>
     was still prepared to pass a remedial Bill, 
     <lb/>
     and called on this government to pass one, 
     <lb/>
     The Hon. George Eulas Foster sat at his 
     <lb/>
     side and endorsed that declaration, so that 
     <lb/>
     he had not then experienced a change of 
     <lb/>
     heart, and, so far as that parliament was 
     <lb/>
     concerned, I suppose he was bound by those 
     <lb/>
     speeches. Now, what does the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman say in 1905? Here are his words: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I regret in no single jot or tittle my act in 
     <lb/>
     1896. Under similar circumstances, I would do 
     <lb/>
     the same thing, but I do not at all say that I 
     <lb/>
     will ever do the same thing under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances that may arise after this. Why? Be<lb break="no"/>cause there is a power which after all is migh<lb break="no"/>tier than the constitution. We invoked the 
     <lb/>
     constitution in 1896. We tried to give it its 
     <lb/>
     full force in a clear case and we were pre<lb break="no"/>vented by the leader of a great party. After 
     <lb/>
     we were prevented, that leader and his party 
     <lb/>
     went to the people in 1896, 1900 and 1904, and 
     <lb/>
     the people declared that they did not want 
     <lb/>
     remedial legislation. In the interests or the 
     <lb/>
     41 per cent which has been talked about in this 
     <lb/>
     House, in the interests of the province of <choice><sic>Que<lb break="no"/>bc</sic><corr>Quebec</corr></choice> which was specially interested, we on this 
     <lb/>
     side tried to get for the minority their rights 
     <lb/>
     in the only way we possibly could under the 
     <lb/>
     constitution. We were prevented from doing 
     <lb/>
     it by the Liberal party, and during three suc<lb break="no"/>cessive elections the Liberal party have en<lb break="no"/>dorsed the policy; we want no hands laid on 
     <lb/>
     any province even though it deprives the min<lb break="no"/>ority or that province of the rights guaranteed 
     <lb/>
     it under the constitution. And I make bold to 
     <lb/>
     say that as long as grass grows and water 
     <lb/>
     runs, I do not feel disposed to go against that

     Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto asked the hon. member for Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Belcourt) to withdraw the statement 
     <lb/>
     when he said that the hon. gentleman had 
     <lb/>
     changed his views because it did not pay. 
     <lb/>
     I am sorry that the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto is not here, because I would like 
     <lb/>
     to ask him two questions. He says that 
     <lb/>
     on three successive occasions the Conser<lb break="no"/>vative party endeavoured to sustain reme<lb break="no"/>dial legislation, that in 1896 they were de<lb break="no"/>feated, that in 1900 they were defeated, and 
     <lb/>
     that in 1904 they were defeated. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know anything about the hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     election of 1900, but I will ask him to say 
     <lb/>
     whether in the constituency of North Tor<lb break="no"/>onto in 1904 he ran on the coercion plat<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
    

     form that he occupied in 1896. Does he 
     <lb/>
     say that he asked the electors of North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto to support his coercion policy of 
     <lb/>
     1896 ? He dare not make such a statement. 
     <lb/>
     It is a mere method which he takes to 
     <lb/>
     crawl out of the principles he then enun<lb break="no"/>ciated. I do not know what the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman may hope for, but I do not think 
     <lb/>
     the public will be blind to what he has 
     <lb/>
     said. In one of his speeches the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman remarked : ' You have to be hon<lb break="no"/>est or the public will get on to you.' Well, 
     <lb/>
     he must think that they are a pretty blind 
     <lb/>
     public it they do not get on to him on this 
     <lb/>
     question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not believe—and I am a constituent 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentleman, I live in North Tor<lb break="no"/>onto—that North Toronto will think the 
     <lb/>
     better of him for what he has done. The 
     <lb/>
     people of that constituency may feel that 
     <lb/>
     on their altar he is prepared to sacrifice all 
     <lb/>
     his past principles and all his past record, 
     <lb/>
     but whether North Toronto will feel that 
     <lb/>
     by that sacrifice they have been compen<lb break="no"/>sated for providing 'him with a haven of 
     <lb/>
     rest after his wanderings in this cold, cold 
     <lb/>
     political world for four years, I leave them 
     <lb/>
     to say, as possibly they may have another 
     <lb/>
     chance to say. Probably it has been evi<lb break="no"/>dent from the way I have discussed this 
     <lb/>
     question that there is to-day a certain 
     <lb/>
     feeling of triumph in my breast for having 
     <lb/>
     lived to see the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto (Mr. Foster) and the colleagues 
     <lb/>
     who were here with him prior to 1896, who 
     <lb/>
     denounced Dalton McCarthy for expressing 
     <lb/>
     these views, to-day standing up enunciat<lb break="no"/>ing and supporting them. There is but 
     <lb/>
     this one question left: On the language ques<lb break="no"/>tion, the views of Mr. Dalton McCarthy 
     <lb/>
     have been adopted, and so have his views 
     <lb/>
     on the school question in Manitoba. We 
     <lb/>
     have just this one question left, and if we 
     <lb/>
     do not prevail to-day we have the pleasure 
     <lb/>
     of knowing that those who most loudly 
     <lb/>
     denounced him are now enunciating the 
     <lb/>
     same views as he enunciated. I make no 
     <lb/>
     apology for speaking thus in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Toronto. I believe 
     <lb/>
     I am justified in doing so, and I say fur<lb break="no"/>ther that so far as this speech discloses 
     <lb/>
     hypocrisy and apostasy, it can do no 
     <lb/>
     harm. I had expected to see the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) at the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion of the speech of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) 
     <lb/>
     rise and congratulate him and accept 
     <lb/>
     him as an acquisition. He did not do it, 
     <lb/>
     although he was kind enough to do that 
     <lb/>
     when I pronounced myself. I did see, or 
     <lb/>
     I imagined I saw, rather a smile of satis<lb break="no"/>faction flit across the face of that hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Mr. Sproule). He went through it 
     <lb/>
     in 1896, he was jeered at, he was sneered 
     <lb/>
     at, he was almost read out of his party be<lb break="no"/>cause he dared to enunciate these same 
     <lb/>
     views, and he was silently able to look at 
     <lb/>
     the member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster). 
     <lb/>
     squirming in his endeavor to rid himself

     from his part and I could almost im<lb break="no"/>agine I heard him thump the gavel<lb/>upon the desk and tell that hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman to come to heel as he had 
     <lb/>meekly done. Such is the situation 
     <lb/>that is presented to this country to<lb break="no"/>day. I do not think that those who feel 
     <lb/>as I do upon this question have much to hope 
     <lb/>for when they rely upon the leaders of the 
     <lb/>respective political parties. I say this sin<lb break="no"/>cerely, and I do not say it offensively: it 
     <lb/>seems to have been the policy of both par<lb break="no"/>ties ; it is therefore necessary for us in these 
     <lb/>days when there is so much inflammatory 
     <lb/>matter about to fully realize and appreciate 
     <lb/>these things. It is not fair, not right, to con<lb break="no"/>sider them without looking from every point 
     <lb/>of view. I have no hesitation in bringing 
     <lb/>these views before the attention of the 
     <lb/>House. I have done it because the leader 
     <lb/>of the opposition insinuated that Mr. Dal<lb break="no"/>ton McCarthy was 'established,' I think he 
     <lb/>put it, by the Prime Minister in Ontario. 
     <lb/>I have shown that Mr. Dalton McCarthy 
     <lb/>held these views long before 1896. I did 
     <lb/>not require to show you, at all events, I 
     <lb/>will not endeavour to do so, for I think 
     <lb/>that this country is now well satisfied, that 
     <lb/>the convictions of Mr. Dalton McCarthy 
     <lb/>then were honest convictions, and that the 
     <lb/>insinuations of the hon. member for Beau<lb break="no"/>harnois (Mr. Bergeron) that he acted out 
     <lb/>of pique or disappointment because he was 
     <lb/>not made Minister of Justice, does not re<lb break="no"/>quire refuting in Ontario, nor do I believe, 
     <lb/>in the whole broad Dominion of Canada. 
     <lb/>From what I have said, it seems clear that 
     <lb/>we must approach this question with a 
     <lb/>knowledge of what has gone before. I an<lb break="no"/>nounced myself at the outset when I spoke 
     <lb/>on the first possible occasion as unalter<lb break="no"/>ably opposed to the educational clauses in 
     <lb/>the Bill, and I will go further and say that 
     <lb/>I am unalterably opposed to this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment legislating in any restrictive way in 
     <lb/>regard to the matter of education as against 
     <lb/>these provinces which are about to be 
     <lb/>formed. I am prepared to go further than 
     <lb/>that, and I think I can demonstrate that 
     <lb/>it is necessary to put a clause in this 
     <lb/>Bill stating that fact; otherwise you will 
     <lb/>find that separate schools will be there 
     <lb/>whether you will or not. This is why I ar<lb break="no"/>gue that there must be a definite announce<lb break="no"/>ment of policy. Now, Sir, many views have 
     <lb/>been propounded in reference to this. The 
     <lb/>Prime Minister has made it perfectly plain 
     <lb/>that as a matter of policy and as a matter 
     <lb/>of law, he thinks that this legislation is 
     <lb/>justified. The leader of the opposition (Mr. 
     <lb/>R. L. Borden), I repeat again, has not said 
     <lb/>anything about the question of policy; he 
     <lb/>does not argue for or against separate 
     <lb/>schools. He says : Let the constitution 
     <lb/>take its course. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. The hon. gentleman has 
     <lb/>
     said that a great many times. I do not

     know if it is significant or not—

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. It has been repeated a 
     <lb/>
     good many times that the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition said ' Let the constitution take 
     <lb/>
     its course.' I do not recall any such ex<lb break="no"/>pression being used by the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. L. G. McCARTHY</persName>. I may have mis<lb break="no"/>conceived the leader of the opposition, but 
     <lb/>
     I understood that to be his whole argu<lb break="no"/>ment. He stood upon the rock of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution also. The Prime Minister also 
     <lb/>
     stood upon that rock, and my difliculty is 
     <lb/>
     that I cannot find room on the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister's rock or the leader of the opposition's 
     <lb/>
     rock, or the rock on which the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) stood. 
     <lb/>
     Three different constitutional views were 
     <lb/>
     expressed by these three gentlemen. In 
     <lb/>
     my opinion, we have plenary power to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this matter as we  see fit, and according 
     <lb/>
     to the expediency and the justice of the 
     <lb/>
     case. In this regard, I agree with the ex-  
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton), and 
     <lb/>
     I also invoke the declaration of Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Thompson in support of that view. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General and great lawyer as he 
     <lb/>
     was, he pronounced his opinion to be that 
     <lb/>
     at this time we would be free to do as we 
     <lb/>
     thought expedient, and best. This, Sir, is 
     <lb/>
     my opinion, and I am prepared to stand by 
     <lb/>
     it. The power under which we are pro<lb break="no"/>ceeding is the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1871, which is commonly known as the 
     <lb/>
     doubt-removing Act. That Act enacted

     I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, and to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. members of this House that the last 
     <lb/>
     three lines of that clause do away with all 
     <lb/>
     argument as to the question of 'territory' 
     <lb/>
     or 'province,' and all question as to the 
     <lb/>
     date of the admission to the union. If the 
     <lb/>
     province of Alberta had been a province 
     <lb/>
     which had been originally united with con<lb break="no"/>federation in 1867, is there any hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man in this House who will say that the 
     <lb/>
     provision of section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act would not apply ? I cannot 
     <lb/>
     conceive of any answer to the argument, that 
     <lb/>
     if you apply this draft clause to these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, you apply to them section 93 of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, unless, in some 
     <lb/>
     other part of the enactment, you specifically 
     <lb/>
     take it away. That is my argument. I say 
     <lb/>
     that if you give them that clause which, in 
     <lb/>
     all fairness and justice, you must, following 
     <lb/>
     the precedent of Manitoba, Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island and British Columbia, you do away 
     <lb/>
     with any argument as to whether it was a 
     <lb/>
     province or a territory, and also with any 
     <lb/>
     argument about the date of admission to the 
     <lb/>
     union. Is there anybody who will say that 
     <lb/>
     they have not now by law these rights and 
     <lb/>
     privileges ? Admit these two points, and 
     <lb/>
     you admit the whole of my argument—the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion seems to me to be absolutely in<lb break="no"/>evitable. But what I say further is that 
     <lb/>
     you have a little phrase in that clause that 
     <lb/>
     does protect you, if you admit the first part 
     <lb/>
     of my argument, which is that we have 
     <lb/>
     plenary power, as we have, I think, under 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act of 1871, that 
     <lb/>
     phrase says 'as varied by this Act' ; and 
     <lb/>
     you must vary this Act if you want to get 
     <lb/>
     away from section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act of 1867. I say, and say it 
     <lb/>
     without fear, without antagonism to any 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman in this House, without any 
     <lb/>
     desire to raise a sectarian cry or to foment 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
            

     religious struggles, I honestly believe that 
     <lb/>
     if you have one national school system it is 
     <lb/>
     in the best interest of the country. I would 
     <lb/>
     be disposed to recognize all conscientious 
     <lb/>
     beliefs. But coming to this question as I do, 
     <lb/>
     I cannot reach any conclusion but that it is 
     <lb/>
     best that there should be one school system. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, I hold that parliament should 
     <lb/>
     vary by this Act the application to these 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
     And I am prepared to support a clause to 
     <lb/>
     that effect. I regret that the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) is not pre<lb break="no"/>sent that I might ask if he is prepared to 
     <lb/>
     support, or whether he intends to propose, 
     <lb/>
     or will propose, as a matter of policy, the 
     <lb/>
     inclusion in this Bill a little clause to this 
     <lb/>
     effect : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     There is a straight issue of policy. The 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister has announced his policy 
     <lb/>
     that he believes in separate schools 
     <lb/>
     and that the minority has rights which 
     <lb/>
     should be protected. The leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition has yet to make an 
     <lb/>
     announcement on that point. He declares 
     <lb/>
     that he does not argue for separate schools 
     <lb/>
     or against them. But I think we are en<lb break="no"/>titled to an announcement by him on the 
     <lb/>
     question of policy. Now, I cannot see why 
     <lb/>
     there should be any inflammatory disposi<lb break="no"/>tion on the part of any hon. gentleman in 
     <lb/>
     discussing the question whether we should 
     <lb/>
     have a national school system or a divided 
     <lb/>
     school system. I do not want to be a bigot ; 
     <lb/>
     I try not to be a bigot. I am sure that 
     <lb/>
     even if you do give the power to the prov<lb break="no"/>ince, in all probability you will have some 
     <lb/>
     kind of a separate school system. But what 
     <lb/>
     harm would there be in leaving it to them? 
     <lb/>
     If you adopt the clause I suggest you are 
     <lb/>
     not legislating to take away separate 
     <lb/>
     schools; you leave it beyond the shadow of 
     <lb/>
     a doubt to them to do as they please about 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. You make your legisla<lb break="no"/>tion clear and you avoid litigation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If that argument is not logical, I am far 
     <lb/>
     astray. The only answer to it that I can see 
     <lb/>
     is the argument of policy, the argument of 
     <lb/>
     toleration and moderation that was made 
     <lb/>
     in 1896. I am prepared to admit that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friends who argue in favour of this 
     <lb/>
     clause as it is now amended are honest in 
     <lb/>
     their conviction that it is in the best interest 
     <lb/>
     of the country to try to quiet matters. But, 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand, I do not think that quiet 
     <lb/>
     would result from the legislation they sug<lb break="no"/>gest. I am one of those who think that if 
     <lb/>
     you follow the course here proposed you are 
     <lb/>
     more likely to stir up strife than if you do 
     <lb/>
     what I suggest. I had a Scotch grand<lb break="no"/>mother, though I have an Irish name, and 
     <lb/>
     I can well believe that this is a case in 
     <lb/>
     which, if you are to grasp the thistle, it is 
     <lb/>
     best to grasp it firmly. If, in dealing with 
     <lb/>
     this matter as the Prime Minister proposes, 
     <lb/>
     we do not promote moderation and tolera<lb break="no"/>
         

            <pb n="4109" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-07_Page_4109.jpg"/>

     tion, then I am right and he is wrong. But 
     <lb/>
     if his legislation shall create a feeling of 
     <lb/>
     safety and promote a spirit or toleration 
     <lb/>
     and moderation, then the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man and his supporters are right and I am 
     <lb/>
     entirely wrong. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, as to whether or not we have a 
     <lb/>
     right to legislate—an absolute, plenary right 
     <lb/>
     —or not, let me ask one question. And now 
     <lb/>
     I regret especially that the hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) is not 
     <lb/>
     here. But I would ask my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     South Simcoe (Mr. Lennox), who is a 
     <lb/>
     lawyer to give me an answer to this ques<lb break="no"/>tion when he replies. If we have not plen<lb break="no"/>ary power under the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1871, why were these words put in 
     <lb/>
     clause six of that Act ? 
     <lb/>

     That tells you that if you create a prov<lb break="no"/>ince you shall not alter that legislation 
     <lb/>
     afterwards, you shall not repeal it, you 
     <lb/>
     shall not do anything with it. If the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act applies, ipso facto, au<lb break="no"/>tomatically, or however you choose to phrase 
     <lb/>
     it, then the only thing you can do is simply 
     <lb/>
     to let it apply, for everybody knows that 
     <lb/>
     you cannot repeal or alter the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. Then, what in the name of 
     <lb/>
     common sense could the Imperial House 
     <lb/>
     mean by legislating that you should not 
     <lb/>
     amend the law after you have once created a 
     <lb/>
     province, if the amending of that law is 
     <lb/>
     clearly and admittedly beyond our power? 
     <lb/>
     Does that appeal to the legal minds of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen? It seems to me absolutely con<lb break="no"/>clusive. If this is not the conclusion, then 
     <lb/>
     it seems to me you can give no affect to the 
     <lb/>
     words. But if you were going simply to 
     <lb/>
     apply the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     that would be absolutely worthless and of 
     <lb/>
     no avail.

            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, upon this legal proposition I 
     <lb/>
     do ask some consideration at the hands 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friends. If I am right, as I 
     <lb/>
     think I am, I cannot endorse the view of the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the government, nor can I endorse 
     <lb/>
     the view of the leader of the opposition, be<lb break="no"/>cause I think that in the event of there be<lb break="no"/>ing litigation over this Bill, it will be found 
     <lb/>
     that if you leave clause 2 in there as it 
     <lb/>
     stands—and they are certainly entitled to 
     <lb/>
     something like that—if you do not vary it, 
     <lb/>
     you will have a system of separate schools 
     <lb/>
     imposed upon these provinces, a more effec<lb break="no"/>tive system, in the interest of the support<lb break="no"/>ers of separate schools, than the present 
     <lb/>
     clause 16. In that respect I agree with the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Beauharnois (Mr. Berger<lb break="yes"/>on), who made the suggestion last night that 
     <lb/>
     such would be the result. Now, if that is 
     <lb/>
     so, I ask again for protection in that regard 
     <lb/>
     for those who think as I do upon this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. It is necessary to vary this Act if 
     <lb/>
     you want to get rid of the effect of clause 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     93 of the British North America Act, and 
     <lb/>
     to do that you will have to insert in this 
     <lb/>
     Bill some such clause as that the provinces 
     <lb/>
     shall have unconditionally the exclusive 
     <lb/>
     right to legislate on educational matters. If 
     <lb/>
     you do not do that, then I say that the 
     <lb/>
     constitution will- take its course, and the 
     <lb/>
     courts will decide that clause 93 shall ap<lb break="no"/>ply, and the difference will be what is in 
     <lb/>
     clause 16 now and what clause 93 would 
     <lb/>
     give them.

     line I am now speaking, upon, that is, we

     <lb/>
     gentleman is quibbling, the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition is quibbling, they say: Let the 
     <lb/>
     constitution take its course. As I read the 
     <lb/>
     amendment it is simply an attempt to get 
     <lb/>
     a shelter behind which to shoot. Remem<lb break="no"/>ber, the leader of the opposition says, I 
     <lb/>
     do not argue against separate schools; I do 
     <lb/>
     not argue for separate schools. Let the con<lb break="no"/>stitution take its course. I have discussed 
     <lb/>
     this with men who are high constitutional

     authorities who have told me that if this

     matter is to be fought out in the courts the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion will in their opinion be as I 
     <lb/>
     have submitted. Now, let us consider what

     the leader of the opposition said. He does

     not want this Bill to be read the second

     Now, if the hon. gentleman will supple<lb break="no"/>ment that by an amendment to this Bill, 
     <lb/>
     then he accomplishes what I am arguing 
     <lb/>
     for. I am going to support this amend<lb break="no"/>ment, notwithstanding the fact that I think 
     <lb/>
     the first part and the last part are incon<lb break="no"/>sistent. I support it with the reservation 
     <lb/>
     that I am supporting the last two lines of 
     <lb/>
     the amendment and not the first three, be<lb break="no"/>cause I believe that at this juncture we 
     <lb/>
     have plenary power to do what we like, 
     <lb/>
     that we should not shoot from behind 
     <lb/>
     hedges, that we should be prepared to say 
     <lb/>
     that we believe it is in the interests of this 
     <lb/>
     country either that a national school sys<lb break="no"/>tem is the best or that a separate school 
     <lb/>
     system is the best. Unless you are men 
     <lb/>
     enough to say that, I do not think you are 
     <lb/>
     discharging the duties cast upon you as 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the people and as mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House. My position is difficult. 
     <lb/>
     I realize that I am not in a position to lead 
     <lb/>
     a crusade, I have neither the intellectual 
     <lb/>
     power nor the financial means to undertake 
     <lb/>
     that. But I am prepared to stand by my 
     <lb/>
    past principles and upon my past record,  
     <lb/>and I will vote in support of that amendment  
     <lb/>owing to these last two lines that are in 
     <lb/>it. I do not think it is effective, I think it 
     <lb/>is a sham, and I think the result will be 
     <lb/>that if the courts have to decide that they 
     <lb/>will decide that the province must accept 
     <lb/>a system of separate schools given by clause 
     <lb/>14, unless you amend this Act as it stands 
     <lb/>to-day. The clause I suggest is that the 
     <lb/>province of Alberta shall unconditionally 
     <lb/>have exclusive right to legislate in matters 
     <lb/>of education. Unless you adopt such an 
     <lb/>amendment, you do not accomplish the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of these last two lines. If hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen are going to follow it up in commit<lb break="no"/>tee, all right; then we will have a division, 
     <lb/>and possibly we will have a division on the 
     <lb/>third reading. But six weeks is a long time 
     <lb/>to wait, and we have not yet had an an<lb break="no"/>nouncement from the hon. gentleman as to 
     <lb/>what his policy is in this regard. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, I do not think it can be said that 
     <lb/>
     I have argued to-day in an intolerant way. 
     <lb/>
     I do not desire to be intolerant, I do not de<lb break="no"/>sire to be classed as a bigot, I do not think 
     <lb/>
     I am. I ask that the provinces be given 
     <lb/>
     the right to establish the system of schools 
     <lb/>
     it thinks to be in the best interests of its 
     <lb/>
     people. But I do not argue that we are not 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
      

     taking away separate schools. We do not 
     <lb/>
     have to go so far as that, nevertheless I think 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen know pretty well where I 
     <lb/>
     stand. I have no hesitation in expressing my 
     <lb/>
     views, I do say that if you are going to legis<lb break="no"/>late that they cannot do away with separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, then you are imposing separate 
     <lb/>
     schools upon these provinces. My belief is 
     <lb/>
     that you should not have Godless schools, 
     <lb/>
     and my belief is that you should not have 
     <lb/>
     dogma schools. We can have schools where 
     <lb/>
     prayers could be agreed upon. I would be 
     <lb/>
     well satisfied to use the words of an emi<lb break="no"/>nent divine : That if they are taught in 
     <lb/>
    these schools simply that it is better to be 
     <lb/>chaste than licentious, better to be true 
     <lb/>than false, better to be brave than coward<lb break="no"/>ly—then we will accomplish something upon 
     <lb/>which we can build up a nation, we will be 
     <lb/>tending towards unity and not separation. 
     <lb/>If we build up a homogeneous people, we will 
     <lb/>have a much more solid foundation for this 
     <lb/>country, and the west will flourish much 
     <lb/>better, than if you establish such schools, and 
     <lb/>if you have separation. I may be right or I 
     <lb/>may be wrong, but such are my views. 
     <lb/>Without desiring to trample upon the rights 
     <lb/>of anybody, I have spoken out in the way 
     <lb/>I have done. Such are my views, and they 
     <lb/>are the views which I think should prevail 
     <lb/>if you desire to build up a united Canada.

     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. HAUGHTON LENNOX</persName> (South Sim<lb break="no"/>coe). I will not attempt to follow my hon. 
     <lb/>
     and eloquent friend (Mr. L. G. McCarthy) 
     <lb/>through all the legal arguments and diffi<lb break="no"/>culties which he undertook to deal with. The 
     <lb/>particular object that my hon. friend had in 
     <lb/>view, I must admit, is not very clear to my 
     <lb/>mind. He started out upon a discussion 
     <lb/>which I imagined would lead him some<lb break="no"/>where, but he, like some hunters, came out 
     <lb/>just where he went in. I will do no discour<lb break="no"/>tesy to my hon. friend if I decline to accept 
     <lb/>the invitation to discuss with him or with 
     <lb/>the House the particular legal propositions 
     <lb/>which he enunciated. I did venture to 
     <lb/>call his attention to the fact that he was 
     <lb/>not giving a fair version or interpretation 
     <lb/>of the very able argument presented by 
     <lb/>my hon. friend the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/> (Mr. R. L. Borden), but notwithstanding that 
     <lb/>he still followed in the error of his ways 
     <lb/>and persisted to the end in giving his own 
     <lb/>interpretation of it. Well, Sir, if his inter<lb break="no"/>pretation of the law is not more reliable 
     <lb/>than his interpretation of the speech of my 
     <lb/>hon. friend the leader of the opposition, I 
     <lb/>am afraid it is not such an interpretation 
     <lb/>as wise men would care to follow. I did 
     <lb/>notice that there was method—I will not 
     <lb/>say in his madness—but method in his 
     <lb/>argument to a certain extent and that was 
     <lb/>that he should tell us once again—and I 
     <lb/>hope this once again will be for the last time 
     <lb/>—the history of the McCarthy family. May 
     <lb/>1 remind my hon. friend, and so as to do no 
     <lb/>injustice I except the vigorous living branch 
     <lb/>of the family of that gentleman who sits on 
     <lb/>

     this side of the House,—that he is not the 
     <lb/>
     whole family and may I suggest to him that 
     <lb/>
     he should apply to his own branch of the 
     <lb/>
     family the same rule as that which applies 
     <lb/>
     to the potatoes—the best part of it is under<lb break="no"/>ground.

     <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. L. G. McCARTHY</persName>. Does that apply

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. No, the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     cannot even now see the point. Probably 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman has so habituated him<lb break="no"/>self to thinking that the mantle of that very 
     <lb/>
     able man, Dalton McCarthy, descended— 
     <lb/>
     not upon his son, for he has a son in Tor<lb break="no"/>onto who is a very able lawyer, but upon 
     <lb/>
     this nephew of his, that he cannot think 
     <lb/>
     of anything else. Is he like the third Na<lb break="no"/>poleon of whom it was said that 
     <lb/>
     the only good thing that could be said 
     <lb/>
     of him was that he was the nephew of 
     <lb/>
     his uncle ? It seems to me that this possibly 
     <lb/>
     applies to the hon. gentleman. There was a 
     <lb/>
     part of his speech which was exceedingly 
     <lb/>
     good. It was the part in which he read 
     <lb/>
     long extracts from the speeches of his 
     <lb/>
     uncle and from the even greater speeches 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friend from North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Foster). The hon. gentleman told us 
     <lb/>
     that he changed his speech and that he 
     <lb/>
     changed it since yesterday. Does he want 
     <lb/>
     us to follow him ? He may change again 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow and very likely he will, but what 
     <lb/>
     struck me at the time was that if he had 
     <lb/>
     changed it more than he did it would have 
     <lb/>
     been a better speech. I do not exactly know 
     <lb/>
     what my hon. friend is aiming at. Surely 
     <lb/>
     it could not be that in objecting to the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of my hon. friend the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition he poses as a greater man— 
     <lb/>
     that he has found out something that nobody 
     <lb/>
     else had found out, that he is going to en<lb break="no"/>lighten the country, that both parties were 
     <lb/>
     wrong, the leader of the government and the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition, in a sense, between 
     <lb/>
     the devil and the deep sea.

            <p>

     <lb/>
     not want to elevate. my hon. friend into 
     <lb/>
    the distinction by talking about. him. He 
     <lb/>may have a chance of fame if I talk about 
     <lb/>him for too long and I think I will leave him 
     <lb/>to his own meditation and his own speech. 
     <lb/>He spoke of shooting from behind hedges. 
     <lb/>Who has been shooting, on this side 
     <lb/>of the House from behind hedges ? He has 
     <lb/>been a long time on that side of the House, 
     <lb/>he sits behind a gentleman who skulks be<lb break="no"/>hind the lines of Torres Vedras, he has learn<lb break="no"/>ed something about shooting from behind 
     <lb/>hedges and let me tell him that hon. mem<lb break="no"/>
 

            <cb/>
           

     bers on this side of the House are gener<lb break="no"/>ally in the habit of speaking their minds 
     <lb/>
     distinctly, of speaking what they think, that 
     <lb/>
     they have the courage of their convictions, 
     <lb/>
     that they are not afraid of speaking out on 
     <lb/>
     practical politics, but not upon these ima<lb break="no"/>ginary theories, which, as I say, enter no<lb break="no"/>where and come out nowhere. What was 
     <lb/>
     the policy which my hon. friend throughout 
     <lb/>
     this discussion advanced in respect to Pro<lb break="no"/>testantism of which he is the champion ? To 
     <lb/>
     do something to prevent the imposition of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools upon the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories ? I think that anybody who listen<lb break="no"/>ed to the tirade of abuse from start to finish 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friend's speech in reference 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. member for North Toronto, the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman who represents the riding 
     <lb/>
     in which he lives, would come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that from first to last his object 
     <lb/>
     was to apply names to the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party and to heap abuse upon my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from North Toronto. I do not think that 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend (Mr. Foster) will suffer much 
     <lb/>
     from the statement of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for North Simcoe. That hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     had a twinge of conscience when he was 
     <lb/>
     talking. What was he afraid of ? He threw 
     <lb/>
     up his hands and prayed to Heaven that 
     <lb/>
     he might not inflame the passions of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the country. Is there any danger 
     <lb/>
     of his inflaming the passions of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the country ? Is there any danger of 
     <lb/>
     many people reading his speech or taking 
     <lb/>
     cognizance of his doings ? He varies his 
     <lb/>
     speeches. He need not be afraid. He will 
     <lb/>
     never inflame the passions of anybody. But, 
     <lb/>
     what was the object of it all ?—the evident 
     <lb/>
     object was to do a party service for 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman whom he has 
     <lb/>
     served so faithfully during the whole period 
     <lb/>
     of this parliamentary career and a more 
     <lb/>
     truckling politician has never occupied a 
     <lb/>
     seat in this House than the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     during the time he has been here. He re<lb break="no"/>minded me of a gentleman, who, speaking 
     <lb/>
     to another, was advancing the theory that 
     <lb/>
     men are the opposite of their fathers, that 
     <lb/>
     they have the opposite traits, the opposite 
     <lb/>
     tendencies, peculiarities, &amp;c., and after 
     <lb/>
     having enunciated that principle he said : 
     <lb/>
     You never met my father. He was 
     <lb/>
     a very clever, a very brilliant and a 
     <lb/>
     very fine man. And, the other replied : No, 
     <lb/>
     I never met your father, but on the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of opposites, I can imagine that your 
     <lb/>
     father was all you describe. I am quite 
     <lb/>
     willing to concede to the late Dalton Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy all reasonable credit and I imagine 
     <lb/>
     that probably if the principle, of opposites, 
     <lb/>
     just referred to holds good, I need say 
     <lb/>
     nothing further in favour of the late Dalton 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy—hon. gentlemen will be prepared 
     <lb/>
     to imagine everything that is good of him, 
     <lb/>
     having my hon. friend, his nephew with 
     <lb/>
     us. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     The hon. gentleman (Mr. L. G. McCarthy)

     lectures to both sides and he has followed 
     <lb/>
     it up to-day by trying to impress upon us 
     <lb/>
     that all wisdom is centered in him. How<lb break="no"/>ever, we are here not to deal with his pe<lb break="no"/>culiar ideas, but to consider what is in the 
     <lb/>
     best interests of Canada having regard to 
     <lb/>
     the proposal made by the government for 
     <lb/>
     the second reading of this Bill, and the 
     <lb/>
     amendment proposed by the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition. The amendment proposed by 
     <lb/>
     my leader may have been lost sight of in 
     <lb/>
     this protracted discussion, and so I shall 
     <lb/>
     recall it to the attention of the House.

     Whatever may be the aspirations of the 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe (Mr. L. G. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy), if he is sincere in the desire an<lb break="no"/>nounced by the ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     and by gentlemen of that school, he will 
     <lb/>
     be able to realize all his expectations and 
     <lb/>
     desires if he votes for this amendment. I 
     <lb/>
     notice that the hon. gentleman (Mr. L. G. 
     <lb/>
     MaCarthy) said, perhaps without suflicient 
     <lb/>
     thought, that the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     proposed that the Bill should not have 
     <lb/>
     a second reading. That is not correct. The 
     <lb/>
     amendment is the enunciation of a sound 
     <lb/>
     principle, it will not defeat the Bill, and it 
     <lb/>
     will be followed up by proposals in com<lb break="no"/>mittee which, if adopted, will make the 
     <lb/>
     Bill what it should be. In a word, this 
     <lb/>
     is a question of provincial autonomy in the 
     <lb/>
     proper sense ; it is a question whether we 
     <lb/>
     will carry out the well recognized prin<lb break="no"/>ciple that the various provinces should— 
     <lb/>
     subject to any conditions legally existing 
     <lb/>
     at the time of the union—have full author<lb break="no"/>ity to regulate their own school laws. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman (Mr. L. G. McCarthy) de<lb break="no"/>plored that the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     had not laid down a policy, and had not 
     <lb/>
     discussed the question whether separate 
     <lb/>
     schools were good or bad per se. Since 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition introduced this 
     <lb/>
     amendment the debate has unfortunately 
     <lb/>
     drifted into a channel which justifies, if 
     <lb/>
     it does not necessitate, a discussion on the 
     <lb/>
     abstract question of separate schools. But, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, the statesmanship of the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition and his wisdom in not dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the abstract question at that time, is 
     <lb/>
     evident to every man in this House, 
     <lb/>
     and in the country, who feels the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of discussing the issue 
     <lb/>
     before us without inflaming unduly the 
     <lb/>
     passions of the people. It would be 
     <lb/>
     a matter for congratulation to us all, 
     <lb/>
     if, following the example of the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition, and the example of gentle<lb break="no"/>
      

            <cb/>
      

     men on this side of the House the question 
     <lb/>
     as to whether separate schools were right 
     <lb/>
     or wrong had been eliminated from this 
     <lb/>
     debate. Even the hon. member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey (Mr. Sproule) following in the main 
     <lb/>
     the same general course as his leader, al<lb break="no"/>though he was baited and badgered in order 
     <lb/>
     to provoke him into an expression of an 
     <lb/>
     |opinion of general hostility to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, he avoided any unnecessary dis<lb break="no"/>cussion of that vexed question, and treated 
     <lb/>
     the real question at issue with moderation 
     <lb/>
     and patriotism. It is to be regretted that 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the other side of the House did 
     <lb/>
     not follow this example. The question as to 
     <lb/>
     whether separate schools are good or bad 
     <lb/>
     is a relative question ; if in Quebec and On<lb break="no"/>tario they are good, it is because they are 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed by the constitution of the 
     <lb/>
    country and it is the duty of all 
     <lb/>loyal men to stand by the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. But in these western Territories 
     <lb/>where there is a sparse population, where 
     <lb/>there is a difliculty in maintaining any 
     <lb/>schools at all, I have no hesitation in say<lb break="no"/>ing that personally I am opposed to sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools. But aside from this I take 
     <lb/>the ground that the matter should be 
     <lb/>left entirely to the people of the west. 
     <lb/>There should be no interference from the 
     <lb/>people of Quebec or from the people of 
     <lb/>Ontario either ; the people of the west 
     <lb/>should be free to decide for themselves. 
     <lb/>We are now face to face with the question 
     <lb/>as to whether these new provinces shall, 
     <lb/>on the lst of July next, attain to sturdy au<lb break="no"/>tonomy, or cringing dependency ; whether 
     <lb/>they shall attain to the status of independ<lb break="no"/>ent provinces, or become the colonies of a 
     <lb/>colony ; whether they shall take their place 
     <lb/>as equal partners among the sisterhood of 
     <lb/>provinces, or, be as bondsmen to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion parliament and shackled for all time 
     <lb/>to come. I venture to say that the good 
     <lb/>judgment of the people of Canada to-day, 
     <lb/>is, that whether we like separate schools 
     <lb/>or whether we do not, the right policy 
     <lb/>and the wise policy is to leave to these 
     <lb/>provinces the management of their own 
     <lb/>affairs. The ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>has told us that the people of the west are 
     <lb/>as capable of managing their own affairs 
     <lb/>as are any people in the world, and we 
     <lb/>can quite believe it. Are you going to let 
     <lb/>this splendid people come in as equal 
     <lb/>partners in the confederation, or are you 
     <lb/>going to declare, that they shall be man<lb break="no"/>acled and throttled at the beginning of their 
     <lb/>career ? What subtle influence is it which 
     <lb/>causes the government to say, that the new 
     <lb/>provinces shall have forced upon them 
     <lb/>onerous conditions from which the other 
     <lb/>provinces are free? In the last few days 
     <lb/>there has come to our knowledge certain 
     <lb/>things which cast a new light upon this 
     <lb/>discussion. Yesterday we had an interest<lb break="no"/>ing discussion upon certain matters that 
     <lb/>had arisen in connection with the exten<lb break="no"/>sion of the boundaries of Manitoba. To<lb break="no"/>

     Yesterday we had a number of ministers 
     <lb/>
     speaking, and the tone of their remarks 
     <lb/>
     was that although you could not depend 
     <lb/>
     upon the statement of the Hon. Mr. Rogers, 
     <lb/>
     you could depend upon that of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Campbell, but that he would not speak 
     <lb/>
     —he had too much discretion to speak. But 
     <lb/>
     he speaks, and speaks definitely to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before I refer to that, however, I might 
     <lb/>
     refer to a matter that casts a light upon the 
     <lb/>
     extent of the privileges to be enjoyed 
     <lb/>
     by the minority in the Northwest in case 
     <lb/>
     this Act goes through in the form proposed. 
     <lb/>
     We have heard the statement constantly 
     <lb/>
     made, and it comes more particularly from 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Finance, that as a matter 
     <lb/>
     of fact, when you analyze the Acts, there 
     <lb/>
     is really nothing objectionable in the kind 
     <lb/>
     of schools which the government are im<lb break="no"/>posing upon the people of the Northwest— 
     <lb/>
     that there is only half an hour of religious 
     <lb/>
     instruction after the school is dismissed, and 
     <lb/>
     that the schools are only separate schools 
     <lb/>
     in name, but not in fact. Let us see whether 
     <lb/>
     or not that is the fact. In 1897 the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the government said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The only thing I care for is that, whereas, 
     <lb/>
     under the Act, 1890, they had not the privilege 
     <lb/>
     of teaching their own religion in the schools, 
     <lb/>
     by the concessions which have been made, 
     <lb/>
     whether they are concessions or new rights or 
     <lb/>
     a restoration of old rights, they will have the 
     <lb/>
     right hereafter of teaching their own religion 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>

     Further on he said this :

     Well, the moment I found that the people of

     which practically restored to the Catholics the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     teaching their own religion in the schools, I 
     <lb/>
     submitted to my fellow countrymen in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec that it was far better to ob<lb break="no"/>tain those concessions by negotiation than to

     there is not a. man in this country, who, looking 
     <lb/>
     at the settlement unbiassed and unprejudiced, 
     <lb/>
     will not come to the conclusion that it was a

     happy solution of a very difficult situation in<lb break="no"/>deed.

            <p>
     That is the statement of the premier, 
     <lb/>
     and it is to the effect, that he had carried 
     <lb/>
     on his negotiations in the west, and had 
     <lb/>
     obtained this concession, mainly that the 
     <lb/>
     minority would have the privilege of teach<lb break="no"/>ing their religion and the French language 
     <lb/>
     in the schools. Now, that seems to be all 
     <lb/>
     that the most extreme advocate of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools asks. Then. turning to the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the Papal ablegate, I find this :

     <lb/>
     tend to facilitate the accomplishment of his ob<lb break="no"/>ject, inasmuch as Catholics in any territory 
     <lb/>
     which might be annexed to Manitoba would 
     <lb/>
     naturally object to losing the right they 
     <lb/>
     had to separate schools and to be subjected to 
     <lb/>
     the educational conditions which existed in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Now, if you go back from that to the 
     <lb/>
     statement of the Prime Minister which I 
     <lb/>
     have just read, namely, that by his nego<lb break="no"/>tiations in 1896 he had secured for the mi<lb break="no"/>nority of Manitoba separate schools, in the 
     <lb/>
     sense of having their religion taught in the 
     <lb/>
     schools and of having the enjoyment of the 
     <lb/>
     French language secured to them ; what is 
     <lb/>
     the result of taking these two matters to<lb break="no"/>gether ? It is that you have religion taught 
     <lb/>
     in the schools, and in addition to that, you 
     <lb/>
     have some greater advantage in the west. 
     <lb/>
     According to the ablegate, there is a broad 
     <lb/>
     distinction between the west and Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     —distinction which is in his opinion suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to bar the way to an extension of 
     <lb/>
     territory for Manitoba on the ground 
     <lb/>
     that the people in the added terri<lb break="no"/>tory would not enjoy equal privileges 
     <lb/>
     with those that they now enjoy. That 
     <lb/>
     lets in a pretty important side light as to 
     <lb/>
     the actual intention of this legislation. It 
     <lb/>
     shows that the government are not honest 
     <lb/>
     or fair, and that the statements of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite are not correct when 
     <lb/>
     they say that this provision has been whit<lb break="no"/>tled down to almost nothing, and that under 
     <lb/>
     it there will be only separate schools in 
     <lb/>
     name but not in fact. Let me say, although 
     <lb/>
     I do not propose to-day to discuss the legal 
     <lb/>
     question, that it will be found, if the argu<lb break="no"/>ment of the ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     is correct—and certainly he above all others 
     <lb/>
     should be in a position to judge of that 
     <lb/>
     matter, having, as he said, special means 
     <lb/>
     of studying the school question—that the 
     <lb/>
     ordinances do not pare down the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the minority in the west, and that the 
     <lb/>
     schools provided for in 1875 will be the 
     <lb/>
     class of schools that will be maintained un<lb break="no"/>der the Act now before the House. And 
     <lb/>
     there is good reason for that, although the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General has thrown out the 
     <lb/>
     suggestion that the government will dis<lb break="no"/>pute the law of the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     in that regard. If you turn to the Act 
     <lb/>
     now before the House, you will find that it 
     <lb/>
     embraces all the subsections of section 93 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act with the 
     <lb/>
     exception of subsection 1. That subsection 
     <lb/>
     does not deal with separate schools, but 
     <lb/>
     with denominational schools, and therefore 
     <lb/>
     has no bearing in Canada, where we have 
     <lb/>
     not what are properly known as denomi<lb break="no"/>national schools. The substituted subsec<lb break="no"/>tion is :

            <p>
     Although this is put forward as an amend<lb break="no"/>ment to subsection 1 it is practically a new 
     <lb/>
     provision, because it provides for separate 
     <lb/>
     schools and for a state of things existing 
     <lb/>
     at the date of the passing of the Act, 
     <lb/>
     instead of ' at the union.' It is provided, 
     <lb/>
     however, that section 93 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act shall apply and the 
     <lb/>
     first subsection of that section deals with 
     <lb/>
     questions of this kind, and thus we 
     <lb/>
     have introduced by the Act now before the 
     <lb/>
     House substantially all of section 93 of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act with a rider such 
     <lb/>
     as I have just quoted. If it is correct, 
     <lb/>
     as the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sif<lb break="no"/>ton) argues that the ordinances have no 
     <lb/>
     effect and that the law of 1875 is still in 
     <lb/>
     force in the Territories the result will be 
     <lb/>
     that by this Act and we will be im<lb break="no"/>posing upon the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     separate schools to the most extreme type to 
     <lb/>
     which they have attained at any time since 
     <lb/>
     1875. The people of the Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies will have to accept this position at the in<lb break="no"/>stance of the minority whether they like it 
     <lb/>
     or not. We had yesterday produced in this 
     <lb/>
     House a statement made by the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers in reference to an interview with the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate. Yesterday we had also 
     <lb/>
     read in the House the statement which the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate gave to the press. In that 
     <lb/>
     statement we are told by the ablegate 
     <lb/>
     that the reason for the interview with Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell—was that he had a previous ac<lb break="no"/>quaintance with Mr. Campbell. Now, no one 
     <lb/>
     pretends for an instant that there was any<lb break="no"/>thing wrong in the Papal ablegate having 
     <lb/>
     interviews with either of these gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers or Mr. Campbell, if he sees fit. 
     <lb/>
     The question of significance yesterday was, 
     <lb/>
     and the question to-day is whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     representative of the Holy See was inter<lb break="no"/>fering unduly with the affairs of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and was endeavouring by means of certain 
     <lb/>
     propositions which he made to those repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of Manitoba to bring about a 
     <lb/>
     state of things which he desired. Hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen of the government yesterday sought 
     <lb/>
     to convey the impression that the Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate had no ulterior design of any kind 
     <lb/>
     and that it was only a private interview 
     <lb/>
     which the Papal ablegate had sought be<lb break="no"/>cause he had had a previous acquaintance 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. Colin Campbell. I propose to read 
     <lb/>
     what Mr. Colin Campbell says in reference 
     <lb/>
     to that matter, and hon. gentlemen will re<lb break="no"/>call how much credence was placed upon the 
     <lb/>
     word of Mr. Colin Campbell, everybody 
     <lb/>
     certified for him and everybody sneered at 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. Rogers. I shall now quote from 
     <lb/>
     an interview which has been had with Mr.

     Now there are other aspects of the case 
     <lb/>
     which require attention to-day. We have 
     <lb/>
     this fact brought very painfully to our 
     <lb/>
     minds that not only has the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     developed lately a peculiarly tyrannical dis<lb break="no"/>position, a desire for more power and a de<lb break="no"/>sire to manage the affairs of this country 
     <lb/>
     without seeking the constitutional advice of 
     <lb/>
     his associates something for which per<lb break="no"/>haps he may not be altogether accountable, 
     <lb/>
     but he has also developed a peculiar lack 
     <lb/>
     of memory, an unfortunate lack of memory, 
     <lb/>
     because, I can attribute some things he has 
     <lb/>
     said and done to nothing else. Nobody 
     <lb/>
     would question that the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man was perfectly honest in telling what 
     <lb/>
     occurred, I would not at all events, for I 
     <lb/>
     have too much respect for the fact that he 
     <lb/>
      was premier of the Dominion of Canada to 
     <lb/>
     say anything of that kind, but I do point 
     <lb/>
     out that there have been some fatal lapses 
     <lb/>
     of memory lately and many of them are 
     <lb/>
     brought forcibly to light in connection with 
     <lb/>
     this matter which is important in itself, in<lb break="no"/>volves as well the vital question of whether

     in Ottawa and I went to Toronto and returned 
     <lb/>
     especially for the purpose of keeping the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment, and when the incident was fresh in 
     <lb/>
     our minds we sent the letter of February 23, in 
     <lb/>
     which we repeated the promise that Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     had given us February 17.

     He says, in effect, that he has reason to 
     <lb/>
     remember, because he went to Toronto and 
     <lb/>
     returned especially to keep that appoint<lb break="no"/>ment. And, while the thing was fresh in his 
     <lb/>
     memory, not Mr. Rogers alone or him<lb break="no"/>self alone, but both drafted the letter and 
     <lb/>
     sent it. The letter was referred to by the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman with something of a 
     <lb/>
     sneer. It is not wise to sneer at the repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of a great province like Manitoba— 
     <lb/>
     not a very large one geographically, but a 
     <lb/>
     great one. That is not the first sneer of 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman. The first was 
     <lb/>
     when he told us of Mr. Haultain's position 
     <lb/>
     in the matter. Then too. there was a covert 
     <lb/>
     sneer at the position taken by the repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of the province, because, forsooth, 
     <lb/>
     he would not, on a casual reference to the 
     <lb/>
     school question, accept the school clause 
     <lb/>
     proposed, and bow his knee to this great gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Mr. Campbell says he came back 
     <lb/>
     and wrote this letter on the 17th. And he 
     <lb/>
     goes on :

     <lb/>
     the Territories of Saskatchewan and Athabasca

     <lb/>
     the policy of secrecy, on which the right

     <lb/>
     ' There was no shorthand reporter present, 
     <lb/>
     the communications were verbal, no record

     <lb/>
    great danger to the public ; and I venture to

     at that date, I venture to say that the re<lb break="no"/>cords will prove otherwise. On page 15 of

     printed letter. That letter written on the

     the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals

     this Bill should not proceed in his absence.

     It is a very important Bill, one of the most

     of the railway company which is promoting

     when the hon. Minister of Railways and

     <lb/>
     we had a very full discussion, not of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill before the House, but of another Bill 
     <lb/>
     which is now upon the order paper, relat<lb break="no"/>ing to the government's policy, not in re<lb break="no"/>spect to anything contained in these par<lb break="no"/>ticular Bills, but in respect to a totally dif<lb break="no"/>ferent matter, not germane to anything 
     <lb/>
     contained in these Bills, but relating wholly 
     <lb/>
     to a proposition that the government should 
     <lb/>
     hereafter exercise certain rights in the way 
     <lb/>
     of users of this railway from Coteau to 
     <lb/>
     Parry Sound and on the Grand Trunk from 
     <lb/>
     Coteau to Montreal. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     of Railways and Canals then stated that up<lb break="no"/>on moving in the House the Bill which he 
     <lb/>
     proposes to introduce to amend the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment's Railway Act all the information re<lb break="no"/>lative to the purport of the Bill or to the 
     <lb/>question, which I presume my hon. friend 
     <lb/>is interested in, will be given by him to the 
     <lb/>House. I presume my hon. friend desires 
     <lb/>to direct the remarks, or the criticisms, 
     <lb/>if there are criticisms, not so much to any<lb break="no"/>thing contained in these particular meas<lb break="no"/>ures, but to the governmental policy relat<lb break="no"/>ing to the users of the railways affected 
     <lb/>by them in the future. Speaking on behalf 
     <lb/>of the company—not on behalf of the com<lb break="no"/>pany any more than that the Bill has been 
     <lb/>entrusted to me—I would like to submit 
     <lb/>to the committee and to my hon. friend 
     <lb/>from Hamilton that the discussion, if there 
     <lb/>is to be one, or the suggestions, if there are

     matters. I would suggest that this Bill be

     allowed to go through the committee and 
     <lb/>
     stand for the third reading, and it may stand

     for the third reading until I have made my

     explanations. I am sure the situation could 
     <lb/>
     not be in any way affected by that course, 
     <lb/>
     and we will be expediting the business of 
     <lb/>
     the House. The company, of course, is not 
     <lb/>
     responsible for the action taken by the 
     <lb/>
     government, and I do not think that we 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I will sum up in a 
     <lb/>
     few words what I said. I said that it had 
     <lb/>
     been the hon. gentleman's policy, and it 
     <lb/>
     had been the policy of prominent members 
     <lb/>
     of the Liberal party in the past to acquire 
     <lb/>
     the Canada Atlantic as an extension of the. 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial to Georgian Bay. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman will remember that he advocated 
     <lb/>
     that three years ago, I think, in this House, 
     <lb/>
     other prominent members of his party have 
     <lb/>
     done the same thing, and we have advocated 
     <lb/>
     it on this side of the House. I pointed out 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. member for Pictou (Mr. Mac<lb break="no"/>donald) that the government might yet con<lb break="no"/>clude that it is the best policy, and that 
     <lb/>
     it would be meaningless, absurd, and an in<lb break="no"/>conceivable thing that they should pass this 
     <lb/>
     legislation and then in the same session and 
     <lb/>
     in the next breath pass an Act authorizing 
     <lb/>
     us to take over this railway, to acquire it 
     <lb/>
     absolutely as the property of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Therefore, it seemed to me to be 
     <lb/>
     only a reasonable thing that we should under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances, hear the minister's ex<lb break="no"/>planation before passing this Bill. I would 
     <lb/>
     think that that view would commend itself 
     <lb/>
     to my hon. friend : because, although he 
     <lb/>
     has to bow, I suppose, to the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     majority of the cabinet in this regard. I 
     <lb/>
     feel so fully convinced of the soundness of 
     <lb/>
     the judgment of my hon. friend on this mat<lb break="no"/>ter, as announced in this House, that I 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
      

     believe at the present moment, if he<lb/>were able absolutely to mould the policy 
     <lb/>
     of the cabinet in this regard, he would tell 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Pictou not to press 
     <lb/>
     this legislation, because he proposes to bring 
     <lb/>
     down a Bill authorizing this government to 
     <lb/>
     take over that railway from Montreal to 
     <lb/>
     Parry Sound and to operate it as a part of 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial. I am sure that I can rely 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently on the sincerity of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     to justify me in expecting that he will now 
     <lb/>
     stand up in this House and say that that is 
     <lb/>
     still his opinion and that if he could have 
     <lb/>
     his own way as to the policy of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment he would adopt that very policy which 
     <lb/>
     he so ably advocated about three years ago 
     <lb/>
     in this House.

     <lb/>
     the suggestion which I made. The Bill need 
     <lb/>
     not pass now, but it can go through com<lb break="no"/>mittee, and thus expedite business and then 
     <lb/>
     stand for the third reading, before which 
     <lb/>
     time the government Bill will be before the 
     <lb/>
     House, and I will have made my explana<lb break="no"/>tions. I know my hon. friend is always 
     <lb/>
     very sincere, as I am.

     <lb/>
     at six o'clock I was directing the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House to an important statement made 
     <lb/>
     by the Hon. Colin Campbell, the attorney 
     <lb/>
     general of the province of Manitoba, and 
     <lb/>
     I was pointing out that an unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     state of things had arisen, namely, that the 
     <lb/>
     memory of the right hon. leader of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment conflicted with the memory of the 
     <lb/>
     two members of the cabinet of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba on several important matters. 
     <lb/>
     I was intending to pursue the matter a 
     <lb/>
     little further and to point out some other 
     <lb/>
     circumstances in the same line. But I have 
     <lb/>
     probably said enough to direct the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the House to the fact that it 
     <lb/>
     is not after all so much a question 
     <lb/>
     of defective memory, as of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the government has so conducted 
     <lb/>
     this business, both in the House and 
     <lb/>
     out of it, that we have the spectacle to-day 
     <lb/>
     of a serious conflict, not only between the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman and the premier of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, but with two mem<lb break="no"/>

bers of the cabinet of Manitoba as well.<lb/>Let me call attention to the position between<lb/>the premier of the Northwest Territories and<lb/>the government. It is admitted to be a <lb/>vexed question as to what school system<lb/>shall prevail in the Northwest Territories,<lb/>and whether there shall be the vindications of<lb/>the subversion of provincial rights. That mat<lb break="no"/>ter was only referred to incidentally and<lb/>not discussed at all the very day when the<lb/>Bill was introduced with the original clause<lb/>16, which caused so much trouble, and<lb/>which is causing so much trouble in the<lb/>House to-day in its amended form. The<lb/>right hon. Prime Minister thinks that<lb/>he was perfectly justified in treating<lb/>the premier of the Northwest Territories<lb/>in a way that has been often described in<lb/>this House, so much so that he cannot fail<lb/>to realize that the people of the west are<lb/>feeling that they have been slighted through<lb/>their representative because of the manner<lb/>in which he has been treated. Enough<lb/>has probably been said about that, but new<lb/>matters arise to-day in connection with the<lb/>same kind of treatment meted out to the<lb/>representatives of Manitoba. We have had a <lb/>certain amount of quibbling by hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers on the other side of the House as to<lb/>whether or not the premier did or did not<lb/>promise to give these gentlemen another<lb/>interview. I do not care about that. From  <lb/>the evidence I read this afternoon, from<lb/>other evidence and from the intrinsic evid<lb break="no"/>ence of the case, I am convinced that the<lb/>country is satisfied that there was an under<lb break="no"/>standing at the time these gentlemen parted<lb/>from the premier and we know the unfortu<lb break="no"/>nate position of the right hon. gentleman,<lb/>putting it in the best way we can. When<lb/>we go to the records, when we go to ' Han<lb break="no"/>sard ' and take the language of the right<lb/>hon. gentleman himself no more unfortunate<lb/>condition, no more unfortunate position as<lb/>regards the Dominion in relation to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces could possibly exist than that which<lb/>is recorded at page 4110 of the unrevised<lb/>' Hansard ' in the language of the right hon.<lb/>gentleman himself. It comes to this that<lb/>he left these gentlemen upon the under<lb break="no"/>standing and with the statement that he<lb/>would let them know in a few days what<lb/>his policy would be, and he never let them<lb/>know until he introduced his Bill into the<lb/>House on the 21st February. Is that the<lb/>way to treat provinces ? It is a little pro<lb break="no"/>vince, it is true. It is said to have offended<lb/>the government, but it is said to have pleased<lb/>the masses of the people in this country.<lb/>The right hon. gentleman said that it<lb/>should have no extension of its boundaries.<lb/>It is a discussable question, I admit,<lb/>whether the boundaries shall be extended or<lb/>not, but I claim that for the provinces that<lb/>they must be treated as sovereignties even<lb/>by the sovereign and federal parliament of<lb/>Canada. When the right hon. gentleman<lb/>said, as he told us, that he would let them<lb/>know in a few days and when he came<lb/>
          

            <cb/>
    

        
before the House and announced his policy<lb/>without letting them know he was not<lb/>treating them as the representatives of that<lb/>proince deserved to be treated. This is<lb/>the language of the hon. gentleman :<lb/>

            <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, we have this state of<lb/>things that the premier of the Dominion,<lb/>having invited the representatives of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba to a conference, having partially dis<lb break="no"/>cussed the matter with them and not having<lb/>determined his policy, tells these gentlemen<lb/>that he will let them know in a few days,<lb/>he determines his policy, he decides that he<lb/>will not extend the boundaries of Manitoba<lb/>to the west which they have asked him to<lb/>do, and having determined that he does not<lb/>think it worth while to let these gentlemen<lb/>know, does not think it worth while to send<lb/>a letter to them even to announce his de<lb break="no"/>cision, but allows them to get it with the<lb/>body of the public through the newspapers<lb/>when announcing his policy in connection<lb/>with the Bills which he was introducing<lb/>on the 21st of February.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now, I come to the main point to which<lb/>I shall direct my attention this evening and<lb/>which, will, I think, stamp it indelibly upon<lb/>the minds of the people, at all events upon<lb/>the minds of the members of the House<lb/>is that it is no accidental condition that we<lb/>are dealing with to-day : that the manner in<lb/>which the whole Autonomy question has<lb/>been conducted and the whole line of policy<lb/>pursued by the premier are the result of<lb/>a deliberate scheme, of a deliberate plan<lb/>by which the Territories were to be deceived<lb/>upon this school question. We know very<lb/>well with what unseemly haste, in so far as<lb/>the premier of the Northwest Territories is<lb/>concerned, the right hon. gentleman intro<lb break="no"/>duced the Bill, and with what unfortunate<lb/>haste as regards the then absent members<lb/>of his government. There is no evid<lb break="no"/>ence even that the Bill, after having been<lb/>prepared by the sub-committee, was sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the Council before it was intro<lb break="no"/>duced into the House. I take the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility of the statement that there was a plan<lb/>

formed to deceive the Northwest Territories<lb/>into the belief that the school question was<lb/>settled and settled in the manner proclaimed<lb/>from 1896 as the policy of the west ; that is<lb/>a free national school. I will not depend<lb/>upon assertion for that. I will refer to the<lb/>documents of the House and the testi<lb break="no"/>mony of a gentleman whom, I think,<lb/>the government will not be in a position to<lb/>question. In 1902 in this House we were<lb/>discussing in committee the question of the<lb/>grant to the Northwest Territories for the<lb/>purposes of government and the Minister<lb/>of the Interior was asked to make a state<lb break="no"/>ment in reference to the question of auton<lb break="no"/>omy. Without referring to a great many<lb/>of the statements that were made in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the discussion I may say that<lb/>Mr. Boyd, then a member of this House,<lb/>called the attention of the hon. gentleman<lb/>to the question of public schools in a very<lb/>pointed way. He said as recorded in<lb/>'Hansard ' at page 3085.<lb/>

            <p>The government might just as well admit<lb/>that the delay is caused by the question of the<lb/>schools, and the question of the language, and<lb/>don't think for a moment that the people in the<lb/>Northwest are not pretty well aware of<lb/>that.<lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>We have the challenge of Mr. Boyd, and<lb/>I will read to you the reply of the Minister<lb/>of the Interior at that time in reference to<lb/>the position in which the schools stood.<lb/>The minister said :<lb/>

            <p>I think they will admit that rash haste with<lb/>regard to a question of such vast importance—<lb/>a question which must be satisfactorily settled<lb/>if settled at all—rash haste would not at all<lb/>be conducive to a settlement which would be <lb/>satisfactory in the long run to the people of<lb/>the Territories. I would not feel that I was<lb/>taking an unreasonable position before this<lb/>House if I said : that if the people of the<lb/>Northwest Territories get a reasonable and<lb/>satisfactory settlement, a settlement that the<lb/>people of Canada and the people of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories particularly will regard as a good settle<lb break="no"/>ment ; a fair and reasonable settlement prom<lb break="no"/>ising permanency ; promising lack of agitation,<lb/>and difficulties and applications for reopening<lb/>of the case in future years—if they get such a<lb/>settlement within three or four years I should<lb/>feel very well satisfied indeed, and I should feel<lb/>that we have accomplished that result in a<lb/>comparatively short time.<lb/>

            <p>We therefore have the announcement of<lb/>the Minister of the Interior that the people<lb/>of the west had settled the school question,<lb/>and that to the people of the west it would<lb/>be left. We also had his statement—and in<lb/>the light of after events it is rather inter<lb break="no"/>esting—that it would take three or four<lb/>years' of negotiation, conferences and gene<lb break="no"/>ral consideration and one year's solid work,<lb/>to determine the financial and other ques<lb break="no"/>tions and clauses. That announcement is<lb/>in strange contrast with the way this legis<lb break="no"/>lation was rushed down to the House this<lb/>session after a few days' preparation, and<lb/>in the absence of the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior himself. I submit that this was not<lb/>accidental, but that the evidence shows that<lb/>there was a desire to stifle an expression<lb/>of opinion by the people of the west, and<lb/>to prevent them presenting their case before<lb/>the government of Canada. The draft Bill<lb/>submitted by Mr. Haultain deals with finan<lb break="no"/>cial questions and general constitutional<lb/>questions alone, and there was an absolute<lb/>omission from it of any reference to the<lb/>school question. Did the government point<lb/>out to him that there was this omission,<lb/>and did they tell him that they were going<lb/>to deal with the question themselves ?<lb/>Nothing of the kind. The right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man did everything he possibly could to<lb/>stave off public discussion, and through the<lb/>Minister of the Interior announced that it<lb/>would be a matter of conference and discus<lb break="no"/>sion between the two high contracting parties<lb/>but when it came to the crux he stifled<lb/>discussion. When the Prime Minister wrote<lb/>to Mr. Haultain on the eve of last election,<lb/>did he tell Mr. Haultain that he had<lb/>changed his idea with regard to the school<lb/>question, and that he intended to bring it<lb/>into the arena of Dominion politics ? Not a<lb/>bit of it. On the contrary, he wrote to Mr.<lb/>Haultain that he would have on the floor<lb/>of parliament a larger number of represent<lb break="no"/>atives from the west, and that the other ques<lb break="no"/>tions involved would be considered. The<lb/>right hon. gentleman is very fond of boast<lb break="no"/>ing that he has a mandate from the people,<lb/>on this question, a question which, above all<lb/>others, requires that the voice of the elec<lb break="no"/>

     torate should be distinctly heard on it ? 
     <lb/>
     In the late elections, throughout the whole 
     <lb/>
     west, there was no announcement by the 
     <lb/>
     government that the new provinces would 
     <lb/>
     be deprived of their control of education. 
     <lb/>
     When the Minister of the Interior was 
     <lb/>
     asked to speak upon the question of educa<lb break="no"/>tion, he told the people, forsooth, that the 
     <lb/>
     matter could not be discussed except at a 
     <lb/>
     full cabinet meeting, and yet in his absence, 
     <lb/>
     and in the absence of the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance, the question is dealt with and the 
     <lb/>
     people of the west kept in the dark. The 
     <lb/>
     people of the west were told that the min<lb break="no"/>isters from the Northwest Territories would 
     <lb/>
     have the fullest opportunity to consult the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion cabinet assembled in force, but 
     <lb/>
     the fact is that the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories were not summoned to Ottawa 
     <lb/>
    until after the departure of the Minister of 
     <lb/>Finance and Interior had departed, and this 
     <lb/>session of parliament was in progress. 
     <lb/>That may have been a clever thing 
     <lb/>for the government to do, but it is not 
     <lb/>new. They did the same thing with regard 
     <lb/>to the Transcontinental Railway, which was 
     <lb/>not discussed until the House was in 
     <lb/>session, introduced in a hurried way 
     <lb/>into parliament, and with regard to which 
     <lb/>the announcement was made that powerful 
     <lb/>interests could not wait. I wonder what in<lb break="no"/>terests cannot wait now. The people of 
     <lb/>Canada are asking what these interests are, 
     <lb/>and the people are bound to find out. The 
     <lb/>Minister of the Interior told us that this 
     <lb/>matter would require the greatest consider<lb break="no"/>ation, and that for years he had pond<lb break="no"/>ered anxiously over the various clauses of 
     <lb/>the Bill, but not over the educational 
     <lb/>clauses. Is not that proof that the 
     <lb/>government intended the people to under<lb break="no"/>stand—and it may be possible that the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior also understood—that 
     <lb/>this question was settled by the people of the 
     <lb/>west in a way satisfactory to themselves, 
     <lb/>and that whatever rights were established 
     <lb/>under the British North America Act would 
     <lb/>be the rights which would govern the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of that free province, and not that the 
     <lb/>parliament of Canada would endeavour to 
     <lb/>gag the people of the Territories and make 
     <lb/>them vassals of the federal power. 
     <lb/>The ex-Minister of the Interior says that 
     <lb/>before his departure in January last, he 
     <lb/>made out a memorandum for his colleagues 
     <lb/>in the cabinet, but not with reference to 
     <lb/>the educational clause. He says that he 
     <lb/>was favoiired with correspondence from the 
     <lb/>right hon. gentleman who leads the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but not in reference to the educa<lb break="no"/>tional clause. He says that there were 
     <lb/>conferences in which this measure was dis<lb break="no"/>cussed with members of the government, 
     <lb/>but there was no discussion as to the edu<lb break="no"/>cational clause. We come down then to 
     <lb/>the fact that when the Bill was prepared 
     <lb/>and submitted to the representatives of the 
     <lb/>west for their consideration, strange to 
     <lb/>say, every feature of the Bill was set out 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         

     in black and white except the educational 
     <lb/>
     clause, and there was not one word about 
     <lb/>
     that. I appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, if 
     <lb/>
     this does not show, in the most conclusive 
     <lb/>
     manner, that there was a deliberate inten<lb break="no"/>tion to spring this measure and to take 
     <lb/>
     advantage of the people at the last moment. 
     <lb/>
     Is it not true that until the last moment the 
     <lb/>
     ex-minister of the Interior and the cabinet 
     <lb/>
     of which he was one of the most prominent 
     <lb/>
     members, understood or pretended that the 
     <lb/>
     measure was out of the arena of discussion, 
     <lb/>
     that it had been settled by the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the west, and that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the west were to have their rights ? But, 
     <lb/>
     in some way which we cannot fathom, but 
     <lb/>
     which we will get at in time, some silent 
     <lb/>
     pressure was brought to bear upon the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister three or four days before the Bill 
     <lb/>
     was introduced, and at the time when there 
     <lb/>
     was a question about extending the bound<lb break="no"/>aries of Manitoba, this fatally dangerous 
     <lb/>
     question is revived, and the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba are told : If you want your 
     <lb/>
     boundaries extended, you had better improve 
     <lb/>
     your school policy. And told by whom? By 
     <lb/>
     the members of the cabinet ? By the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people of Canada? No, 
     <lb/>
     not by them, but by the representative of 
     <lb/>
     the Holy See, who, he tells us, invited these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen to meet him. Of course, we are 
     <lb/>
     bound to accept his statement, that it 
     <lb/>
     was without any sinister motive, and 
     <lb/>
     only casually, that he discussed the 
     <lb/>
     matter, but still with the object of ad<lb break="no"/>vancing what he believed and properly 
     <lb/>
     believed, to be the interests of his church. 
     <lb/>
     I am not going to ascribe motives, but it 
     <lb/>
     will be for the people to say just what all 
     <lb/>
     this means. I am going to call the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the people to what I believe it 
     <lb/>
     means. I believe it means that a deliber<lb break="no"/>ate plan was formed in 1897 to work sil<lb break="no"/>ently and in the dark, and to throw the 
     <lb/>
     people down on this question when 
     <lb/>
     the proper hour would arrive. What 
     <lb/>
     evidence have I of this? I am glad to see 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice in his place, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore I have no hesitation in referring 
     <lb/>
     to the eloquent way in which a few years 
     <lb/>
     ago he referred to a matter which is pertin<lb break="no"/>ent to the subject I am now dealing with. 
     <lb/>
     That hon. gentleman proclaimed the other 
     <lb/>
     night in this House that there could be no 
     <lb/>
     peace in this country until the minority had 
     <lb/>
     received their rights, and in 1896-97 this 
     <lb/>
     country was ringing with the same state<lb break="no"/>ment that there would be no peace until 
     <lb/>
     the minority had their rights. But in the 
     <lb/>
     interval, between 1897 and 1905, we had 
     <lb/>
     almost silence on that question ; we had a 
     <lb/>
     lull in the storm. Now, the people are ask<lb break="no"/>ing what it all means and what is the im<lb break="no"/>pelling cause, of the very peculiar and very 
     <lb/>
     striking conduct of the First Minister in 
     <lb/>
     introducing this Bill—introducing it at this 
     <lb/>
     particular time, immediately after an elec<lb break="no"/>,tion. and after falling to submit the ques<lb break="no"/>tion during the election, which, according 
     <lb/>

to constitutional practice, he should have<lb/>done ? Was it that he had one of those<lb/>peremptory mandates from the people<lb/>which he is so fond of talking about? Why,<lb/>during the election hon. gentlemen opposite<lb/>were dumb on the school question. Not only<lb/>that, but in 1901 the Minister of the Inter<lb break="no"/>ior told this House that one of the reasons<lb/>why the question of the Northwest autonomy<lb/>could not be taken up at the time was<lb/>this, that in the absence of the Minister of<lb/>Finance, they could not consider it, they<lb/>could not think about it. We know what hap<lb break="no"/>pened afterwards. The Speaker objected<lb/>the other night when an hon. member inti<lb break="no"/>mated that the premier was paying his<lb/>political debts. I will not say it in an of<lb break="no"/>fensive way ; but I will say that the indi<lb break="no"/>cations are that the premier renewed his<lb/>promises of 1895 and 1896-renewed the<lb/>promise which he made to the hierarchy or<lb/>to the supporters of separate schools in 1896<lb/>and again in 1897, and that the new watch<lb break="no"/>word then was : instead of making an agita<lb break="no"/>tion throughout the country, keep quiet, work<lb/>silently and make the proper preparations,<lb/>and when the time comes for giving auton<lb break="no"/>omy to the west, that vast and fertile re<lb break="no"/>gion, perhaps the greatest agricultural<lb/>field in the world, I will be true to you,<lb/>and will redeem the pledges I made<lb/>to the House and the country during the<lb/>debates of 1896. What reason have I for<lb/>saying that ? Well, there is a good deal of<lb/>reason all along the way. In 1896, we had<lb/>the various statements made by the right<lb/>hon. gentleman in moving the six months'<lb/>hoist. You know the position he took as<lb/>to that. The position was this : I heard<lb/>the Conservative party make certain pro<lb break="no"/>positions to you; they proposed to pass a<lb/>remedial law, which will be practically<lb/>useless in face of the fact that there is no<lb/>means of supplementing it by a money<lb/>grant in support of the schools; I will move<lb/>the six months' hoist, because I want my peo<lb break="no"/>ple to get something substantial, and not<lb/>a shadowy justice. That was the position<lb/>the right hon. gentleman took at that time;<lb/>and he got in by that policy, and by vili<lb break="no"/>fying the honest policy of the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tives of that day-their honest desire to<lb/>carry out the constitutional rights of this<lb/>country. The hon. member for North Sim<lb break="no"/>coe taunted me yesterday about having lost<lb/>my deposit in 1896 in running against his<lb/>uncle, the late Dalton McCarthy. I did<lb/>lose my deposit in a triangular fight, but<lb/>I got the votes of the best men of the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party in that fight, and I fought<lb/>for what I believed to be the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional rights of the people of Canada.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I do not like separate schools but once it<lb/>had become the duty of the government to<lb/>give separate schools I for one was not<lb/>disposed to turn my back upon the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional burden of the Dominion<lb/>
 

            <cb/>
         

     government in that regard. I fought that 
     <lb/>fight through and I got a good big threshin<lb/>but I received the support of the best men<lb/>in North Simcoe at that time. And my hon.<lb/>friend the late Dalton McCarthy what did<lb/>he get. He was a clever man but the<lb/>people recognized that he was not altogether<lb/>right on that question, that at all events<lb/>it was a debatable question. That being<lb/>the case and the fight coming on with a<lb/>reformer in the field and Reformers said :<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We can do better than vote for our can<lb break="no"/>didate. Mr. McCarthy it is true lost nearly<lb/>one half of his Conservative following but<lb/>he got nearly half of the Reform following<lb/>because they said that he could battle<lb/>against the Conservative government better<lb/>than their own candidate possibly could. <lb/>The right hon. gentleman having an<lb break="no"/>nounced his policy, having gone to the<lb/>people and having won at the polls<lb/>found that he was unable to carry<lb/>out his promise and there was a clamor<lb/>in Quebec and the hierarchy were as<lb/>clamorous as any people at that time.<lb/>There was a general dissatisfaction and you<lb/>will remember that certain representatives<lb/>were sent to Rome. I do not mean the<lb/>Minister of Justice who subsequently re<lb break="no"/>presented The Forty Associates, but I mean<lb/>an earlier mission to Rome who paved the<lb/>way and who represented there that<lb/>although great concessions were not being<lb/>obtained they were better than what a Con<lb break="no"/>servative government would give. That <lb/>mission failed, as has been pointed out in<lb/>this debate, and there was still dissatisfac<lb break="no"/>tion. The premier, as you will remember,<lb/>went to Quebec and the Minister of Justice<lb/>went to Toronto and they both received a <lb/>good hearing. The Minister of Justice ex<lb break="no"/>plained to the people at Toronto-<lb/>
           and one thing for which I give him<lb/>credit is that he generally speaks out<lb/>in a manly way-that although they had<lb/>not got all they were entitled to, they had<lb/>got an instalment and they would get<lb/>more. The premier in Quebec explained<lb/>that they had only got an instalment and<lb/>they would get more and as Mr. Russell<lb/>explained in his letter it was the beginning<lb/>of justice. This brings us to the turning<lb/>point, to the height of land, because up to<lb/>that time we cannot say-although I have<lb/>great doubts myself-whether the premier<lb/>was honest or sincere or whether he was<lb/>playing a game, but from that time on,<lb/>he was climbing down, he was beginning to<lb/>work on the plan of doing things in the<lb/>dark, of deceiving people for the time<lb/>being, as in getting the elections over<lb/>and introducing this Bill. Something<lb/>had to be done and I have no doubt the<lb/>Minister of Justice came to the rescue and<lb/>it was found necessary for home to go on a<lb/>mission to Rome. One of the greatest reli<lb break="no"/>gious institutions the world has ever seen<lb/>is the Roman Catholic church. Whenever<lb/>
I speak of that great church I want to speak

     with the utmost respect ; I have the utmost 
     <lb/>
     respect for the opinions of the other people 
     <lb/>
     and I claim to be entitled to the same res<lb break="no"/>pect for my own opinions and for my own 
     <lb/>
     religious beliefs. It is admitted by all 
     <lb/>
     people that the Roman Catholic church em<lb break="no"/>braces in its membership a vast multitude 
     <lb/>
     of the brightest intellects, of the most cul<lb break="no"/>tivated men, men of great reasoning power, 
     <lb/>
     great ability and of the greatest diplo<lb break="no"/>macy. It is in a word one of the great<lb break="no"/>est powers the world has ever seen. Now 
     <lb/>
     if we come to the conclusion that we are 
     <lb/>
     in any way coping with that power to-day, 
     <lb/>
     with that church working for what it 
     <lb/>
     believes to be absolutely right and its duty, 
     <lb/>
     while we believe on the other hand that the 
     <lb/>
     true interests of Canada are not bound up 
     <lb/>
     in the aims of the Roman Catholic church, 
     <lb/>
     then it becomes our duty to be on the alert 
     <lb/>
     and to set mind against mind, reason 
     <lb/>
     against reason—but not passion against pas<lb break="no"/>sion. Mind against mind and reason against 
     <lb/>
     reason in order to secure for Canada those 
     <lb/>
     rights which we believe are in the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the people as a whole. Let me refer for 
     <lb/>
     a moment to the description of the church 
     <lb/>
     of Rome in the language of the-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice, then the Solicitor General. The 
     <lb/>
     Solicltor General says, referring to his trip 
     <lb/>
     to Rome, at page 193 of the ' Hansard '

     have said it too often already, and I hope my 
     <lb/>
     remarks will not be considered too much of a 
     <lb/>
     personal character, and that hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     will not believe I am continually talking about 
     <lb/>
     myself, I went to Rome, as I have already 
     <lb/>
     stated, as a Roman Catholic to bring a griev<lb break="no"/>ance that I felt I had in common with other 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholics, before the head of my 
     <lb/>
     church. I will say this, that it is to me, and I 
     <lb/>
     believe to many others, a source of comfort, a 
     <lb/>
     source of gratification, to feel that while we 
     <lb/>
     belong to a religious body in which there are 
     <lb/>
     over 240,000,000 of subjects, any one, however 
     <lb/>
     humble he may be, can go to Rome, and within 
     <lb/>
     two days after he reaches there, can go to the 
     <lb/>
     head of the church and tell him the grievance, 
     <lb/>
     and he will be listened to and heard. That is 
     <lb/>
     what I did and that is what I boast of. I say 
     <lb/>
     that any man who belongs to a church that can 
     <lb/>
     accomplish such a thing as that has something 
     <lb/>
     to boast of.

     matter in which a devout member of that

     There are few people perhaps to realize what

     it is a matter of great gratification to those

     <lb/>
     respectfully submit that in this country of 
     <lb/>
     sparse population where we must work 
     <lb/>
     unitedly to advance the interests of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, that the time has not yet come when we 
     <lb/>
     should cause a re-union of church and state. 
     <lb/>
     Having determined that question at the time 
     <lb/>
     of secularization of the clergy reserves, and 
     <lb/>
     the subject having been discussed on many 
     <lb/>
     hustings and settled, as we believed, for all 
     <lb/>
     time by the wise action of that day, there 
     <lb/>
     is nothing in the circumstances of the coun<lb break="no"/>try to indicate that we should endeavour 
     <lb/>
     to create a union between church and state 
     <lb/>
     again. Now, what was the result of the mis<lb break="no"/>sion ? The hon. gentleman tells us that 
     <lb/>
     somebody came back. And we know who 
     <lb/>
     came back. The result of the mission was 
     <lb/>
     that the clamour that was about the ears 
     <lb/>
     of the Prime Minister ceased, that an un<lb break="no"/>derstanding was to come to ? Was that it ? 
     <lb/>
     Or was it that he was released from his 
     <lb/>
     obligation. Was it that he was told: We will 
     <lb/>
     not exact a fulfilment of your promise ; we 
     <lb/>
     will let you off ? I do not think so. Be<lb break="no"/>cause the Minister of Justice, and the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister as well, said : It is only an instal<lb break="no"/>ment of justice that we have given, it is 
     <lb/>
     only the beginning of justice in Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     And the Minister of Justice in this same vo<lb break="no"/>lume that I have been quoting from, pointed 
     <lb/>
    out that it was the duty of his co-religion<lb break="no"/>

     ists in the west to agitate and agitate till 
     <lb/>
     they should get the full measure of justice 
     <lb/>
     to which they thought they were entitled. 
     <lb/>
     And the Minister of Justice does not make 
     <lb/>
     any bones about what that is. The Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister does not hesitate to say what that 
     <lb/>
     is ? No hon. gentleman of the Roman Cath<lb break="no"/>olic faith who has spoken in behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     government hesitates to tell us what it is;— 
     <lb/>
     and it is that side by side in the schools, as 
     <lb/>
     you impart secular education and you shall 
     <lb/>
     impart religious education and training as 
     <lb/>
     well and you shall pay for them both out 
     <lb/>
     of the same fund. I do not say that they 
     <lb/>
     are wrong in entertaining that opinion. But 
     <lb/>
     I say it is a discussable question in this 
     <lb/>
     country ; and, if it is contended that the mi<lb break="no"/>nority have a right to discuss it, then the 
     <lb/>
     majority have a right to take part in that 
     <lb/>
     discussion in a moderate and proper way,— 
     <lb/>
     and I will not say a word offensive or in<lb break="no"/>flammatory ; I would rather discuss the 
     <lb/>
     legal aspect of the case, but I think this is 
     <lb/>
     not the best time for that, and besides that 
     <lb/>
     phase of it has been so well discussed by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the leader of the opposition ; in 
     <lb/>
     committee I may have a word or two to say 
     <lb/>
     on that phase of the matter. I say that, if 
     <lb/>
     the minority are free to discuss this matter, 
     <lb/>
     then, the majority certainly have a right to 
     <lb/>
     present their views without being denounced 
     <lb/>
     from day to day by the government party 
     <lb/>
     as trying to raise an agitation, to inflame 
     <lb/>
     the minds of the people by appealing to their 
     <lb/>
     prejudices. I, for one, repel such an insin<lb break="no"/>uation. I make no such appeals. But I say 
     <lb/>
     distinctly that I do want to see the people 
     <lb/>
     aroused to the fact that we are, probably 
     <lb/>
     for the last time, dealing with a great ques<lb break="no"/>tion affecting the greater portion of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. I want the people to realize that 
     <lb/>
     this is a question which may determine the 
     <lb/>
     permanency of the British institutions on this 
     <lb/>
     part of the continent. I do not wish to 
     <lb/>
     say anything extravagant. But look at the 
     <lb/>
     condition. People are pouring in there from 
     <lb/>
     the United States—it is the boast of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite that thousands of them 
     <lb/>
     are coming in. They are people who have 
     <lb/>
     not been accustomed to a system of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools and who will not willingly submit 
     <lb/>
     to separate schools. We have people com<lb break="no"/>ing in from all other quarters of the earth 
     <lb/>
     as well. Many of them have been oppressed 
     <lb/>
     in their own country and have had griev<lb break="no"/>ances not unlike to this. They have come to 
     <lb/>
     what they have regarded as a free country. 
     <lb/>
     They have come to a country in which, they 
     <lb/>
     were told by the literature given them by 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Interior, that they would 
     <lb/>
     have free national schools. These people 
     <lb/>
     are living alongside the United States. And 
     <lb/>
     the United States is watching every move<lb break="no"/>ment in Canada. They know and realize, as 
     <lb/>
     fully as Canadians do, the vast possibilities 
     <lb/>
     that exist in the west, and they are waiting 
     <lb/>
     to see if there shall arise an opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     annex that great and fertile territory to the 
     <lb/>
     United States. If we crowd these people of 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
        

     ours too far ; if we make them restless ; if 
     <lb/>
     we show them that when their representa<lb break="no"/>tives come to Ottawa those representatives 
     <lb/>
     are regarded as of no account, that they 
     <lb/>
    are to be told : We will see you 
     <lb/>again, and then not see them again, 
     <lb/>but proceed to introduce legislation 
     <lb/>affecting them without hearing what they 
     <lb/>have to say about it,—if this is our treatment 
     <lb/>of them, what may we exepect ? I do not 
     <lb/>say it will happen, but I want you to be 
     <lb/>careful that it does not happen—careful that 
     <lb/>some morning, when the prosperity of Can<lb break="no"/>ada appears to be great, when the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of that territory is large and growing, 
     <lb/>these provinces west of the Great Lakes and 
     <lb/>reaching to the foot of the mountains may 
     <lb/>not be found contemplating throwing in 
     <lb/>their lot with the United States between 
     <lb/>them and whom are no geographical barriers, 
     <lb/>no great range of mountains or other ob<lb break="no"/>stacle to communication, and that we may 
     <lb/>not find out, too late, that all the power 
     <lb/>of Great Britain cannot prevent those peo<lb break="no"/>ple becoming part and parcel of the United 
     <lb/>States. It is a serious question ; there never 
     <lb/>was so serious a question in the history, of 
     <lb/>Canada, to my mind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, as the question has come up, I in<lb break="no"/>tend to consider whether or not the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     church exerts a political influence—a poli<lb break="no"/>tical and sometimes a controlling political 
     <lb/>
     influence. I have prepared authorities and I 
     <lb/>
     have them here. Testimony is given both 
     <lb/>
     ways. An hon. gentleman on this side of 
     <lb/>
     the House for whom I have the greatest 
     <lb/>
     respect, both as regards his opinions and as 
     <lb/>
     regards his candour, in expressing those 
     <lb/>
     opinions, has pointed out that the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic clergy do not exert political in<lb break="no"/>fluence. I have the testimony of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Simcoe last night, but 
     <lb/>
     I could not subscribe to his statement, that 
     <lb/>
    the clergy would go to the extent of excom<lb break="no"/>municating people for their political opinions 
     <lb/>or connections. I do not believe anything 
     <lb/>of the kind. But I will refer to authorities 
     <lb/>that will not be disputed. First, I may be 
     <lb/>permitted to give the testimony of the Prime 
     <lb/>Minister. The premier speaking in the de<lb break="no"/>bate on the motion for the six months hoist, 
     <lb/>recorded in ' Hansard,' on page 2758, said :

     to say : even though I have threats held over 
     <lb/>
     me coming, as I am told, from high dignitaries 
     <lb/>
     in the church to which I belong, no word of 
     <lb/>

     Now I have many other authorities. The

     Minister of Agriculture last night referred

     to the same matter. I refer to it for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of showing that these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     have exercised influence in the past, and if 
     <lb/>
     they have exercised political influence in 
     <lb/>
     the past it is important to know it, because 
     <lb/>
     they may exercise it in the future and they 
     <lb/>
     may be at work now. The Minister of

     Now, those who are familiar with the condi<lb break="no"/>tions existing in our province, those who know

     Now it is not necessary to refer further 
     <lb/>
     to that matter. You may perhaps say that 
     <lb/>
     no man of any political standing would give 
     <lb/>
     those pledges, and you would say that the 
     <lb/>
     deliberations of this free parliament would 
     <lb/>
     not be in any way influenced by the 
     <lb/>
     fact of the bishops of the church of Rome 
     <lb/>
     having required those pledges from candi<lb break="no"/>dates seeking election. But that is not the 
     <lb/>
     case. The greatest, the brightest minds on 
     <lb/>
     the list of liberal candidates for election at 
     <lb/>
     that time, including the Minister of Justice, 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     were of those who with a religious fervour 
     <lb/>
     that does them credit (as churchmen), ac<lb break="no"/>cepted these pledges, and signed them, and 
     <lb/>
     gave their adhesion to what was re<lb break="no"/>quired by that pastoral letter, namely, 
     <lb/>
     that the desire and aspirations of the 
     <lb/>
     bishops should be consulted, and that 
     <lb/>
     men should pledge themselves in advance, 
     <lb/>
     before they entered the House of Commons, 
     <lb/>
     that they would not only vote for the restor<lb break="no"/>ation of the rights of the minority in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba, but that they would con<lb break="no"/>form - to the wishes of the prelates to 
     <lb/>
     whom they bound themselves. I am not 
     <lb/>
     arguing whether that condition of things is 
     <lb/>
     right or wrong—I am directing attention to 
     <lb/>
     the fact that we were confronted with that 
     <lb/>
     condition of things in 1896, that of the candi<lb break="no"/>dates who were supporters of the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, a fulfilment of those pledges as 
     <lb/>
     demanded in 1896-7, that a great clamour 
     <lb/>
     existed for the fulfilment of those promises; 
     <lb/>
     and that by reason of the mission of the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice to Rome, a gentleman 
     <lb/>
     came out, and his power was substituted 
     <lb/>
     for the power of the clergymen of the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic church as regards a matter 
     <lb/>
     which affected the political interests of the 
     <lb/>
     minority in this country. Now it is a 
     <lb/>
     logical conclusion or is it not? If we find 
     <lb/>
     that in 1896 the Roman Catholic church was 
     <lb/>
     exercising a direct influence upon the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Canada in that regard, that it had 
     <lb/>
     been exerted long before 1896, is it not 
     <lb/>
     prudent that we should ask ourselves to-day 
     <lb/>
     whether, having regard to all the circum<lb break="no"/>stances presented to us in such lurid light 
     <lb/>
     within the last few days, that influence by 
     <lb/>
     the hand of an eminent gentleman, His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency the Papal delegate, is being ex<lb break="no"/>erted to-day ?

     Now, some one has been referring to 
     <lb/>
     the palladium of liberty, to the bul<lb break="no"/>wark of liberty and so on . What is the 
     <lb/>
     palladium of liberty, or the bulwark of 
     <lb/>
     liberty as regards the Bill? We have the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Sir William Mulock, the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General, and we have the court appointed 
     <lb/>
     to investigate into this matter. We have 
     <lb/>
     four judges to stand between the people 
     <lb/>
     and any attacks that may be made upon 
     <lb/>
     their liberties. When I say an attack upon 
     <lb/>
     their liberties I do not mean a vicious 
     <lb/>
     attack, an absolutely unjustifiable attack ; I 
     <lb/>
     mean that when the advance guard of a 
     <lb/>
     great body comes forward to assist what 
     <lb/>
     they believe to be right in the interests of 
     <lb/>
     their church, but which we do not believe to 
     <lb/>
     be in the best interests of Canada, we have 
     <lb/>
     as the palladium of Canadian liberty the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman who is sleeping in his seat 
     <lb/>
     tonight and we have three more. I, as a

     Protestant—and I do not think I am saying 
     <lb/>
     anything offensive in saying that—rest my 
     <lb/>
     case mainly with him. The others may be 
     <lb/>
     prejudiced, they may be carried away with 
     <lb/>
     their religious zeal, but the champion of

     the hon. Postmaster General, who stood as

     <lb/>
     we have four. We have the premier, who

     who is a confirmed and staunch believer in 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. We have another gentle<lb break="no"/>man, the Hon. Secretary of State. Some 
     <lb/>
     one has said that he is a Roman Catholic. 
     <lb/>
     That does not matter at all, but we have 
     <lb/>
     the hon. the Secretary of State. He is a 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic. We have this gentleman 
     <lb/>
     whose history is written in one long agita<lb break="no"/>tion for separate schools in this country, a 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, who, while discharging semi- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     judicial duties, was issuing a pamphlet for 
     <lb/>
     the guidance of the electors and the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the House of Commons coloured 
     <lb/>
     to suit the case which we are oppos<lb break="no"/>ing. We have then the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) and in that hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman we have one who has declared him<lb break="no"/>self honestly and fairly, as to the view he 
     <lb/>
     takes of this matter. It is, however, impor<lb break="no"/>tant, that, in considering the position of this 
     <lb/>
     question, in considering the attitude that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of Justice is likely to take on 
     <lb/>
     this matter, we should also consider the 
     <lb/>
     position that he stands in in regard to his 
     <lb/>
     pledge because he was one of those who did 
     <lb/>
     give a pledge in 1896. This is the pledge 
     <lb/>
     that the Minister gave and has more than 
     <lb/>
     once admitted frankly that he gave this 
     <lb/>
     pledge. He has told the House that he will 
     <lb/>
     stand by the pledge and that if he is called 
     <lb/>
     upon to redeem it, he will redeem it. I 
     <lb/>
     submit for your consideration, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     if the time has not arrived by all indications 
     <lb/>
     that we see around us to-day in the city of 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, both inside and outside this House, 
     <lb/>

     So that it was to apply to the west and to 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba as well, but the desire which seems 
     <lb/>
     to animate the premier to-day is to hedge 
     <lb/>
     around little Manitoba, circumscribe its 
     <lb/>
     boundaries, not to enlarge the area of 
     <lb/>
     national schools but to contract and circum<lb break="no"/>scribe the area and extend the area of sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools the position of which in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories is so much in advance of the 
     <lb/>
     privileges enjoyed by the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, that, as His Excellency, the Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate, points out, that unless the people 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba will agree to amend their school 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     who enjoy a higher class of religious liberty 
     <lb/>

     I have spoken of the hon. the Post<lb break="no"/>master General. I see he is awake. It 
     <lb/>
     is for the country to consider, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the attitude of the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General and his well known championship 
     <lb/>
     of provincial rights, whether there may be 
     <lb/>
     any temptation on his part to surrender 
     <lb/>
     the citadel. The matter was well timed 
     <lb/>
     for that. It has been a government notor<lb break="no"/>ious for 'supplanters.' The extent to which 
     <lb/>
     dissensions have imperilled the administra<lb break="no"/>tion has been a disgrace to the government 
     <lb/>
     and when Esau, the hon. Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance was absent it was a good time, per<lb break="no"/>haps, to apply to the Postmaster General 
     <lb/>
     and without saying anything improper to 
     <lb/>
     impress upon his mind the grandeur and 
     <lb/>
     nobility of having a great mind such as his 
     <lb/>
     at the head of the affairs of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and to point out that, after all it might be 
     <lb/>
     better that the Postmaster General should 
     <lb/>
     represent the Dominion of Canada in succes<lb break="no"/>sion to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, than his rival 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Finance who has evidently 
     <lb/>
     been aspiring to the position. Well! A 
     <lb/>
     vacancy was approaching, the plums were 
     <lb/>
     hanging above the head of the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General, his mouth was open and watering 
     <lb/>
     for them, and Jacob—the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral figuratively speaking—was willing in 
     <lb/>
     the absence of Esau to take the position, 
     <lb/>
     and so he capitulated to the seductive in<lb break="no"/>fluences that surrounded him. Was that it? 
     <lb/>
     Or may it have been that the Post<lb break="no"/>master General was actuated by a 
     <lb/>
     more noble ambition. and that he was 
     <lb/>
     anxious to secure the leadership of his 
     <lb/>
     party so that he might put an end to the 
     <lb/>
     iniquitous infringements of the independ<lb break="no"/>ence of Parliament Act which we see oc<lb break="no"/>curring day after day. Or may it have been

     that in the hands of the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice and the Prime Minister, these two 
     <lb/>
     great potters so to speak, the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General was as clay and that they moulded 
     <lb/>
     him to their desires. When the Bill was 
     <lb/>
     introduced in the first instance $5,000,000 
     <lb/>
     worth of property was set apart for public 
     <lb/>
     schools was contrary to all principles of 
     <lb/>
     the separation of church and state 
     <lb/>
     of which the Postmaster General must 
     <lb/>
     be an advocate if he wishes to repre<lb break="no"/>sent North York—made to contribute for 
     <lb/>
     all time to come to the support of the edu<lb break="no"/>cation system of the Roman Catholics of 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces. The Bill with a provi<lb break="no"/>sion having this was presented to this House 
     <lb/>
     and applauded by the Postmaster General, so 
     <lb/>
     that one must conclude that he was but 
     <lb/>
     as clay in the hands of the skilful Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice. The Postmaster General will 
     <lb/>
     have to fight that out with the people of 
     <lb/>
     his own riding it he ever faces them again; 
     <lb/>
     he will have to explain to them why he 
     <lb/>
     so cheerfully surrendered all his old prin<lb break="no"/>ciples. And, it he can satisfy the electors 
     <lb/>
     of North York, and if the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
     can satisfy the people of Canada—I do not 
     <lb/>
     think they will—then possibly the Post<lb break="no"/>master Gcneral may realize that ambition 
     <lb/>
     to attain which he surrendered the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the people of the new provinces which 
     <lb/>
     ought to have been safe in his keeping. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Foster) said yesterday that the poeple are 
     <lb/>
     thinking and I repeat, Sir, that the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada are thinking. When this ques<lb break="no"/>tion was launched a few weeks ago it as<lb break="no"/>sumed great importance, but since then a 
     <lb/>
     further and still more important issue has 
     <lb/>
     been forcibly presented, that is, that undue 
     <lb/>
     influences are at work controlling and guid<lb break="no"/>ing the administration in a manner which 
     <lb/>
     should not be possible in a free British 
     <lb/>
     country. There is the fact—and the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister has not dared to deny it—that he 
     <lb/>
     has had conference after conference with 
     <lb/>
     the Papal ablegate, not only as to clause 
     <lb/>
     16 of the original Bill but as to the amend<lb break="no"/>ed educational clause which was substi<lb break="no"/>tuted for it. This latter clause was brought 
     <lb/>
     in to quiet the rebellion in the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     camp, but so far as the vital principle is 
     <lb/>
     concerned as to whether or not the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces shall be respected, there 
     <lb/>
     is not one tittle of difference between 
     <lb/>
     the new clause and the old. It is 
     <lb/>
     time for the people of Canada to think 
     <lb/>
     and they are doing their own thinking 
     <lb/>
     and don't you forget it. If the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the government benches would leave the 
     <lb/>
     sinister influences which surround them in 
     <lb/>
     the city of Ottawa and go out into the 
     <lb/>
     country, they would find what the prevail<lb break="no"/>ing state of public opinion is. They would 
     <lb/>
     find that the people are clamouring against 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, and Sir, the people would clamour 
     <lb/>
     still more if they knew that the measure 
     <lb/>
     is to be rushed through this House by the 
     <lb/>
     force of numbers and numbers alone, to be<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
     
come at all events nominally the law of 
     <lb/>
     the land. I have met in the town of Barrie 
     <lb/>
     a great many Liberals—but I have not met 
     <lb/>
     one who has not condemned the action of 
     <lb/>
     the government. They are not saying much; 
     <lb/>
     they did not say much previous to the 
     <lb/>
     Ontario elections last January, but they 
     <lb/>
     spoke by their ballots as they dropped 
     <lb/>
     them into honest boxes, and they will do 
     <lb/>
     so again. I can tell these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite that they need not imagine for 
     <lb/>
     one moment that they are going to 
     <lb/>
     foist this measure upon the west in de<lb break="no"/>fiance of the constitutional rights of these 
     <lb/>
     two provinces. With Manitoba alarmed, 
     <lb/>
     excited, and in arms as it is against 
     <lb/>
     the treatment which it has received from 
     <lb/>
     the government, a crisis had been brought 
     <lb/>
     about in the affairs of Canada. That crisis 
     <lb/>
     is the result of the government's studied 
     <lb/>
     silence, of its system of misleading the 
     <lb/>
     people, of its system of working in the 
     <lb/>
     dark, of its system of retiring behind the 
     <lb/>
     lines of Torres Vedras before the election, 
     <lb/>
     and rushing out after the election, to steal 
     <lb/>
     away the rights of the people. Don't ima<lb break="no"/>gine that you can coerce the people of the 
     <lb/>
     west. Don't imagine that you can perman<lb break="no"/>ently secure even the best interests of the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic church in this way. As 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Finance said, if you 
     <lb/>
     treated the people of the west in a generous 
     <lb/>
     way, if you approached them in a fair spirit, 
     <lb/>
     the minority would get all the con<lb break="no"/>cessions they needed as is the case 
     <lb/>
     in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick where 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Finance told us they have 
     <lb/>
     not separate school laws, but where the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholics enjoy vastly greater pri<lb break="no"/>vileges than as he would have us under<lb break="no"/>stand it—this legislation gives the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics of the west. I shall say 
     <lb/>
     no more. This is an important ques<lb break="no"/>tion ; it is fraught with immense conse<lb break="no"/>quences for the people of Canada; it is a 
     <lb/>
     question upon which the people are think<lb break="no"/>ing and it is a question which will not die. 
     <lb/>
    Had this measure been introduced in 
     <lb/>a more moderate manner and in a 
     <lb/>constitutional way it might be that we 
     <lb/>would hear no more of it at the next elec<lb break="no"/>tion. But, introduced as it was, in the ab<lb break="no"/>sence of the constitutional advisers of 
     <lb/>the Crown, the people of the west lulled 
     <lb/>into fancied security as they were, the 
     <lb/>haste with which the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment introduced it in the absence of the 
     <lb/>ministers, the language, the violent lan<lb break="no"/>guage, with which the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>introduced it, the statements which he 
     <lb/>made, the events which have occurred since 
     <lb/>involving the discussion of the influence 
     <lb/>exercised by the Papal ablegate over the 
     <lb/>Prime Minister of this country, the manner 
     <lb/>in which the representatives of the West 
     <lb/>have been treated, the manner too in which 
     <lb/>the land question and the question of timber, 
     <lb/>minerals, &amp;c., have been dealt with—all these 
     <lb/>are questions which will live in the memory 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
    they will die out some time, but I hope 
     <lb/>they will not die out until this peril shall 
     <lb/>have been averted, and until the people of

     <lb/>in power a wise administration which will

     <lb/>is in the interest of the majority and in the

     <persName ref="pers:TURG1">Mr. O. TURGEON</persName> (Gloucester). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, at this late hour of the evening, in 
     <lb/>
     the closing hours of a long week's labour, 
     <lb/>
     and at this advanced stage of this most im<lb break="no"/>portant debate which has brought forth elo» 
     <lb/>
     quence seldom heard within the walls of 
     <lb/>
     this House, I would certainly not rise at all 
     <lb/>
     but that the noble sentiments that have been 
     <lb/>
     expressed on both sides of this House, not<lb break="no"/>withstanding occasional divergences, have 
     <lb/>
     recalled some other sentiments, the sentiment 
     <lb/>
     of gratitude and others, which one entertains 
     <lb/>
     according to his own particular experiences 
     <lb/>
     in life. I wish to say, Mr. Speaker, that 
     <lb/>
     born under the heavens of French Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     carried away in my early years to other 
     <lb/>
     shores in search of brothers lost, whom I 
     <lb/>
     knew merely by the history of their heroes 
     <lb/>
     and martyrs, I heard my name graced with 
     <lb/>
     kindly expressions of sympathy and best 
     <lb/>
     wishes from the Scotch people, the English 
     <lb/>
     people and the Irish people happily settled 
     <lb/>
     in various districts of the extensive county 
     <lb/>
     of Gloucester, which I now have the honour 
     <lb/>
     to represent. I at once was struck by the 
     <lb/>
     vivid expressions of sympathy and the ex<lb break="no"/>uberance of the cordial feelings of these 
     <lb/>
     peoples, who were the first to inspire my 
     <lb/>
     political ambition, who left their homes, 
     <lb/>
     their fields, their fishing boats to go to the 
     <lb/>
     polls to vote for me when my own kindred 
     <lb/>
     people had not yet thought proper to do so. 
     <lb/>
     This, Mr. Speaker, was at a time when 
     <lb/>
     the echoes of the patriotic eloquence of 
     <lb/>
     Joseph Howe were still vibrating through 
     <lb/>
     the hills and valleys of New Brunswick and 
     <lb/>
     the Metapedia, on the onward wave towards 
     <lb/>
     the western provinces which were soon to 
     <lb/>
     be united with the rest of Canada by ties 
     <lb/>
     stronger than the iron rails and bridges of 
     <lb/>
     the great national highway which Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia's patriot had so happily dreamed of 
     <lb/>
     —the more lasting the nobler ties of fratern<lb break="no"/>ity, equality, justice and charity. It was 
     <lb/>
     only a few years afterwards that the fathers 
     <lb/>
     of confederation, representing the different 
     <lb/>
     provinces of British North America, met 
     <lb/>
     together. May I name some of them whose 
     <lb/>
     names are still perhaps more familiar than 
     <lb/>
     others to the people at large ? Sir John A. 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald, Sir George E. Cartier, D'Arcy 
     <lb/>
     McGee, Oliver Mowat, George Brown, Sir 
     <lb/>
     Charles Tupper, Sir Leonard Tilley. Sit<lb break="no"/>ting at an international council, as I may 
     <lb/>
     call it, these men undertook a task of great 
     <lb/>
     difficulty—to lay the foundations of a new 
     <lb/>
     nation—a nation formed of various races 
     <lb/>
     and creeds. Mingling their patriotic breath 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     

     in one common aspiration they framed for 
     <lb/>
     the different provinces of British North 
     <lb/>
     America a constitution, an immutable 
     <lb/>
     constitution which would stand for the 
     <lb/>
    protection of the weak as well as for 
     <lb/>the welfare of the strong. That new 
     <lb/>nation, Mr. Speaker, born with the 
     <lb/>many virtues of its many races, has made 
     <lb/>good progress in the development of the re<lb break="no"/>sources which nature has lavished upon her 
     <lb/>until Canada is certain to be one of the 
     <lb/>great nations of the twentieth century, and, 
     <lb/>according to the creed of my faith, the 
     <lb/>greatest Christian nation of the world. Not 
     <lb/>half a century has yet elapsed since those 
     <lb/>days, and we see all the progress which 
     <lb/>Canada has made, incomparable to that of 
     <lb/>any other nation. The United States has had 
     <lb/>its time of great progress, but its growth 
     <lb/>in moral as well as material progress is not 
     <lb/>to be compared with that of Canada during 
     <lb/>the last eight or ten years. We have had 
     <lb/>the advantage of bringing Prince Edward 
     <lb/>Island into the union; we have had the ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of bringing in British Columbia, 
     <lb/>which, with its immense resources, in lum<lb break="no"/>ber, in gold, in lands, in fisheries, is sure 
     <lb/>to become an immense factor in the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada. We have added the great 
     <lb/>Northwest, to which the attention of the 
     <lb/>nations of the world has lately been directed 
     <lb/>by a progressive policy of immigration which 
     <lb/>has never been equalled by any other na<lb break="no"/>tion, not even by the United States; and to<lb break="no"/>day we are called upon to give to that ter<lb break="no"/>ritory all the rights and liberties and privi<lb break="no"/>leges which the constitution permits us to 
     <lb/>give, commensurate with its importance, 
     <lb/>with the requirements of its progress, both 
     <lb/>moral and material, and with the immense 
     <lb/>resources which that portion of Canada con<lb break="no"/>tains in greater quantity than any other— 
     <lb/>resources of land, resources of forest in 
     <lb/>most districts, minerals of all kinds—re<lb break="no"/>sources which have been lying there unde<lb break="no"/>veloped for centuries, which are appealing 
     <lb/>to human intelligence and to human ac<lb break="no"/>tivity for their development in the interest 
     <lb/>of the Canadian people; where millions will 
     <lb/>certainly live in the years to come, and will 
     <lb/>work together in unity, like the people of 
     <lb/>the older provinces; where the French, the 
     <lb/>English, the Scotch, the Irish and the Ger<lb break="no"/>mans will all seek to give the country the 
     <lb/>benefit of their labours and of their intelli<lb break="no"/>gence in order to bring the Norhwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories to the head of this great nation, which 
     <lb/>are certainly capable of raising sufficient 
     <lb/>wheat to supply all the breadstuffs required 
     <lb/>by the British people in the cities of England 
     <lb/>or Scotland. In those provinces, by the in<lb break="no"/>terchange of trade and commerce, not only 
     <lb/>the true Canadian sentiment but the true 
     <lb/>British sentiment will be kept up, for these 
     <lb/>people will settle there, they will grow their 
     <lb/>wheat and they will know that that wheat 
     <lb/>will go especially to the great cities of the 
     <lb/>British empire and as trade and commercial 
     <lb/>relations create sentimental relations these 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="4157" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-07_Page_4157.jpg"/>

     sentimental relations will be favourable to 
     <lb/>
     Canada and to the British empire. We 
     <lb/>
     have heard a great deal of imperalism in 
     <lb/>
     this country. Not long ago noble senti<lb break="no"/>ments were expressed by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Victoria and Haliburton (Mr. Sam. 
     <lb/>
     Hughes), and certainly there is something 
     <lb/>
     which appeals to the intelligence of every 
     <lb/>
     Canadian in the word 'imperalism' owing 
     <lb/>
     to the debt of gratitude we owe and of the 
     <lb/>
     continued gratitude which we expect to 
     <lb/>
     entertain for the British empire. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that for many years to come, for the present 
     <lb/>
     at least in my judgment, the best imperial<lb break="no"/>ism which we can offer to the British em<lb break="no"/>pire would be for the Canadians to produce 
     <lb/>
     all the wheat and all the breadstuffs which 
     <lb/>
     her millions of artisans in the cities of Lon<lb break="no"/>don, Liverpool and Manchester require and 
     <lb/>
     which they have neither the means, the 
     <lb/>
     time nor the land to produce, and to have 
     <lb/>
     those immense quantities of wheat and 
     <lb/>
     breadstuffs transported through Canadian 
     <lb/>
     channels and Canadian ports to the ports 
     <lb/>
     of England, Scotland and Ireland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The prospects of those new provinces are 
     <lb/>
     certainly brilliant and it became no doubt 
     <lb/>
     a hard task for this government and for 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman who leads the 
     <lb/>
     government (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) to raise 
     <lb/>
     the foundation upon which these two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces will be best able to work out their 
     <lb/>
     destiny and the fullest development of their 
     <lb/>
     progress, moral and material. Our consti<lb break="no"/>tution gives the government of this coun<lb break="no"/>try many powers in the making of new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and no doubt when a portion of 
     <lb/>
     country comes and calls at the door of this 
     <lb/>
     parliament asking for provincial rights, 
     <lb/>
     the people of that portion of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     naturally expect all the freedom and op<lb break="no"/>portunities possible under the constitution. 
     <lb/>
     It becomes then the duty of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and of the Prime Minister to allow 
     <lb/>
     such rights as may be commensurate with 
     <lb/>
     their future happiness and prosperity. The 
     <lb/>
     government has to give them that right of 
     <lb/>
     going to seek for their future prosperity 
     <lb/>
     that a father gives to his child, whom he 
     <lb/>
     sees going from him. While the father 
     <lb/>
     gives his son a portion at his territory, he 
     <lb/>
     shows still greater attention and greater 
     <lb/>
     parental sentiment, when he says : My 
     <lb/>
     child, I give you a certain domain, but I 
     <lb/>
     shall not leave you all alone, I shall con<lb break="no"/>tinue to help you with my credit and my 
     <lb/>
     means in order to allow you to develop that 
     <lb/>
     domain as rapidly as possible without en<lb break="no"/>cumbrance upon yourself. When this ques<lb break="no"/>tion arose the question of land was no doubt 
     <lb/>
     one that first attracted the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. the premier and his government. 
     <lb/>
     No doubt a certain class of people in those 
     <lb/>
     Territories, at first sight, may have thought, 
     <lb/>
     and thought properly in their judgmentm 
     <lb/>
     that they should have a claim to the lands, 
     <lb/>
     to the vast prairies, to the millions of acres 
     <lb/>
     which are still unsettled, and the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of which will require millions of 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
      

     dollars in order to be able to bring im<lb break="no"/>migration sufficient for the development of 
     <lb/>
     those lands, and to maintain the credit of 
     <lb/>
     those provinces by keeping up a steady flow 
     <lb/>
     of immigration. Let us for a moment con<lb break="no"/>sider the position of the people of those 
     <lb/>
     provinces in reference to the possession of 
     <lb/>
     those lands. The moment those lands are 
     <lb/>
     transferred to them the people of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces would have to meet the ex<lb break="no"/>penses of that immigration of which I 
     <lb/>
     have spoken, they would have to continue 
     <lb/>
     the immense payments for immigration 
     <lb/>
     agents in the different countries, they would 
     <lb/>
     have to pay the expenses of their land 
     <lb/>
     agents, and we know what a risk there 
     <lb/>
     is of a province under her own credit, and 
     <lb/>
     with her own single resources, no matter 
     <lb/>
     how wealthy that province may be, falling 
     <lb/>
     into some bad policy which would be suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to at once arrest the tide of immigra<lb break="no"/>tion and divert it to some other country. If, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, we compare the difference in the 
     <lb/>
     monetary terms granted to the people of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces, Saskatchewan and Alberta, 
     <lb/>
     as they are now, and as they would be if 
     <lb/>
     the government had given the public lands 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces, we find that if they had 
     <lb/>
     the lands they would then not only have 
     <lb/>
     to meet the expenses of immigration, but 
     <lb/>
     they would have no compensation for the 
     <lb/>
     lands. Now, when they do not get the 
     <lb/>
     title to the lands, they receive compensa<lb break="no"/>tion instead, and therefore instead of paying 
     <lb/>
     large sums of money, which will continue to 
     <lb/>
     be paid by this government, they will have 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of the credit of the government, 
     <lb/>
     of the credit of the nation, and I claim this 
     <lb/>
     evening, Mr. Speaker, that if the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, if the nation of Canada 
     <lb/>
     were to withdraw her credit as well as 
     <lb/>
     her means from the facilities for immi<lb break="no"/>gration to these provinces, that might be 
     <lb/>
     sufficient to divert the current of immi<lb break="no"/>gration again to the country to the south of 
     <lb/>
     us, and therefore expose our provinces to 
     <lb/>
     the loss of innumerable immigrants. Sec<lb break="no"/>tion 19 reads thus :

     of all that the government of Canada can 
     <lb/>
     do with its wealth anl its credit to send 
     <lb/>
     immigrants to fill up their vacant lands. 
     <lb/>
     And when the population reaches a larger 
     <lb/>
     number this annual payment increases. 
     <lb/>
     This alone, in my judgment, is enough to 
     <lb/>
     prove to the people of the Territories that 
     <lb/>
     the government has been most careful and 
     <lb/>
     paternal in retaining the lands and under<lb break="no"/>taking the expenditure on immigration, and 
     <lb/>
     placing more money at their disposal for 
     <lb/>
     the first years—and this is most important 
     <lb/>
     —to be spent in meeting provincial require<lb break="no"/>ments. Then we have heard a great deal 
     <lb/>
     lately about the boundaries established for 
     <lb/>
     these provinces, and the government has 
     <lb/>
     been taken to task for not having extended 
     <lb/>
     the boundaries of Manitoba westward, thus 
     <lb/>
     taking from the new provinces a portion of 
     <lb/>
     their lands and a portion of their population. 
     <lb/>
     I would like to ask some of the residents of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Saskatchewan, especially 
     <lb/>
     some of the people who live on the borders 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba, and who, as is now proposed, 
     <lb/>
     will belong to the new provinces that have 
     <lb/>
     no liabilities, whether it would be more in 
     <lb/>
     their interest that they should remain in the 
     <lb/>
     new province or should join the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and share its liabilities, its finan<lb break="no"/>cial endorsements and financial responsi<lb break="no"/>bilities. I have no doubt that the 
     <lb/>people of Saskatchewan have been 
     <lb/>strongly and urgently representing to the 
     <lb/>government of Canada that they should be 
     <lb/>allowed to remain within the limits of the 
     <lb/>new province. The new provinces are going 
     <lb/>into the union without any debt, and they 
     <lb/>are to receive from the government of Can<lb break="no"/>ada half-yearly in advance interest at the 
     <lb/>rate of 5 per cent on the sum of $8,107,500, 
     <lb/>or a total of $405,170 each. The people that 
     <lb/>would be taken away from the province of 
     <lb/>Saskatchewan and added to the province of 
     <lb/>Manitoba would be deprived of the benefit 
     <lb/>of that payment, and, moreover, they would 
     <lb/>be shackled by the participation in the liabi<lb break="no"/>lities of Manitoba. I do not wonder that 
     <lb/>every member from the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories on this side of the House has been 
     <lb/>so decided and so urgent in his expressions 
     <lb/>of opinion on behalf of the people. It has 
     <lb/>been my good fortune lately to visit the dis<lb break="no"/>trict of Saskatchewan and to hear the ex<lb break="no"/>pressions of opinion by the people, in the 
     <lb/>trains and hotels and also in their homes, 
     <lb/>and I have found them practically unani<lb break="no"/>mous in the desire to be by themselves ; 
     <lb/>and they want to have two provinces, or 
     <lb/>even three provinces established. lest there 
     <lb/>should be any risk of their being joined 
     <lb/>to Manitoba. The people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>Territories are a business people, and they 
     <lb/>look at the question of provincial rights and 
     <lb/>opportunities from a business standpoint. 
     <lb/>It is not the course of a man of the 
     <lb/>Northwest to neglect any possible advant<lb break="no"/>age, for he knows that in these days he 
     <lb/>must progress rapidly if he wants to pro<lb break="no"/>gress at all. The people there understand 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
          

     the future and know the vast possiblities 
     <lb/>
     of their resources of land, forest and mines. 
     <lb/>
     The virtues of all nationalities can he use<lb break="no"/>fully combined to make that new country 
     <lb/>
     prosperous. I will not undertake to discuss 
     <lb/>
     from the legal point of view the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the Crown within the province or within the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government. I am not gifted with 
     <lb/>
     the legal training or knowledge required to 
     <lb/>
     do so. But speaking from a common sense 
     <lb/>
     point of view, I believe that every man in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest, as well as every man in the 
     <lb/>
     east, will admit that the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment has bought and paid for the lands 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest. And now, when the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada is called upon to give 
     <lb/>
     provincial rights and privileges to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the two new provinces, it is our duty 
     <lb/>
     to give them the best we know and can 
     <lb/>
     give in order to ensure their development 
     <lb/>
     and future stability and prosperity. We are 
     <lb/>
     legislating for the happiness and proseprity 
     <lb/>
     of millions of Christian and British families 
     <lb/>
     that will be there at the end of the century, 
     <lb/>
     all united in a true Canadian sentiment, and, 
     <lb/>
     as I have said, at the same time in a true 
     <lb/>
     British sentiment, which will be to our ad<lb break="no"/>vantage. In this country we do not look 
     <lb/>
     forward to independence, and much less to 
     <lb/>
     annexation ; we look for continued rela<lb break="no"/>tions with the mother country, and relations 
     <lb/>
     which will grow closer all the time. As I 
     <lb/>
     said, give us prosperity, give us trade, give 
     <lb/>
     us wheat, give us coal, give us gold, give 
     <lb/>
     us lumber in the west, and you will have a 
     <lb/>
     constantly growing sentiment of loyalty to 
     <lb/>
     the British empire all the time. We may 
     <lb/>
     expect to see, through a development of 
     <lb/>
     navigation in Hudson bay, a revolution in 
     <lb/>
     the trade and in the financial conditions of 
     <lb/>
     American and European countries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has been said that Manitoba should have 
     <lb/>
     at once an extension of territory, if not 
     <lb/>
     to the west, then to the north. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, we have a valuable country, the 
     <lb/>
     immense wealth of which is not yet 
     <lb/>
     suspected. I suspect it, perhaps, because I 
     <lb/>
     have taken an interest in it all my lifetime 
     <lb/>
     and made a lengthy visit into that country. 
     <lb/>
     I know that the people of my county take 
     <lb/>
     a great interest in that country also. It is 
     <lb/>
     my practice at home. whenever I pass by a 
     <lb/>
     school house in the county of Gloucester to 
     <lb/>
     go in and give a few words of encourage<lb break="no"/>ment to the pupils, and I always make it a 
     <lb/>
     point to call their attention to the incon<lb break="no"/>ceivable possibilities of our extensive terri<lb break="no"/>tory to the Northwest, and to inspire in their 
     <lb/>
     breasts an irresistible sentiment of pat<lb break="no"/>riotism and pride in the immense prospects 
     <lb/>
     which the development of navigation to the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson bay will open up to all the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. In regard to the extension of 
     <lb/>
     the boundaries of Manitoba, I think the 
     <lb/>
     government of this country has acted wise<lb break="no"/>ly and prudently, and that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the west will in future thank them for it, 
     <lb/>
     because that development requires further 
     <lb/>
     study. It is a question that affects not 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="4161" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-07_Page_4161.jpg"/>

     only the people of Manitoba, not only the 
     <lb/>
     people of Saskatchewan, where my children 
     <lb/>
     are living, not only the future of Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     but it is a question affecting the whole Do<lb break="no"/>minion. Therefore, every province is inter<lb break="no"/>ested and has a right to be consulted in the 
     <lb/>
     question of the extension of the boundaries 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba, inasmuch as every province 
     <lb/>
     has an interest in the opening up of a Hud<lb break="no"/>son Bay route. As the eloquent member 
     <lb/>
     for Pictou (Mr. Macdonald) pointed out last 
     <lb/>
     night, the people of the province of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick have, through their legislature, 
     <lb/>
     drawn attention to the immense accretions 
     <lb/>
     of territory that have been given to Ontario 
     <lb/>
    and Quebec, until we in the maritime pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are beginning to fear for our future 
     <lb/>representation in this parliament. While 
     <lb/>we do not wish to ask for any infringement 
     <lb/>upon the clauses of the constitution, still 
     <lb/>it is nothing but natural that we should 
     <lb/>call the attention of parliament to the result 
     <lb/>which may come about through the great 
     <lb/>influx of population into the western pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, inasmuch as that result may leave 
     <lb/>us in the future unrepresented or insuff<lb break="no"/>ciently represented in the parliament of 
     <lb/>Canada. Therefore, I think I am voicing 
     <lb/>not only my own sentiments but the senti<lb break="no"/>ments of my fellow-citizens of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick; and I believe the minister of our pro<lb break="no"/>vince, the Minister of Railways and Canals, 
     <lb/>will bear me out in this declaration that 
     <lb/>it is only natural and right that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, in its laudable desire to 
     <lb/>promote the prosperity of the people of the 
     <lb/>west, should not take a step of such vast 
     <lb/>importance without consulting the other 
     <lb/>provinces, which are all equally interested 
     <lb/>in our national development. I think, Mr. 
     <lb/>Speaker, my view is supported by the 
     <lb/>speech of the member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>(Mr. Scott), who says that the people of 
     <lb/>the eastern portion of Saskatchewan 
     <lb/>would have objected to being brought 
     <lb/>into the province of Manitoba because 
     <lb/>they would be deprived of the im<lb break="no"/>mense benefit which they will receive by 
     <lb/>remaining within the limits of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, and would be deprived in the very 
     <lb/>first year of the sum of $202,687, besides 
     <lb/>being exposed to share the debt and possibly 
     <lb/>the responsibilities of another province, 
     <lb/>which has made much progress, no doubt, 
     <lb/>but which is already calling for better 
     <lb/>terms. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I regret to 
     <lb/>have heard this evening, and on former oc<lb break="no"/>casions, the statement that the non-exten<lb break="no"/>sion of the boundaries of Manitoba was due 
     <lb/>to other reasons than the best interests of 
     <lb/>the people of the Northwest as a whole, 
     <lb/>and especially of the people of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     But this question has another aspect. A 
     <lb/>
     great deal has been said about the school 
     <lb/>
     question. I will not attempt, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     to make an appeal to your sentiment. We 
     <lb/>
     have heard very eloquent appeals in this 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
        

     House made to sentiment. We have heard 
     <lb/>
     from the member for Labelle (Mr. Bour<lb break="no"/>assa), from the Solicitor General (Mr. Le<lb break="no"/>mieux), from the member for Jacques Car<lb break="no"/>tier (Mr. Monk), not forgetting the junior 
     <lb/>
     member of this House, and from my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Beauce (Mr. Béland). These hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen have certainly delighted and as<lb break="no"/>tonished this parliament as well as their con<lb break="no"/>stituents, by their eloquence and their lofty 
     <lb/>
     sentiments. I have not had the honour nor 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of remaining in my native 
     <lb/>
     province, but I have spent thirty-three 
     <lb/>
     years of my life in another province look<lb break="no"/>ing after the interests of a people to whom I 
     <lb/>
     always speak in the language of my 
     <lb/>
     heart. If the scene of my activity has been 
     <lb/>
     laid in another sphere my sentiments have 
     <lb/>
     perhaps become more expanded, and the 
     <lb/>
     result has been no detriment to my citizen<lb break="no"/>ship as a fellow-Canadian. Meanwhile I 
     <lb/>
     have never forgotten the province of my 
     <lb/>
     birth, and I certainly desire to pay my com<lb break="no"/>pliments to the orators from Quebec who 
     <lb/>
     have preceded me on this question. If I

     have mentioned more particularly my hon. 
     <lb/>
    friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa), my hon. 
     <lb/>friend the Solicitor General (Mr. Lemieux), 
     <lb/>and my hon. friend from Jacques Cartier 
     <lb/>(Mr. Monk), none of whom, I am sorry to 
     <lb/>say, is here at the present time, it is be<lb break="no"/>cause these honourable gentlemen have 
     <lb/>been the guests of the people of my county, 
     <lb/>who have been particularly impressed with 
     <lb/>the eloquence and wisdom of their remarks, 
     <lb/>and I can assure them that all the classes 
     <lb/>of the people of the county of Gloucester, 
     <lb/>Scotch, Irish and French, still reflect upon 
     <lb/>what they have said, and still consider the 
     <lb/>counsels which have been so eloquently 
     <lb/>given them by these three honourable mem<lb break="no"/>bers. Meanwhile, as I have said, I have not 
     <lb/>forgotten my worship to my native province, 
     <lb/>nor have I forgotten the old-time loyalty and 
     <lb/>devotion of my fathers in the province of 
     <lb/>Quebec, loyalty and devotion spoken not 
     <lb/>merely by word of mouth in the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Quebec or in the public meetings 
     <lb/>of the people, but spoken in the prayers of 
     <lb/>our mothers every evening, loyalty and de<lb break="no"/>votion spoken at the altars of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian people, in the prayer of the Catholic 
     <lb/>priest and bishop rising to heaven for the 
     <lb/>maintenance of the British flag in Canada, 
     <lb/>loyalty and devotion at the call of the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish people in time of danger, whether it 
     <lb/>was a Fenian invasion or an American in<lb break="no"/>vasion in days gone by, but spoken more 
     <lb/>gloriously than ever on that memorable day, 
     <lb/>the 26th of October, 1813, on the border of 
     <lb/>Lake Champlain, when 300 French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians and 50 Scotchmen achieved the most 
     <lb/>heroic deed of modern ages, witnessed only 
     <lb/>by 7.000 American soldiers hastily retreat<lb break="no"/>ing. and the heavens above rejoicing.

     This question of education certainly re<lb break="no"/>quires the greatest wisdom on the part of

ber of this House, as it has required, no 
     <lb/>
     doubt, the greatest wisdom on the part of 
     <lb/>
     the government and on the part of the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. premier of this country. At the same 
     <lb/>
     time, what is there in it ?—a question of 
     <lb/>
     right and justice, a question settled long 
     <lb/>
     ago by the highest tribunals in the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion of Canada and the British empire, 
     <lb/>
     though a question of right, which may have 
     <lb/>
     been doubted in the early years of confe<lb break="no"/>deration when we first appealed for this 
     <lb/>
     right. It was doubted for a moment by 
     <lb/>
     ourselves in the province of New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     in the early years of confederation because 
     <lb/>
     at that time, owing to the harmonious 
     <lb/>
     relations which have existed from time 
     <lb/>
     immemorial in the maritime provinces be<lb break="no"/>tween Catholic and Protestant, Scotch, Irish 
     <lb/>
     and French Acadians, we were in the 
     <lb/>
    enjoyment of privileges the source of which 
     <lb/>we knew not. These privileges we had en<lb break="no"/>joyed through the generosity of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, but who, not being compelled to 
     <lb/>think of the future, did not insert in the 
     <lb/>constitution of their province the word 
     <lb/>'separate' or 'dissentient' or 'denomina<lb break="no"/>tional' schools and we were in a moment 
     <lb/>surprised when we were deprived of those 
     <lb/>rights. We appealed to the constitution. 
     <lb/>Every hon. member of this House, every 
     <lb/>man in Canada knows of the resolution 
     <lb/>brought into this House in 1872 by my hon. 
     <lb/>friend the member for Victoria, N.B. (Mr. 
     <lb/>Costigan) who occupies a place near to me 
     <lb/>at the present moment. My hon. friend, 
     <lb/>who has given 38 years of usefulness to the 
     <lb/>people of Canada, is the most highly res<lb break="no"/>pected and esteemed senior member of this 
     <lb/>parliament. I might say en passant that 
     <lb/>while the little province of New Brunswick 
     <lb/>has given to this House its senior member 
     <lb/>in the representative of Victoria there is 
     <lb/>also, in the other division of this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, not only the senior member of the 
     <lb/>Senate, but the senior legislator in the 
     <lb/>world in the person of Senator Wark. I 
     <lb/>said a moment ago that this was simply 
     <lb/>a question of right and justice. When we 
     <lb/>look back to the discussion in the House of 
     <lb/>Lords at the time the provinces of 
     <lb/>Canada were united into the confederation 
     <lb/>we find there not only an expression of the 
     <lb/>sentiments of the fathers of confederation 
     <lb/>but we find there especially an example of 
     <lb/>that greater generosity and justice which 
     <lb/>have always been displayed in the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Great Britain upon every occasion 
     <lb/>that the proper treatment of a great ques<lb break="no"/>tion required it. We find there the decla<lb break="no"/>ration that justice shall be given to the 
     <lb/>minority, not only to the Catholic minority 
     <lb/>but to the Protestant minority as well as 
     <lb/>the case may be. In this country where 
     <lb/>development is so rapid, where it is bound 
     <lb/>to be rapid in the future and which it is 
     <lb/>the duty of every Canadian to promote as 
     <lb/>much as possible, who will deny that per<lb break="no"/>haps in one of the provinces where to-day 
     <lb/>the majority is Protestant this condition 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
    

     may not be reversed before the end of the 
     <lb/>
     twentieth century and that in that province 
     <lb/>
     the majority of to-day will become the 
     <lb/>
     minority at the end of the century? I 
     <lb/>
     say with deliberation that these things are 
     <lb/>
     possible and I need not go out of my own 
     <lb/>
     province to find an illustration of the truth 
     <lb/>
     of what I say. It is known that in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of New Brunswick, for different rea<lb break="no"/>sons which I will not undertake to explain, 
     <lb/>
     the population has increased only, you might 
     <lb/>
     say, by the increased number of the Catho<lb break="no"/>lic people. Owing to different reasons the 
     <lb/>
     young men of English parentage, perhaps 
     <lb/>
     having more desire to see the greatness of 
     <lb/>
     the world and to seek advantages abroad, 
     <lb/>
     have gone in immense numbers to the New 
     <lb/>
     England States with the result that to-day 
     <lb/>
     we find more of the English sons of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick in the States of New England 
     <lb/>
     than we find in New Brunswick. 
     <lb/>
     The increase in population has been going 
     <lb/>
     on especially amongst the French and the 
     <lb/>
     Irish people who have kept their children 
     <lb/>
     at home. This, Sir, is a good lesson to the 
     <lb/>
     English people that the time is past when 
     <lb/>
     young Canadians require to go to a foreign 
     <lb/>
     country to seek fortune, because in the great 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories they now have a field 
     <lb/>
     for their enterprise and energy. If, for the 
     <lb/>
     next fifty years the conditions continue the 
     <lb/>
     same in New Brunswick as they have been 
     <lb/>
     for the past fifty years, then the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     people will be in the majority in that pro<lb break="no"/>vince and should that come to pass, would 
     <lb/>
     it not be wise and generous that we the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic people being in the majority should 
     <lb/>
     extend to the Protestant minority the same 
     <lb/>
     generosity and the same charity that they 
     <lb/>
     for years extended to us ? The words of 
     <lb/>
     Lord Carnarvon in the British House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords have already been quoted to this 
     <lb/>
     House, but I may be allowed to quote them 
     <lb/>
     again with the explanation that we in New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick have learned to draw from them 
     <lb/>
     lessons of charity and lessons of justice. 
     <lb/>
     Let me say that if there ever was an occa<lb break="no"/>sion for the display of charity and justice, 
     <lb/>
     it is required just now in the discussion of 
     <lb/>
     this question. The Minister of Finance (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fielding) who has inherited the eloquent 
     <lb/>
     and noble sentiments of Joseph Howe, gave 
     <lb/>
     us the history of the settlement of religious 
     <lb/>
     differences in the maritime provinces ; 
     <lb/>
     although trouble did arise in Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     and New Brunswick it was soon allayed 
     <lb/>
     through the good sense and liberality of 
     <lb/>
     the people. When men of fortitude came 
     <lb/>
     to govern in New Brunswick the province 
     <lb/>
     was again clothed in its golden mantle of 
     <lb/>
     conciliation, and harmony has prevailed 
     <lb/>
     among the people ever since. To-day we 
     <lb/>
     see the Acadian children and the Irish Catho<lb break="no"/>lic children enjoying the advantages of a 
     <lb/>
     splendid secular and religious education. 
     <lb/>
     And, Sir, the Acadian people have the same 
     <lb/>
     hope in the future of this country and are 
     <lb/>
     actuated with the same desire to share in 
     <lb/>
     its progress and prosperity as are our 
     <lb/>

     English fellow countrymen. Our Acadian 
     <lb/>
     people do not forget the memory of their an<lb break="no"/>cestors, but to-day they know that the vio<lb break="no"/>lated bell of Grand Pré will sound for ever 
     <lb/>
     throughout the world to perpetuate uni<lb break="no"/>versal sympathy for a small people deceived 
     <lb/>
     —not by the King of England, I am glad 
     <lb/>
     to say, but by a military officer acting on 
     <lb/>
     his own counsel. To-day in Acadia you do 
     <lb/>
     not hear the lamentations of the past nor 
     <lb/>
     the sobs of the Acadian women bemoaning 
     <lb/>
     the deportation of their race ; no, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, you hear the air resounding with 
     <lb/>
     the patriotic ejaculations of the Acadian 
     <lb/>
     people who are taking their place with their 
     <lb/>
     fellow countrymen of all races in this Can<lb break="no"/>adian nation, working for its welfare and 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. Let me quote the words of Lord 
     <lb/>
     Carnarvon when he introduced the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act in the House of Lords. 
     <lb/>
     He said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     In this Bill the division of powers has been 
     <lb/>
     mainly effected by a distinct classification. 
     <lb/>
     That classification is fourfold: First, those 
     <lb/>
     subjects of legislation which are attributed to 
     <lb/>
     the central parliament exclusively. Secondly, 
     <lb/>
     those which belong to the provincial legisla<lb break="no"/>ture exclusively. Third, those which are the 
     <lb/>
     subject of concurrent legislation, and fourth, a 
     <lb/>
     particular clause which is dealt with excep<lb break="no"/>tionally. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Lastly, in the 93rd clause which contains the 
     <lb/>
     exceptional provisions to which I refer, your 
     <lb/>
     lordships will observe some rather complicated 
     <lb/>
     arrangement in reference to education. I need 
     <lb/>
     hardly say that that great question gives rise 
     <lb/>
     to nearly as much earnestness and division of 
     <lb/>
     opinion on that as on this side of the Atlantic. 
     <lb/>
     This clause has been framed after long and 
     <lb/>
     anxious controversy in which all parties have 
     <lb/>
     been represented and on conditions to which all 
     <lb/>
     have given their consent. The object of the 
     <lb/>
     clause is to secure to the religious minority 
     <lb/>
     of one province the same rights, privileges 
     <lb/>
     and protection which the religious minority of 
     <lb/>
     another province may enjoy. The Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority of Upper Canada, the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant minority of Lower Canada, and the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic minority of the maritime 
     <lb/>
     provinces will thus stand on a footing of 
     <lb/>
     entire equality. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     On another occasion Lord Carnarvon in 
     <lb/>
     the House of Lords made this statement : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Hence the House will perceive that it is al<lb break="no"/>most impossible for any injury to be done 
     <lb/>
     to the Protestant minority. The real question 
     <lb/>
     at issue between the Protestant and Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic community is the question of educa<lb break="no"/>tion, and the 93rd clause after a long con<lb break="no"/>troversy in which the views of all parties have 
     <lb/>
     been represented, has been framed. The object 
     <lb/>
     of that clause is to govern against the pos<lb break="no"/>sibility of the members of the minority suf<lb break="no"/>fering from undue pressure by the majority. 
     <lb/>
     It has been framed to place all the mino<lb break="no"/>rities of whatever religion on the same footing, 
     <lb/>
     and that, whether the minorities are in in esse 
     <lb/>
     or in posse.

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     I call the attention of the House to these 
     <lb/>
     words ' in esse' and 'in posse ;' whether to<lb break="no"/>day it is a Catholic minority, or to-morrow 
     <lb/>
     a Protestant minority. We have the judg<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
          

     ment of our courts to guide us in the solu<lb break="no"/>tion of the meaning of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, which seems to be so mis<lb break="no"/>understood by certain members of this 
     <lb/>
     House and by certain papers in Ontario. In 
     <lb/>
     the New Brunswick school case, the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada refused to entertain the 
     <lb/>
     resolution brought by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Victoria (Mr. Costigan) in 1872, request<lb break="no"/>ing in the name of the Catholic minority of 
     <lb/>
     that province that the government of Can<lb break="no"/>ada should exercise their veto against the 
     <lb/>
     provincial Act passed in 1871 which took 
     <lb/>
     away from the Catholic minority these ex<lb break="no"/>tensive privileges of which I have spoken. 
     <lb/>
     I must acknowledge that members on both 
     <lb/>
     sides of the House on that occasion expres<lb break="no"/>sed the greatest sympathy with the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member (Mr. Costigan) and with the Catho<lb break="no"/>lic minority in his province. But it was 
     <lb/>
     found on both sides of the House that under 
     <lb/>
     the clause relating to education in the con<lb break="no"/>stitution, the government of Canada had not 
     <lb/>
     the power to declare the New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     law of 1871 ultra vires or not efficient. 
     <lb/>
     After the refusal of the parliament of Can<lb break="no"/>ada to interfere on the ground of the consti<lb break="no"/>tution, the Catholic minority appealed to 
     <lb/>
     the highest court of the province, the <choice><sic>Sup<lb break="no"/>preme</sic><corr>Supreme</corr></choice> Court of New Brunswick, at that 
     <lb/>
     time the highest Canadian court for them, 
     <lb/>
     because the Supreme Court of Canada was 
     <lb/>
     not yet in existence. It may be necessary 
     <lb/>
     for me to give some preliminary explanation 
     <lb/>
     of the school laws of the province of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, so that I may be better under<lb break="no"/>stood when I give the quotations from the 
     <lb/>
     judgment of the Supreme Court of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick on the question. I will only 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the calm facts of history which 
     <lb/>
     will show that that enlightened judgment 
     <lb/>
     has afforded lessons to the Catholic minority 
     <lb/>
     as well as to the Protestant majority of the 
     <lb/>
     province of New Brunswick, and will speak 
     <lb/>
     to the intelligence and heart of every mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this House and every Canadian. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It might be of interest that I should men<lb break="no"/>tion at once that previous to the time of 
     <lb/>
     confederation and after, and still at the 
     <lb/>
     time our appeals were under the consider<lb break="no"/>ation of the high tribunals, the province of 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick had two classes of edu<lb break="no"/>cational institutions, both administered un<lb break="no"/>der provincial statutes by the one board of 
     <lb/>
     education, inspected by the common provin<lb break="no"/>cial inspector, both receiving state aid or 
     <lb/>
     government subsidies for their maintenance 
     <lb/>
     and support. The general class of edu<lb break="no"/>cational institutions was composed chiefly 
     <lb/>
     of rural districts, I may say, and of the 
     <lb/>
     population of the outskirts of a city, town 
     <lb/>
     or village. The more particular class of 
     <lb/>
     educational institutions was extended to 
     <lb/>
     the population of the cities, of the towns 
     <lb/>
     or large villages and to these particular 
     <lb/>
     schools greater privileges had been con<lb break="no"/>ferred, accordingly favourable to the reli<lb break="no"/>gious conditions of the people for whose 
     <lb/>
     children these schools were particularly in<lb break="no"/>

tended, and in which religious instruction 
     <lb/>
     was, by law, given according to the tenets 
     <lb/>
     of their faith. As I stated a while ago, 
     <lb/>
     the former class extended to the rural dis<lb break="no"/>tricts, it more particularly carried on the 
     <lb/>
     supervision of elementary education and 
     <lb/>
     was administered under an enactment of 
     <lb/>
     1858 called the Parish School Act, which 
     <lb/>
     was superseded in 1871 by an Act called 
     <lb/>
     the Common Schools Act. It was against 
     <lb/>
     this new law that the Catholics appealed 
     <lb/>
     to the Supreme Court. Let  me say also 
     <lb/>
     that it had been the expectation of the 
     <lb/>
     fathers of confederation and of the British 
     <lb/>
     parliament that the first clause upon edu<lb break="no"/>cation applied to all the schools, or classes 
     <lb/>
     of schools in New Brunswick, so strong, so 
     <lb/>
     general, was the prevailing opinon that the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority enjoyed denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools in every respect, an opinion created 
     <lb/>
     by the prevalent harmonious relations of 
     <lb/>
     the people of different races and creeds in 
     <lb/>
     the maritime provinces. But upon investiga<lb break="no"/>tion by the courts it was found that the 
     <lb/>
     liberties enjoyed by the Catholics of New

     Brunswick were not granted by the said 
     <lb/>
     Parish School Act of 1858, but had come 
     <lb/>
     into existence owing to what may legally 
     <lb/>
     be termed irregularities, or laxities in the 
     <lb/>
     administration of the law. The decisions 
     <lb/>
     of the Privy Council and of the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court of New Brunswick maintained that 
     <lb/>
     the Parish School Act, 1858, did not refer to 
     <lb/>
     denominational schools, and therefore this 
     <lb/>
     Act being superseded by the Public Schools 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1871, no denominational rights could 
     <lb/>
     be  affected so long as there were none in 
     <lb/>
     existence by law. These judgments were 
     <lb/>
     based on the assumption that denomination<lb break="no"/>al privileges or rights in existence 
     <lb/>
      before the union were inalienable. These 
     <lb/>
     tribunals searched in the Parish School Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1858 for the existence of such rights as 
     <lb/>
     claimed by the Catholics which might have 
     <lb/>
     been affected by the new Act of 1871, but 
     <lb/>
     failed to find them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I wish to lay stress on this point that 
     <lb/>
     evidently the judges of the Supreme Court 
     <lb/>
     of New Brunswick before writing their de<lb break="no"/>cision had come to the unanimous convic<lb break="no"/>tion that the 1st section of clause 93 of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act did apply 
     <lb/>
     to any province in which a class of per<lb break="no"/>sons enjoyed denominational principles in 
     <lb/>
     the schools. I wish to lay stress on this 
     <lb/>
     point that the Supreme Court did search 
     <lb/>
     the existence of any such rights, under the 
     <lb/>
     common understanding that should any 
     <lb/>
     such rights be found to exist, the court 
     <lb/>
     was bound by the terms of the section to 
     <lb/>
     see them restored. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I wish to lay stress also upon this point 
     <lb/>
     that had an appeal been made at the time 
     <lb/>
     against principles enjoyed by different 
     <lb/>
     classes of persons in the schools of the 
     <lb/>
     other classification to which I referred, the 
     <lb/>
     Supreme Court expressed their readiness 
     <lb/>
     jealously to protect them.

            <cb/>
           
 <p>
     For an illustration of this statement I 
     <lb/>
     wish to quote from the judgment of the 
     <lb/>
     Supreme Court of Canada, given in Feb<lb break="no"/>ruary, 1873, in the case of ex parte Renaud 
     <lb/>
     and others, as it is called. The judges, 
     <lb/>
     after having looked into the particulars of 
     <lb/>
     the case, said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     It is contended, that the rights and privileges 
     <lb/>
     of the Roman Catholic inhabitants of this 
     <lb/>
     province, as a class of persons, have been 
     <lb/>
     prejudicially affected by the Common Schools 
     <lb/>
     Act, 1871, contrary to the provisions of sub<lb break="no"/>section 1 of section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. We have now to determine 
     <lb/>
     whether any class of persons had, by law, 
     <lb/>
     in this province, any right or privilege with 
     <lb/>
     respect to denominational schools at the union, 
     <lb/>
     which are prejudicially affected by the Com<lb break="no"/>mon Schools Act of 1871. This renders it 
     <lb/>
     ncessary that we should, with accuracy and 
     <lb/>
     precision, ascertain exactly what the state of 
     <lb/>
     the law was with reference to denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools, and the rights of classes of persons 
     <lb/>
     in respect thereto, at the union. At that time, 
     <lb/>
     what may fairly and legitimately be called 
     <lb/>
     the common school system of the province, 
     <lb/>
     was carried on under an Act passed in the 21st 
     <lb/>
     Vic., c. 9,  intituled ' An Act relating to Parish 
     <lb/>
     Schools.' There were no doubt, at the same 
     <lb/>
     time in existence, in addition to the schools 
     <lb/>
     established under the Parish School Act, 
     <lb/>
     schools of an unquestionably denominational 
     <lb/>
     character, belonging to, and under the im<lb break="no"/>mediate government and control of particular 
     <lb/>
     denominations.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And in which, there can be no doubt, it may 
     <lb/>
     reasonably be inferred, the peculiar doctrines 
     <lb/>
     and tenets of the denominations to which they 
     <lb/>
     respectively belong were exclusively taught, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore had, what may rightly be esteem<lb break="no"/>ed, all the characteristics of denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools, pure and simple. We do not here re<lb break="no"/>fer  to collegiate institutions, which it has been 
     <lb/>
     strongly, and with great force, urged were not 
     <lb/>
     within the contemplation of the imperial par<lb break="no"/>liament, or intended to  be affected by the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Act, 1867, but we refer to 
     <lb/>
     such schools as the Wesleyan Academy, Sack<lb break="no"/>ville, as incorporated by the 12th Victoria, 
     <lb/>
     chapter 65, amended by 19th Victoria, chapter 
     <lb/>
     65, a corporation entirely distinct in law, as we 
     <lb/>
     presume also, in fact, from the college which 
     <lb/>
     the trustees of that academy are authorized to 
     <lb/>
     found and establish under the 21st Victoria, 
     <lb/>
     chapter 57, an institution entirely under the 
     <lb/>
     control of the Wesleyan denomination, and in 
     <lb/>
    which, or in any department thereof, or 
     <lb/>in any religious service held upon the 
     <lb/>said premises, it is enacted that no per<lb break="no"/>son shall teach, maintain, promulgate or 
     <lb/>enforce any religious doctrine or practice con<lb break="no"/>trary to what is contained in certain notes on 
     <lb/>the New Testament, commonly reputed to be

     that the Catholics of New Brunswick at that

     When England granted responsible gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to the people of Canada, she granted 
     <lb/>
     it to the full extent with all its privileges, 
     <lb/>
     with full liberty, civil, political and religi<lb break="no"/>ous. And what to-day is the brightest jewel

     enthusiasm ? Take from that flag the 
     <lb/>
     jewel of religious liberty and what is left 
     <lb/>
     in it more than in the similar emblem of any 
     <lb/>
     other nation. Religious liberty has been 
     <lb/>
     granted with full generosity by the British 
     <lb/>
     parliament and the British people. I refer 
     <lb/>
     not to men like the editors of the Toronto 
     <lb/>
     ' World ' and ' News.' I mean the British 
     <lb/>
     people ! That great people in giving 
     <lb/>
     religious liberty, did not take back 
     <lb/>
     with one hand what they granted with 
     <lb/>
     the other, but gave it with an open 
     <lb/>
     hand, with a generous heart and with 
     <lb/>
     best wishes for her subjects dispersed 
     <lb/>
     over the whole universe. Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     claim that the question before us is merely 
     <lb/>
     a question of justice and right—undoubtedly 
     <lb/>
     right. And we know that the people in the 
     <lb/>
     minority in the districts of these new prov<lb break="no"/>inces, whether Catholic or Protestant, ex<lb break="no"/>pect the same right and the same educa<lb break="no"/>tional advantages as they possess to-day. We 
     <lb/>
     have there not only French Canadian Catho<lb break="no"/>lic people, but Scotch and Irish Catholics. 
     <lb/>
     We have also Germans of the Catholic faith 
     <lb/>
     who give good service to Canada and are 
     <lb/>
     equal to any other class of our people. We 
     <lb/>
     have the German Protestants, who are the 
     <lb/>
     equals of any other class in this country 
     <lb/>
     and who deserve to be protected in their 
     <lb/>
    rights. As I have said, we need in this 
     <lb/>country the virtues of every nation. We 
     <lb/>need in Canada, and particularly in the 
     <lb/>Northwest, a combination of the best peo<lb break="no"/>ple to build up that new country. To de<lb break="no"/>velop its resources the valour and activity 
     <lb/>of the Frenchman will not alone suffice. 
     <lb/>We require also the steady, dogged perse<lb break="no"/>verance of the Scotchman who can follow his 
     <lb/>plough from sunrise to sunset, preparing 
     <lb/>the land for a crop which, repeated on 
     <lb/>thousands of farms, will make that vast 
     <lb/>country in fact the granary of the British 
     <lb/>empire. And these people coming to the 
     <lb/>Northwest will expect a continuance of the 
     <lb/>liberties and privileges which they find es<lb break="no"/>tablished there by law. I have spoken of 
     <lb/>the German people. I say that the German 
     <lb/>Protestant people are as jealous of their 
     <lb/>religious education and their separate schools 
     <lb/>as are the French or Irish or German 
     <lb/>Catholics. In the few weeks that I spent 
     <lb/>in the Northwest I devoted my time from 
     <lb/>morning till night to making myself ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with the people. I have met some 
     <lb/>of these Germans, both Protestants and 
     <lb/>Catholics, and that at a time when 
     <lb/>the discussion of this Bill was on the 
     <lb/>lip of every citizen of the Northwest 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
        

     and these German people, both Protestants<lb/>and Catholics, have said to me that they 
     <lb/>
     hoped that the new Bill would secure to them 
     <lb/>
     the separate schools which they have to<lb break="no"/>day in the Northwest. As I have said, the 
     <lb/>
     district in which the minority is Catholic 
     <lb/>
     to-day may have a Catholic majority in the 
     <lb/>
     future, or vice versa. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron) whose coun<lb break="no"/>tenance has drawn him towards me lately, 
     <lb/>
     has claimed that the educational clauses as 
     <lb/>
     they appear in this Bill do not give much 
     <lb/>
     to the Catholic minority of the new prov<lb break="no"/>inces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I admit that if we were granted more we 
     <lb/>
     would not object to it. At the same time, 
     <lb/>
     I may tell my hon. friend that I am one of 
     <lb/>
     those who suffered for years in the struggle 
     <lb/>
     of the Catholic minority in New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     to support separate schools. For a long 
     <lb/>
     time our schools were practically closed, 
     <lb/>
     and we were paying, not only our own 
     <lb/>
     school tax without enjoying schools at all, 
     <lb/>
     but we were paying the public school tax, 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic population, especially on the 
     <lb/>
     north shore of New Brunswick, being among 
     <lb/>
     the poorest class of the people. I may be 
     <lb/>
     permitted to say to the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Beauharnois that perhaps if he had gone 
     <lb/>
     through the same experience he would bet<lb break="no"/>ter appreciate the liberty and the rights 
     <lb/>
     which are granted by this very Act. It 
     <lb/>
     grants to the Catholic minority in any dis<lb break="no"/>trict the right to have their separate schools 
     <lb/>
     supported by public money as well as the 
     <lb/>
     public schools in the same district or in 
     <lb/>
     other districts. It gives them the right to 
     <lb/>
     engage a Catholic teacher ; it also gives 
     <lb/>
    them the right to require the teacher, dur<lb break="no"/>ing that half hour, to teach the catechism 
     <lb/>or to give religious instruction to the Catho<lb break="no"/>lic children. That is not all we want, but 
     <lb/>we have there both the right to separate 
     <lb/>schools and the means to support them ; 
     <lb/>and for my part, Mr. Speaker, I value high<lb break="no"/>ly the fact alone that we have the means 
     <lb/>to support a school. In the interest of my 
     <lb/>own Catholic people I do not want to see 
     <lb/>a school that is not efficient, and a school 
     <lb/>cannot be efficient unless you have the 
     <lb/>means to make it so. If you do not give 
     <lb/>them the money to support the school, what 
     <lb/>other privilege will be of any value to them ? 
     <lb/>I think any one who has given some atten<lb break="no"/>tion to public instruction and to the educa<lb break="no"/>tion of his children will appreciate that 
     <lb/>fact. We want first of all the means. When 
     <lb/>the teacher has been engaged he is under a 
     <lb/>contract, and it is his duty to give to the 
     <lb/>children a religious education during that 
     <lb/>half hour. He has also the duty, during 
     <lb/>the rest of the day, of supervising the edu<lb break="no"/>cation of the Catholic children in the classes, 
     <lb/>and this is a point in which my hon. friend 
     <lb/>from Beauharnois is equally interested 
     <lb/>with myself. The influence of the teacher 
     <lb/>is there all day long, his guardianship is 
     <lb/>there all the time that the children are re<lb break="no"/>ceiving education in other branches as well 
     <lb/>as in religion ; the child is receiving lessons

     in geography, lessons in arithmetic, along 
     <lb/>
     with his catechism and his holy scripture. 
     <lb/>
     When we have the young well educated in 
     <lb/>
     Christian morals and doctrine, as well as in 
     <lb/>
     secular matters, we can rely on the future 
     <lb/>
     of the country. When the Catholic minori<lb break="no"/>ty come to the parliament of Canada and 
     <lb/>
     ask them to favour the sacred traditions of 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic people for religious instruction 
     <lb/>
     to a certain extent, they ask for it in the 
     <lb/>
     name of their conscience, but they ask for 
     <lb/>
     it also for the benefit of Canadian society. 
     <lb/>
     The more religious instruction you give to 
     <lb/>
     the child the better citizen you make of 
     <lb/>
     him. And we want in this country good 
     <lb/>
     citizens, people who will not live in idle<lb break="no"/>ness ; we want the child, along with his 
     <lb/>
     secular education, to receive a good moral 
     <lb/>
     tuition and a good Christian tuition. As 
     <lb/>
     long as we ask for that in the name of con<lb break="no"/>science, why, in the name of the British 
     <lb/>
     flag, should you not give it to us ? We are 
     <lb/>
     asking nothing from the Protestant majori<lb break="no"/>ty alongside of us, we are only asking for 
     <lb/>
     the right to use our own money in order to 
     <lb/>
     educate our own children, so that they may 
     <lb/>
     become true Canadian citizens. We know 
     <lb/>
     from experience that other denominations 
     <lb/>
     do not hold the same view with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of religious instruction in the 
     <lb/>
     schools, and we do not object to that. yet 
     <lb/>
     this Bill gives to the Protestant majority 
     <lb/>
     and the Protestant minority the same privi<lb break="no"/>lege of giving religious instruction to their 
     <lb/>
     children during the half hour. I know there 
     <lb/>
     is scarcely a Christian mother in the western 
     <lb/>
     provinces who does not wish her child to 
     <lb/>
     receive a Christian education. I met the 
     <lb/>
     Christian mother in the Northwest. She 
     <lb/>
     spoke to me her love of her children and 
     <lb/>
     her devotion to their welfare and happiness. 
     <lb/>
     She spoke to me of her attachment 
     <lb/>
     to the religious education of her children, 
     <lb/>
     and her desire that they should re<lb break="no"/>ceive a good moral education at the same 
     <lb/>
     time, in order that they might grow up to be 
     <lb/>
     honest and useful citizens. We must re<lb break="no"/>member that civilization carries with it 
     <lb/>
     some dangers which only a Christian edu<lb break="no"/>cation can counteract, and without such 
     <lb/>
     Christian education the result will be dis<lb break="no"/>astrous, not only to the family, but to soci<lb break="no"/>ety in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, I think I have estab<lb break="no"/>lished in a most irrefutable manner that 
     <lb/>
     the people who go into the Northwest pro<lb break="no"/>vinces have a right to enjoy the same privi<lb break="no"/>leges that they received at home. I regret 
     <lb/>
     as much as does the member for Beauhar<lb break="no"/>nois that our Catholic people are not ac<lb break="no"/>corded still greater privileges than will be 
     <lb/>
     given them under this law. But the con<lb break="no"/>stitution allows us to grant only what we 
     <lb/>
     now possess, and what we hold now we are 
     <lb/>
     bound to guarantee by this Autonomy Bill. 
     <lb/>
     It is not a question of political power for this 
     <lb/>
     parliament, it is a question of granting school 
     <lb/>
     privileges to the minority in the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. In 1875, when the parliament of 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
          

     Canada decided unanimously to give separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools to the people of the Northwest, 
     <lb/>
     the parliament had power to make them 
     <lb/>
     lasting. In 1875, when the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada gave to 'that class of persons,' to 
     <lb/>
     use the language of the judgment of the 
     <lb/>
     Supreme Court of New Brunswick, rights 
     <lb/>
     and privileges in regard to educational mat<lb break="no"/>ters in the Northwest Territories, it gave 
     <lb/>
     them for ever. To-day this parliament is 
     <lb/>
     not confronted with a question of whether or 
     <lb/>
     not it has power to do a certain thing ; it is 
     <lb/>
     confronted with a simple duty to preserve 
     <lb/>
     the rights established by the Act of 1875. 
     <lb/>
     Parliament had the power at that time, as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Blake plainly stated. Mr. Blake's lan<lb break="no"/>guage has already been quoted in this 
     <lb/>
     House, but I may be permitted to read it 
     <lb/>
     again :

     The task which the ministry had set for 
     <lb/>
     itself was the most important it was possible 
     <lb/>
     to conceive. To found primary institutions 
     <lb/>
     under which we hope to see hundreds of thou<lb break="no"/>sands, and the more sanguine of us think, mil<lb break="no"/>lions of. men and families settled and flourish<lb break="no"/>ing, was one of the noblest undertakings that 
     <lb/>
     could be entered upon by any legislative body, 
     <lb/>
     and it was no small indication of the power 
     <lb/>
     and true position of this Dominion that parlia<lb break="no"/>ment should be engaged to-day in that impor<lb break="no"/>tant task. He agreed with the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Kingston (Sir John A. Macdonald) that 
     <lb/>
     the task was one that required time, consider<lb break="no"/>ation and deliberation, and they must take care 
     <lb/>
     that no false steps were made in such a work. 
     <lb/>
     He did not agree with that right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man that the government ought to repeal his 
     <lb/>
     errors. The right hon. gentleman had tried 
     <lb/>
     the institutions for the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     which he now asked the House to frame, and 
     <lb/>
     for the same reason as he had given to-day— 
     <lb/>
     that it would be better for the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to keep matters in their own hands 
     <lb/>
     and decide what was best for the future. He 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Blake) believed that it was essential to 
     <lb/>
     our obtaining a large immigration to the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest that we should tell the people 
     <lb/>
     beforehand what those rights were to be in the 
     <lb/>
     country in which we invited them to settle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He regarded it as essential, under the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances of the country, and in view or 
     <lb/>
     the deliberation during the last few days, that 
     <lb/>
     a general principle should be laid down in the 
     <lb/>
     Bill with respect to public instruction. He 
     <lb/>
     did believe that we ought not to introduce into 
     <lb/>
     that territory the heart burnings and difficulties 
     <lb/>
     with which certain other portions of the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion and other countries had been afflicted. 
     <lb/>
     It seemed to him, having regard to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that, as far as we could expect at present, 
     <lb/>
     the general character of that population would 
     <lb/>
     be somewhat analogous to the population of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, that there should be some provision in 
     <lb/>
     the constitution by which they should have 
     <lb/>
     conferred upon them the same rights and pri<lb break="no"/>vileges in regard to religious instruction as 
     <lb/>
     those possessed by the people of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario. The principles of local self-gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and the settling of the question of 
     <lb/>
     public instruction seemed to him ought to be 
     <lb/>
     the cardinal principles or the measure. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     At that time it was within the power of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion parliament to grant or not to

     grant these privileges. But now, they have 
     <lb/>
     been granted, the people have had them in 
     <lb/>
     their possession and the people who are to<lb break="no"/>day looking towards the Northwest, towards 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces from Germany, as well 
     <lb/>
     as from Scotland, England and other coun<lb break="no"/>tries expect to have the religious teaching 
     <lb/>
    which they desire. Therefore, this is not a 
     <lb/>mere question of power ; it is a matter of 
     <lb/>duty for us in this parliament to see that the 
     <lb/>minority coming to Canada shall have the 
     <lb/>institutions which they desire and to which 
     <lb/>they are entitled. We cannot afford to de<lb break="no"/>stroy the credit of Canada for the sake of 
     <lb/>half an hour's religious teaching in the 
     <lb/>schools of the Northwest. But, it is said that 
     <lb/>some people are opposed to it. Well, we can 
     <lb/>only call upon the people of difierent classes 
     <lb/>in this Dominion of ours with all its possi<lb break="no"/>bilities and with all its generosity to set an 
     <lb/>example in speech and in action to those few 
     <lb/>people who cannot possibly comprehend the 
     <lb/>reason why the Catholic people, as well as 
     <lb/>a great many Protestant people, are asking 
     <lb/>to have this privilege granted to the minori<lb break="no"/>ties in the western Territories. If I thought 
     <lb/>there were people in this Dominion who 
     <lb/>required any further persuason in order 
     <lb/>to induce them to take a broad and liberal 
     <lb/>view of this question I would perhaps recall 
     <lb/>the words of Joseph Howe. He described 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia as the frontage of the whole 
     <lb/>British North American continent whose 
     <lb/>harbours, citadel and arsenal were not made 
     <lb/>for Nova Scotia alone but were designed by 
     <lb/>nature for the common benefit of herself 
     <lb/>and of her sister provinces. I would ask my 
     <lb/>hon. friend the Minister of Finance (Mr. 
     <lb/>Fielding) to go down to Nova Scotia with 
     <lb/>his following and there call upon the gener<lb break="no"/>ous people of that province to break open 
     <lb/>the gate of that arsenal where the senti<lb break="no"/>ments of generosity, mutual forbearance 
     <lb/>and Christian charity have been stored since 
     <lb/>the days of Huntingdon, Uniacke, Young 
     <lb/>and Johnson, to be dispersed by the breezes 
     <lb/>and conveyed to those centres where the 
     <lb/>Toronto ' World ' or the ' News ' may yet 
     <lb/>have some influence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     It has been said that the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral (Sir William Mulock) and the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Customs (Mr. Paterson) will have 
     <lb/>
     to face their constituents in the future. 
     <lb/>
     It has been said that great excitement 
     <lb/>
     exists in the constituency of the Post<lb break="no"/>master General, and that the same responsi<lb break="no"/>bility attaches to the Minister of Customs. 
     <lb/>
     For my part I would ask them to go before 
     <lb/>
     their constituents and ask them what crime 
     <lb/>
     they have committed in having been inspired 
     <lb/>
     and guided by that spirit of religious freedom 
     <lb/>
     that has spread over Ontario, Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces. I would ask them to 
     <lb/>
     go and tell their constituents what they 
     <lb/>
     have done. But, Mr. Speaker, similar 
     <lb/>
     charges were made against the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
     not very long ago. It was said that when 
     <lb/>
     these same hon. gentlemen and their follow<lb break="no"/>ers went before the people they would stay 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
          

     at home, but they have gloriously come back 
     <lb/>
     and I believe they will again gloriously 
     <lb/>
     come back. It. has been said also that the 
     <lb/>
     venerated, esteemed, and beloved premier 
     <lb/>
     of this country will pay the penalty of his 
     <lb/>
     courage in extending the religious liberty 
     <lb/>
     which now prevails in other parts of Can<lb break="no"/>ada to the Northwest Territories. The same 
     <lb/>
     threat has been made before. Still men 
     <lb/>
     like Balfour and Joseph Chamberlain did 
     <lb/>
     listen and bow to the word of Mr. Laurier. 
     <lb/>
     These hon. gentlemen opposite may again 
     <lb/>
     make threats in this House and throughout 
     <lb/>
     this country. Still, Mr. Speaker, the shades 
     <lb/>
     of William Ewart Gladstone, Daniel O'Con<lb break="no"/>nell,' Edmund Burke, and Robert Peel awake 
     <lb/>
     to the name of Wilfrid Laurier, and with 
     <lb/>
     a fraternal smile invite him to share with 
     <lb/>
     them in history, a common glory acquired in 
     <lb/>
     the work of a common cause—the emancipa<lb break="no"/>tion and the unity of races, the harmony of 
     <lb/>
     creeds, the blending of the noble sentiments 
     <lb/>
     of fraternity and charity on this continent 
     <lb/>
     of America, the greatest country of Christian 
     <lb/>
     civilization. The generations of the future 
     <lb/>
     which are coming in the immense chariot of 
     <lb/>
     commercial and industrial genius to settle 
     <lb/>
     along our national highways, to develop the 
     <lb/>
     abundant surrounding resources, when in 
     <lb/>
     contact with each other in that endless tur<lb break="no"/>moil of business, as in New York, Buffalo 
     <lb/>
     and other industrial centres of the United 
     <lb/>
     States, will merely pause a moment in their 
     <lb/>
     felicity to proclaim aloud that this irre<lb break="no"/>sistible activity which carries them to 
     <lb/>
     and fro is the work of a Canadian whose 
     <lb/>
     name was Wilfrid Laurier ; and the Chris<lb break="no"/>tian mothers of Alberta and Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan will bless the name of the man who 
     <lb/>
     has given them true British religious free<lb break="no"/>dom for the education of their children.

     <persName ref="pers:TALB2">Mr. PETER TALBOT</persName> (Strathcona). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I regret very much that it is con<lb break="no"/>sidered necessary at this late hour to con<lb break="no"/>tinue the debate, but I believe there 
     <lb/>
    are so many hon. members who will 
     <lb/>speak on this question that it is neces<lb break="no"/>sary to go on. The discussion of 
     <lb/>this Bill has already taken up considerable 
     <lb/>time, and I suppose almost every argument 
     <lb/>that could be used in favour of the Bill or 
     <lb/>in favour of the amendment moved by the 
     <lb/>leader of the opposition has already been 
     <lb/>advanced. As a resident of the Northwest 
     <lb/>Territories it has been very pleasing to me 
     <lb/>to notice that almost every hon. member 
     <lb/>who has spoken, has admitted that this Bill 
     <lb/>is a most important one, and that on this 
     <lb/>legislation will depend in a great measure 
     <lb/>not only the future prosperity of the new 
     <lb/>provinces but the prosperity of the whole 
     <lb/>Dominion. I maintain, Sir, that anything 
     <lb/>that tends to mar the harmony or interfere 
     <lb/>with the prosperity or check the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of these new provinces will be in<lb break="no"/>jurious to the whole of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>Before dealing with the main features of 
     <lb/>the measure I shall touch briefly on a few 
     <lb/>

     of the minor points. The government has 
     <lb/>
     been criticised in some quarters for pro<lb break="no"/>posing that there should be tw0 provinces 
     <lb/>
     instead of only one. As a resident of these 
     <lb/>
     Territories I admit that it would be very 
     <lb/>
     pleasant for us to feel that we had the ban<lb break="no"/>ner province of the Dominion, that we over<lb break="no"/>shadowed our lesser neighbours, and that 
     <lb/>
     the time would come when we would wield 
     <lb/>
     a tremendous influence in the affairs of the 
     <lb/>
     nation. But in the business things of life 
     <lb/>
     there is more to be considered than senti<lb break="no"/>ment. I maintain that that immense terri<lb break="no"/>tory would be too much for any single pro<lb break="no"/>vincial government to handle. We know that 
     <lb/>
     when the premier of a province is forming 
     <lb/>
     his cabinet he takes his ministers from dif<lb break="no"/>ferent, parts of the province, but in the case 
     <lb/>
     of such an immense area as that of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories this would be utterly 
     <lb/>
     impossible. It is quite true that for some 
     <lb/>
     years past we have had an honest and a 
     <lb/>
     fairly capable government in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories but settlement is increasing, the 
     <lb/>
     population is getting larger, and I venture 
     <lb/>
     to assert that there are portions of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories that for the last two 
     <lb/>
     or three years have not been quite satisfied. 
     <lb/>
    I am sure that the people of the Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan district and northern Alberta would 
     <lb/>have been better satisfied if they had had 
     <lb/>a representative in the cabinet. Then, again, 
     <lb/>some objection has been taken to the divid<lb break="no"/>ing line placing the fourth initial meridian 
     <lb/>as the boundary between the two provinces, 
     <lb/>but I believe that very good reasons can be 
     <lb/>given for the selection of that line. In the 
     <lb/>first place, it divides the Territories almost 
     <lb/>exactly in two, making the areas of the two 
     <lb/>provinces practically the same, and in the 
     <lb/>second place that line will be much more con<lb break="no"/>venient in describing property, &amp;c., as it is 
     <lb/>the beginning of a new range. To my mind 
     <lb/>the only objection that can be offered at all 
     <lb/>to selecting that line, is, that it divides the 
     <lb/>ranching country, but I maintain that no 
     <lb/>matter where the line is drawn between 
     <lb/>these two provinces it would interfere with 
     <lb/>some particular interest. Even if the di<lb break="no"/>viding line were placed 60 miles further 
     <lb/>east it would still divide the ranching coun<lb break="no"/>try. I anticipate very little trouble from 
     <lb/>the clashing of herd laws or the branding 
     <lb/>regulations. The stockmen of southern Al<lb break="no"/>berta and of western Assiniboia will still 
     <lb/>have common interests, and even with the 
     <lb/>two provinces their associations will still 
     <lb/>continue to do the work they have been 
     <lb/>doing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I have been pretty severely criticised my<lb break="no"/>self in some quarters, because I favoured 
     <lb/>
     the selection of the city of Edmonton for 
     <lb/>
     the temporary capital of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Alberta. Now, Sir, I want to say that if I 
     <lb/>
     considered my personal interests in this 
     <lb/>
     matter I would have advocated the selection 
     <lb/>
     of the town near which I reside and in which 
     <lb/>
     my interest lies. But I knew that at least 
     <lb/>
     75 per cent of the constituents whom I repre<lb break="no"/>
   

            <cb/>
     

     sent were in favour of having Edmonton as 
     <lb/>
     the capital and considered its claims as the 
     <lb/>
     best, and I thought it my duty to advocate 
     <lb/>
     what they desire rather than to look for my 
     <lb/>
     own selfish interests. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, we come to one of the 
     <lb/>
     most important features at this Bill, the one 
     <lb/>
     relating to the ownership of the lands. These 
     <lb/>
     residents of the proposed provinces who 
     <lb/>
     look on this question from a sentimental 
     <lb/>
     point of view only will no doubt favour pro<lb break="no"/>vincial ownership, but I am convinced that 
     <lb/>
     the practical men who consider the future 
     <lb/>
     prosperity of not only the new provinces but 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion as a whole, will be perfectly 
     <lb/>
     satisfied to have the land administered by 
     <lb/>
     the federal government. We in the west 
     <lb/>
     believe that the present remarkable pros<lb break="no"/>perity of the west is due mainly to the tide 
     <lb/>
     of immigration that is flowing to that part 
     <lb/>
     of the country, and we further believe that 
     <lb/>
     the immigrants that are going to the west 
     <lb/>
     are induced to do so chiefly by the offer of 
     <lb/>
     free lands. What is the policy of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition with respect to immigration ? I sup<lb break="no"/>pose the member for Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) 
     <lb/>
     has given expression to that policy, and on 
     <lb/>
     page 3542 of ' Hansard ' he says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     If the new provinces were possessed of their 
     <lb/>
     own public lands, they would be the most inter<lb break="no"/>ested of all in encouraging immigration to 
     <lb/>
     come within their bounds. We should have 
     <lb/>
     three local governments all hard at work try<lb break="no"/>ing to bring in immigration, and all competing 
     <lb/>
     with each other for immigration. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

   
            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, we would have not 
     <lb/>
     only three local governments competing for 
     <lb/>
     immigration ; we would have no less than 
     <lb/>
     six. We would have the province of Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, Ontario and Quebec. What would be 
     <lb/>
     the condition of things if we had six immi<lb break="no"/>gration departments each sending out litera<lb break="no"/>ture describing its own particular advant<lb break="no"/>ages, and each sending its agents to different 
     <lb/>
     parts of the world ? It would not only be 
     <lb/>
     very expensive but it would be confusing, 
     <lb/>
     and you would have jealousy and quarreling 
     <lb/>
     amongst them, the effect of which would 
     <lb/>
     be to sever rather than to unite the differ<lb break="no"/>ent classes out of which we hope to make 
     <lb/>
     a united Canada. I am proud to be a 
     <lb/>
     resident of the proposed province of Alberta 
     <lb/>
     and I have unbounded faith in the future 
     <lb/>
     of that province, but at the same time I 
     <lb/>
     think it is best for Canada as a whole and 
     <lb/>
     best for Alberta, that the immigration liter<lb break="no"/>ature should go out from the government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, that our immigration agents in 
     <lb/>
     the different parts of the world should be 
     <lb/>
     Canadian agents, and that the immigrants 
     <lb/>
     who come to this country should be guided 
     <lb/>
     by Canadian officials. I would dislike very 
     <lb/>
     much to see any great change made in the 
     <lb/>
     immigration policy of the government. 
     <lb/>
     Those of us who lived in the west before 
     <lb/>
     that policy was inaugurated know only too 
     <lb/>
     well the condition of affairs at that time. 
     <lb/>

     We have seen the settlers who were there 
     <lb/>
     load their few effects on prairie schooners 
     <lb/>
     and drive out to the country ; we have seen 
     <lb/>
     deserted homesteads by the score ; we have 
     <lb/>
     seen merchants close their doors and leave 
     <lb/>
     the country; we have seen settlers on the 
     <lb/>
     verge of starvation; we have seen honest, 
     <lb/>
     industrious men forced to appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     government for assistance and we have seen 
     <lb/>
     improved farms sold in that western coun<lb break="no"/>try at from one dollar to three dollars per 
     <lb/>
     acre. No sooner was the present immigration 
     <lb/>
     policy adopted and the late Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior (Mr. Sifton) placed in charge of 
     <lb/>
     immigration affairs than a change took 
     <lb/>
     place. Settlers began to flock into the 
     <lb/>
     country and to afford a market for what the 
     <lb/>
     earlier settlers had produced. Other mar<lb break="no"/>kets were opened up. The merchants began 
     <lb/>
     to thrive. The price of land rose quickly 
     <lb/>
     from $3 to $4, from $4 to $5, from $5 to $6, 
     <lb/>
     &amp;c., in many localities as high as $30 per 
     <lb/>
     acre has been paid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think the west is practically solid in 
     <lb/>
     requesting that no change be made in the 
     <lb/>
     immigration policy. I was pleased a few 
     <lb/>
     days ago to hear the hon. the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General pay a high compliment to the late 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior, and I want to as<lb break="no"/>sure that hon. gentleman that he was 
     <lb/>
     only voicing the sentiments of the west 
     <lb/>
     when he said the resignation of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior was little short of a national 
     <lb/>
     calamity. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another reason why it is best 
     <lb/>
     for the federal government to administer 
     <lb/>
     those lands. It may not be considered a 
     <lb/>
     good reason by some, but I think the ex<lb break="no"/>perience of most of the other provinces will 
     <lb/>
     give some weight to it. It is this. We 
     <lb/>
     might at some future time have a careless 
     <lb/>
     or extravagant government in one or both 
     <lb/>
     of the new provinces. If such a thing 
     <lb/>
     did happen our resources would rapidly 
     <lb/>
     disappear and we might in a very few 
     <lb/>
     years be compelled to appeal to extensive 
     <lb/>
     direct taxation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is still another serious obstacle in 
     <lb/>
     the way of the provinces administering the 
     <lb/>
     land. Some years ago very extensive 
     <lb/>
     grants of those lands were made to various 
     <lb/>
     corporations, railway companies and coloni<lb break="no"/>zation companies. Now it happens that 
     <lb/>
     when those corporations selected their 
     <lb/>
     lands they chose the greater portion of it 
     <lb/>
     in the proposed province of Alberta. So, 
     <lb/>
     if the provinces received the lands within 
     <lb/>
     their own borders, they would not receive 
     <lb/>
     equal shares and an injustice would be 
     <lb/>
     done to the province of Alberta. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some hon. gentlemen on the other side 
     <lb/>
     of the House would like to make the pub<lb break="no"/>lic believe that all the lands in these vast 
     <lb/>
     areas are agricultural lands. Such is far 
     <lb/>
     from being the case. In fact only a small 
     <lb/>
     portion of those lands will ever be fit for 
     <lb/>
     agricultural purposes. Many millions of 
     <lb/>
     acres are under water. Millions more con<lb break="no"/>sist of muskeg and slough, while millions 
     <lb/>
           


            <cb/>
         

     more are sand hills and barren. There is 
     <lb/>
     no doubt there is an immense quantity of 
     <lb/>
     good agricultural land in the country but 
     <lb/>
     it is only a fraction of the whole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, what does federal administration of 
     <lb/>
     these lands mean to the provinces ? In the 
     <lb/>
     first place, the provinces really get half 
     <lb/>
     the land, or all the even-numbered sections. 
     <lb/>
     These sections are reserved for free home<lb break="no"/>steads. Until entered for we have the use 
     <lb/>of them. Our stock will graze on those 
     <lb/>pastures. As soon as entered for, they 
     <lb/>become the property of our citizens who 
     <lb/>pay us taxes. And even with regard to the 
     <lb/>odd-numbered sections the same reasoning 
     <lb/>may apply because we hope that those may 
     <lb/>soon be thrown open for settlement at a 
     <lb/>low price. In the second place, we get 
     <lb/>this land administered for us free of 
     <lb/>charge. In the third place, we have an 
     <lb/>energetic immigration policy of a national 
     <lb/>character carried on for us without ex<lb break="no"/>pense. In the fourth place, we get an 
     <lb/>annual subsidy, increasing as our popula<lb break="no"/>tion increases and sufficiently large to 
     <lb/>put us on a par fianancially with the most 
     <lb/>favoured of the other provinces. If all the 
     <lb/>members of the opposition would be as 
     <lb/>frank and as candid as the hon. member 
     <lb/>for Beauharnois, they would say with him, 
     <lb/>that as far as the financial terms are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, the government has treated the 
     <lb/>new provinces not only with fairness but 
     <lb/>with generosity.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to dwell on 
     <lb/>
     the other very important question involved 
     <lb/>
     in this Bill. It is certainly quite true, that 
     <lb/>
     the education question is a dangerous one 
     <lb/>
     to deal with. This question nearly pre<lb break="no"/>vented coufederation. It caused the down<lb break="no"/>fall of one federal government and our 
     <lb/>
     friends in the opposition fondly hope that 
     <lb/>
     it will cause the downfall of another in the 
     <lb/>
     not distant future. Nearly every province 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion has experienced difficulty 
     <lb/>
     in dealing with this vexed question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I will not attempt to deal with the consti<lb break="no"/>tutional question involved in this Bill. I have 
     <lb/>
     had no legal training and I frankly admit 
     <lb/>
     my inability to grapple with a question on 
     <lb/>
     which the best legal talent in Canada fail 
     <lb/>
     to agree. I want to say that in 1892 I gave 
     <lb/>
     this question a good deal of thought. I 
     <lb/>
     read over the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     and the Northwest Territory Act of 1875. 
     <lb/>
     and I came to the conclusion that whatever 
     <lb/>
     privileges the minority had when we be<lb break="no"/>came a province these privileges would have 
     <lb/>
     to be continued. That conclusion may have 
     <lb/>
     been wrong, but I arrived at it notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the fact that I was then, as I am 
     <lb/>
     LOW, strongly opposed to separate schools in 
     <lb/>
     the usual sense of the term. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If I understand this Bill in its present 
     <lb/>
     form, it provides that the minority, either 
     <lb/>
     Protestant or Roman Catholic, shall con<lb break="no"/>tinue to have the privileges they now have 
     <lb/>
     under the provisions of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories Ordinances of 1901. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<p>
     Now, Sir, I maintain that before we 
     <lb/>
     undertake to pronounce judgment on this 
     <lb/>
     Bill we should have a fair understanding 
     <lb/>
     of the school system in use in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories under the provisions of those 
     <lb/>
     ordinances. It is only natural that when the 
     <lb/>
     people of Ontario hear the term 'separate 
     <lb/>
     schools' they should think of the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools as they exist in that province. 
     <lb/>
     When the people of Manitoba hear the ex<lb break="no"/>pression 'separate schools' they think of the 
     <lb/>
     inefficient schools which they abolished in 
     <lb/>
     1890. I feel sure that if the people of the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces understood our school sys<lb break="no"/>tem there would not be a great deal or op<lb break="no"/>position to the educational clause of this 
     <lb/>
     Bill in its present form. I believe the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the west are willing to give to any 
     <lb/>
     minority any privilege to which they can 
     <lb/>
     show a claim, and they will give it the 
     <lb/>
     more cheerfully and criticise it the less close<lb break="no"/>ly because in this case it not only does not 
     <lb/>
     injure, but it increases the usefulness 
     <lb/>
     of our school system. Our schools are in 
     <lb/>
     truth national schools. No religious sect, 
     <lb/>
     no denomination, no association, no society 
     <lb/>
     has anything to do directly or indirectly 
     <lb/>
     with the secular education of the children 
     <lb/>
     attending any of our schools. They are 
     <lb/>
     completely and absolutely under the control 
     <lb/>
     of the government. In all our schools the 
     <lb/>
     same course of studies is followed. Practi<lb break="no"/>cally the same text books are used. The 
     <lb/>
     teachers have to pass the same examinations 
     <lb/>
     and get the same training at the same nor<lb break="no"/>mal school. All have the same holidays and 
     <lb/>
     vacations, and all undergo the same rigid 
     <lb/>
     inspection and the government grant is ap<lb break="no"/>portioned to all the same basis. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I desire to read a few short extracts from 
     <lb/>
     the School Ordinance that applies in this 
     <lb/>
     case. Section 4 reads as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The department shall have the control and 
     <lb/>
     management of all kindergarten schools, public 
     <lb/>
     and separate schools, normal schools, teachers' 
     <lb/>
     institutes, and the education of deaf, deaf mute 
     <lb/>

     Now, these are the sections in the North 
     <lb/>
     west Territories Ordinances, 1901, that ap<lb break="no"/>ply in this case. I am not going to enter 
     <lb/>
     into a discussion on the advisability of 
     <lb/>
     having religious instruction in schools, but 
     <lb/>
     it is a well—known fact that many Protest<lb break="no"/>ants as well as Roman Catholics desire to 
     <lb/>
     have some religious instruction given in 
     <lb/>
     the schools. Now, to meet the wishes of 
     <lb/>
     such people as these, we permit the giving 
     <lb/>
     of religious instruction in the schools from 
     <lb/>
     3.30 to 4 o'clock in the afternoon. In this 
     <lb/>
     we treat all alike, all schools have the same 
     <lb/>
     privilege. Separate schools will not be 
     <lb/>
     formed unless the trustees of a public school 
     <lb/>
     try to deprive the minority of their right 
     <lb/>
     in this respect. Let us suppose a case. 
     <lb/>
     Suppose that in a certain district a major<lb break="no"/>ity of the people are Roman Catholics and 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic trustees are elected. They 
     <lb/>
     will, we suppose, engage a Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     teacher. They will request or instruct him 
     <lb/>
     to give religious instruction in that school 
     <lb/>
     after 3.30 o'clock. The Protestant children 
     <lb/>
     of course are allowed to go home. If the 
     <lb/>
     parents or trustees of these children desire 
     <lb/>
     that their children should have religious in<lb break="no"/>struction in that school, they will no doubt 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the trustees and ask that they 
     <lb/>
   

            <pb n="4183" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-07_Page_4183.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">4184</fw>
         

     be given a certain number of afternoons for 
     <lb/>
     that purpose. If the trustees refuse, then 
     <lb/>
     they will probably form a separate school. 
     <lb/>
     In practice, trouble never arises; we have 
     <lb/>
     no trouble in the west in that way, the 
     <lb/>
     trustees always agree and they have dif<lb break="no"/>ferent days for giving religious instruction 
     <lb/>
     for the different denominations. The trus<lb break="no"/>tees have in all cases for years been able 
     <lb/>
     to come to an agreement. No separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, either Protestant or Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic, have been organized for the last three 
     <lb/>
     or four years, and even some that we had 
     <lb/>
     previous to 1901 have become disorganized. 
     <lb/>
     In 1901, there were 14 Roman Catholic sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools In the Northwest Territories; 
     <lb/>
     to-day there are only 10. We in the west 
     <lb/>
     were boasting that we had solved this vexed 
     <lb/>
     problem. The Roman Catholic laity are 
     <lb/>
     perfectly satisfied, as far as I can learn, 
     <lb/>
     and there is no complaint from the Protest<lb break="no"/>ant majority. We are bringing together the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant and Roman Catholic children for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of secular education to an extent 
     <lb/>
     never before known anywhere in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Some ask the question: have you separate 
     <lb/>
     schools at all? To these I would say that 
     <lb/>
     as far as secular education is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     we have not, and for sectarian education 
     <lb/>
     we have. Now, I think that is right. It 
     <lb/>
    leaves the secular education with the state 
     <lb/>and the sectarian education, where it be<lb break="no"/>longs, with the church and with the home. 
     <lb/>If this plan which has worked so successful<lb break="no"/>ly in the west for years be not adopted, what 
     <lb/>alternative have we ? We are asked by 
     <lb/>some to refer the matter to the courts and 
     <lb/>to allow them to decide what is the right 
     <lb/>of the minority. Now, it is just possible, in 
     <lb/>my mind, that the courts may decide that 
     <lb/>the minority are entitled to the rights 
     <lb/>which they had by the provisions of the 
     <lb/>Northwest Territories Act of 1875, and if 
     <lb/>that were the case, we would have saddled 
     <lb/>upon us a dual system of schools which 
     <lb/>would be as unsatisfactory to the Roman 
     <lb/>Catholic minority as it would be to the 
     <lb/>Protestant majority. Personally, I prefer to 
     <lb/>take no risks, especially since granting what 
     <lb/>is asked does not interfere with the useful<lb break="no"/>ness of our present school system. Then 
     <lb/>we are asked by others to leave this ques<lb break="no"/>tion entirely with the new provinces. For 
     <lb/>my part, I would be quite willing to do 
     <lb/>this. I feel sure that the governments in 
     <lb/>the provinces would be sensible enough to 
     <lb/>continue the present system, in fact, I have 
     <lb/>heard nearly all the members of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent legislature of the Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies express themselves as opposed to making 
     <lb/>any change. The premier of the Northwest 
     <lb/>Territories quite recently said that if he 
     <lb/>had the power to-morrow he would not 
     <lb/>change the present system. But we all 
     <lb/>know how at any time an agitation may be 
     <lb/>started and how the minority might then 
     <lb/>be deprived of the privileges which they 
     <lb/>have. If that were the case, we would 
     <lb/>then be confronted by a serious evil. If 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
        

     the Roman Catholic minority were deprived 
     <lb/>
     of the privileges they now have, what would 
     <lb/>
     they do ? They would do Just as they have 
     <lb/>
     done in hundreds of cases in the past. They 
     <lb/>
     would build, equip, and patronize church 
     <lb/>
     schools. These schools would have to be 
     <lb/>
     supported by them and they would also be 
     <lb/>
     compelled to pay their taxes to the public 
     <lb/>
     or common school. They would thus be 
     <lb/>
    paying double taxes, and in many 
     <lb/>cases that would be a hardship to 
     <lb/>them. But that is not the worst 
     <lb/>feature of the case to my mind. The worst 
     <lb/>feature is that since the government did not 
     <lb/>support or assist these church schools it 
     <lb/>would have no control over even the secular 
     <lb/>education given in them. Now I am so 
     <lb/>strongly in favour of the state having abso<lb break="no"/>lute control of the secular education of the 
     <lb/>children who are to become citizens of that 
     <lb/>state that I am willing to deprive the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of the power of making the mistake 
     <lb/>of totally abolishing separate schools. If 
     <lb/>separate schools were abolished in the new 
     <lb/>provinces by law we might have a condition 
     <lb/>of affairs similar to that which exists in the 
     <lb/>maritime provinces. We were told a few 
     <lb/>evenings ago by the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>(Mr. Fielding) the condition that exists in 
     <lb/>those provinces. In localities where there is 
     <lb/>a considerable number of Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>separate schools do exist by practice if they 
     <lb/>do not by law. There you find Roman 
     <lb/>Catholic children in one school and Protest<lb break="no"/>ant children in another ; you find Roman 
     <lb/>Catholic teachers in one school and Protest<lb break="no"/>ant teachers in another ; you have in effect 
     <lb/>separate schools there by practice if not by 
     <lb/>law. Now to my way of thinking our 
     <lb/>system is far ahead of that. Some have 
     <lb/>compared the action of the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment in this case to the action of the federal 
     <lb/>government in 1896. But I do not think the 
     <lb/>cases are at all similar. Then the federal 
     <lb/>government tried to force an obnoxious law 
     <lb/>upon an unwilling people ; now the federal 
     <lb/>government is merely asking the Northwest 
     <lb/>to continue a system that passed its 
     <lb/>legislature unanimously and was accept<lb break="no"/>ed by the people and has proved for 
     <lb/>years to be thoroughly efficient. And, 
     <lb/>further, it is a law which, we all 
     <lb/>admit, the people of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>would themselves adopt if it were left 
     <lb/>to their own free choice. I have no hesita<lb break="no"/>tion in saying—and I say it after an experi<lb break="no"/>ence of twenty-five years teaching in the 
     <lb/>public schools of Ontario and the North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>west—that we have a system of elementary 
     <lb/>education inferior to none in Canada. And 
     <lb/>I wish to say further that our system is 
     <lb/>more thoroughly a national system than 
     <lb/>even that of the United States. Our gov<lb break="no"/>ernment has absolute control of the secular 
     <lb/>education of a larger percentage 01' the 
     <lb/>children than has the government of any 
     <lb/>state of the American union, where they 
     <lb/>boast of their national schools. Let me 
     <lb/>quote an extract from a standard work.

     Now, Mr. Speaker, I think that speak:

     well for our system as compared with What

     they have. In the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     to-day we have practically every child re<lb break="no"/>ceiving his secular education under the

     Hon. H. R. EMMERSON (Minister of Rail<lb break="no"/>ways and Canals) moved for leave to in<lb break="no"/>troduce Bill (No. 132) to amend the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment Railways Act. He said: There is 
     <lb/>
     legislation before the House with reference 
     <lb/>
     to the transfer of the Canada Atlantic Rail<lb break="no"/>way system to the Grand Trunk Railway 
     <lb/>
     Company of Canada, and by which legis<lb break="no"/>lative authority is sought to conclude the 
     <lb/>
     transaction. It was deemed advisable by 
     <lb/>
     the government in the public interest that 
     <lb/>
     notice should be given to the panties before 
     <lb/>
     this legislative authority is granted that 
     <lb/>
     certain running powers should be reserved 
     <lb/>
     over the Canada Atlantic Railway system 
     <lb/>
     for the government system of railways. 
     <lb/>
     The proposal in this Bill is to reserve run<lb break="no"/>ning powers for the Intercolonial Railway 
     <lb/>
     system and for any extension of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment railway system over the line from 
     <lb/>
     Montreal to Coteau and over the main trunk 
     <lb/>
     line of the Canada Atlantic Railway and 
     <lb/>
     all its branches. This Bill provides that the 
     <lb/>
     government shall have the right to run 
     <lb/>
     through freight and passenger trains and 
     <lb/>
     to do a local passenger business over this 
     <lb/>
     line. It is provided also that the compen<lb break="no"/>sation which shall be paid by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment to the Grand Trunk Railway for this 
     <lb/>
     privilege shall be determined by the Rail<lb break="no"/>way Commission, from which there shall 
     <lb/>
     be an appeal to the Supreme Court of Can<lb break="no"/>ada. Under the Railway Act, 1903, an ap<lb break="no"/>peal from the decision of the Railway Com<lb break="no"/>mission would lie to the Governor in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil, but as the government system of rail<lb break="no"/>ways would be under the control and man<lb break="no"/>agement of the Governor in Council, it 
     <lb/>
     would be anomalous that the appeal of one 
     <lb/>
    'of the parties should go before that tri- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
