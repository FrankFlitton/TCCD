<head rendition="simple:centre">REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF <lb/>
COMMONS. <lb/></head> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">The PRIME MINISTER</persName> (Rt. Hon. Sir <lb/>
Wilfrid Laurier) moved the second reading <lb/>
of Bill (No. 66) to readjust the representa<lb break="no"/>tion in the House of Commons. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). I think <lb/>
it well, before this motion carries, to call <lb/>
to the attention of my right hon. friend <lb/>
(Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier) one or two <lb/>
points respecting the character of this Bill <lb/>
concerning which, it seems to me, there is <lb/>
some misapprehension in the country, and, <lb/>
possibly, in the mind of my right hon. friend. <lb/>
The exact meaning of the Bill may not be <lb/>
quite understood. <lb/></p> 

<p>We were told by the Prime Minister on <lb/>
the first reading of the Bill, that this proposal <lb/>
is the same as that which was made in <lb/>


<cb/>

Great Britain in 1884. I wish to point out <lb/>
to the House that what was proposed in <lb/>
Great Britain in 1884, was something entirely <lb/>
different. In saying so I do not put it by <lb/>
way of criticism on the present action of the <lb/>
government nor do I say now that what the <lb/>
government has proposed is lacking in fair<lb break="no"/>ness. I simply want to have in the mind of <lb/>
the House and of the country a clear idea of <lb/>
what the position of the government is at <lb/>
the present time. In 1884, in the British <lb/>
House, there was a conference between the <lb/>
political parties before the Bill was intro<lb break="no"/>duced at all. The conference was not a <lb/>
formal one; the members were not ap<lb break="no"/>pointed by the House and had no duty of <lb/>
reporting to the House. Their work was <lb/>
altogether of an informal character. It was, <lb/>
in fact, a conference between the two <lb/>
political parties. Mr. Mills, now Mr. Jus<lb break="no"/>tice Mills, who was in this House in 1892 <lb/>
made that very clear in his remarks. He <lb/>
said, referring to the British measure: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The measure was submitted to parliament af<lb break="no"/>ter the leaders of the two parties had agreed <lb/>
upon it. . . . The English government entered <lb/>
into a conference with their political opponents <lb/>
on the character of a measure which they were <lb/>
to submit to parliament, and to assume the <lb/>
responsibility for, and that was done prior to <lb/>
the submission of the Bill to parliament for <lb/>
discussion. <lb/></p> </quote>
 
 

<p>In the Annual Register which was referred <lb/>
to at that time there is a history of the intro<lb break="no"/>duction of the English measure which makes <lb/>
this abundantly clear. This history can be <lb/>
found at pages 252 and 253 of the Annual <lb/>
Register of 1884—at page 252 we find: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>During the next fortnight— <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>—that is while the conference was going <lb/>
on— <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>—the process of arrangement was steadily pur<lb break="no"/>sued. Lord Salisbury and Sir S. Northcote at<lb break="no"/>tended the meetings of the cabinet, and con<lb break="no"/>ducted the negotiations with the specially se<lb break="no"/>lected delegates of that body. Naturally there <lb/>
were rumours of misunderstandings more or <lb/>
less serious, but as time wore on, it was clear, <lb/>
from the public utterances of those in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to know the real facts, that the basis of the <lb/>
compromise was never in jeopardy, and that the <lb/>
ultimate decision on all questions of detail <lb/>
would have to be left to parliament. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>And then, at page 253 it is said: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>At length after a week's adjournment, both <lb/>
Houses reassembled, and Mr. Gladstone, in a <lb/>
very brief speech altogether without rhetorical <lb/>
display and sympathetic enthusiasm, presented <lb/>
to the House of Commons the results of the <lb/>
negotiations, and moved for leave to bring in a <lb/>
Bill dealing with the most crucial party rights <lb/>
and susceptibilities which had been settled out<lb break="no"/>side the arena of parliamentary conflict. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>There is another fact which I would like <lb/>
to point out to my right hon. friend, and <lb/>
it is this—the conference of 1884 in Great <lb/>
Britain simply settled the principles to be <lb/>
applied in the work of redistribution, and <lb/>
left those principles to be carried out in the <lb/>
delimitation of the constituencies by a boun<lb break="no"/>

dary commission. A boundary commission <lb/>
was appointed, composed of eminent men, <lb/>
including among its members several offi<lb break="no"/>cers of the Royal Engineers whose technical <lb/>
knowledge was supposed to be valuable <lb/>
in such work. It is true that the Bill pro<lb break="no"/>vided that in Yorkshire, Glasgow, Birming<lb break="no"/>ham and other large boroughs, a certain <lb/>
number of members should be allowed, just <lb/>
as our constitution allows a certain propor<lb break="no"/>tion of members for Ontario, Nova Scotia <lb/>
and the other provinces. But, except for <lb/>
this, the entire work of the delimitation of <lb/>
the constitutencies was left to the com<lb break="no"/>mission. Moreover, the present proposition <lb/>
does not seem in line with the position taken <lb/>
by my right hon. friend (Rt. Hon. Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>frid Laurier) in 1882. His motion on that <lb/>
occasion, to which he has drawn attention <lb/>
is as follows: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>That Bill (No. 76) an Act to readjust the re<lb break="no"/>presentation in the House of Commons be re<lb break="no"/>ferred to a conference or committee to be com<lb break="no"/>posed of both political parties, to agree upon <lb/>
the lines or principles on which a Redistribu<lb break="no"/>tion Bill should be drawn. <lb/></p> </quote>
 
 

<p>My right hon. friend was more in line with <lb/>
the English precedent at that time than he is <lb/>
at the present time, became his proposal <lb/>
then was that a committee should be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed composed of both political parties to <lb/>
agree upon the lines or principles upon <lb/>
which a redistribution Bill should be drawn. <lb/>
I may say that that motion as interpreted <lb/>
by a prominent member of his own party, <lb/>
now Mr. Justice Davies, of the Supreme <lb/>
Court, was understood to be a motion that <lb/>
the committee should merely settle the lines <lb/>
or principles, and should leave it to the <lb/>
House to settle the boundaries of the con<lb break="no"/>stituencies themselves; because Mr. Davies, <lb/>
in speaking on the second reading of the <lb/>
Bill, and speaking after my right hon. <lb/>
friend, used the following language: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>My hon. friend's motion is based exactly up<lb break="no"/>on that section of the constitution. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>I may say in passing, that Mr. Davies: <lb/>
was arguing very strenuously that parlia<lb break="no"/>ment itself had no right to delimit the con<lb break="no"/>stituencies, but that that duty should be <lb/>
imposed by parliament upon some independ<lb break="no"/>ent body. So Mr. Davies continued: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>He says—— <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>That is referring to my right hon. friend, <lb/>
then the leader of the opposition. <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>He says let us come together now and <lb/>
agree upon these lines, and when we are agreed <lb/>
upon the lines and upon the manner, then let <lb/>
us legislate and enact a law, and when we <lb/>
have carried the principle into law, let us ap<lb break="no"/>point the authorities who are to apply the <lb/>
principles to the condition of the country and <lb/>
carry them out. I say that in principle, and <lb/>
from historic precedents, and by the legal con<lb break="no"/>struction of the British North America Act, <lb/>
this proposition of the leader of the opposition <lb/>
is one which I think must commend itself to the <lb/>
minds, at any rate, of the legal members of <lb/>
the House. I cannot see, based as it is upon <lb/>
justice and equality, how it can fail to commend <lb/>

<cb/>

itself not only to the sense of fair play, but to <lb/>
the common sense of all the members of this <lb/>
House. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Then I would like to point out to my <lb/>
right hon. friend that his present proposi<lb break="no"/>tion is not in line with the view which he <lb/>
took in 1899, for he then said: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Whenever a county has to be divided into <lb/>
ridings, whenever a county which up to that <lb/>
time is entitled to one member, becomes en<lb break="no"/>titled to two or three members, the division <lb/>
should take place by judicial decision and au<lb break="no"/>thority. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>That is the second principle upon which <lb/>
he based the Bill that he then introduced to <lb/>
the House. <lb/></p> 

<p>Therefore I submit with all deference <lb/>
to the Prime Minister that the pro<lb break="no"/>posal which is now before the House is <lb/>
not the same as the English proposal of <lb/>
1884, it is not the same as the proposal of <lb/>
the right hon. gentleman in 1892, and it is <lb/>
not the same as the proposal of the right <lb/>
hon. gentleman in 1899. However, it must <lb/>
be admitted, Mr. Speaker, that it does not <lb/>
at all follow that this is not a perfectly <lb/>
fair proposition. All I am desirous of point<lb break="no"/>ing out at the present time is that it is not <lb/>
any one of the proposals which have been <lb/>
made on the three occasions to which I have <lb/>
referred. <lb/></p> 

<p>Well, what have we to say about the <lb/>
Bill which is before us? In the first place, <lb/>
I may say a word to those who have <lb/>
thought it remarkable that the members of <lb/>
the Conservative party have not burst out <lb/>
into a chorus of congratulation to the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment upon the introduction of this Bill. <lb/>
I want to point out to my right hon. friend <lb/>
that one very good reason why we should <lb/>
restrain our congratulations at the present <lb/>
time is that we have not the real Bill be<lb break="no"/>fore us. As was well said by Mr. McCarthy <lb/>
in 1892, the whole force, the whole vitality <lb/>
of a Bill of this character is to be found <lb/>
in the details. Now we have the mere <lb/>
skeleton of a Bill at the present time, we <lb/>
have nothing except the bare formal parts <lb/>
of the Bill, and we are not prepared to pro<lb break="no"/>nounce any opinion at all upon that which <lb/>
we have not yet seen. I admit that a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment desiring to introduce a perfectly <lb/>
fair Redistribution Bill—and I accept in the <lb/>
fullest sense my right hon. friend's assur<lb break="no"/>ance of that desire—I say that a government <lb/>
desirous of introducing the fairest possible <lb/>
Redistribution Bill, might adopt this course: <lb/>
and I say also that a government which de<lb break="no"/>sired to introduce a Bill that was not fair <lb/>
in the ordinary sense of the term, might <lb/>
adopt exactly the same course, and place <lb/>
before the proposed committee schedules <lb/>
which might just as well have been attached <lb/>
to the Bill itself. I am not suggesting that <lb/>
that is the intention of the government, but <lb/>
I am pointing out that at the present time <lb/>
we have not in the Bill anything but a mere <lb/>
skeleton, and we do not know whether the <lb/>
proposal of the government will be a fair <lb/></p>

<fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">1212</fw> 

<p>one or an unfair one until their proposal has <lb/>
been placed before the committee, and we <lb/>
have had an opportunity of judging. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, I think what I have said was em<lb break="no"/>phasized in a very striking manner by Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy in 1892. In referring to the pro<lb break="no"/>posal made at that time by my right hon. <lb/>
friend he said: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Even if there had been a conference in that <lb/>
way I do not see what particular benefit could <lb/>
have resulted because the conference, repre<lb break="no"/>senting as it was suggested it should, the ma<lb break="no"/>jority and the minority according to numbers <lb/>
in this House, would, unless they agreed, have <lb/>
merely reproduced the scheme of the majority. <lb/>
It would merely have reproduced the scheme <lb/>
which the government have now presented and <lb/>
which this House, representing in the same way <lb/>
the same proportion of numbers, will ultima<lb break="no"/>tely adopt. <lb/></p> </quote>
 
 

<p>That is the criticism which I would make <lb/>
upon this proposal in so far as it contemplates <lb/>
a conference or committee. If it is intended <lb/>
to produce an agreement such as was <lb/>
arrived at in 1884, if it is proposed to adopt <lb/>
the same principle which was acted on by the <lb/>
English government at that time, it seems to <lb/>
me that the proposal of my right hon. friend <lb/>
should have been a proposal for a com<lb break="no"/>mittee composed of an equal number of <lb/>
members from each side, a proposal which <lb/>
would not reflect the numerical strength of <lb/>
either party in this House, instead of the <lb/>
present one which in the end must merely <lb/>
result, or might merely result in reproducing <lb/>
to the House the scheme of the majority, <lb/>
as Mr. McCarthy remarked in 1892. Now <lb/>
my right hon. friend has assured me that <lb/>
no schedules or maps have been prepared, <lb/>
or at least that they have not been finally <lb/>
prepared. Of course we have heard a great <lb/>
many rumours to the contrary, some of these <lb/>
rumours appear to be well founded; but <lb/>
again I say I accept, as far as my right <lb/>
hon. friend is concerned, in the fullest sense <lb/>
his assurance, nor am I making any reser<lb break="no"/>vation in a parliamentary sense. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now there is another observation I would <lb/>
make, which is that no principle whatever <lb/>
has been announced by my right hon. friend <lb/>
in introducing this Bill, beyond this. He <lb/>
says: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The guiding principle in this redistribution <lb/>
should be that county boundaries should be pre<lb break="no"/>served, that the municipal representation of <lb/>
the county ought to he the basis of the par<lb break="no"/>liamentary representation. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>My right hon. friend has not made any <lb/>
reference whatever to equality of population, <lb/>
although he laid a good deal of stress upon <lb/>
that in his speech of 1892. I would like <lb/>
to point out to him that in Great Britain <lb/>
in 1884 very full rules were laid down, and <lb/>
among them were these: in the first place <lb/>
equality of population; in the next place <lb/>
retaining in the divisions any particular <lb/>
portion of the population which was of an <lb/>
urban character, that, is in the divisions of <lb/>
boroughs; in the third place, compactness <lb/>
of divisions with respect to geographical <lb/>
 

<cb/>

position; in the fourth place, community <lb/>
of interests. I think some of those, at least, <lb/>
require to be regarded to a considerable <lb/>
extent in the work of the committee, and <lb/>
perhaps it would have been better if my <lb/>
right hon. friend had introduced some of <lb/>
these principles into this Bill or into his <lb/>
speech. <lb/></p> 

<p>There is another principle which was laid <lb/>
down by my right hon. friend in 1892, and <lb/>
to which I would invite his attention now. <lb/>
In speaking upon the second reading of the <lb/>
Bill at that time, he said: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>What I propose to the sense of justice and <lb/>
every man in this House is that this applica<lb break="no"/>tion of the law should be made in such a man<lb break="no"/>ner that both parties shall remain with the <lb/>
same advantage they now possess. <lb/></p> </quote>
 
 

<p>I am not at all clear how it would be <lb/>
possible to work out a principle of that kind <lb/>
in framing schedules for a Bill of this char<lb break="no"/>acter, but at all events it is a principle <lb/>
upon which my right hon. friend very <lb/>
strongly relied in 1892, and it is one which <lb/>
it is proper for me now to bring to his <lb/>
attention. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, I have one more remark, and it is in <lb/>
respect of the criticism which my right hon. <lb/>
friend made of the Act of 1892. In speaking <lb/>
on the first reading of this Bill, he named <lb/>
forty-two constituencies in the province of <lb/>
Ontario which, he said, had elected twenty-<lb break="yes"/>five Conservatives and only seventeen Lib<lb break="no"/>erals, and notwithstanding that fact, the <lb/>
vote for the seventeen Liberals was greater <lb/>
in number than the vote for the twenty-five <lb/>
Conservatives. My right hon. friend seems <lb/>
to regard that as a complete argument to <lb/>
show that the Bill of 1892 was unfair to the <lb/>
Liberal party. Well, now, I have been fur<lb break="no"/>nished with a list of certain constituencies <lb/>
in the province of Ontario which produce an <lb/>
exactly opposite result. Take the constitu<lb break="no"/>encies of West Bruce, South Brant, South <lb/>
Essex, Glengarry, Haldimand, East Huron, <lb/>
West Huron, South Huron, Kingston, West <lb/>
Lambton, West Middlesex, South Middle-<lb break="yes"/>sex, West Northumberland, South Ontario, <lb/>
West Ontario, Ottawa, South Oxford, South <lb/>
Perth, East Peterborough, Prescott, North <lb/>
Renfrew, South Renfrew, North Simcoe, <lb/>
Wentworth and Brant, North York—Here <lb/>
you have twenty-five constituencies with a <lb/>
popular vote for the Liberal party of 52,098 <lb/>
which returned twenty-five Liberal members <lb/>
at the last general election. Now, take <lb/>
seventeen Conservative constituencies which <lb/>
returned Conservatives at the last general <lb/>
election. Cornwall and Stormont, East Elgin, <lb/>
East Grey, Hamilton, Hamilton, Middle-<lb break="yes"/>sex East, East Toronto, West Toronto, <lb/>
Centre Toronto, East York, West York, East <lb/>
Lambton, Lincoln and Niagara, Muskoka and <lb/>
Parry Sound, North Perth, East Simcoe, <lb/>
South "Waterloo—Here you have constituen<lb break="no"/>cies which returned seventeen Conservatives <lb/>
by a popular vote of 53,962, or some <lb/>
1,900 more than the total number of <lb/>
votes cast for twenty-five Liberal members. <lb/></p>

<fw type="num">1213</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 14, 1903</fw> <fw type="num">1214</fw> 

<p>Where I have dealt with constituencies like <lb/>
Ottawa, or, like West Toronto which re<lb break="no"/>turned two members I have taken half the <lb/>
vote for the successful Conservative candi<lb break="no"/>dates which I think is a very fair way to <lb/>
do. Let me also point out to my right hon. <lb/>
friend the result in his own province. He <lb/>
was very strong in the position he took that <lb/>
the Bill of 1892 was unfair to the province <lb/>
of Quebec. He dwelt on that to the extent <lb/>
of two or three columns of ' Hansard.' I do <lb/>
not think that my right hon. friend, looking <lb/>
at the result in his own province to-day, can <lb/>
fairly regard it as a gerrymander in the in<lb break="no"/>terest of the Conservative party at least. <lb/>
I have been looking at the figures and I <lb/>
find that in the province of Quebec at the <lb/>
last general election the popular Liberal <lb/>
vote was 133,121 and that fifty-eight Liberal <lb/>
members were returned while the popular <lb/>
Conservative vote was 104,522 and that <lb/>
seven Conservative members were returned. <lb/>
Each Liberal member represents on an ever-<lb break="yes"/>age 2,300 Liberal electors while each Con<lb break="no"/>servative member represents on an average <lb/>
15,000 Conservative electors. I think my <lb/>
right hon. friend will not be inclined to rely <lb/>
upon the position he took in 1892 when he <lb/>
regarded the province of Quebec as having <lb/>
been gerrymandered in the Conservative in<lb break="no"/>terest. <lb/></p> 

<p>There is another matter I would like to <lb/>
bring to the attention of the House and it <lb/>
is this. My right hon. friend has not said <lb/>
a word about the very important legal point <lb/>
which was raised by two of his colleagues <lb/>
in 1892—Mr. Davies and Mr. Mills. These <lb/>
were very eminent men in their profession, <lb/>
so eminent that they have since been ap<lb break="no"/>pointed by this government to positions on <lb/>
the bench of the highest court of appeal in <lb/>
this country and both of these gentlemen, <lb/>
in 1892, laid down the position unequivoc<lb break="no"/>ally, stating that they had no doubt upon it, <lb/>
that parliament was not competent to do <lb/>
this work at all, that it must appoint an <lb/>
independent authority to deal with the sub<lb break="no"/>ject. I shall not weary the House by read<lb break="no"/>ing from their speeches but any hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who has paid any attention to the de<lb break="no"/>bate of 1892 knows that what I say is <lb/>
absolutely correct. Mr. Davies as well as <lb/>
Mr. Mills professed himself to be without <lb/>
any doubt whatever on the subject, and on <lb/>
the Conservative side of the House, the late <lb/>
Mr. Dalton McCarthy, a gentleman very emi<lb break="no"/>nent in his profession, none more eminent <lb/>
in Canada at that time, professed himself <lb/>
to be in agreement with Mr. Mills and Mr. <lb/>
Davies. Now, under these circumstances, <lb/>
would it not be worth the attention of the <lb/>
government to consider whether or not that <lb/>
point should be referred to the Supreme <lb/>
Court for their decision. That is not a point <lb/>
that can be laughed out of court when <lb/>
we have in support of it Mr. Davies, now a <lb/>
judge of the Supreme Court, the highest <lb/>
court of the country, Mr. Mills an eminent <lb/>
constitutional lawyer, now occupying a seat <lb/>

<cb/>

on the bench and when we have also in <lb/>
support of it the opinion of the late Mr. <lb/>
Dalton McCarthy. It is something that you <lb/>
will not dismiss with a smile, I imagine, it <lb/>
is something that you will not dismiss with a <lb/>
shrug or a laugh, it is something that you <lb/>
will regard as serious when gentlemen of <lb/>
the standing and ability of the three gentle<lb break="no"/>men I have named have taken the position <lb/>
which these gentlemen did take in the <lb/>
House of Commons. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, there is one other mat<lb break="no"/>ter about which I would like to say a word <lb/>
and it is in regard to the legal question which <lb/>
I drew to the attention of the House on the <lb/>
first reading of this Bill. I have been very <lb/>
kindly favoured by the hon. Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice (Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick) with a copy of the <lb/>
memo. which he presented to council and I <lb/>
am bound to say that I think he has with <lb/>
his usual ability made the very best possible <lb/>
case that he could for the position of those <lb/>
who think that there is no ground for the <lb/>
contention which has been raised by the <lb/>
law officers of the Crown for the province of <lb/>
New Brunswick. I have had a great deal <lb/>
of doubt in my own mind as to what the true <lb/>
answer to the question is. At one time when <lb/>
I first examined the question, I was very <lb/>
strongly impressed with the opinion which <lb/>
has been given by the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Justice although I reached the conclusion by <lb/>
a somewhat different mode of reasoning. It <lb/>
seemed to me, looking at the provisions <lb/>
of sections three and four of the British <lb/>
North America Act that you might say that <lb/>
Canada was as much constituted under the <lb/>
British North America Act when it had <lb/>
seven provinces as when it had four. That <lb/>
at first blush seemed to be the true solution <lb/>
of the case for the reason that the Dominion <lb/>
of Canada was not formally constituted by <lb/>
the British North America Act, but it was <lb/>
constituted under the British North America <lb/>
Act by the Queen's proclamation, and inas<lb break="no"/>much as section three gave power to the <lb/>
Queen to proclaim the four provinces to be <lb/>
one union and as section 146 gave power to <lb/>
the Queen, upon certain conditions precedent <lb/>
having been complied with, to make a simi<lb break="no"/>lar proclamation in regard to other of Her <lb/>
Majesty's colonies in North America I was <lb/>
inclined to think at first that the words 'as <lb/>
constituted under this Act' in section four <lb/>
would be just as much applicable to Canada <lb/>
at the present time as they were in 1867. I <lb/>
do not say that there is not some force in <lb/>
that answer to the argument which has been <lb/>
put forward by the law officers of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of New Brunswick. But, let us look <lb/>
at the preamble of the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act, which is as follows:— <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Whereas, the provinces of Canada, Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia and New Brunswick have expressed their <lb/>
desire to be federally united into one Dominion <lb/>
under the Crown of the United Kingdom of <lb/>
Great Britain and Ireland, with a constitution <lb/>
similar in principle to that of the United King<lb break="no"/>dom: <lb/></p>

<pb n="1215" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1903-04-14_Page_01215.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">1215</fw>
<fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">1216</fw> 

<p>And whereas such a union would conduce to <lb/>
the welfare of the provinces and promote the <lb/>
interests of the British empire; <lb/></p> 

<p>And whereas on the establishment of the <lb/>
union by authority of parliament it is expedient, <lb/>
not only that the constitution of the legislative <lb/>
authority in the Dominion be provided for, but <lb/>
also that the nature of the executive govern<lb break="no"/>ment therein be declared; <lb/></p> 

<p>And whereas it is expedient that provision <lb/>
be made for the eventual admission into the <lb/>
union of other parts of British North America. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Then follows the enacting part. Then, in <lb/>
section four provides: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The subsequent provisions of this Act shall, <lb/>
unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, <lb/>
commence and have effect on and after the <lb/>
union, that is to say, on and after the day ap<lb break="no"/>pointed for the union taking effect in the <lb/>
Queen's proclamation; and in the same provi<lb break="no"/>sions, unless it is otherwise expressed or im<lb break="no"/>plied, the name Canada shall be taken to mean <lb/>
Canada as constituted under this Act. <lb/></p> </quote>
 
 

<p>That is rather an important provision it <lb/>
seems to me which is contained in the first <lb/>
part of section four. The subsequent pro<lb break="no"/>visions of this Act are to 'commence and <lb/>
have effect on and after the union' and it <lb/>
seems to me that the expression gives a <lb/>
certain key as to whether or not you are to <lb/>
regard the words 'Canada as constituted <lb/>
under this Act' as having the meaning <lb/>
which I have already indicated. Now, an<lb break="no"/>other important section is section eight to <lb/>
which I think attention was not drawn <lb/>
upon the first reading of the Bill. <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>In the general census of the population of <lb/>
Canada which is hereby required to be taken in <lb/>
the year one thousand eight hundred and seven<lb break="no"/>ty-one, and in every tenth year thereafter, the <lb/>
respective populations of the four provinces <lb/>
shall be distinguished. <lb/></p> </quote>
 
 

<p>I would rather be inclined to think that <lb/>
there is ground for the contention taken by <lb/>
the law officers of the province of New <lb/>
Brunswick—I understand this to be their <lb/>
argument—that Canada as constituted under <lb/>
this Act meant in the first place the four <lb/>
original provinces, or rather the three origi<lb break="no"/>nal provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and <lb/>
New Brunswick and not Canada as it might <lb/>
be constituted from time to time. If you <lb/>
once grant that, it seems to me that <lb/>
a very serious question arises. I am not <lb/>
insensible of the force of the argu<lb break="no"/>ment which might be and which has <lb/>
been made by the hon. Minister of Justice, <lb/>
and it seems that he has overlooked one <lb/>
point to which he might have drawn atten<lb break="no"/>tion and that is that the words 'parliament <lb/>
of Canada ' at the commencement of section <lb/>
fifty-one must obviously mean Canada as <lb/>
constituted from time to time, because it is <lb/>
the parliament of Canada as constituted <lb/>
from time to time that must make these pro<lb break="no"/>visions. My hon. friend the Minister of <lb/>
Justice has in his memo gone very fully into <lb/>
the question of the statutes and the ad<lb break="no"/>dresses, and in particular he has referred <lb/>
to the imperial legislation following the ad<lb break="no"/>mission of Manitoba into the union. The <lb/>
 

<cb/>

hon. gentleman places very great stress in<lb break="no"/>deed upon the statute which deals with the <lb/>
province of Manitoba. He says: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The terms of union and the Manitoba Act <lb/>
are to be looked upon and construed as in <lb/>
effect imperial Acts amending the British <lb/>
North America Act, 1867. It will be observed <lb/>
that in each of them it is provided that the <lb/>
provisions of the British North America Act, <lb/>
1867, except these answering a certain des<lb break="no"/>cription which section 61 does not answer, shall <lb/>
be applicable to the new province in the same <lb/>
way and to the same extent as they apply to <lb/>
the other provinces of the Dominion, and as if <lb/>
the new provinces had been one of the provinces <lb/>
originally united by the said Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Of course, one can see at once the force of <lb/>
that argument, but it does not seem to me <lb/>
to be as conclusive as the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice supposes, because it might possibly be <lb/>
that the new provinces must be compared <lb/>
with the total population of Canada for the <lb/>
purpose of regulating their representation, <lb/>
and yet it would not necessarily follow that <lb/>
the very distinct language contained in sec<lb break="no"/>tion 51 must be so modified so far as the <lb/>
other four provinces are concerned. That <lb/>
seems to me to be the whole crux of the <lb/>
argument of the Minister of Justice. If <lb/>
you once concede that 'Canada' in section <lb/>
51 means ' Canada ' as it was originally con<lb break="no"/>stituted, then that section being regarded in <lb/>
the light of a treaty between the four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—in fact the whole Act must be re<lb break="no"/>garded in the light of a treaty between the <lb/>
four provinces—you must have something <lb/>
very distinct indeed in any subsequent sta<lb break="no"/>tutes or addresses if you are to modify the <lb/>
language of that section. I do not know <lb/>
that I would be inclined to go so far as <lb/>
my hon. friend the Minister of Justice. in <lb/>
holding that you do find what is suffi<lb break="no"/>cient for that purpose in the addresses and <lb/>
the statutes to which he has called atten<lb break="no"/>tion. Indeed, I do not observe anything <lb/>
in the memo. of the Minister of Justice <lb/>
which indicates his reasons for supposing <lb/>
that the population of the Territories must <lb/>
be taken into consideration—I do not know <lb/>
whether the Minister of Justice goes so far <lb/>
as to hold that the population of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories ought be taken into consideration. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. It ought <lb/>
not to be. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). My hon. friend <lb/>
thinks that it ought not to be. <lb/></p>

Minister of Justice were more convincing <lb/>
to me than it is—and I am bound to say <lb/>
that I appreciate its weight—nevertheless <lb/>
we have on the other hand the opinion of the <lb/>
law officers of the province of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, and all who are acquainted with the <lb/>
Attorney General of New Brunswick (Hon. <lb/>
Wm. Pugsley), and all who have met him <lb/>
at the bar, realize and recognize his emin<lb break="no"/>ence in the legal profession. Therefore, so <lb/>
long as there is a question with regard to <lb/>
it, I think it would be right that it should <lb/>
be submitted to the Supreme Court. It <lb/>
ought to be submitted not only to the Su<lb break="no"/>preme Court. but it seems to me necessary <lb/>
or at least desirable that provision should <lb/>
also be made for having the opinion of the <lb/>
Privy Council upon the question. I <lb/>
say that for this reason: Suppose the <lb/>
parliament of Canada should pass this Act <lb/>
in its present form, and a question <lb/>
should afterwards he raised—and it may <lb/>
be raised before the courts—as to whe<lb break="no"/>ther this parliament had jurisdiction, and <lb/>
the case so raised should go not only to the <lb/>
Supreme Court of Canada, but to the Privy <lb/>
Council, a very awkward condition of affairs <lb/>
may come to pass. It seems to me that it <lb/>
would be impossible to separate in such an <lb/>
Act as this, that portion which upon the <lb/>
assumption that I have made, would be <lb/>
good, and that portion which would be bad. <lb/>
May I make my meaning a little plainer-<lb/>I am trying to address myself more par<lb break="no"/>ticularly to my hon. friend the Minister of <lb/>
Justice. Here is a statute which undoubted<lb break="no"/>ly contains provisions which this parliament <lb/>
may pass—there can be no doubt that we <lb/>
can deal with the revision of constituencies <lb/>
throughout Canada. While that revision or <lb/>
redistribution of constituencies throughout <lb/>
Canada is part of the statute, it contains, <lb/>
let us say, a provision which is absolutely <lb/>
ultra vires of this parliament; namely, the <lb/>
reduction of the representation of Ontario <lb/>
to eighty-six and the reduction of the re<lb break="no"/>presentation of the other provinces by one <lb/>
or two members. In construing a statute <lb/>
of that kind it may be held by the court <lb/>
eventually: That not only that portion <lb/>
which deals with the representation of the <lb/>
province of Ontario is bad, but the whole is <lb/>
bad, because the two things are so much <lb/>
dependent on each other and so absolutely <lb/>
joined together in the Act, that you cannot <lb/>
separate in it that portion which is good <lb/>
from that portion which is bad. Therefore, <lb/>
it seems to me that we should have an ad<lb break="no"/>judication upon this question and we should <lb/>
not only have the adjudication of the Su<lb break="no"/>preme Court of Canada upon it, but we <lb/>
should also have the adjudication of the <lb/>
Privy Council by way of appeal as well. <lb/></p> 

<p>I do not desire, Mr. Speaker, to detain the <lb/>
House further. There is, however, one mat<lb break="no"/>ter which I forgot to mention and which I <lb/>
know has impressed itself upon the mind <lb/>
of my hon. friend the Minister of Justice: <lb/>
That is the fact which seems to have been <lb/>
taken for granted in 1892: That British Col<lb break="no"/>
 


<cb/>

umbia came into the union under such con<lb break="no"/>ditions that her representation although it <lb/>
may be increased cannot be decreased. It <lb/>
would seem to me that this is quite as in<lb break="no"/>congruous as to the point to which the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice has referred; namely, that <lb/>
under the contention which he controverts <lb/>
certain provinces in Canada are to have their <lb/>
representation increased or diminished ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the population of four provinces <lb/>
and not the population of the whole of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, while so far as the rest of Canada is <lb/>
concerned the representation of the different <lb/>
provinces is dependent, not upon the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the four provinces, but upon the <lb/>
population of all the provinces of Canada. <lb/>
Therefore, Mr. Speaker. I think it would <lb/>
be a wise course for the government to have <lb/>
that question, which has been raised by the <lb/>
province of New Brunswick, submitted to <lb/>
the courts; and not only to have it submitted <lb/>
to the Supreme Court but to have the ques<lb break="no"/>tion determined by the highest court of ap<lb break="no"/>peal to which any judicial matter can he <lb/>
carried in this country. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">The PRIME MINISTER</persName> (Rt. Hon. Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>frid Laurier). I am happy that my hon. <lb/>
friend the leader of the opposition and I <lb/>
have been able to agree on so many things, <lb/>
even if we cannot agree on everything. It <lb/>
was not to be expected that we should have <lb/>
an absolute love feast and that we should <lb/>
see eye to eye on every question, but on the <lb/>
whole I am glad that the Bill has received <lb/>
the approval of my hon. friend, and that we <lb/>
shall have his concurrence in making it as <lb/>
perfect as possible and as fair between <lb/>
party and party as it is possible to make <lb/>
it. I have a brief reference to make to one <lb/>
or two observations of my hon. friend (Mr. <lb/>
Borden). He has referred to the view held <lb/>
at one time in this House by two eminent <lb/>
friends and subsequent colleagues of mine, <lb/>
then Mr. Louis H. Davies and Mr. David <lb/>
Mills, both of whom are new members of <lb/>
the Supreme Court. I remember very well <lb/>
the occasion upon which these two gentle<lb break="no"/>men strongly expressed the view that the <lb/>
parliament of Canada was not competent to <lb/>
deal with the Redistribution Act, but that <lb/>
the parliament of Canada could create—not <lb/>
only that it could create but that it should <lb/>
create—a power to make the redistribution <lb/>
although it could not do the work itself. <lb/>
This view was held by these two gentlemen <lb/>
and it was strongly supported, but as my <lb/>
hon. friend knows this view was not gener<lb break="no"/>ally accepted. I do not notice that my hon. <lb/>
friend (Mr. Borden) himself expresses an <lb/>
opinion, and he no doubt has one, upon this <lb/>
question. Whatever may be his view I shall <lb/>
not press to know it at the moment, but I <lb/>
will point out that the government thought <lb/>
that upon this question, though perhaps the <lb/>
question may not be free from doubt—I <lb/>
would not go so far as that probably—though <lb/>
the contrary view is held by eminent authori<lb break="no"/>ties, we thought the safest course was to <lb/>
follow the practice which has hitherto <lb/>

<fw type="num">1219</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">1220</fw>


been accepted and have the redistribution <lb/>
made by parliament itself. I have no doubt <lb/>
that parliament can create a power to do <lb/>
the redistribution, but the power is also <lb/>
vested in parliament, and all governments <lb/>
up to the present time have interpreted it <lb/>
in that way. I believe it was more in ac<lb break="no"/>cordance with the public interpretation of <lb/>
popular government to have that supreme <lb/>
power carried into effect by parliament it<lb break="no"/>self. The other question to which the hon. <lb/>
gentleman (Mr. Borden) has referred is a <lb/>
far more serious one; namely, the method <lb/>
of counting the votes and distributing them. <lb/>
My hon. friend has stated, and rightly <lb/>
stated, that upon this point we are abso<lb break="no"/>lutely bound by the British North America <lb/>
Act; we are not at liberty to assign so much <lb/>
to this province or so much to the other <lb/>
province; we must follow the results of the <lb/>
census, according to the terms laid down <lb/>
in the British North America Act. But there <lb/>
can be a way of counting the votes and as<lb break="no"/>certaining that proportion. We have re<lb break="no"/>ceived a very strong appeal from some of <lb/>
the provinces, particularly from the province <lb/>
of New Brunswick, and my hon. friend the <lb/>
Minister of Justice has taken the precaution <lb/>
to have this matter referred to the Supreme <lb/>
Court and to have as speedy a decision as <lb/>
possible. Whether or not it would be advis<lb break="no"/>able to carry it to the Judicial Committee <lb/>
of the Privy Council is a matter on which <lb/>
it is premature to pronounce. I suppose <lb/>
that in this we will be guided very much <lb/>
by the judgment of the Supreme Court. If <lb/>
that judgment be of such a character as to <lb/>
leave no doubt, either one way or the other, <lb/>
there would be no necessity to push the <lb/>
matter further. Perhaps it may be advis<lb break="no"/>able to do so, but the government are not <lb/>
prepared to decide that point definitely at <lb/>
present. My hon. colleague the Minister <lb/>
of Justice, has taken steps to have the mat<lb break="no"/>ter referred to the Supreme Court and have <lb/>
a decision as speedily as possible, and I <lb/>
hope that in a few weeks we will be able to <lb/>
announce that decision. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:NORT1">Mr. W. B. NORTHRUP</persName> (East Hastings). <lb/>
In rising to make a few comments on the <lb/>
Bill, Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my en<lb break="no"/>tire accord in the remarks of my hon. leader, <lb/>
when he said that he accepted the statements <lb/>
of the right hon. gentleman, the First Minis<lb break="no"/>ter, as unreservedly as they were made. I sin<lb break="no"/>cerely believe that the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man intends by the Bill before the House <lb/>
to give the people a fair redistribution <lb/>
measure, and speaking for myself, I say <lb/>
in all sincerity, that when the right hon. <lb/>
gentleman's biography comes to be written <lb/>
—and I am sure it is gratifying to every <lb/>
hon. member on both sides to realize that <lb/>
that day is apparently growing daily more <lb/>
remote—the brightest page in that biography <lb/>
will be that one on which is recorded the pro<lb break="no"/>mise of the right hon. gentleman to give this <lb/>
House and country a fair measure of redis<lb break="no"/>tribution. But while expressing my appre<lb break="no"/>




<cb/>

ciation of the intentions of the right hon. <lb/>
the leader of this House, it seems to me that <lb/>
the time is inopportune for the passing of <lb/>
such a measure as that submitted to us. <lb/>
The right hon. gentleman has pointed out <lb/>
that the government has decided to sub<lb break="no"/>mit to the Supreme Court a reference on <lb/>
the question raised as to our right to reduce <lb/>
the representation of any of the provinces. <lb/>
But practically what difference can there <lb/>
be in submitting the case to the Supreme <lb/>
Court, and submitting it to a board compos<lb break="no"/>ed of county court judges, other than the <lb/>
intrinsic merits and abilities of the members <lb/>
of the respective courts? We know that <lb/>
if legislation be based on the decision of the <lb/>
Supreme Court and if the constitutionality <lb/>
of that legislation be disputed before the <lb/>
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, <lb/>
that body would be in no way bound by <lb/>
the decision of the Supreme Court. In a <lb/>
matter of such importance, not only as affect<lb break="no"/>ing the present, but as laying down a pre<lb break="no"/>cedent and doctrine for future redistribu<lb break="no"/>tions, it seems to me that the least the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment should do would be to obtain the <lb/>
best opinion possible in order that in what<lb break="no"/>ever we may do, we may be acting on no <lb/>
uncertain ground, and have every assurance <lb/>
that our legislation will be unassallable. I <lb/>
do not intend to argue that the construction <lb/>
of the British North America Act given <lb/>
by the government is wrong, although <lb/>
my own opinion would lead me to <lb/>
that conclusion. But I do not take <lb/>
this ground because, in the first place, it is <lb/>
not necessary for the argument I intend <lb/>
making. What I wish to point out is that <lb/>
if it be doubtful that this House has a <lb/>
right to reduce the representation of any <lb/>
of the provinces, if nobody can say with <lb/>
certainty that we have the power to pass <lb/>
such legislation, we ought certainly to ob<lb break="no"/>tain the most authoritative opinion we can <lb/>
before proceeding to pass any enactment. <lb/>
In the second place, I do not propose to <lb/>
argue that the government is wrong in its <lb/>
contention, for if I were to do so, I would <lb/>
be submitting to this House an argument <lb/>
which would be more properly made in a <lb/>
court of law, as this House is not so con<lb break="no"/>stituted as to be the proper forum before <lb/>
which to argue an intricate question of <lb/>
law. I would prefer that such a question <lb/>
should be argued before the Judicial Com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the Privy Council. <lb/></p> 

<p>On looking through the written opinion <lb/>
of the hon. Minister of Justice, and speaking <lb/>
with all deference to his high legal attain<lb break="no"/>ments, if I can find statements of fact in <lb/>
that opinion which are inaccurate quotations <lb/>
of law that are erroneous if I can find <lb/>
arguments which are fallacious and other <lb/>
arguments which followed to their logi<lb break="no"/>cal conclusion would bear out the con<lb break="no"/>tentions of the provinces, I think I will be <lb/>
justified in concluding that an opinion based <lb/>
on such data cannot be so clear and free <lb/>
from doubt as to warrant our passing an <lb/>
Act which later on might be declared invalid. <lb/></p>

<p>Looking at the opinion of the hon. Minister <lb/>
of Justice, and without pretending to dis<lb break="no"/>sect it thoroughly, let me call attention to <lb/>
a few facts which may throw some light on <lb/>
the conclusion he has come to. On page 4 <lb/>
I find this sentence: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The province of Manitoba has been carved <lb/>
out of Rupert's Land by legislation of the par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada, which also, by virtue of <lb/>
provision of the British North America Act, <lb/>
1867, has practicallly the force and effect of an <lb/>
imperial statute. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>That is a statement with regard to an <lb/>
important fact. But is it a fact that the <lb/>
province of Manitoba was carved out of <lb/>
Rupert's Land by legislation of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion of Canada? I find in Hodgins on Do<lb break="no"/>minion and Provincial Legislation, page 9, <lb/>
that a predecessor of the hon. gentleman, <lb/>
the Rt. Hon. Sir John Macdonald, Minister <lb/>
pointing out that so doubtful was the power <lb/>
of Justice of that day, in a report approved <lb/>
by His Excellency the Governor General <lb/>
of Canada in Council, on the 2nd of Jan<lb break="no"/>uary, 1871, thus speaks of the question raised <lb/>
as to the power of parliament to pass an <lb/>
Act giving the new province the right to <lb/>
representation in the Senate and the House <lb/>
of Commons of the Dominion: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The general purview of the British North <lb/>
America Act, 1867, seems to be confined to the <lb/>
three provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia. New <lb/>
Brunswick, originally forming the Dominion. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>And on the strength of that and the <lb/>
other statements in this state paper, the <lb/>
Minister of Justice of that day came to <lb/>
the conclusion that inasmuch as it was <lb/>
doubtful whether the parliament of Canada <lb/>
had the power to carve out a province <lb/>
from Prince Rupert's Land, it was wise to <lb/>
have imperial legislation to legalize what the <lb/>
parliament of Canada had done. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. And im<lb break="no"/>perial legislation was passed. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:NORT1">Mr. NORTHRUP</persName>. Certainly. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. Where <lb/>
then is the argument? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:NORT1">Mr. NORTHRUP</persName>. It is this, that the im<lb break="no"/>perial parliament, a year or two later, pass<lb break="no"/>ed an Act to legalize what the parliament of <lb/>
Canada had done, and what the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man says the parliament of Canada had a <lb/>
right to do without any imperial Act. If <lb/>
the statement be true that the parliament <lb/>
of Canada had the power to carve out the <lb/>
province of Manitoba from Rupert's Land, <lb/>
the Rt. Hon. Sir John Macdonald and the <lb/>
officers of the Crown of that day were wrong <lb/>
in applying for an imperial Act, and the <lb/>
imperial parliament and the law lords were <lb/>
wrong when they passed an Act of the <lb/>
statute to legalize what the Dominion had <lb/>
a right, of its own accord, to do without <lb/>
any imperial legislation. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. But we <lb/>
are speaking of the present time. What <lb/>
was done at that time was legalized subse<lb break="no"/>quently. <lb/></p> 



<cb/>

<p>
<persName ref="pers:NORT1">Mr. NORTHRUP</persName>. I am speaking of the <lb/>
statement in the report of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man that the province of Manitoba had been <lb/>
carved out of Rupert's Land by legislation <lb/>
of the parliament of Canada. But on re<lb break="no"/>ferring to the record, I find that while <lb/>
the parliament of Canada had attempted to <lb/>
do so, the Minister of Justice of that day <lb/>
doubted its power, and the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment passed a piece of legislation, which <lb/>
was not at all necessary except on the <lb/>
ground that the parliament of Canada had <lb/>
not the power to do what it professed to do. <lb/>
I am justified, therefore, in my contention <lb/>
that in an important statement of fact the <lb/>
hon. gentleman is not accurate, and that <lb/>
when he says that the province of Manitoba <lb/>
has been carved out of Rupert's Land by <lb/>
legislation of the parliament of Canada, he <lb/>
should have qualified that statement by <lb/>
pointing out that so doubtful was the power <lb/>
of parliament to do this considered, that an <lb/>
Act was passed by the imperial parliament <lb/>
to legalize what the Dominion parliament <lb/>
had done. Therefore, I submit that is not a <lb/>
fact on which the conclusion arrived at by <lb/>
the Minister of Justice can be based. Fur<lb break="no"/>ther in this report of the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Justice, he says, that British Columbia and <lb/>
Prince Edward Island came into the union <lb/>
under the same section 146 of the British <lb/>
North America Act, and that they were ad<lb break="no"/>mitted into the union with practically equal <lb/>
rights. On page 6, these are the words he <lb/>
uses: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Where new partners are admitted into the <lb/>
union with practically equal rights, one would <lb/>
expect to find the relation of the population of <lb/>
each province to that of the whole Dominion <lb/>
to govern this representation in the popular <lb/>
Chamber. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>But as a matter of law is it the case that <lb/>
British Columbia and Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land were admitted into the Dominion with <lb/>
practically equal rights? In this very state <lb/>
paper of the hon. Minister of Justice I find <lb/>
on page 5: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>British Columbia is entitled to be represented <lb/>
in the Senate by three and by six in the House <lb/>
of Commons, the representation to be increased <lb/>
under the provisions of the British North <lb/>
America Act, 1867. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>And I find that, according to the same <lb/>
paper, page 5: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The terms of union with Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land contain a provision to precisely the same <lb/>
effect as clause 10 of the terms of union with <lb/>
British Columbia and the following provisions <lb/>
as to representation:— <lb/></p> 

<p>That the population of Prince Edward Island <lb/>
having increased by 15, 000 or upwards since the <lb/>
year 1861, the island shalll be represented in <lb/>
the House of Commons by six members; the <lb/>
representation to be readjusted from time to <lb/>
time under the provisions of the British North <lb/>
America Act, 1867. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>But in the case or British Columbia, the <lb/>
representation was to be, not readjusted, <lb/>
as in the case of Prince Edward Island, but <lb/>
increased. It will hardly lie in the mouth <lb/>

of the hon. gentleman to say that the two <lb/>
expressions 'readjusted' and 'increased' <lb/>
are synonymous terms, because in 1892, <lb/>
when the last Redistribution Act was before <lb/>
the House, hon. members opposite, includ<lb break="no"/>ing the present leader of the government, <lb/>
admitted that under the terms of union, <lb/>
the representation of British Columbia <lb/>
could not be decreased below six. It was <lb/>
not contended then that the representation <lb/>
of Prince Edward Island could not be in<lb break="no"/>creased or decreased according to this <lb/>
method of readjustment. And therefore, Sir, <lb/>
we find that, as a matter of fact, as a <lb/>
matter of law, of the two provinces, both <lb/>
of which came in under orders in council, <lb/>
in the case of one it is guaranteed that the <lb/>
number of its members can never be less <lb/>
than six, while the other may be reduced <lb/>
to one or none. And yet, the Minister of <lb/>
Justice, in this report on so important a <lb/>
question, a report which if followed, may <lb/>
lead to a state of affairs never contemplated, <lb/>
and which never could be desired, says that <lb/>
these new provinces were admitted to the <lb/>
union with practically equal rights. I sub<lb break="no"/>mit to this House could anybody on either <lb/>
side contend for a moment that when one <lb/>
province comes in with six members which <lb/>
number cannot be decreased, and another <lb/>
comes in with six members which can be <lb/>
decreased, it is not a mere abuse of language <lb/>
to say that the two provinces came in with <lb/>
equal rights? <lb/></p> 

<p>And I would refer to another part of the <lb/>
report of the Minister of Justice. At the <lb/>
beginning of his report he refers to the <lb/>
contention on the part of the parliament <lb/>
of New Brunswick that Canada under the <lb/>
51st section, is Canada as originally con<lb break="no"/>stituted by the British North America Act, <lb/>
and he shows, on the other side, the con<lb break="no"/>tention which the government supports, <lb/>
that Canada means Canada as it exists to<lb break="no"/>day. We know what Canada means under <lb/>
the British North America Act—the original <lb/>
four provinces. And we know what Can<lb break="no"/>ada means as it exists to-day, stretching <lb/>
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. And the <lb/>
difference between the province of New <lb/>
Brunswick on the one side and the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion of Canada on the other is which of <lb/>
these interpretations is correct. The fourth <lb/>
subsection of section 51 is the clause which <lb/>
is under discussion and concerning which <lb/>
the question arises whether it means Can<lb break="no"/>ada as it was constituted under the British <lb/>
North America Act, or Canada as it exists <lb/>
to-day. I find, in this statement of the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice the clause which bears on <lb/>
this point and gives the information on it. <lb/>
He said: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The terms of union and the Manitoba. Act <lb/>
are to be looked upon and construed as in <lb/>
effect imperial Acts amending the British North <lb/>
America Act, 1867. It will be observed that, in <lb/>
each of them it is provided that the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the British North America Act, 1867, <lb/>
except those answering a certain description <lb/>
 

<cb/>

which section 51 does not answer shall be ap<lb break="no"/>plicable to the new province— <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>And the words following are underlined: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>—in the same way and to the same extent as <lb/>
they apply to the other provinces of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, and as it the new province had been <lb/>
one of the provinces originally united by the <lb/>
said Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>And it goes on: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Section 51 is also in each case specially de<lb break="no"/>clared to be applicable. subject to the excep<lb break="no"/>tions which for the present purpose are im<lb break="no"/>material. <lb/></p> 

<p>The words underlined— <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Those to which I have just referred.</p>
 
 <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
 <p>
—seem to dispose of the suggested view as to <lb/>
the construction of the Act as untenable. Sup<lb break="no"/>pose one of the colonies had been one of the <lb/>
provinces originally united, how must section <lb/>
51 have then been read and construed. In the <lb/>
opening paragraph ' four provinces' would have <lb/>
been 'five provinces': the Word 'province' <lb/>
throughout the section would be applied to the <lb/>
supposed additional province as well as the <lb/>
other, and can it be doubted that the word <lb/>
' can' in paragraph 4 would have included all <lb/>
five provinces. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>So the hon. gentleman's argument is that <lb/>
as these provinces came in from time to <lb/>
time they became part of the Dominion on <lb/>
the same terms as did the original provinces, <lb/>
and therefore the British North America <lb/>
Act should be read, as each came in, as <lb/>
though it had been part of the Dominion <lb/>
when the British North America Act was <lb/>
passed. Then, let us see, this being ad<lb break="no"/>mitted, how clause 5 of the British North <lb/>
America Act will read. Making the amend<lb break="no"/>ments necessary for the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
argument it would read as follows: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Canada shall be divided into seven provinces, <lb/>
named Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New <lb/>
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and <lb/>
British Columbia. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>I think the hon. gentleman (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
Fitzpatrick) will admit that that is a fair <lb/>
reading of clause 5 of the British North <lb/>
America Act as amended by his argument, <lb/>
that as each new province came into the <lb/>
Dominion it acquired all the powers of the <lb/>
original provinces, and that the clauses of <lb/>
the Act were to be read as if it had been <lb/>
admitted as part of the Dominion originally. <lb/>
But this would make Canada consist only <lb/>
of the seven provinces enumerated. If I <lb/>
had not had the pleasure of meeting the <lb/>
hon. gentleman in the North-west Territories <lb/>
last fall, I would have thought that he was <lb/>
under the impression that a person stepped <lb/>
from Manitoba directly in to British Co<lb break="no"/>lumbia. Under his argument, the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories form no part of the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion of Canada, for Canada consists only <lb/>
of the seven provinces. Under that argu<lb break="no"/>ment, when we seek to find what each pro<lb break="no"/>vince should be arrayed against in order <lb/>
to calculate its representations, we find that <lb/>
it would be Ontario, or whatever other pro<lb break="no"/>

vince may be considered, against seven pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, not against the Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada. So, admitting for the purpose of argu<lb break="no"/>ment—which I do not as a matter of fact— <lb/>
that the hon. gentleman's argument is cor<lb break="no"/>rect, he has simply proved himself out of <lb/>
court, because he begins in the first page of <lb/>
his report to prove that Canada means Cana<lb break="no"/>da as it exists from the Atlantic to the Paci<lb break="no"/>fic, and he has proved that it means only the <lb/>
seven provinces, the territories not being <lb/>
included. So, when we seek to find against <lb/>
what part the representation of Ontario <lb/>
should be calculated, we find that it is only <lb/>
against seven provinces and not against the <lb/>
Dominion of Canada including the terri<lb break="no"/>tories. What the practical effect of that <lb/>
would be I am not prepared to say. I do <lb/>
not know that it is material, for, in dealing <lb/>
with the law it is a question of right and <lb/>
wrong. However, I have had two calcula<lb break="no"/>tions made showing the effect under each <lb/>
contention. Not being a mathematician, I <lb/>
cannot say whether they are right. But <lb/>
one calculation made by a competent per<lb break="no"/>son shows that, it the territories were ex<lb break="no"/>cluded and Ontario were calculated against <lb/>
seven provinces, we should not have any <lb/>
reduction. The other made by a depart<lb break="no"/>ment in the city shows that, by a paltry <lb/>
decimal of twelve, Ontario would lose six <lb/>
seats, if the territories were brought into <lb/>
the calculation. While I believe the first <lb/>
figures to be correct, I am not going to <lb/>
commit myself to them. It is a question of <lb/>
the construction of the statute, and, if it <lb/>
does not affect us to-day it might affect us <lb/>
at some other time. We are entitled to a <lb/>
fair rendering of the statutes, and we are <lb/>
entitled to know whether the minister bases <lb/>
his argument on the ground that seven pro<lb break="no"/>vinces constitute the whole of Canada be<lb break="no"/>fore we are called upon to accept a cal<lb break="no"/>culation based upon such data. <lb/></p> 

<p>I notice, also, that on page 6 of the hon. <lb/>
gentleman's report, it appears that the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces came in with equal rights as com<lb break="no"/>pared with the others. Let us see how that <lb/>
would work out with regard to the other <lb/>
provinces. I have spoken of the fact that <lb/>
it is clear that British Columbia has greater <lb/>
rights than Prince Edward Island. See how <lb/>
section 51 would work out from the stand<lb break="no"/>point of the old provinces in the light of <lb/>
the hon. gentleman's contention. Section 51 <lb/>
provides what is to be done on the com<lb break="no"/>pletion of the census—that Quebec shall <lb/>
have a fixed number of sixty-five repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives, and we understand how the <lb/>
other provinces have proportionate <choice><sic>repres<lb break="no"/>tation</sic><corr>representation</corr></choice>. If the contention of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is right, when we come to read section <lb/>
51, it applies not only to the four provinces, <lb/>
but to the seven. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. No, not <lb/>
to seven provinces, but to Canada. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:NORT1">Mr. NORTHRUP</persName>, And the hon. minister <lb/>
has shown by the argument I have referred <lb/>

<cb/>

to it means the seven provinces. I am <lb/>
taking the hon. gentleman's report, and not <lb/>
at present giving my own views. He has <lb/>
proved to his own satisfaction that Can<lb break="no"/>ada consists of the seven provinces. How <lb/>
then would you work out this 5lst clause? <lb/>
If he wishes to change his opinion and make <lb/>
the section mean the whole of Canada, how <lb/>
would he work out the 51st clause according <lb/>
to his contention? Whatever portions com<lb break="no"/>pose Canada this clause provides for equal <lb/>
treatment. But what would you do when <lb/>
you come to British Columbia? Can you <lb/>
apply section 51 to that province? In view <lb/>
of the fact that its representations is never <lb/>
to be decreased below six members, how <lb/>
is it possible to apply this section to that <lb/>
province? Then, how about the territories, <lb/>
if, as the hon. minister contends, Canada con<lb break="no"/>sists of the whole country from ocean to <lb/>
ocean? It is settled law that we have the <lb/>
power, under the imperial statutes, to give <lb/>
the territories as large representations as <lb/>
we see fit. We can give them ten or fifty <lb/>
or an hundred members, as we please. So <lb/>
section 51 clearly does not apply to the terri<lb break="no"/>tories. According to the hon. gentleman <lb/>
though, section 51 applies to the whole of <lb/>
Canada, it does not apply to the North-west <lb/>
Territories, the largest division of Canada, <lb/>
or to British Columbia, which is the largest <lb/>
province. I do not pretend to be very fam<lb break="no"/>iliar with the geographical facts, but, if you <lb/>
subtract from the whole area of Canada <lb/>
the area of the North-west Territories and <lb/>
British Columbia, I am inclined to think <lb/>
that you will find that the greater part of <lb/>
Canadian territory is outside the operation <lb/>
of section 51, and we know that the time <lb/>
is not far distant when the North-west <lb/>
Territories and British Columbia will be, <lb/>
in population, the greatest part of the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion. So, the hon. gentleman has led him<lb break="no"/>self into a difficulty there. <lb/></p> 

<p>I only wished to call attention to a few <lb/>
points in the report of the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice to argue that, when a gentleman of his <lb/>
attainments at the bar, and with his talents <lb/>
—talents which we all admire—looking in<lb break="no"/>to this matter and preparing a state paper, <lb/>
commits the inaccuracies I have pointed <lb/>
out, and comes to such conclusions as I <lb/>
have shown, the ordinary humble member <lb/>
of this House, such as myself and those <lb/>
who sit about me, may well say that this <lb/>
question is not so beyond doubt that we <lb/>
should be justified in proposing legislation <lb/>
until the best opinions that we can obtain <lb/>
have been obtained. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now referring for a moment to the con<lb break="no"/>tention on the other side, is there nothing <lb/>
to be said for the contention of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick? I see New Brunswick's contention <lb/>
submitted to the Dominion government is <lb/>
very brief. It does not descend to argu<lb break="no"/>ment, it merely states the case of New <lb/>
Brunswick. But is there anything to be <lb/>
said on behalf of the contention of New <lb/>
Brunswick? I think a great deal can be <lb/></p>

<p>said. It has been laid down by one of the <lb/>
Supreme Court judges, Mr. Justice Strong, <lb/>
quoted in Lefroy on the Constitution, <lb/>
page 42: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>We are not only entitled, but bound to apply <lb/>
that well-established rule, which requires us, <lb/>
in placing a meaning upon descriptive terms <lb/>
and definitions contained in statutes, to have <lb/>
recourse to external aids derived from the sur<lb break="no"/>rounding circumstances and the history of the <lb/>
subject-matter dealt with, and to consider the <lb/>
enactment by the light derived from such <lb/>
source, and so to put ourselves as far as possi<lb break="no"/>ble in the position of the legislature whose <lb/>
language we have to expound. If this rule were <lb/>
rejected and the language of the statute were <lb/>
considered without such assistance from 'ex<lb break="no"/>trinsic facts, it is manifest that the task or in<lb break="no"/>terpretation would degenerate into mere spe<lb break="no"/>culation and guess work. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>So we have the authority of one of the <lb/>
judges of the Supreme Court to say that we <lb/>
have a right to look at all the surrounding <lb/>
circumstances, and to consider what light <lb/>
can be shed by them on the legislation that <lb/>
has been passed. In the debates before the <lb/>
imperial parliament, when Lord Carnarvon <lb/>
was introducing the British North America <lb/>
Act, he spoke very clearly as to the lan<lb break="no"/>guage of the enactment, and laid down that <lb/>
the British North America Act was the re<lb break="no"/>sult of a treaty made between the various <lb/>
powers every clause of which was a com<lb break="no"/>promise; and because every clause of that <lb/>
treaty was a compromise he refused to <lb/>
allow the House of Lords to amend any <lb/>
clause of it in any respect. Now then if <lb/>
every clause of that treaty was a compro<lb break="no"/>mise, perhaps it would not be out of place <lb/>
to inquire into the circumstances under <lb/>
which this particular clause 51, in which <lb/>
we are so deeply interested, came to be put <lb/>
in the statute. On reference to Pope's Con<lb break="no"/>federation Documents, page 67, we find the <lb/>
debate on the clause giving the number of <lb/>
representatives that the various provinces <lb/>
should be given. We find Mr. Galt saying: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>We have supposed that the population of <lb/>
Lower Canada being tolerably equable in its <lb/>
character, would afford the best basis. But hav<lb break="no"/>ing respect to the rapid increase of Upper <lb/>
Canada, we think the lower provinces should <lb/>
not be reduced if they do not increase in the <lb/>
same ratio. Therefore, the lower provinces <lb/>
would have the same as they have now unless <lb/>
in the very improbable case of any one falling <lb/>
off five per cent or more,—that is a decrease <lb/>
relatively to the whole federation. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Which then began with four provinces. <lb/>
The Hon. Geo. Brown whose name is greatly <lb/>
revered by hon. gentlemen opposite, speak<lb break="no"/>ing on the same subject, says on page 67: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The practical result will be that while Lower <lb/>
Canada certainly will not be less and the lower <lb/>
provinces may increase in population, they can<lb break="no"/>not decrease in the number of representatives. <lb/>
It keeps the House within a reasonable limit. <lb/>
It is now to start with one in 17,000. It will <lb/>
afterwards vary. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Then on page 68 the debate goes on, and <lb/>
it is stated that the number of representa<lb break="no"/>




<cb/>

tives then given was not accidental, but was <lb/>
given because one member for each county <lb/>
and one for each city would give exactly <lb/>
the number agreed upon. The delegates <lb/>
found that they could so divide up the re<lb break="no"/>presentation of the Dominion that the figures <lb/>
agreed on in the British North America Act   <lb/>
would afford what they considered a fair <lb/>
basis for the representation of each pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and it was evidently understood by <lb/>
the representatives at that time when they <lb/>
so provided that unless there was a falling <lb/>
off of one-twentieth in the population of a <lb/>
province there should be no decrease, that <lb/>
practically they were insured against any <lb/>
decrease. Now the provinces have gone in<lb break="no"/>to the Dominion on that basis, and the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America Act being an imperial <lb/>
Act, I submit it is beyond question that the <lb/>
terms of the British North America Act, <lb/>
every clause of it being, as Lord Carnar<lb break="no"/>von said, a compromise, must stand pre<lb break="no"/>cisely to-day as they were then, except <lb/>
insofar as those clauses have been modified <lb/>
by imperial legislation. We must not forget <lb/>
that no matter what legislation this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment might profess to pass or attempt to <lb/>
pass in derogation of imperial legislation, <lb/>
we would be exceeding our powers and our <lb/>
legislation would be utterly void. Now, I <lb/>
would ask the Minister of Justice what legis<lb break="no"/>lation has ever passed the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment that in any way affects clause 51. <lb/>
Probably the answer will be: The other <lb/>
provinces came in under Orders in Council. <lb/>
True, they did come in under Orders in <lb/>
Council, and if the Minister of Justice will <lb/>
read the imperial Orders in Council under <lb/>
which Prince Edward Island, British Colum<lb break="no"/>bia and other provinces came in, he will <lb/>
find that in each case the Order in Council <lb/>
provided that in pursuance of the 146th <lb/>
section of the British North America Act <lb/>
they came in subject to the provisions of <lb/>
this Act, for in fact an Order in Council <lb/>
would have no power to vary the British <lb/>
North America Act, it would be as invalid <lb/>
as an Act of this House, except for clause <lb/>
146 which provided that on an address from <lb/>
a province, with a similar address and on <lb/>
similar terms, from this House, the Queen <lb/>
in Council might approve of their addresses <lb/>
and allow that province to come in on the <lb/>
terms agreed upon, but in every case sub<lb break="no"/>ject to the provisions of that Act. So that <lb/>
when British Columbia or Prince Edward <lb/>
Island came into the union, they came in <lb/>
subject to the provisions of the British <lb/>
North America Act. The imperial Order in <lb/>
Council has no power to vary that, and <lb/>
whatever its provisions were, they had to <lb/>
accept them. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now the Minister of Justice seemed to <lb/>
think that if there were four partners, and <lb/>
two or three others came in, they must <lb/>
come in on equal terms. Surely no wilder <lb/>
statement of law than that could be ima<lb break="no"/>gined. One can understand four gentlemen <lb/>
owning a business each holding a one-quar<lb break="no"/>

ter interest; and they decide to take in, we <lb/>
will say, their head clerk. There is nothing <lb/>
to prevent them giving each one his share <lb/>
of one-eighth, or one-sixteenth or one-thirty <lb/>
second, or any interest they like, to that <lb/>
clerk. It is wholly a matter of contract <lb/>
between them, and even if that clerk had <lb/>
ten times the brains of the original tour, <lb/>
and contributed ten times as much to the <lb/>
success or the business as the original part<lb break="no"/>ners, when he came to claim his share of <lb/>
the profits, he would have to abide by the <lb/>
terms on which he came in. If the Minister <lb/>
of Justice will look at the terms on which <lb/>
these provinces came into the union he will <lb/>
find that there was a provision that they <lb/>
should have the benefit of certain terms from <lb/>
the old provinces, they were given a benefit <lb/>
here and there, but there is not a single word <lb/>
to show that the old provinces lost the <lb/>
rights they had already acquired by imperial <lb/>
legislation. It would be easy for any one <lb/>
to infer that the provinces should have equal <lb/>
rights, but they did not get equal rights, <lb/>
as is shown by the exceptional representa<lb break="no"/>tion given to British Columbia. There<lb break="no"/>fore we find that the provinces have come in <lb/>
with different rights between themselves. <lb/>
Now, if they have come in with different <lb/>
rights between themselves, why should it <lb/>
be argued that they would necessarily come <lb/>
in with equal rights as against the old part<lb break="no"/>ners? I venture to submit that the true <lb/>
view of the British North America Act is <lb/>
that laid down by Sir John A. Macdonald <lb/>
in his state paper of 1870, when he said that <lb/>
the purview of the British North America <lb/>
Act was evidently confined to the original <lb/>
four provinces. That Act was framed by <lb/>
the ablest statesmen of Canada. They were <lb/>
building wisely and well, and they knew the <lb/>
country was liable to have an unlimited ex<lb break="no"/>pansion; they knew it was impossible to <lb/>
foresee the possibilities of this country, and <lb/>
therefore, in providing for the present, as <lb/>
far as possible they provided for the future <lb/>
in general but not in details. They pro<lb break="no"/>vided that other provinces might come in, <lb/>
but the details they left to be arranged <lb/>
while the original partners of the British <lb/>
North America Act secured imperial legis<lb break="no"/>lation, a charter which they hold to-day. <lb/>
I will not say anything further on this <lb/>
point than to claim that in view of the <lb/>
circumstances under which this clause was <lb/>
inserted in the British North America Act, <lb/>
in view of the guarantee of the charter that <lb/>
the provinces have under the British North <lb/>
America Act, in view of the fact that not <lb/>
one word is to be found in any Order of <lb/>
Council or in any address on which an Order <lb/>
in Council is issued, leading to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that the original provinces were <lb/>
divested of any powers they had, whereas <lb/>
on the contrary they have been given new <lb/>
powers, certain specified powers, it seems <lb/>
to me that the case is not free from doubt, <lb/>
and this is as far as it is necessary to go <lb/>
for the purposes of my argument. But if <lb/>

<cb/>

the question be not free from doubt, ad<lb break="no"/>mitting that the right hon. gentleman wishes <lb/>
to do what is fair, is it the part of a practi<lb break="no"/>cal man of business to obtain an opinion <lb/>
from an inferior court when he could obtain <lb/>
one from a superior court? Is it wise to <lb/>
obtain an opinion that has no intrinsic value <lb/>
beyond the value that may be given to it <lb/>
from the personal standing of the judges <lb/>
when, if the case be referred to the Privy <lb/>
Council, we shall then have an authoritative <lb/>
decision which will be beyond question. <lb/>
Therefore I hope that the right hon. leader <lb/>
of the government, considering that this is <lb/>
only the third session of this parliament, <lb/>
that the parliament is still in its infancy, <lb/>
that there is ample time to secure the de<lb break="no"/>cision of the Privy Council and pass this <lb/>
legislation long before this parliament comes <lb/>
to its natural end, will not cause the money <lb/>
of this country to be expended and the time <lb/>
of hon. members perhaps, to be wasted in <lb/>
fruitlessly discussing legislation which the <lb/>
decision of the Privy Council, a few months <lb/>
later on, may show to be utterly abortive. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName> (Hon. <lb/>
Charles Fitzpatrick). Mr. Speaker, of course <lb/>
my hon. friend (Mr. Northrup) is not un<lb break="no"/>aware of the fact that there is no provision <lb/>
for any reference to the Privy Council and <lb/>
that the only provision which we have in <lb/>
our statutes is that which provides for a re<lb break="no"/>ference to the Supreme Court of Canada. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Hon. Mr. HAGGART</persName>. Is there not a pro<lb break="no"/>vision for an appeal from the Supreme <lb/>
Court? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. We are <lb/>
not dealing with appeals; we are dealing <lb/>
with references. I assume that when hon. <lb/>
gentlemen argue legal questions, they mean <lb/>
what they say. As I understand it, the <lb/>
obligation is imposed upon the government <lb/>
after each decennial census to provide for <lb/>
the redistribution of the representation of <lb/>
the different provinces of the Dominion. <lb/>
That is an obligation which is imposed on <lb/>
parliament. There is no discretion that can <lb/>
be exercised by the government in respect <lb/>
to that redistribution. The charter under <lb/>
which we live, under which we are gov<lb break="no"/>erned, the British North America Act, pro<lb break="no"/>vides for the manner in which that redis<lb break="no"/>tribution is to be made, and section 51 of <lb/>
the British North America Act operates au<lb break="no"/>tomatically without reference to the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in any manner or form. Now, in <lb/>
respect to the apportionment of represen<lb break="no"/>tation in each province, there parliament is <lb/>
supreme. When you have determined that <lb/>
in respect to the province of Quebec sixty-<lb break="yes"/>five members are to be allotted. or rather <lb/>
when the British North America Act has <lb/>
decided that sixty-five members are to be <lb/>
allotted to the province of Quebec. then, <lb/>
within the limits of the province, parliament <lb/>
is absolutely supreme. Parliament can de<lb break="no"/>termine how these members are to be al' <lb/>
lotted, to which portion of the province they <lb/>

are to be allotted, or generally in any man<lb break="no"/>ner that parliament chooses. The principle <lb/>
upon which we proceed in this Bill in re<lb break="no"/>spect to the redistribution of the constitu<lb break="no"/>encies in the provinces, a principle which <lb/>
was laid down by the right hon. leader of the <lb/>
government (Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier), <lb/>
as I understood him when he presented this <lb/>
Bill, is that we should maintain county boun<lb break="no"/>daries, and that after having settled the <lb/>
principle that in so far as it is possible <lb/>
county boundaries should be maintained the <lb/>
subdivision of any county is a matter that <lb/>
parliament should deal with and that subdi<lb break="no"/>vision is to be made by a committee of the <lb/>
House, as stated by him when he introduced <lb/>
the Bill. In respect to the principle that <lb/>
was laid down by the right hon. the leader of <lb/>
the government that we would adhere to <lb/>
municipal or county boundaries, I would <lb/>
like to say to the House that that prin<lb break="no"/>ciple was laid down by the late Sir John <lb/>
Macdonald in 1871 at the time of the first <lb/>
redistribution, and that it was acquiesced <lb/>
in by the then leaders of the opposition, <lb/>
Hon. Mr. Mackenzie and Hon. Mr. Blake, <lb/>
and was concurred in by Sir Charles Tupper, <lb/>
who also spoke upon that question. There<lb break="no"/>fore, the question of adhering to county <lb/>
boundaries may be considered as a question <lb/>
that was determined by the leaders of both <lb/>
political parties in 1871. It is true that <lb/>
for purposes to which it is not necessary <lb/>
to refer now that principle was departed <lb/>
from in 1882, but it was not departed from <lb/>
by the Liberal party, and in so far as we <lb/>
are concerned our position to-day is the <lb/>
position we occupied in 1871, that we should <lb/>
maintain county boundaries. Having stated <lb/>
that much, I now proceed to submit to the <lb/>
House the method of reasoning adopted by <lb/>
me in support of the proposed redistribution <lb/>
of seats. This matter is to be referred to the <lb/>
Supreme Court of Canada; it will be argued <lb/>
there, and in so far as I am concerned I will <lb/>
be content to state now the position I <lb/>
take without adding any argument in sup<lb break="no"/>port of it. It seems to me the time to argue <lb/>
this abstract legal question will be when <lb/>
we come to submit the matter to the Su<lb break="no"/>preme Court, because it would be to some <lb/>
extent forestalling the judgment of the Su<lb break="no"/>preme Court if we were to argue it here <lb/>
to-day. I will be content at present to leave <lb/>
it to the House to appreciate how far my <lb/>
conclusions flow from the position I lay <lb/>
down. My hon. friend who spoke last said <lb/>
the fathers of confederation provided for <lb/>
the then present. So far as I am concerned, <lb/>
as I read the Confederation Act, the inten<lb break="no"/>tion was to provide for the then present and <lb/>
to provide for the future, and it is because <lb/>
I maintain that the British North America <lb/>
Act provided for the future that I have <lb/>
reached the conclusion to which I will have <lb/>
occasion to refer by and by. Am I right <lb/>
when I say that the British North America <lb/>
Act provided for the future, and that when <lb/>
the British North America Act was passed <lb/>
 

<cb/>

it was then in contemplation that we should <lb/>
have a Canada as we have it to-day? Let <lb/>
me read the preamble. The preamble of <lb/>
the British North America Act says: <lb/></p>

<p>There we find that at the time the British <lb/>
North America Act was passed provision <lb/>
was made for the condition of things we <lb/>
have to-day. But, we have more than that. <lb/>
We find that section 146 enacts: <lb/></p>

<p>That is to say, that provision is made <lb/>

for the admission of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories and Rupert's Land on conditions to <lb/>

<p>Rupert's Land came in under the name of <lb/>
Manitoba, and when it came in certain <lb/>
doubts were expressed in respect to the <lb/>
power of the Dominion of Canada to carve <lb/>
out—I use the expression again which I <lb/>
used in the opinion which I gave—to carve <lb/>
out of Rupert's Land the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. Certain doubts were expressed by <lb/>
the late Sir John Macdonald and other mem<lb break="no"/>bers of his government, and as a result the <lb/>
Order in Council, to which my hon. friend <lb/>
referred, was passed. Then, what hap<lb break="no"/>pened? We find that we have what is <lb/>
known as the Doubt Removing Act; that is <lb/>
to say, the British North America Amend<lb break="no"/>ment Act of 1871, in which it is provided <lb/>
that: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The parliament of. Canada may from time to <lb/>

establishment, make provision for the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion and administration of any such province, <lb/>
and for the passing of laws for the peace, or<lb break="no"/>der, and good government of such province, and <lb/>

<p>The Dominion parliament shall have the <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The following Acts passed by the said par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada, and entitled respectively: <lb/>

<p>That is to say, the Act passed by the Do<lb break="no"/>minion carving Manitoba out of Rupert's, <lb/>
Land in 1870, is declared by this Imperial <lb/>
Act as having been properly passed, and the <lb/>
Act of 1870 is now to be construed as if it <lb/>
had been an Act of the imperial parliament. <lb/>
Acting on this theory, that this Act here con<lb break="no"/>firms the first Act and made it imperial <lb/>
legislation, I ventured to make the statement <lb/>
that the Dominion of Canada did carve Mani<lb break="no"/>toba out of Rupert's Land. My hon. friend <lb/>
(Mr. Northrup) cavils with that statement. I <lb/>
say that the Imperial Act of 1871 says that <lb/>
what we did in 1870 was good, and that it <lb/>
gave to the Act of 1870 absolutely the same <lb/>
effect as if it were done by the imperial par<lb break="no"/>liament, and my hon. friend says it is an <choice><sic>in<lb break="no"/>corrrect</sic><corr>incorrect</corr></choice> statement in law to assert that Can<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

ada had carved out of Rupert's land the <lb/>
province of Manitoba. I am willing to ac<lb break="no"/>cept his criticism. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). Would the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice permit me to ask a question <lb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). I merely ask for <lb/>

we get power to provide for the representa<lb break="no"/>tion of the North-west Territories. Is it <lb/>
not under section four of the Act to which <lb/>
the hon. gentleman has just referred. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. Yes. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). Does the hon. <lb/>

between section four and section two. Sec<lb break="no"/>tion two dealing with provinces (therefore <lb/>
not applying to the territories) provides <lb/>
specially for representation in addition to <lb/>
providing for laws for the peace, order and <lb/>
good government; whereas section four pro<lb break="no"/>vides for the making of laws for the peace, <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>On from and after the said day on which the <lb/>

that to be the case but section four goes on <lb/>
to say: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The said province shall be represented, in <lb/>
the first instance, in the House of Commons, by <lb/>
four members, and for that purpose, shall be <lb/>
divided by proclamation of the Governor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, into four electoral districts, each of which <lb/>
shall be represented by one member: provided <lb/>
that on the completion of the census in the year <lb/>
1881, and of each decennial census afterwards, <lb/>
the representation of the said province shall <lb/>
be readjusted according to the provisions of <lb/>
the fifty-first section of the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act, 1867. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>That is to say, that we have this Act <lb/>
which provides for the admission of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba into confederation; we have this Act <lb/>
making all the conditions and all the terms <lb/>
of the British North America Act applicable <lb/>
to Manitoba; and we have moreover special <lb/>
provision made that there shall be a read<lb break="no"/>justment of the representation of Manitoba <lb/>
after each decennial census subsequent to <lb/>
the year 1871, and that with respect to that <lb/>
redistribution or readjustment, section fifty-<lb break="yes"/>one of the British North America Act shall <lb/>
be made applicable, section flfty-one being <lb/>
the section which applies to the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, so far as Manitoba is concerned, <lb/>
after the Act was passed, what is the condi<lb break="no"/>tion of affairs? Is the Act of 1867 not to <lb/>
be read and construed by the light of the <lb/>
subsequent amendment of 1870, and are you <lb/>
not bound to give effect to all the terms and <lb/>
conditions of the British North America Act <lb/>
with respect to Manitoba; and are you not <lb/>
bound in so far as the redistribution of <lb/>
Manitoba is concerned by the terms of sec<lb break="no"/>tion fifty-one? My hon. friend (Mr. Borden) <lb/>
says that you have got to be careful, and you <lb/>
have to watch scrupulously the effect of each <lb/>
word contained in the British North America <lb/>
Act; that the British North America Act is <lb/>
a treaty between the different provinces. I <lb/>
agree with that. It was so stated at the time <lb/>
the British North America Act was introduc<lb break="no"/>ed by Lord Carnarvon in the House of Lords, <lb/>
and it has been since stated on two differ<lb break="no"/>ent cases by the Supreme Court of Canada. <lb/>
But what is the effect? The British North <lb/>
America Act is a treaty as between the four <lb/>
provinces which were parties to it at its in<lb break="no"/>ception; but it is also a treaty with respect <lb/>
to the provinces which came in afterwards, <lb/>
and if the four provinces which were parties <lb/>
to the British North America Act originally, <lb/>
accept other partners in the concern, they <lb/>
are bound by the terms and conditions upon <lb/>
which the other partners come in. They <lb/>
were free to modify the treaty. A treaty <lb/>
could not be modified by outside parties, but <lb/>
by those who were parties to it, and these <lb/>
parties can agree to modify the terms as <lb/>
they choose. Therefore, when the four ori<lb break="no"/>ginal provinces say to Manitoba: We agree <lb/>
to your coming into confederation, and you <lb/>
are to be governed by the same stipulations <lb/>
that apply to us, and with respect to your re<lb break="no"/>




<cb/>

presentation you are to be governed by sec<lb break="no"/>tion fifty-one of the British North America <lb/>
Act, what is the conclusion? The conclu<lb break="no"/>sion is: After that Act was passed sec<lb break="no"/>tion fifty-one of the British North America <lb/>
Act must be read in the light of the amend<lb break="no"/>ing Act, and so is thereafter to read instead <lb/>
of 'four provinces' ' five provinces;' and in<lb break="no"/>stead of ' Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick <lb/>
and Nova Scotia;' 'Quebec, Ontario, New <lb/>
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Manitoba.' <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, we are free so far as Manitoba is <lb/>
concerned. And what do we find after that? <lb/>
We then find British Columbia coming in. <lb/>
British Columbia comes in on an address <lb/>
from the Legislative Council of the province <lb/>
of British Columbia to the parliament of <lb/>
Canada. The parliament of Canada, the <lb/>
House of Commons and the Senate, also <lb/>
passed addresses. The addresses of the <lb/>
House of Commons and of the Senate are <lb/>
in terms identical with the address pre<lb break="no"/>sented on behalf of the Legislative Council <lb/>
of British Columbia. These addresses from <lb/>
the House of Commons of Canada and from <lb/>
the Senate of Canada and from the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council of British Columbia are sent <lb/>
over to England. There an Order in Council <lb/>
is passed and the Order in Council takes in <lb/>
the terms of the addresses that were pre<lb break="no"/>sented, and says in effect: That the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of British Columbia is admitted into <lb/>
confederation on the terms and stipulations <lb/>
provided in the addresses. Let us see what <lb/>
these addresses are. You find for instance <lb/>
with reference to British Columbia, that in <lb/>
the Order in Council of the 16th May. 1871, <lb/>
it is represented:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>And whereas by addresses from the Houses <lb/>
of the parliament of Canada and from the legis<lb break="no"/>lative council of British Columbia respectively, <lb/>

was prayed, by and with the advice of Her Most <lb/>

recited Act, to admit British Columbia into the, <lb/>

<p>What are the terms and conditions? <lb/></p>

<p>Now, let us take the province of Prince <lb/>

complied with there. You had your ad<lb break="no"/>dresses from both Houses of parliament <lb/>
here, and you also had an address from the <lb/>
parliament of Prince Edward Island. What <lb/>
do we find in the addresses? We find the <lb/>
same terms as in the case of British Col<lb break="no"/>umbia. <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>That the population of Prince Edward Island <lb/>

Prince Edward Island had been one of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces originally united by the said Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Now, we have reached the last one of the <lb/>
provinces, and what is the position? You <lb/>
have the British North America Act in the <lb/>
pleamble providing for the admission of <lb/>
these provinces into confederation; you have <lb/>
section 145 of the British North America Act <lb/>
which makes provision for the way in which <lb/>
they are to be brought in; you have got the <lb/>
arrangement which contains specifically the <lb/>
words; that they stipulate that their re<lb break="no"/>presentation is to be readjusted under the <lb/>
British North America Act, and that they <lb/>
specially provide that they are to be dealt <lb/>
with in all respects as if they had been part <lb/>
and parcel of the original provinces when <lb/>
the Confederation Act was first passed. <lb/>
They say you shall deal with us absolutely <lb/>
on the same terms and subject to the same <lb/>
conditions as those in which we came in. <lb/>
What was the result of that? How was <lb/>
their representation to be readjusted? The <lb/>
British North America Act provides for re<lb break="no"/>adjustment by section fifty-one. <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>On the completion of the census in the year <lb/>

Canada, from time to time provides subject and <lb/>
according to the following rules. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Where are they? If my construction of <lb/>
the Act be not correct, if we are to be held <lb/>
to the words of the British North America <lb/>
Act, without any regard to subsequent le<lb break="no"/>gislation, there is provision made here for a <lb/>

<cb/>

readjustment of the representation of the <lb/>
four provinces and nothing else. If that <lb/>
Act has not been amended, you have simply <lb/>
four provinces, the representation of which <lb/>
you can readjust. What an absurd conclu<lb break="no"/>sion that would be. The only sensible <lb/>
logical view is that what you are called on <lb/>
to readjust is the representation of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Canada existing at the time such <lb/>
readjustment must be made. That is to say, <lb/>
that the British North America Act, like every <lb/>
other Act, has always to be construed as if <lb/>
it were passed at the time you are seeking <lb/>
to put it into operation. It is consequently <lb/>
necessary, under section 51, to make to-day <lb/>
provision for the readjustment, not of the <lb/>
four provinces, as they stood when the Act <lb/>
passed, but of the seven provinces composing <lb/>
confederation to-day. This has never hither<lb break="no"/>to been questioned. In 1871 provision was <lb/>
made for readjustment in more than four <lb/>
provinces, also in 1881, and in 1891 a read<lb break="no"/>justment was made of the representation <lb/>
of all the seven provinces. Where did the <lb/>
parliament of Canada get authority to read<lb break="no"/>just the seven provinces in 1891, if not in <lb/>
section 51? Have) all those eminent men, <lb/>
who took part in the legislation of those <lb/>
years, been entirely at fault? Is it pos<lb break="no"/>sible that they were so blinded, so ignorant, <lb/>
so absolutely incapable as not to understand <lb/>
where they got their authority to pass the <lb/>
legislation they did? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). It is contended <lb/>
that if you take the four provinces, as they <lb/>
originally stood, there would be, under pre<lb break="no"/>sent circumstances, no decrease in the re<lb break="no"/>presentation of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick <lb/>

a controlling influence in that regard? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. Not if, <lb/>
as my hon. friend said a moment ago, it <lb/>
was in the address stated specifically that <lb/>
the representation was reduced to 64. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FRAS9">Mr. FRASER</persName>. Would that be true also, <lb/>
without any reference at all to Quebec? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. The Bri<lb break="no"/>tish parliament can undoubtedly amend the <lb/>
Act at any time. As to whether they would <lb/>
or could constitutionally exercise the <lb/>
right is another question; it is extremely <lb/>
doubtful. I am replying simply to an <lb/>
abstract legal question. If the parliament <lb/>
that has power to pass an Act con<lb break="no"/>tinues to exist, it must necessarily have <lb/>
power to amend or repeal it. That is an ele<lb break="no"/>mentary principle in constitutional law. And <lb/>
as the result of the subsequent action of the <lb/>
imperial parliament, section 51 was amended <lb/>
so as to make the first clause read 'seven ' <lb/>
provinces instead of four. That, I submit <lb/>
respectfully, concludes the matter, because <lb/>
if the representation of the seven provinces <lb/>
is to be readjusted, it must be readjusted by <lb/>
the parliament of Canada. What is the <lb/>
parliament of Canada? It is the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment which has control over the seven pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to be readjusted, and in which those <lb/>
provinces are represented? Canada must <lb/>
of necessity mean the whole of the provinces <lb/>
as they exist at the time. What is the re<lb break="no"/>sult? The result is that, section 51 being <lb/>
applicable, you have, when you proceed <lb/>
to readjust your provices, to be governed <lb/>
by it. The province of Quebec shall have <lb/>
a fixed number of 65 members. That pro<lb break="no"/>vince is of course out of court, but it is <lb/>
the pivotal province. It is by the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of Quebec that the whole redistribution <lb/>
of the country is to be settled. <lb/></p> 

<p>Subsection 2 of section 51 provides: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>There shall be assigned to each of the other <lb/>
provinces such a. number of members as will <lb/>
bear the same proportion to the number of its <lb/>
population (ascertained at such census) as the <lb/>
number 65 bears to the number of the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of Quebec (so ascertained). <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>What is the result? The unit of represen<lb break="no"/>tation is 25,367 and a fraction, Ontario hav<lb break="no"/>ing a population of 1,648,898, the population <lb/>
of the Dominion being 2,182,947, the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of Quebec being 65. The Act <lb/>
works automatically. It is a mere question <lb/>
 



<cb/>

of proportion—as 1,648,898, the population, <lb/>
of Ontario, is to 2,182,947, so is 65 to x. <lb/>
The result is 86-05, and we find that read<lb break="no"/>justed, the represention would be in this <lb/>
House: <lb/></p>

<p>The question naturally arises, how do you <lb/>
justify the decrease in the representation of <lb/>
the provinces of Ontario, Nova Scotia, New <lb/>
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. I <lb/>
may say at once that with respect to Prince <lb/>
Edward Island, there is no necessity for any <lb/>
argument, because whatever view you take, <lb/>
whether or not you construe the term ' Can<lb break="no"/>ada' in subsection 4 of section 51 to in<lb break="no"/>clude only the four original provinces or to <lb/>
mean Canada as it is to-day, the island is, <lb/>
in either case, out of court. But with re<lb break="no"/>spect to the provinces of Ontario, Nova <lb/>
Scotia and New Brunswick, if you construe <lb/>
the term 'Canada' to mean only the four <lb/>
original provinces, then their representation <lb/>
would not be reduced, but if you take it to <lb/>
cover all the provinces then their represen<lb break="no"/>tation will be reduced to the figures I have <lb/>
given. The only question to be determined <lb/>
therefore is What is the meaning of the <lb/>
word 'Canada ' in that subsection 4. I say <lb/>
it must of necessity mean Canada as it is <lb/>
at present and not merely the four original <lb/>
provinces. I shall not attempt to argue that <lb/>
question out now, because it seems to me <lb/>
that it would be to some extent unseemly <lb/>
that I should present here a legal argument <lb/>
which should be more properly submitted to <lb/>
the Supreme Court. I wish merely to state <lb/>
the position I take. But I should state to <lb/>
the House that this question is, of course, one <lb/>
that the House is free to discuss—I am not <lb/>
arguing that the House is not free; it is <lb/>
a matter of taste. But I say that this ques<lb break="no"/>tion is one to which I have given considerable <lb/>
thought. At the same time, as I had oc<lb break="no"/>casion to say once or twice before, I am <lb/>
not absolutely infallible; and I thought it <lb/>
was proper for me to get the opinion of some <lb/>
outside counsel on the question, and I did <lb/>
do so. I thought I could not do better than <lb/>
get the opinion of so eminent an authority <lb/>
as Mr. Christopher Robinson, who entirely <lb/>
agrees with the views I take. He says: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>In my opinion, ' Canada.' in section 51, sub<lb break="no"/>section 4: means Canada as now constituted. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>And he goes on to say: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>I do not agree with what I understand to be <lb/>
the contention of Nova Scotia. and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick that for the purposes of readjustment it <lb/>
means only the four original provinces. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Now, that is the case as I want to put it; <lb/>
that is the case as I understand it; and that <lb/>
is the case as I am prepared to argue it in <lb/>
the Supreme Court. I hope the matter will <lb/>

be disposed of there. I think it is a case <lb/>
that ought to be argued, not because I have <lb/>
any doubt whatever of the soundness of <lb/>
the view I take, but for the simple reason <lb/>
that, when you are taking from a province <lb/>
a political right, when you are depriving a <lb/>
province of a certain number of represen<lb break="no"/>tatives, it is proper that every possible fa<lb break="no"/>cility should be given to make it clear that, <lb/>
if they have rights that are being interfered <lb/>
with by parliament, those rights will be <lb/>
construed by a proper tribunal. We want <lb/>
to have a fair redistribution; we do not <lb/>
want to take from any province what it has. <lb/>
On the contrary, we are of those who be<lb break="no"/>lieve that every constitutional right vested <lb/>
in a province is to be construed as sacred <lb/>
and is not to be lightly interfered with, is. <lb/>
not to be interfered with unless it is abso<lb break="no"/>lutely certain that, under the operation of: <lb/>
the Act, it is necessary that we should do <lb/>
so. For that reason, and not that I have <lb/>
any doubt, the matter is to be referred to <lb/>
the Supreme Court. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BARK1">Mr. S. BARKER</persName> (Hamilton). I do not <lb/>
propose to occupy the time of the House in <lb/>
following the legal arguments that have been <lb/>
advanced by hon. gentlemen on this side <lb/>
of the House or by the Minister of Justice <lb/>
(Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick). But I do propose <lb/>
to adopt the words of Sir Henry Strong, <lb/>
quoted by my hon. friend from East Hast<lb break="no"/>ings (Mr. Northrup), in which he said we <lb/>
were entitled, in such a case as this, to refer <lb/>
to the history of the matter, to look at the <lb/>
circumstances of the time and see what was <lb/>
intended by those who, as delegates from <lb/>
the various provinces, sought to frame con<lb break="no"/>federation. I may say a word or two as to <lb/>
the Minister of Justice, not for the purpose <lb/>
of following legal argument, but to show <lb/>
the House wherein our position differs from <lb/>
the argument he has advanced. The hon. <lb/>
minister says that it is the duty of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to redistribute after each census. I <lb/>
do not know that that is questioned. I take <lb/>
it that it is as the hon. minister says. But <lb/>
the hon. Minister of Justice will not dis<lb break="no"/>pute—I am sure he will admit-that where <lb/>
the readjustment of representation comes in <lb/>
question that readjustment must take place <lb/>
before you can redistribute; and it is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the law as to the readjustment of <lb/>
the numerical representation of the provin<lb break="no"/>ces that we are really now discussing, not <lb/>
the redistribution of the constituencies. Now, <lb/>
with regard to that, the Minister of Justice <lb/>
has referred to the Manitoba Act as if that <lb/>
was inconsistent with the position taken by <lb/>
the leader of the opposition (Mr. Borden, <lb/>
Halifax), and by my hon. friend from East <lb/>
Hastings. I think that, perhaps, the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice has overlooked the excep<lb break="no"/>tion in the Manitoba Act which brings the <lb/>
Manitoba legislation into practically the <lb/>
same position with the introduction of pro<lb break="no"/>vinces under Orders in Council. The second <lb/>
section, which has already been referred <lb/>
to says that: </p>

<cb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>
On and from such a day aforesaid— <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>—That is the day on which the Order in <lb/>
Council shall introduce Manitoba as a pro<lb break="no"/>vince— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>—the provisions of the British North America <lb/>
Act, 1867, shall, except those parts thereof <lb/>
which are in terms made or by reasonable in<lb break="no"/>tendment may be held to be clearly applicable <lb/>
to or only to affect one or more but not the <lb/>
whole of the provinces. <lb/></p></quote> 

<p>Now, there is an exception preserving, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to our contention, the very provision <lb/>
we are talking about. The fifty-first section <lb/>
and the eighth section, according to our con<lb break="no"/>tention, provides for readjustment of the <lb/>
four provinces originally united, and these <lb/>
two provisions especially relate to one or <lb/>
more provinces and are therefore expressly <lb/>
excepted from the provisions of the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba Act. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. Were <lb/>
there other provinces at that time? <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:BARK1">Mr. BARKER</persName>. There were other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces brought in. I am going to deal with <lb/>
that in a moment. That is another point <lb/>
rather in favour of our contention. The <lb/>
other provinces brought in by Orders in <lb/>
Council, after addresses sent to England by <lb/>
the provinces and the Dominion, come under <lb/>
clause 146 of the British North America Act, <lb/>
and that section of the Act expressly pro<lb break="no"/>vides that when addresses are sent by the <lb/>
incoming provinces and by the Dominion <lb/>
stating the terms and conditions on which <lb/>
the incoming provinces propose to enter, <lb/>
they shall, upon the Order in Council being <lb/>
passed in Great Britain, become members of <lb/>
the union, subject to the provisions of the <lb/>
British North America Act—subject, that is, <lb/>
to the very same condition put into the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba Act that the special provision relating <lb/>
to one or more provinces shall not be affected <lb/>
by what appears in the addresses. So that <lb/>
no matter what province you take that may <lb/>
have become part of the Dominion, whether <lb/>
under the Manitoba Act or under Orders in <lb/>
Council, you find that the addresses pursu<lb break="no"/>ant to section 146 in the one case and the <lb/>
Manitoba Act in the other, are expressly <lb/>
subject to the special provisions of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America Act, as to the relative <lb/>
representation of. the original four provinces. <lb/>
In other words, the addresses are subject to <lb/>
the conditions of the British North America <lb/>
Act. Provinces may enter the Dominion on <lb/>
any terms and conditions that they and the <lb/>
Dominion may agree upon, no matter what <lb/>
they are; but, whatever these terms and <lb/>
conditions may be they shall be all subject <lb/>
to the special provisions of the British North <lb/>
America Act as to any one or more pro<lb break="no"/>vinces; and, as we contend, no matter what <lb/>
their agreement may be as to representation <lb/>
or anything else, they are admitted according <lb/>
to the bargain they have made; subject, <lb/>
however, to this: that that bargain or agree<lb break="no"/>ment shall not interfere with the special pro<lb break="no"/>vision made in the original Act respecting <lb/>

the readjustment of the four original pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. That, Mr. Speaker, is our contention. <lb/>
Now, I do not propose to go on and take up <lb/>
the time of the House in arguing that ques<lb break="no"/>tion, because, as the Minister of Justice says, <lb/>
it is more properly a question for the court. <lb/>
But I wish to point out that the Minister <lb/>
of Justice has dealt with clause 8 and clause <lb/>
51 as if these clauses read not the four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces but each of the provinces of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. He treats the four provinces for <lb/>
this purpose as if at the time the words <lb/>
' each of the provinces ' were inserted. Now, <lb/>
I propose to show, by taking the resolutions <lb/>
of the conference which framed the Act, <lb/>
that the delegates deliberately avoided us<lb break="no"/>ing the words ' each province,' that they, on <lb/>
occasion, used those words and then struck <lb/>
them out and substituted the words which <lb/>
appear in the Act to-day. For some reason <lb/>
which they well considered, no doubt, seek<lb break="no"/>ing to provide for the readjustment of <lb/>
the representation of the four original pro<lb break="no"/>vinces - they did not want to use words <lb/>
which might leave any doubt. I would re<lb break="no"/>fer to the original resolutions prepared <lb/>
by the conference and presented in Lon<lb break="no"/>don, as found at page 101 of Pope's Con<lb break="no"/>federation documents. Caluse 20 of that <lb/>
document, with some change, has became sec<lb break="no"/>tion 51 of the Act; and it reads thus: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Immediately after the completion of the cen<lb break="no"/>sus of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-<lb break="yes"/>one, and immediately after every decennial cen<lb break="no"/>sus thereafter, the representation from each <lb/>
province in the House of Commons shall be re<lb break="no"/>adjusted on the basis of population, such re<lb break="no"/>adjustment to take effect upon the termination <lb/>
of the then existing parliament. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Then follow as separate sections the other <lb/>
provisions that now form the subsections <lb/>
of section 51. Now, we go on, and at page <lb/>
126 we find What is called the rough draft <lb/>
of the Act that was to be submitted to the <lb/>
British House of Commons. We find in that <lb/>
rough draft the same words are followed, <lb/>
' from each province,' instead of ' the four <lb/>
provinces,' as they now appear in the Act. <lb/>
 <lb/></p> 

<p>The clause in these words: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>18. The House of Commons shall be consti<lb break="no"/>tuted upon the basis of representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation. and shall consist of 181 members distri<lb break="no"/>buted as follows: To Upper Canada, 82; Lower <lb/>
Canada, 65: Nova Scotia, 19; and to New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, 15; and after the decennial census of <lb/>
1871, and every decennial census thereafter, <lb/>
upon the determination, by dissolution or other<lb break="no"/>wise of the parliament then existing, the re<lb break="no"/>presentation from each province shall be re<lb break="no"/>adjusted, and for that purpose Lower Canada <lb/>
shall always be assigned 65 members, and to <lb/>
each of the other provinces at such readjust<lb break="no"/>ment shall be assigned the number of members <lb/>
to which it will be entitled in the same ratio <lb/>
of representation as Lower Canada will have. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Then on page 147 we have What is called <lb/>
the first draft. It is marked 'Confidentlal, <lb/>
23rd January, 1867. Draft of a Bill.' There <lb/>
we find the same clause in section 25.</p>

manner, and from such time, as any Act of the <lb/>

<p>There for the first time we find the words <lb/>
'of the four provinces,' after twice using the <lb/>
words 'each province,' which would follow <lb/>
the construction the Minister of Justice is <lb/>
seeking to put upon the present Act. Now <lb/>
it is singular that in the third draft of the <lb/>
Bill they come back to the words ' from each <lb/>
province. That clause is number 34, and <lb/>
evidently during the hammering away at this <lb/>
Bill and trying to meet all the difficulties <lb/>
that existed in confederating these provinces, <lb/>
they first in the resolutions, and then in the <lb/>
other draft of the Bill, use the words each <lb/>
province'; next, in what is called 'first <lb/>
draft,' they use the words 'four provinces '; <lb/>
then in another draft of the Bill they go <lb/>
back to the words ' from each province,' and <lb/>
finally in the last draft and in the Act itself <lb/>
use the significant words, 'of the four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.' I do not dispute for a moment that <lb/>
if they had adhered to ' each province,' both <lb/>
in the 8th clause and in the 51st clause, there <lb/>
would be a great deal in the argument of <lb/>
the Minister of Justice. But they deliber<lb break="no"/>ately abandoned it. In the final draft and in <lb/>
the Act which was passed they come back <lb/>
to the words that we are now discussing. <lb/>
'the four provinces,' the four original pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, what is the meaning <lb/>
of all these changes? These changes were <lb/>
being discussed by statesmen who were <lb/>
"sent from Canada as the delegates of four <lb/>
provinces to arrange the terms of confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. The delegates were settling these <lb/>
provisions with regard to existing difficul<lb break="no"/>ties between the provinces. They were <lb/>
negotiating the conditions of confederation. <lb/>
We all know the difficulties that existed at <lb/>
that time between Lower Canada and Upper <lb/>
Canada. There was the burning question <lb/>
of representation by population, and there <lb/>
were difficulties between the provinces down <lb/>
by the sea and ourselves. There was a <lb/>
divergence of interests. At the first meeting <lb/>
two years before, there were six provinces <lb/>
represented; Newfoundland and Prince <lb/>
Edward Island were represented and took <lb/>
part in the first discussion. Newfoundland <lb/>
dropped out, and then the five provinces <lb/>
attempted to settle the difficulties. The <lb/>
first difliculty arose because Prince Edward <lb/>
Island wanted more than its share of re<lb break="no"/>presentation, and the other provinces would <lb/>
not agree. Prince Edward Island candidly <lb/>
admitted that they could not argue that <lb/>
they were entitled to six members, but they <lb/>
said: There is no use talking to us about <lb/>
coming into confederation if you insist upon <lb/>
our having only our proportion according <lb/>
to population: you must give us six or we <lb/>

cannot come in. The four would not agree <lb/>
to it, and Prince Edward Island dropped <lb/>
out. Then the four got together at West<lb break="no"/>minster, and having discussed all the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties that existed between them, the <lb/>
statesmen who had lived all their lives <lb/>
amidst political difficulties, set to work, and <lb/>
the thing that seems to have received the <lb/>
most consideration from them was the word<lb break="no"/>ing of this very 51st clause. They started <lb/>
with the very words that would suit my <lb/>
hon friend, 'from each province'; they put <lb/>
them in twice or three times, then abandon<lb break="no"/>ed them. They were dealing with the trou<lb break="no"/>bles and divergent interests of four provin<lb break="no"/>ces, Upper and Lower Canada, Nova Scotia <lb/>
and New Brunswick; those are the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces they were dealing with in that 51st <lb/>
section; and it is rather singular that you <lb/>
find, when they use the words ' the four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces,' they for the first time make the <lb/>
other provisions relating to readjustment of <lb/>
the numerical representation a mere subsec<lb break="no"/>tion of 51. When they come to deal with <lb/>
this whole subject, confining the subject-<lb break="yes"/>matter to the four original provinces, they <lb/>
make the connected provisions subsections <lb/>
of 51 so that there might be no difliculty <lb/>
with the details, and that that word 'Can<lb break="no"/>ada,' that comes in subsection (4), should be <lb/>
understood as limited to the subject of the <lb/>
main part of the section, the four provinces. <lb/>
Now I refer for a moment to clause 8 of the <lb/>
Act. This is not the clause that I read from <lb/>
the resolutions, it is a clause that does not <lb/>
seem to have come in until they were fram<lb break="no"/>ing the Act. <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>8. In the general census of the population of <lb/>
Canada which is hereby required to be taken <lb/>
in the year 1871 d in every tenth year there<lb break="no"/>after, the respective populations of the four <lb/>
provinces shall be distinguished— <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Why distinguished? Why did they want <lb/>
the respective populations of the four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to be distinguished when, as the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice says, they were contemplat<lb break="no"/>ing a Dominion consisting of many pro<lb break="no"/>vinces? If they were looking to a general <lb/>
provision in that section, why did they not <lb/>
say ' of each province of the Dominion' or <lb/>
'of each province'? But they deliberately <lb/>
use the words "four provinces', just as in <lb/>
51 'each province,' was struck out and the <lb/>
particular words 'four provinces ' substitut<lb break="no"/>ed. Section 51 reads: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>On the completion of the census in 1871 and <lb/>
of each subsequent decennial census, the re<lb break="no"/>presentation of the four provinces shall be re<lb break="no"/>adjusted by such authority and in such man<lb break="no"/>ner and at such time as the parliament of Can<lb break="no"/>ada from time to time provides, subject and <lb/>
according to the following rules:— <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>The following rules are the five subsec<lb break="no"/>tions that were in the old resolutions as in<lb break="no"/>dependent sections. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now allusion has been made to the words <lb/>
'parliament of Canada.' Well, that phrase <lb/>
has a clear and distinct meaning. Clearly <lb/>

<cb/>

it implies here something more than a par<lb break="no"/>liament of the four provinces, because there <lb/>
can be no parliament of Canada except the <lb/>
parliament of the whole Dominion. There <lb/>
can be no difficulty about the construction <lb/>
of that phrase. <lb/></p> 

<p>Here I may refer to another matter. Whe<lb break="no"/>ther the parliament of Canada has power it<lb break="no"/>self to distribute or readjust as has been con<lb break="no"/>sidered settled, because it has been argued <lb/>
that the parliament can itself do what, under <lb/>
this section, it was empowered to authorize <lb/>
others to do. But I would call the attention <lb/>
of the Minister of Justice to the fact that if <lb/>
the construction that we are now putting <lb/>
forward is to have effect, it may be neces<lb break="no"/>sary to reconsider whether that view of its <lb/>
authority is correct. It might be that if the <lb/>
minister's view that section 51 applies to the <lb/>
whole Dominion, was correct, the parliament <lb/>
of Canada might possibly be argued to have <lb/>
power to do what it could authorize some<lb break="no"/>body else to do. But a different construc<lb break="no"/>tion might be reasonable and proper <lb/>
if the parliament of Canada is only to <lb/>
authorize somebody to adjust the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of these particular four provinces. <lb/>
It does not at all follow that the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada would be a proper <lb/>
body to adjust the representation of a par<lb break="no"/>ticular province. I should doubt very much <lb/>
whether, if we took the view that I am now <lb/>
putting forward, parliament has authority <lb/>
at all to distribute, or whether it is not <lb/>
bound to depute that authority to somebody <lb/>

<p>The contention of the hon. gentleman, I <lb/>
know, is very plausible. I think there is very <lb/>
grave doubt as to whether it is correct, and <lb/>
nobody can positively say at the present <lb/>
time that the other contention is absolutely <lb/>
wrong. But we find in the 4th and 5th <lb/>
sections of the British North America Act <lb/>
what the word 'Canada' means where <lb/>
there is no expression to the contrary <lb/>
and no implication to the contrary, and we <lb/>
have the word 'Canada' here without any <lb/>
expression to the contrary, and I contend <lb/>
that the only implication of the meaning of <lb/>
'Canada' here is the four provinces, be<lb break="no"/>cause it is used in the subsection of the <lb/>
main section, which refers only to the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal four provinces called 'Canada.' I <lb/>
would like to point out that the considera<lb break="no"/>tion we are urging is a reasonable one. The <lb/>
four provinces had peculiar reasons for <lb/>
maintaining a certain ratio of representation <lb/>
as between themselves. The men who were <lb/>
settling the terms of confederation were <lb/>
not able within human foresight to see <lb/>
what might be necessary for other provin<lb break="no"/>ces. They had had before them the case of <lb/>
Prince Edward Island, and they were un<lb break="no"/>able to agree upon the terms upon which <lb/>
that province should come in. Were they <lb/>
likely to settle for one hundred years to <lb/>
come upon what terms the balance of the <lb/>
provinces would come in? Surely it was a <lb/>
reasonable thing for them to agree upon <lb/>
terms and conditions as to representation, <lb/>
readjustment, and otherwise, of the four <lb/>
provinces, the circumstances of which they <lb/>
were fully aware of and to leave the terms <lb/>
and conditions upon which the other <lb/>
provinces should come in to be settled under <lb/>
section 146 at the time when these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces might wish to come in. They <lb/>
could, under section 146, make any terms <lb/>
they pleased. It was competent for <lb/>
the Dominion, when a new province came <lb/>
in, to agree that the incoming province <lb/>
should have a fixed representation, not mere<lb break="no"/>ly for ten years, but for twenty years or <lb/>
fifty years. It was competent for them to <lb/>
agree that they should have a representa<lb break="no"/>tion which would increase and not decrease. <lb/>
to agree to any terms they saw fit, subject <lb/>
always to one condition expressed in section <lb/>
146, that its admission should be ' subject <lb/>
to the provisions' of the British North <lb/>
 

<cb/>

America Act. Among these were special <lb/>
provisions that were made between the four <lb/>
provinces in relation to each other and which <lb/>
therefore cannot be affected by any terms <lb/>
that the incoming provinces obtain under <lb/>
the addresses or Orders in Council. The <lb/>
matter strikes me as a reasonable one. A <lb/>
number of delegates met to try and settle <lb/>
the differences between the four provinces <lb/>
existing and which they represented. They <lb/>
had in view the admission of other provin<lb break="no"/>ces and territories. They knew that we <lb/>
had a vast territory in which at that time, <lb/>
I believe, there were only 12,000 inhabitants. <lb/>
How could they foresee the terms upon <lb/>
which it would be reasonable for provinces <lb/>
as yet unborn to come in? Would it <lb/>
have been sensible for men in their posi<lb break="no"/>tion to attempt to do more than they did, <lb/>
which was to settle the terms and conditions <lb/>
between the existing provinces that were <lb/>
confederating and to leave the incoming <lb/>
provinces in the future to make Whatever <lb/>
conditions they saw fit to make at the time <lb/>
and which the Dominion should see fit <lb/>
to grant to them? That is our con<lb break="no"/>tention, and it seems to be a perfectly <lb/>
reasonable one. It seems to me to be what <lb/>
any business men would agree upon who <lb/>
sat down to meet the difficulties that pre<lb break="no"/>sented themselves when these provinces at<lb break="no"/>tempted to confederate. There is another <lb/>
feature, and I would like to point it out, be<lb break="no"/>cause it shows further why it was reason<lb break="no"/>able that the word 'Canada' in the 4th <lb/>
subsection should not include the population <lb/>
outside of the four provinces. Suppose that <lb/>
in 1901, before this census was taken, that <lb/>
there had been a proposition for Newfound<lb break="no"/>land to be brought in, What would have <lb/>
been the effect of it? Ontario, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and Nova Scotia would immediately <lb/>
begin to calculate what the probable popu<lb break="no"/>lations were, and what effect the incoming <lb/>
provinces would have upon the proportion <lb/>
of representation, and if Ontario, for exam<lb break="no"/>ple, saw that the addition of the proposed <lb/>
new province to the aggregate population <lb/>
of the Dominion might have the effect of' <lb/>
placing her outside the one-twentieth limit <lb/>
and subject her to a loss of six members, <lb/>
the natural consequence would be that On<lb break="no"/>tario would say: We will vote against <lb/>
Newfoundland coming in. That will be the <lb/>
result of the contention of the hon. Minister <lb/>
of Justice as to subsection 4. But if the <lb/>
calculation is confined simply to the aggre<lb break="no"/>gate population of the four provinces which <lb/>
constituted Canada as defined in the Act, <lb/>
no trouble can arise. What had the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of British Columbia, what had the <lb/>
population of Manitoba or the North-west <lb/>
Territories to do with the question of the <lb/>
readjustment of the representation of the <lb/>
four provinces? Those populations were fac<lb break="no"/>tors quite outside the subject matter. The <lb/>
four provinces endeavouring to readjust, as <lb/>
between themselves, their relative represen<lb break="no"/>tation would naturally want to know what <lb/>

<fw type="num">1249</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 14, 1903</fw> <fw type="num">1250</fw> 


was the population of each province and <lb/>
what was the aggregate of the four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. That gave them all they wanted to <lb/>
know, and if you interpret the word "Can<lb break="no"/>ada' to mean more than it is defined to <lb/>
mean by sections 3, 4, and 5 of the British <lb/>
North America Act you make it impossible <lb/>
to foresee what the future relative repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of the four provinces may be. In <lb/>
the next twenty-five years we may have a <lb/>
million people in the far west. No man can <lb/>
see what effect that will have upon the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation, and the fact that one-twentieth <lb/>
was put as the margin of stability shows <lb/>
that the framers of confederation were <lb/>
not considering so wide a field. They <lb/>
were confining themselves to the four old <lb/>
provinces whose population was fairly well <lb/>
settled, and the whole of the provisions <lb/>
show that they were framing these words <lb/>
in reference to it. If you take section 51 <lb/>
you will see that it clearly refers in explicit <lb/>
terms to the four provinces, not to the prov<lb break="no"/>inces of the Dominion, but explicitly to the <lb/>
four provinces. When we take subsection <lb/>
4 of that very section we can have no doubt <lb/>
that the word 'Canada' means the four <lb/>
provinces there referred to. Why should <lb/>
you go beyond it? It seems to me a <lb/>
clear and reasonable reading of the <lb/>
words in the main section to use the <lb/>
word ' Canada ' as defined by the Act itself. <lb/>
If you go outside of these four provinces, <lb/>
you introduce a disturbing element. What <lb/>
had these people, dealing with the readjust<lb break="no"/>ment of their own representation, to do <lb/>
with the people that might come into Mani<lb break="no"/>toba or British Columbia? How did that <lb/>
concern the question between themselves? <lb/>
If Ontario and Quebec were jealous of each <lb/>
other, were nervous about the effect of the <lb/>
future upon their relative representation, <lb/>
what had they to do with the number of <lb/>
people that might come into British Colum<lb break="no"/>bia, the North-west Territories or the Yu<lb break="no"/>kon? These were elements quite outside <lb/>
of the calculation. The definition of the <lb/>
word ' Canada ' by the Act is consistent and <lb/>
reasonable with What they were driving at; <lb/>
that is keeping their relative positions, in so <lb/>
far as they could be provided for by Act of <lb/>
parliament. I repeat what other hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men have said, that nobody would, espe<lb break="no"/>cially in the face of the opinion which the <lb/>
hon. Minister of Justice has read, say that <lb/>
there was no doubt upon this question. <lb/></p> 

<p>There certainly is such a doubt that it <lb/>
would be extremely unsafe to go on and <lb/>
provide for a parliament upon a new basis <lb/>
of representation, perhaps elect a par<lb break="no"/>liament, and leave the question in such <lb/>
a condition that hereafter—when Acts <lb/>
have been passed and corporations created <lb/>
and all sorts of interests dealt with—that <lb/>
we might find that under an appeal of pri<lb break="no"/>vate parties to the Privy Council, that, the <lb/>
highest court, decided that all our procedure <lb/>
was irregular? Where does the need for haste <lb/>
arise? This Act cannot have force until <lb/>



<cb/>

the end of this parliament. This parlia<lb break="no"/>ment has two or three years to run yet. <lb/>
What is the difficulty about getting the opin<lb break="no"/>ion of the highest court in the empire to <lb/>
definitely determine this question so that <lb/>
we shall know where we are. We are <lb/>
asked now to discuss this Bill before we <lb/>
get the opinion of the Supreme Court as if <lb/>
there was some urgency that we must deal <lb/>
with it at this moment or not at all. It <lb/>
seems to me that we are putting the cart <lb/>
before the horse. It would be far better for <lb/>
us to first find what the law is. I presume <lb/>
the Minister of Justice would not refer the <lb/>
question to the Supreme Court unless he <lb/>
thought there might be some doubt about <lb/>
it. After we know the law, let us pass an <lb/>
Act in accordance with our authority. But <lb/>
to go on discussing this Bill, before we <lb/>
know what the decision of the court will <lb/>
be, seems to me to be farcical. <lb/></p>

<p>House resumed at eight o'clock. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LANC1">Mr. E. A. LANCASTER</persName> (Lincoln and <lb/>
Niagara). I desire, Mr. Speaker, to say a <lb/>
few words on this very important measure, <lb/>
and to give the reasons why I feel con<lb break="no"/>strained to oppose the second reading of <lb/>
this Bill. It must be conceded that if <lb/>
this Bill is read a second time, then every <lb/>
principle contained in it is endorsed by <lb/>
this House. If it were not that I have <lb/>
other reasons, I might well content myself <lb/>
with the reasons given by the Minister of <lb/>
Justice this afternoon as a justification for <lb/>
opposing the second reading of this Bill <lb/>
under the existing circumstances. The <lb/>
Minister of Justice told us to-day as clearly <lb/>
as he could state it in language, that the <lb/>
measure is not ripe for second reading, for <lb/>
he declared that there may be some doubt <lb/>
concerning the rights of the parties as <lb/>
declared by this Bill. In view of that state<lb break="no"/>ment made by the chief legal adviser of the <lb/>
government, I was somewhat surprised <lb/>
that the right hen. the Prime Minister did <lb/>
not withdraw his motion, and acting upon <lb/>
the advice of his Minister of Justice post<lb break="no"/>pone the second reading of the measure <lb/>
until the rights of the parties were defined <lb/>
by the courts. We are in this position now. <lb/>
We have a very serious constitutional ques<lb break="no"/>tion brought before us. This parliament is <lb/>
asked to legislate in regard to a serious in<lb break="no"/>terference with what has been up to this <lb/>
moment the right of four provinces to a <lb/>
certain representation in this House. We <lb/>
are asked by this Bill to say. without any <lb/>
more ado about it, that a change in the re<lb break="no"/>presentation of these provinces shall be <lb/>
made to their detriment and made at once, <lb/>
and we are asked to declare that, in face <lb/>
of the declaration of the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice on the floor of the House: That it is <lb/>
a question which should be decided by the <lb/>

highest court in the land before it is con<lb break="no"/>cluded by this parliament as to whether <lb/>
that principle is right or wrong. As has <lb/>
been said by the hon. member for Hamilton <lb/>
(Mr. Barker): This is putting the cart be<lb break="no"/>fore the horse. But that is not the worst of <lb/>
it. While the Minister of Justice says that <lb/>
he does not think we ought go far in dis<lb break="no"/>cussing what the decision of the Supreme <lb/>
Court may be; we are at the same time <lb/>
told by him that we should go ahead and <lb/>
by giving this Bill a second reading antici<lb break="no"/>pate the decision of the Supreme Court in <lb/>
favour of the Minister's contention. It <lb/>
seems to me that it that were done the <lb/>
Supreme Court would be in a proper posi<lb break="no"/>tion to say to us: Parliament has already <lb/>
decided on the principle of the Bill and why <lb/>
appear idly before us now and ask us <lb/>
whether you did right or wrong. But Mr. <lb/>
Speaker apart from that I have a stronger <lb/>
opinion on this question than even the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice has. It is not to be wonder<lb break="no"/>ed at that two lawyers should not agree; <lb/>
it is perhaps customary that lawyers, when <lb/>
they are engaged on the opposite side of a <lb/>
case, should not agree; it is also probable <lb/>
that a Conservative lawyer may not agree <lb/>
with the Minister of Justice in a so called <lb/>
Liberal government. However I do agree <lb/>
with the Minister of Justice that there is <lb/>
not much doubt about this question, but <lb/>
I disagree with him as to where this doubt <lb/>
is. I have given considerable attention to <lb/>
this Bill and I have gone into the Acts and <lb/>
into the history of this matter, and 1 have <lb/>
been obliged to come to the conclusion that <lb/>
this Bill provides for a wrong principle, and <lb/>
that a reduction in the representation in <lb/>
this parliament of the provinces of Ontario <lb/>
and New Brunswick and Nova Scotia is <lb/>
not warranted by the law as it stands to<lb break="no"/>day. I therefore believe that this Bill ought <lb/>
not be read a second time upon its <lb/>
merits, and I believe that, apart altogether <lb/>
from the doubt which the Minister of <lb/>
Justice has said he is going to get <lb/>
the Supreme Court to decide upon, I <lb/>
shall have to ask the indulgence of the <lb/>
House if I again call attention to the provi<lb break="no"/>sions of the British North America Act. The <lb/>
first part of the Act to which I shall refer <lb/>
is the one headed ' Union ' and bearing the <lb/>
figures 11 in Roman numerals, being a sub<lb break="no"/>division of the Act. The heading 'Union' <lb/>
applies from section 3 to section 8 both sec<lb break="no"/>tions inclusive. Now this heading ' Union ' <lb/>
and this subdivision of the Act under that <lb/>
heading, is of considerable importance. The <lb/>
first part provides: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>On and after a. day therein appointed, not <lb/>
being more than six months after the passing <lb/>
of this Act, the provinces of Canada, Nova <lb/>
Scotia and New Brunswick shall form and be <lb/>
one Dominion under the name of Canada; and <lb/>
on and after that day those three provinces <lb/>
shall form and be one Dominion under that <lb/>
name accordingly. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>It goes on to say: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The subsequent provisions of this Act shall, <lb/> 




<cb/>

unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, <lb/>
commence and have effect on and after the <lb/>
union, that is to say, on and after the day <lb/>
appointed for the union taking effect in the <lb/>
Queen's proclamation; and in the same pro<lb break="no"/>visions, unless it is otherwise expressed or im<lb break="no"/>plied, the name Canada shall be taken to mean <lb/>
Canada as constituted under this Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>It seems to me with all due deference to <lb/>
the Minister of Justice, that under this <lb/>
British North America Act there is for the <lb/>
purposes of this Act no other constitution of <lb/>
Canada than the province of Ontario, Que<lb break="no"/>bec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia—the <lb/>
two provinces Ontario and Quebec being <lb/>
known as Canada at that date. It seems to <lb/>
me to be begging very hard for some argu<lb break="no"/>ment to say that these positive and distinct <lb/>
words 'Canada as constituted under this <lb/>
Act ' can mean anything else than what is <lb/>
stated in subsection 3, which says that <lb/>
Canada consists of the four provinces. <lb/></p> 

<p>We have to ask ourselves what is the <lb/>
next step to take in determining whether <lb/>
this term Canada is to apply to the whole <lb/>
of Canada or to the four provinces for <lb/>
arriving at the number of members for <lb/>
each province. There is one thing which <lb/>
strikes me very forcibly, and which has <lb/>
not yet been referred to. Why does <lb/>
this Act at all say what shall consti<lb break="no"/>tute Canada? What would constitute Can<lb break="no"/>ada if this section were not in the Act? <lb/>
Why, it would simply be, as the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice says, whatever Canada may <lb/>
be at the time. But the difference between <lb/>
the Minister of Justice and myself is that <lb/>
I contend that when these words were put <lb/>
in the Act, they were inserted for some <lb/>
purpose. The efiect would be altogether <lb/>
different had they been omitted. No <lb/>
lawyer of any experience will say that the <lb/>
putting in of these words was a mere <lb/>
surplusage or meant nothing. If they <lb/>
do not mean what we say they do. they <lb/>
would not be in this Act at all, and then <lb/>
Canada would mean exactly what the hon. <lb/>
Minister of Justice says it does. Canada <lb/>
might mean four provinces or five or six or <lb/>
seven, according to the changing circum<lb break="no"/>stances. But what I submit is that the very <lb/>
fact that these words are put in show a <lb/>
special attention to give a special meaning to <lb/>
the word ' Canada.' It shows that the par<lb break="no"/>liament which passed this Act did not intend <lb/>
that the term 'Canada' should bear the <lb/>
ordinary meaning, but that it should apply <lb/>
for the purpose of readjustment to the four <lb/>
original provinces. Has that been changed <lb/>
or repealed by any proper authority? There <lb/>
are other provisions in this Act which show <lb/>
that the term Canada is only intended to <lb/>
cover the four original provinces. Take for <lb/>
instance section thirty-seven: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The House of Commons shall, subject to the <lb/>
provisions of this Act, consist of 181 members, <lb/>
of whom 82 shall be elected for Ontario, 65 for <lb/>
Quebec, 19 for Nova Scotia and 15 for New <lb/>
Brunswick. <lb/></p></quote>

<fw type="num">1253</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 14, 1903</fw> <fw type="num">1254</fw> 

<p>And section forty provides: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Until the parliament of Canada otherwise pro<lb break="no"/>vides, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New <lb/>
Brunswick shall, for the purposes of the elec<lb break="no"/>tion of members to serve in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons, be divided into electoral districts as fol<lb break="no"/>lows. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>The Act does not say that until parlia<lb break="no"/>ment otherwise provides, the number shall <lb/>
be so and so, but only that the electoral <lb/>
districts shall be so and so. Special power <lb/>
is given to provide for the rearranging of <lb/>
those districts, but no power is given to in<lb break="no"/>terfere with the number that shall be <lb/>
elected from each province. Section fifty-<lb break="yes"/>one provides that: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>On the completion of each decennial census <lb/>
the representation of the four provinces shall <lb/>
be readjusted by such authority in such man<lb break="no"/>ner and in such time as the parliament of Can<lb break="no"/>ada from time to time provides, subject and <lb/>
according to the following rules. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>No language could be stronger. And one <lb/>
of these rules, subsection four, is: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>On any such readjustment the number of <lb/>
members for a province shall not be reduced <lb/>
unless the proportion which the number of the <lb/>

last preceding readjustment ot the number of <lb/>
members for the province is ascertained at the <lb/>
then latest census to be diminished by one-<lb break="yes"/>twentieth part or upward. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>It is conceded on both sides that if that <lb/>
be applied to Canada, as originally constitu<lb break="no"/>ted, three of these provinces are entitled to <lb/>
a different representation than is provided <lb/>
for in this Bill. According to section fifty-<lb break="yes"/>two:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The number of members of the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons may be from time to time increased by <lb/>
the parliament of Canada, provided the pro<lb break="no"/>portionate, representation of the provinces pre<lb break="no"/>scribed by this Act is not thereby disturbed. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Thus there is provision for increasing the <lb/>
number of the members. But if a reduction <lb/>
were contemplated, why did not the Act pro<lb break="no"/>vide that the number should be ' increased or <lb/>
reduced.' There is not a word about any re<lb break="no"/>duction, so that we find on all hands cor<lb break="no"/>roboration of the contention put forward by <lb/>
this side of the House, that subsection four <lb/>
of section fifty-one applies only to the four <lb/>
original provinces, and not a word to war<lb break="no"/>rant a different construction being put upon <lb/>
the Act than is to be found in the wording <lb/>
of the Act itself. What has happened since <lb/>
that Act has passed? Has anything been <lb/>
done by the imperial parliament to disturb <lb/>
the effect of the British North America Act <lb/>
as it applies to those four provinces? It is <lb/>
contended that addresses have been pre<lb break="no"/>sented and Orders in Council passed in some <lb/>
cases, and Acts of parliament in others, <lb/>
bringing new partners into the concern. But <lb/>
there was not a word in any of these to <lb/>
show that subsection four of section fifty-<lb break="yes"/>one has been amended. Yet if these ad<lb break="no"/>
 
 
<cb/>

dresses and Orders in Council were to have <lb/>
the effect claimed for them, subsection four <lb/>
of section fifty-one would have to be am<lb break="no"/>ended, and there is no way of amending it <lb/>
except by saying so in the usual and ordi<lb break="no"/>nary way. And if the imperial parliament <lb/>
do not see fit to amend section four or to say <lb/>
anything more than that an agreement <lb/>
is made as regards new provinces coming <lb/>
in, how can these addresses and Orders <lb/>
in Council be construed to mean that <lb/>
the original arrangement between the origi<lb break="no"/>nal provinces was to be disturbed in the <lb/>
least? <lb/></p> 

<p>The last part of section 146 must be borne <lb/>
in mind in order to keep us right in this mat<lb break="no"/>ter. It says: <lb/></p>

the parliament of Canada, and from the Houses <lb/>
of the respective legislatures of the colonies or <lb/>
provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land and British Columbia, to admit those <lb/>
colonies, or provinces, or any of them, into the <lb/>
union, and on address from the Houses of the <lb/>
parliament of Canada to admit either of them, <lb/>
into the union, on such terms and conditions <lb/>
in each case, as are in the addresses expressed <lb/>
and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject <lb/>
to the provisions of this Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Again 'subject to the provisions of this <lb/>
Act?' The Act says you can make a bar<lb break="no"/>gain with these new provinces and let them <lb/>
in on such terms as you may provide, but <lb/>
always subject to the provisions of this Act, <lb/>
and the provision standing out before every<lb break="no"/>body is that you shall not reduce the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of these four provinces except it <lb/>
falls under the condition regarding the one-<lb break="yes"/>twentieth part, provided in subsection 4 <lb/>
before quoted. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. Minister of Justice argued that <lb/>
chapter twenty-eight of thirty-four and five <lb/>
Victoria was a doubt removing Act. <lb/>
That is probably not an inapt expression. <lb/>
But what doubt did it remove? It did not re<lb break="no"/>move any doubt upon the question we are <lb/>
debating. I did not pretend to say, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, that this subsection 4 would no long<lb break="no"/>er apply. It removed a doubt as to the <lb/>
particular matter being dealt with in the <lb/>
Act. The very fact that it had removed <lb/>
that doubt showed that there was a doubt <lb/>
even then with the authorities in Great <lb/>
Britain as to whether the parliament of <lb/>
Canada had power to do that which com<lb break="no"/>pared to what we are being asked to-day to <lb/>
do was a very small matter. I do not <lb/>
think that Act does anything but indirectly <lb/>
strengthen the case made here for the non-<lb break="yes"/>reduction of the number to be elected from <lb/>
the three provinces of Ontario, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and Nova Scotia. The last section of <lb/>
what the minister calls the doubt-removing <lb/>
Act, says: <lb/></p>

far as it relates to the province of Manitoba, <lb/>
or any other Act hereafter established in new <lb/>
provinces in the said Dominion. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Will it be contended that when this says: <lb/>
You shall not, except as provided in the <lb/>
Act and in respect of the small matter with <lb/>
which it deals, interfere With any rights <lb/>
heretofore existing in regard to the province <lb/>
of Manitoba or the new provinces, it im<lb break="no"/>pliedly allows you to make ducks and drakes <lb/>
of the legislation bringing into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion the four provinces of the Dominion of <lb/>
Canada as it at first existed? It could not, <lb/>
even by the utmost stretch of imagination, <lb/>
be made to accomplish such a result. The <lb/>
parliament of Canada has never asked the <lb/>
imperial parliament to repeal or amend <lb/>
section 4, therefore, we are not in a position <lb/>
to say whether they would or would not <lb/>
repeal it if we asked them. But we know <lb/>
that nothing else that they have been asked <lb/>
to do in regard to the other provinces have <lb/>
they ever done except upon the address of <lb/>
the legislature of the province affected. <lb/></p> 

<p>I understood the Minister of Justice to <lb/>
say, in answer to a question by the leader <lb/>
of the opposition (Mr. Borden) that, under <lb/>
the Order in Council that had been passed <lb/>
it would be competent for the representation <lb/>
of the province of Quebec to be reduced to <lb/>
any number. If that is so, if he can, by <lb/>
an Act of parliament approved by Order <lb/>
in Council by the imperial government, re<lb break="no"/>duce the representation in the province of <lb/>
Quebec, why cannot he do the same thing <lb/>
under the statute which gives power for the <lb/>
entry into confederation of the terri<lb break="no"/>tory known at that time as Prince <lb/>
Rupert's Land? The only difference <lb/>
is in the heading, and that cannot <lb/>
affect the case—let it be called Prince <lb/>
Rupert's Land or Quebec, the effect is the <lb/>
same. There is another thing which, I say <lb/>
with all due deference, the Minister of <lb/>
Justice forgot when giving the opinion which <lb/>
was spoken of in the House this afternoon. <lb/>
He forgot the well-known rule of law <lb/>
with regard to the repeal of statutes. Every <lb/>
lawyer who has studied the matter knows, <lb/>
when the question rises whether a subse<lb break="no"/>quent statute repeals a former one you must <lb/>
'lean against repugnancy'— you must as<lb break="no"/>sume that there is no repeal, unless it is <lb/>
expressly so stated or unless there is no <lb/>
construction which can be found consistent <lb/>
with the belief that there has been no <lb/>
repeal. Let me quote, for the benefit of the <lb/>
Minister of Justice and also for the benefit <lb/>
of the laymen as well as the lawyers of the <lb/>
House, the words of Sir Peter Benson Max<lb break="no"/>well, who is acknowledged to be one of the <lb/>
greatest authorities on the constutrction of <lb/>
statutes. In his latest work, this great <lb/>
writer says - I quote from page 134: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>To impute repugnancy is to iuipute ignorance <lb/>
or cariessness of expression or confusion of <lb/>
thought; and not only therefore is repeal by <lb/>
implication not favoured, but any construction <lb/>
involving it is to be rejected in favour of any <lb/>
other which the language will rationally bear. <lb/></p> </quote>
 
 <cb/>

<p>And he gives several decided cases as <lb/>
authority for this view. At page 136, he <lb/>
says: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>When the latter enactment is worded in <lb/>
affirmative terms only without any negative it <lb/>
does not take away the earlier law. The gov<lb break="no"/>erning principle in all these cases is to con<lb break="no"/>strue the Act if possible as reconcilable, and <lb/>
capable of co-existence. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Now, with the indulgence of the House <lb/>
let us apply this principle to the case before <lb/>
us. Here we have an Act showing how the <lb/>
calculation of representation is to be made <lb/>
as between these four provinces. The Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice says that this is by impli<lb break="no"/>cation repealed. He does not contend that <lb/>
there has been an express repeal, nor does <lb/>
the right hon. mover (Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid <lb/>
Laurier) of the second reading of the Bill. <lb/>
But, because certain Orders in Council, <lb/>
which have the effect of statutes as provided <lb/>
for in the Act, have, or are said to have a <lb/>
certain effect, therefore, you must, by im<lb break="no"/>plication read into section 4 'seven' instead <lb/>
of 'four,' and apply it to seven provinces <lb/>
instead of four, or you are not giving the <lb/>
smooth and easy construction required for <lb/>
the purposes of this Bill. But the authority <lb/>
I have quoted makes it clear that if we can <lb/>
find a construction of the two which is con<lb break="no"/>sistent with the non-repeal of the earlier <lb/>
statute, we must accept that interpretation. <lb/>
That is why we say that the Act must have <lb/>
the meaning that we give it. We preserve <lb/>
intact the provision with regard to the one-<lb break="yes"/>twentieth, and we give full force and effect <lb/>
to the Orders in Council which the minister <lb/>
refers to. The fact is, there was a business <lb/>
going on with these four provinces as <lb/>
partners. The other provinces wanted to <lb/>
come in, and were asked to come in. An <lb/>
arrangement mutually satisfactory was <lb/>
made for them to enter the partnership. it <lb/>
is contended, therefore, that there should not <lb/>
be the same construction of the bargain <lb/>
among the four as between themselves that <lb/>
there would have been if the others had not <lb/>
entered. The better interpretation of the <lb/>
law is that the new provinces should be <lb/>
held to the bargain that they made, leaving <lb/>
the other bargain intact, and so there was <lb/>
no repeal. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, with regard to what the Minister <lb/>
of Justice has said as to reducing the re<lb break="no"/>presentation of the province of Quebec. <lb/>
When the hon. gentleman was speaking I <lb/>
thought: Oh! shades of provincial rights, <lb/>
where are you. When we hear a minister <lb/>
in the Liberal government contending that <lb/>
the province of Quebec could have its repre<lb break="no"/>sentation reduced by a mere Act of this <lb/>
parliament, and this with the statutes before <lb/>
him showing that the British parliament has <lb/>
refused to make any changes affecting a <lb/>
province without an address from the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of that province-<lb/> </p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. I suppose <lb/>
the hon. gentleman (Mr. Lancaster) does not <lb/>
mean the House to take him seriously when <lb/>
Ihe attributes such a statement to me. <lb/></p>

 <p><persName ref="pers:LANC1">Mr. LANCASTER</persName>. I am replying to what <lb/>
I think the result of the hon. gentleman's <lb/>
argument. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. I did not <lb/>
understand that. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:LANC1">Mr. LANCASTER</persName>. The argument of the <lb/>
Minister of Justice, as I understand it, was <lb/>
that this could be done. I may point out <lb/>
that these new provinces were not allowed <lb/>
by the imperial government to come into <lb/>
confederation except on address from the <lb/>
legislature of the province as well as of the <lb/>
Dominion. But the logical result of the <lb/>
Minister of Justice's argument is that you <lb/>
could interfere with the existing arrange<lb break="no"/>ment of the four provinces without an ad<lb break="no"/>dress from the legislature of those four <lb/>
provinces or consulting them in any way. <lb/>
I think the conclusion that we must <lb/>
come to with regard to the whole mat<lb break="no"/>ter is that, interpreting the British North <lb/>
America Act as we must interpret it. it is <lb/>
not only doubtful, but I am constrained to <lb/>
say that it is clear to me that you have no <lb/>
right to interfere with the arrangement un<lb break="no"/>der section 4, you must apply that propor<lb break="no"/>tion of one-twentieth to the four provinces. <lb/>
That being so, then, on the merits, this Bill <lb/>
should not be read a second time. but the <lb/>
order should be discharged. the existing ar<lb break="no"/>rangement should be left undisturbed and, <lb/>
applying properly this proportion of one-<lb break="yes"/>twentieth to the four original provinces, On<lb break="no"/>tario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, none of them should be reduced in the <lb/>
number of representatives they send to this <lb/>
House. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DEME3">Mr. L. P. DEMERS</persName> (St. John and Iber<lb break="no"/>ville). (Translation.) I desire, Mr. Speaker, <lb/>
to say a few words, in reply to some remarks <lb/>
fallen from the hon. gentleman (Mr. Lan<lb break="no"/>caster) who has just taken his seat. Clearly, <lb/>
my hon. friend has not caught the exact <lb/>
meaning of the statement made by the hon. <lb/>
Minister of Justice (Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick). I <lb/>
think the question as to whether the <lb/>
representation of the province of Quebec <lb/>
could be reduced by an Act of this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment has never seriously been raised by <lb/>
any member of this House. <lb/></p> 

<p>I agree with the hon. gentleman that the <lb/>
Liberal party has always championed pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights. I wish also to express my <lb/>
entire accord in his remarks, when he said <lb/>
that the provinces having entered into part<lb break="no"/>nership, the British North America Act <lb/>
is a treaty which ought to be fairly carried <lb/>
out by all those who were parties to it. <lb/></p> 

<p>The province of Quebec agreed that she <lb/>
should have a fixed representation of sixty-<lb break="yes"/>five members, provided that the representa<lb break="no"/>tion of the other provinces should be reduced <lb/>
in the event of their population becoming <lb/>
proportionally less considerable than the <lb/>
population of Quebec. In 1872, as also in <lb/>
1882 and in 1892, the province of Quebec <lb/>
has cheerfully concurred in the enforcement <lb/>
of the compact it had been a party to in <lb/>

<cb/>

1867. It is most regrettable that the hon. <lb/>
gentlemen opposite should seek to put a <lb/>
different construction on that Act, now that <lb/>
it becomes incumbent upon parliament to <lb/>
reduce the representation of a sister pro<lb break="no"/>vince. As the hon. Minister of Justice <lb/>
explained this afternoon, the soundness of <lb/>
the view taken by the government cannot be <lb/>
questioned. Section 4, upon which hon. <lb/>
gentlemen opposite have dwelt at length <lb/>
with such evident relish, is not so obscure <lb/>
as they pretend. The last part of that <lb/>
section provides: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>And in the same provisions, unless it is other<lb break="no"/>wise expressed or implied, the name Canada <lb/>
shall be taken to mean Canada as constituted <lb/>
under this Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Now, I appeal to any hon. gentleman who <lb/>
has read the British North America Act <lb/>
whether, in any part of this Act, the Word <lb/>
'Canada' does not cover all the provinces <lb/>
that may join confederation? But let us <lb/>
look at the preamble of the Act, which is <lb/>
as follows: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Whereas the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia <lb/>
and New Brunswick have expressed their desire <lb/>
to be federally united into one Dominion under <lb/>
the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great <lb/>
Britain and Ireland, with a constitution similar <lb/>
in principle to that of the United Kingdom. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Clearly, sir, in this peamble of the Act, <lb/>
Canada means only the province of Ontario <lb/>
and the province of Quebec which were <lb/>
then known, in virtue of the Union Act, <lb/>
under the name of the province of Canada. <lb/>
Prior to confederation, the term Canada <lb/>
applied only to Ontario and Quebec. But <lb/>
under section 4, the word Canada has a <lb/>
much wider meaning as shown by the con<lb break="no"/>cluding words of that section: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, <lb/>
the name Canada shall be taken to mean Can<lb break="no"/>ada as constituted under this Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>That is to say, the union formed under the <lb/>
new constitution. When the word Canada <lb/>
does not cover that union, it means Canada <lb/>
such as is understood in the preamble of the <lb/>
Act. <lb/></p> 

<p>Then, in section four, it says: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The subsequent provisions of this Act shall, <lb/>
unless it is otherwise expressed or implied, <lb/>
commence and have effect on and after the <lb/>
union, that is to say, on and after the day <lb/>
appointed for the union taking effect ...... <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Section 146 enacts that the provinces, <lb/>
which have later on joined confederation, <lb/>
may be admitted into the union, subject to <lb/>
the provisions of this Act. Now, from the <lb/>
very moment those provinces were let in, <lb/>
it was under section 4 that they came in. <lb/>
True, there was a special treaty entered into <lb/>
between those provinces, but apart altogether <lb/>
from such treaty, supposing, for instance, <lb/>
that the entry of Manitoba only had been <lb/>
provided for. section 4 says that that pro<lb break="no"/>vince may be admitted into confederation <lb/>
subject to the provisions of the British North <lb/>
America Act; and therefore it came in under <lb/>

section 4. Sections 4 and 146 should be <lb/>
construed as forming a whole. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, with the indulgence of the House, <lb/>
I shall urge but one objection to the argu<lb break="no"/>ments advanced by the opposition. They <lb/>
pretend that a contract or partnership has <lb/>
been entered into, but the province of Quebec <lb/>
was also one of the contracting parties. It <lb/>
should be borne in mind that the province <lb/>
of Quebec agreed to having a fixed repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of sixty-five members, but it is <lb/>
but fair that it should be given a compensa<lb break="no"/>tion, and that the other provinces should <lb/>
have their representation reduced. It is <lb/>
a policy of give and take. That was a <lb/>
well understood principle from the very <lb/>
outset, as shown by subsection 2 of section <lb/>
51 which says: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>There shall be assigned to each of the other <lb/>
provinces such a number of members as will <lb/>
bear the same proportion to the number of its <lb/>
population (ascertained at such census) as <lb/>
the number 65 bears to the number of the <lb/>
population of Quebec—(so ascertained). <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>So, if there was anything in the minds of <lb/>
the fathers of confederation it was that <lb/>
representation was to be based on popula<lb break="no"/>tion. Such was the principle adopted at the <lb/>
time. Quebec was to have sixty-five members <lb/>
and the other provinces were to be given a <lb/>
proportionate number. Such was the system <lb/>
adhered to by the framers of confederation. <lb/></p> 

<p>The hon. member of Lincoln (Mr. Lan<lb break="no"/>caster) has also referred to the interpreta<lb break="no"/>tion of treaties. But he should not forget <lb/>
that treaties must be interpreted as against <lb/>
the stipulating party. Now, it is agreed that <lb/>
as the province of New Brunswick has not <lb/>
the required population, it cannot rightly <lb/>
claim more members than the number which <lb/>
the government contemplate allotting to the <lb/>
province. Were the matter open to doubt <lb/>
the province should not be given, the <lb/>
benefit of the doubt; but, on the contrary, <lb/>
the treaty should be construed conformably <lb/>
to common law, that is to say, in favour of <lb/>
the main clause of the contract, instead of <lb/>
the exception. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Hon. JOHN HAGGART</persName> (South Lanark). <lb/>
It is with a good deal of diffidence that I <lb/>
approach the discussion of this question. <lb/>
The right hon. gentleman stated in intro<lb break="no"/>ducing this Bill that it was his intention to <lb/>
bring in a measure which would be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to both parties in this House to <lb/>
agree upon. He stated that he was following <lb/>
English precedent, and especially the doc<lb break="no"/>trine laid down by him and his followers <lb/>
when they were in opposition, when they <lb/>
declared that if they had an opportunity of <lb/>
introducing a Redistribution Bill it would <lb/>
be drawn on those lines and would be <lb/>
perfectly fair, a Bill which ought to be <lb/>
acceptable to all parties in the House. The <lb/>
Bill introduced by the right hon. gentleman <lb/>
and his statement in introducing it led me <lb/>
to believe that the Bill would be submitted <lb/>
to a committee, a majority of which would <lb/>
have an opportunity of framing and report<lb break="no"/> 
 
<cb/>

ing the Bill to the House. The principle <lb/>
adopted in England has been set forth by <lb/>
my hon. friend the leader of the opposition. <lb/>
He has shown that the English Bill was the <lb/>
result of a conference, which consisted on <lb/>
behalf of the opposition of Lord Salisbury <lb/>
and Sir Stafford Northcote. They met time <lb/>
and again in the Privy Council. The <lb/>
question that arose was as to the number of <lb/>
members which should be assigned to Eng<lb break="no"/>land, the number to Scotland and the num<lb break="no"/>ber to Ireland. They also had to decide the <lb/>
principle as to whether a suburban popula<lb break="no"/>tion should be attached to a rural popula<lb break="no"/>tion, and they decided the principle that a <lb/>
suburban population should be attached to <lb/>
the cities and an urban population should <lb/>
remain with the counties. The conference <lb/>
decided upon all the leading principles of <lb/>
the Bill, they fixed the unit of representa<lb break="no"/>tion for England, for Scotland and for Ire<lb break="no"/>land, the unit for the counties and the unit <lb/>
for the cities; all the leading principles of <lb/>
the Bill were agreed upon by the conference, <lb/>
and then it was referred to the committee <lb/>
for the purpose of delimiting the various <lb/>
ridings. As my hon. friend the leader of <lb/>
the opposition stated, that committee con<lb break="no"/>sisted of gentlemen from different sections <lb/>
of the country. They had as asistants offi<lb break="no"/>cers of the Royal Engineers, and they made <lb/>
a delimitation to which no objection could <lb/>
possibly be taken. If I understand the <lb/>
right hon. gentleman, he intends that a con<lb break="no"/>ference, composed of members whom he <lb/>
may select and whom the opposition may <lb/>
select, should settle the principles which <lb/>
should be adopted in the delimitation of the <lb/>
different constituencies. That is perfectly <lb/>
fair, we were perfectly willing to accept that <lb/>
proposition. Viewing the conference as re<lb break="no"/>presenting the principles laid down by the <lb/>
opposition in 1892, as interpreted by the <lb/>
Hon. Mr. Davies, by the Hon. Mr. Mills <lb/>
and by Mr. Dalton McCarthy, it was to be <lb/>
a conference designed to come to a mutual <lb/>
agreement, the same as the English con<lb break="no"/>ference in 1884, which settled the principles <lb/>
upon which the delimitation was to take <lb/>
place. The right hon. gentleman in intro<lb break="no"/>ducing this Bill is fixing the number of re<lb break="no"/>presentatives for the different provinces. I <lb/>
suppose he does not intend on the second <lb/>
reading to include that principle. As I under<lb break="no"/>stood him, the question as to whether we <lb/>
are to have a reduced representation in <lb/>
Ontario is to be left with the Supreme <lb/>
Court to decide. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). Ontario and the <lb/>
maritime provinces. <lb/></p>

the question as to whether Ontario, New <lb/>
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island were <lb/>
to be affected in their present representa<lb break="no"/>tion was to be left to the Supreme Court to <lb/>
decide; that is, the interpretation of clause <lb/>
51 and the correlative clauses was to be left <lb/>
to the Supreme Court. If that is the case, <lb/>

he cannot expect us to approve of the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of the Bill, and to say that Ontario <lb/>
should have a certain number of representa<lb break="no"/>tives, and the same with the other provinces <lb/>
except Quebec. He cannot expect us to <lb/>
vote for the second reading of the Bill <lb/>
aflirming the principles which the Minister <lb/>
of Justice says are the governing principles <lb/>
in the Redistribution Act, on which we take <lb/>
issue, and which we understand from the <lb/>
right hon. gentleman are the questions that <lb/>
are to be submitted to the court. But if <lb/>
these clauses fixing the number of members <lb/>
are eliminated from the Bill, I do not see <lb/>
that we can have any objection on this side <lb/>
of the House to a second reading, providing <lb/>
that the Bill does not become law until the <lb/>
Supreme Court has decided whether On<lb break="no"/>tario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward <lb/>
Island must submit to a decreased repre<lb break="no"/>sentation. <lb/></p> 

<p>The British North America Act is the <lb/>
charter and constitution of this Dominion. <lb/>
We have no power to decide whether any <lb/>
Act of ours infringes upon it. The parties <lb/>
who are the custodians of that Act are the <lb/>
imperial authorities and their representa<lb break="no"/>tive here, the Governor General. He has <lb/>
exercised that authority already on the <lb/>
Oaths Bill. When any question arises as to <lb/>
whether the legislation of this parliament <lb/>
is ultra vires of the British North America <lb/>
Act, I consider that it is the duty of the <lb/>
Governor General to consult the law officers <lb/>
of the Crown in England. For these rea<lb break="no"/>sons, I feel a double security. I feel a se<lb break="no"/>curity in the promise which the right hon. <lb/>
gentleman has made to us that the question <lb/>
will be submitted to the Supreme Court; I <lb/>
also feel a security in the fact that the im<lb break="no"/>perial authorities and the Governor General <lb/>
of Canada are the custodians of the British <lb/>
North America Act, who are to decide as to <lb/>
whether any legislation of ours is outside <lb/>
the corners of that Act. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now let me refer to the question which is <lb/>
particularly before the House as to whether <lb/>
there is the right to deprive Ontario or New <lb/>
Brunswick of the number of members which <lb/>
they at present send as representatives to <lb/>
this House. I do so with a good deal of <lb/>
diffidence. I am of the opinion of the hon. <lb/>
Minister of Justice that when the British <lb/>
North America Act was passed it contem<lb break="no"/>plated the present and it contemplated the <lb/>
future, but I will ask the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Justice what is the meaning of clause 8 in <lb/>
that British North America Act in which it <lb/>
states that the four provinces of Canada <lb/>
shall have a separate census taken and then <lb/>
I shall deal with clause 51 of the Act. My <lb/>
contention is that clause 51 of the British <lb/>
North America Act has no application to <lb/>
any of the provinces which might be in fu<lb break="no"/>ture added to the Dominion, that its appli<lb break="no"/>cation is solely and only to the four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and that if an Act of parliament is <lb/>
passed by the imperial authorities on ad<lb break="no"/>dresses from this House and addresses from <lb/>

<cb/>

the different provinces asking that the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the Act shall apply to the differ<lb break="no"/>ent provinces coming into confederation <lb/>
clause 51 would not apply at all. I doubt <lb/>
very much if the Supreme Court, or any <lb/>
lawyer throughout the country, would give <lb/>
the opinion that unless clause 51 is especially <lb/>
mentioned it would apply in connection with <lb/>
the redistribution after any decennial census <lb/>
to any province or territory added to the <lb/>
Dominion of Canada. Let us read the word<lb break="no"/>ing of the Act. Clause 51 says: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>On the completion of the census in the year <lb/>
one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, <lb/>
and of each subsequent decennial census, the <lb/>
representation of the four provinces shall be <lb/>
readjusted by such authority, in such manner, <lb/>
and from such time as the parliament of Can<lb break="no"/>ada from time to time provides. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>What is the meaning of ' Canada ' in that <lb/>
Act? I will admit the correctness of the <lb/>
opinion of the hon. Minister of Justice that <lb/>
it is Canada as constituted at the time of <lb/>
the passage of the Act. There is no doubt <lb/>
whatever about it that the parliament of <lb/>
Canada could not mean the members of this <lb/>
House representing the four provinces of <lb/>
the Dominion, but that it must apply to the <lb/>
whole 'Dominion of Canada.' Then, we <lb/>
have this governing clause: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>On any such readjustment the number of <lb/>
members for a province shall not be reduced <lb/>
unless the proportion which the number of the <lb/>
population of the province bore to the number <lb/>
of the aggregate population of Canada at the <lb/>
then last preceding readjustment of the number <lb/>
of members for the province is ascertained at <lb/>
the then latest census to be diminished by one <lb/>
twentieth part or upwards. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>The hon. Minister of Justice says that <lb/>
'Canada ' within the meaning of that clause <lb/>
refers to Canada whatever it is at the time <lb/>
the readjustment is made and to back up <lb/>
his opinion he reads the opinion of Mr. <lb/>
Christopher Robinson, of Toronto. On that <lb/>
point I would remind the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Justice of the delicacy that he had in argu<lb break="no"/>ing the question when he said that he did <lb/>
not like to discuss the question in full be<lb break="no"/>cause he did not like to lead the Supreme <lb/>
Court upon the question. But, he has no <lb/>
delicacy in reading the opinion of Mr. Chris<lb break="no"/>topher Robinson in support of his conten<lb break="no"/>tion and it never struck him that he might <lb/>
possibly lead the Supreme Court into form<lb break="no"/>ing an opinion in reference to the matter. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. Not at <lb/>
all. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Hon. Mr. HAGGART</persName>. On that point. the <lb/>
whole argument of the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Justice is that 'Canada' comprises the Do<lb break="no"/>minion as at present existing between the <lb/>
Atlantic and the Pacific. Unfortunately for <lb/>
his argument he admitted that the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories did not come Within the <lb/>
meaning of the word 'Canada.' Why does <lb/>
not ' Canada ' comprise the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories? The application of this clause was <lb/>
intended to the four provinces of Canada <lb/>

and 'Canada' under the meaning of the <lb/>
clause could not mean anything else than <lb/>
the four provinces at that time. The par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada may redistribute the re<lb break="no"/>presentation of the four provinces and if my <lb/>
argument is correct unless clause 51 of the <lb/>
British North America Act is specifically <lb/>
mentioned as applicable to the provinces or <lb/>
territories coming in it would have no, ap<lb break="no"/>plication at all. The application is solely <lb/>
and only to the four provinces mentioned <lb/>
and the strongest support of my conten<lb break="no"/>tion is the statement of the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Justice that the North-west Territories did <lb/>
not form part of Canada as at present con<lb break="no"/>stituted. The hon. gentleman risks his re<lb break="no"/>putation; he says that he has no doubt as <lb/>
to the opinion of the Supreme Court in the. <lb/>
matter. He fortifies his position with the <lb/>
opinion of Mr. Christopher Robinson. I, a <lb/>
layman, perhaps, should not speak particul<lb break="no"/>arly of the interpretation of an Act of par<lb break="no"/>liament or statute, but I am clearly of a <lb/>
different way of thinking. I understand <lb/>
the meaning of the English language, 1 un<lb break="no"/>derstand the meaning of the surroundings <lb/>
of the British North America Act. This <lb/>
was a bargain between the four provinces <lb/>
entering into confederation and the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation either increased or decreased, was <lb/>
to be governed by a proportion between <lb/>
them. The hon. Minister of Justice says <lb/>
that on addresses from this House and on <lb/>
addresses from the provinces or territories <lb/>
coming into confederation, the governing <lb/>
power in England, the King, can, by Order <lb/>
in Council, Within the four corners of the <lb/>
British North America Act, or if nothing is <lb/>
contradictory or against the tenor of the <lb/>
British North America Act, admit these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces into the Dominion. That is true, <lb/>
and it becomes as solemn as an Act of par<lb break="no"/>liament can be but when he was faced by <lb/>
the question of my hon. friend the leader <lb/>
of the opposition (Mr. Borden, Halifax): <lb/>
Supposing there was a bargain with New<lb break="no"/>foundland for the purpose of securing her <lb/>
admission to the confederation by which <lb/>
Newfoundland would have an abnormal re<lb break="no"/>presentation could he make it a part of the <lb/>
bargain that the representation ')f Ontario <lb/>
and of Quebec and of New Brunswick should <lb/>
be decreased?—the hon. Minister of Justice <lb/>
said 'yes.' It becomes, he said, in fact, an <lb/>
imperial Act of parliament and if upon an <lb/>
address from us an imperial Order in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil is passed and receives the sanction of <lb/>
the King we can reduce even the representa<lb break="no"/>tion of Quebec three or four members. I <lb/>
contend there is no such power vested in the <lb/>
imperial authorities. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. Oh. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Hon. Mr. HAGGART</persName>. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man gives a power to the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment which would never be submitted if the <lb/>
imperial parliament had that power. He <lb/>
says that as a matter of law the British <lb/>
North America Act could be altered from <lb/>
 



<cb/>

time to time by the imperial parliament. It <lb/>
may be so but when a constitution is once <lb/>
given to a country the imperial parliament <lb/>
will not interfere. I doubt very much if <lb/>
they have the power of doing it unless when <lb/>
a rebellion, or a revolution or a reconquest <lb/>
of the country occurs. I heard that doc<lb break="no"/>trine laid down long ago by as able a lawyer <lb/>
as the hon. Minister of Justice, the Hon. Ed. <lb/>
Blake in this House and he held that once <lb/>
a constitution is given to a country there is <lb/>
no power, even under the imperial authority, <lb/>
to diminish or lessen that constitution with<lb break="no"/>out the consent of the country to which the <lb/>
authority is given. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:TART1">Hon. Mr.TARTE</persName>. Hear, hear. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Hon. Mr. HAGGART</persName>. And the power to <lb/>
limit such a constitution is only exercised in <lb/>
the most extreme cases such as for instance <lb/>
in the case of a revolution. 1 am glad to <lb/>
say, although possibly the reports in the <lb/>
newspapers may have been wrong, that <lb/>
when there was a question in the old coun<lb break="no"/>try in regard to doing away with the conlb break="no"/>stitution of Cape Colony all the representa<lb break="no"/>tives at the colonial conference protested <lb/>
against anything of the kind being done for <lb/>
the reason that they did not know when it <lb/>
would perhaps occur to themselves. The <lb/>
principle I lay down is that although the <lb/>
power may be there I doubt very much if <lb/>
it can be exercised except under extraordin<lb break="no"/>ary circumstances, that once they grant a <lb/>
constitution to a country they have no power <lb/>
to revoke it without cause. I contend that <lb/>
the clause in regard to representation has no <lb/>
effect upon or no application to any province <lb/>
or territory which is admitted into Canada <lb/>
unless it is specially asked for. The im<lb break="no"/>perial authorities on an address from this <lb/>
House, admitted Rupert's Land into the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. They passed an imperial Act of <lb/>
parliament giving it representation in the <lb/>
Dominion parliament. Does the Minister of <lb/>
Justice contend that they could pass an Act <lb/>
of parliament limiting the representation of <lb/>
Canada under the British North America <lb/>
Act, or increasing the representation or <lb/>
Rupert's Land, without the consent of Can<lb break="no"/>ada. If he admits that principle, then if <lb/>
ever we think that Quebec has too much in<lb break="no"/>fluence in the Dominion, all we have to do <lb/>
is to pass an address to the imperial au<lb break="no"/>thorities asking for an Act of parliament <lb/>
to reduce the representation of Quebec. The <lb/>
Minister of Justice seems to have set aside <lb/>
the legal opinions in his department alto<lb break="no"/>gether. In support of my view in reference <lb/>
to clause 51 having no application to pro<lb break="no"/>vinces or territories afterward: admitted in<lb break="no"/>to the Dominion I wish to read a couple of <lb/>
clauses from an Order in Council passed by <lb/>
Sir John Macdonald and on which the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Act of 1871 was passed. It says: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

ion. In the constitution of the Senate, the Do<lb break="no"/>minion was divided into three divisions. each <lb/>
division having equal representation in that <lb/>
body. In like manner the clauses of this Act <lb/>
relating to the constitution of the House of <lb/>
Commons give a certain proportional represen<lb break="no"/>tation to the provinces originally constituting <lb/>
the Dominion, and make no reference to the <lb/>
increase in numbers or any addition to the ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial domain. There is in the Act no pro<lb break="no"/>vision whatever for the representation in the <lb/>
House of Commons of Rupert's Land or the <lb/>
North-west Territories or British Columbia. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE argues that be<lb break="no"/>cause we pass an address to the imperial <lb/>
authorities, with respect to a new body <lb/>
coming into the Dominion, be it a province <lb/>
"or be it a territory; the conditions of the <lb/>
address being approved by His Majesty the <lb/>
King, it becomes part of the British North <lb/>
America Act, and so they may reduce the <lb/>
representation set forth in the agreement <lb/>
between the original four provinces. Do <lb/>
I understand the Minister of Justice rightly <lb/>
in that? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. I do <lb/>
not quite understand my hon. friend (Hon. <lb/>
Mr. Haggart). Of course he realizes that <lb/>
there is a difference between the case of a <lb/>
territory which has no representative in<lb break="no"/>stitutions, and the case of a province. In <lb/>
the case of a territory the Dominion parlia<lb break="no"/>ment has jurisdiction to bring the territory <lb/>
in. With respect to a province hav<lb break="no"/>ing representative institutions, it is entirely <lb/>
different. In that case there must be <lb/>
an address from the province that seeks <lb/>
entrance into the Dominion and there <lb/>
must be an address from the Dominion <lb/>
parliament. Both these addresses from the <lb/>
province coming in and from the Dominion <lb/>
parliament must go to the imperial author<lb break="no"/>ities, and there by Order in Council sanction<lb break="no"/>ing the address the province is allowed in <lb/>
upon the terms fixed in the address. The <lb/>
address of course must be in the same <lb/>
terms from the province and from the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion. In these terms the imperial order is <lb/>
passed, and has the effect of imperial legis<lb break="no"/>lation. My hon. friend (Hon. Mr. Haggart) <lb/>
was good enough to give us his opinion a <lb/>
moment ago with respect to imperial legis<lb break="no"/>lation, and perhaps he will allow me to read <lb/>
from Jenkins, who is something of an au<lb break="no"/>thority on this point: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The legislative supremacy of. parliament over <lb/>
the whole of the British domain is complete <lb/>
and undoubted in law. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>And there is no lawyer in parliament who <lb/>
would say to the contrary. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). There is no <lb/>
doubt at all as to the technical power of <lb/>
the imperial parliament; there is no <lb/>
doubt as to the technical power of <lb/>
the King of Great Britain and Ireland to <lb/>
disallow a Bill, but the Minister of Justice <lb/>
knows that constitutional writers distinguish <lb/>
between the technical power and the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional right. Therefore, it is said that <lb/>

<cb/>

although the King of Great Britain has the <lb/>
technical power to disallow Acts of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment he has not the constitutional right; <lb/>
and his doing so after the lapse of 200 <lb/>
years might provoke a revolution in a great <lb/>
emergency. Therefore, while the imperial <lb/>
parliament might exercise its power to <lb/>
make a tariff for us to-morrow, because it <lb/>
has the technical power to do so, that is a <lb/>
different thing altogether from the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional right; and it was on the question <lb/>
of constitutional right that my hon. friend <lb/>
from Lanark (Hon. Mr. Haggart) was ad<lb break="no"/>dressing himself. While I am on my feet, <lb/>
I might with the indulgence of the House <lb/>
mention to the Minister of Justice a con<lb break="no"/>sideration which has been addressed from <lb/>
this side and which he has perhaps not <lb/>
fully appreciated. He has said that it would <lb/>
be quite possible, by means of addresses <lb/>
passed by the provinces and by this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment upon the admission of these provinces, <lb/>
to so far alter the effect of the British <lb/>
North America Act as to reduce the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of the province of Quebec which <lb/>
is definitely fixed and stated in that Act. <lb/>
Now, I submit to the Minister of Justice <lb/>
that that would lead to a very extraordinary <lb/>
condition of affairs, if his argument is pur<lb break="no"/>sued to its logical conclusion, and for this <lb/>
reason: So far as Rupert's Land is con<lb break="no"/>cerned there is to be no address from Ru<lb break="no"/>pert's Land because Rupert's Land possesses <lb/>
no representative institutions. Rupert's <lb/>
Land was to be admitted on an address from <lb/>
no other body than from the House of par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada. The statute says: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>And on address from the Houses of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada to admit Rupert's Land and <lb/>
the North-west Territory. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Then the British North America Act of <lb/>
1886 was passed giving power to this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to deal with the representation of <lb/>
Rupert's Land; and the point to which I <lb/>
invite the attention of the minister is this— <lb/>
he says that by means of this address, <lb/>
coupled with the Queen's proclamation you <lb/>
can cut down the representation of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec. I do not agree with the <lb/>
Minister of Justice at present; I may <lb/>
change my mind upon further considera<lb break="no"/>tion; but if his argument is correct, does <lb/>
it not lead to this inevitable conclusion: <lb/>
You have so far as Rupert's Land is concern<lb break="no"/>ed the address of the Houses of the par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada plus the Imperial Act <lb/>
of 1886 giving power to deal with the re<lb break="no"/>presentation of that territory. Therefore, <lb/>
the address of the Houses of the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, which made no provision <lb/>
for representation of the Territories and <lb/>
Rupert's Land, plus the Imperial Act of <lb/>
1886, should place this parliament in the <lb/>
same position as that which the Minister <lb/>
of Justice has already indicated. In other <lb/>
words, it seems to me it would logically <lb/>
follow from his argument that this par<lb break="no"/>liament, under the imperial statute of <lb/>
1886 in providing from time to time for <lb/>

the representation of the North-west Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, could deal with the representa<lb break="no"/>tion of Ontario or Quebec or the mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces. It seems to be that <lb/>
that would logically result from the argu<lb break="no"/>ment of the Minister of Justice with which, <lb/>
however, I do not agree. I say this, be<lb break="no"/>cause the addresses with respect to Ru<lb break="no"/>pert's Land, plus the Imperial Act of 1886, <lb/>
are exactly equivalent to the address from <lb/>
the Dominion and from the province of <lb/>
Prince Edward Island for example, plus the <lb/>
Queen's proclamation. I would think that <lb/>
possibly the argument which the Minister <lb/>
of Justice made in that regard may lead <lb/>
to a very awkward result if carried as far <lb/>
as I suggest. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">The MINISTER OF JUSTICE</persName>. I do not <lb/>
think that we can debate the question quite <lb/>
fully at the present time. We will have <lb/>

I said, and when my hon. friends come to <lb/>
look up ' Hansard ' they will see I guarded <lb/>
myself by saying that it was extremely <lb/>
doubtful if any attempt to legislate in that <lb/>
direction would be made. The right to <lb/>
legislate is undoubted. That is the state<lb break="no"/>ment I made, and that is the statement I <lb/>

whether I am a lawyer or not, but I would <lb/>
venture to doubt it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Hon. Mr. HAGGART</persName>. My argument was <lb/>
from the constitutional point of view, that <lb/>
the imperial authorities had no right at all <lb/>
to interfere with our constitution. The Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice said they had, and the ap<lb break="no"/>plication of his argument was that when the <lb/>
addresses and Order in Council received the <lb/>
sanction of the Queen, they became part of <lb/>
the British North America Act or the im<lb break="no"/>perial law and affected our position to that <lb/>
extent. I pointed out that addresses from <lb/>
the different provinces coming into the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion and the addresses from the Dominion <lb/>
to the imperial authorities, if approved by <lb/>
the Sovereign, might alter the representa<lb break="no"/>tion of the four provinces under the bargain <lb/>
which we make with a new province com<lb break="no"/>ing into the union. I state here, and it <lb/>
cannot be contradicted, that if it were not <lb/>
for the admission of the North-west Terri<lb break="no"/>tories and Manitoba into this Dominion, the <lb/>
number of representatives in this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment from the province of Ontario would <lb/>
not be diminished at all. Therefore our <lb/>
 

<cb/>

representation is affected by the bargain <lb/>
which we make with the different provinces <lb/>
entering into the Dominion. I say that <lb/>
there was no such intention in the British <lb/>
North America Act. That Act bears no <lb/>
such meaning. Section 51 applies solely to <lb/>
the four provinces which originally con<lb break="no"/>stituted confederation and it is solely to <lb/>
the readjustment of the representation of <lb/>
these provinces to which that section ap<lb break="no"/>plies. Then what can be the meaning of the <lb/>
term 'Canada' so far as this clause 51 is <lb/>
concerned? As regards the readjustment <lb/>
of the representation of these four original <lb/>
provinces, the term can be held to cover <lb/>
but them alone. Notwithstanding the argu<lb break="no"/>ment of the hon. Minister of Justice and <lb/>
the opinion of the eminent lawyer, Mr. <lb/>
Christopher Robinson, of Toronto, I am still <lb/>
convinced, following the opinion of my old <lb/>
leader, the late Sir John Macdonald, that <lb/>
this clause 51 in the British North America <lb/>
Act has no reference at all to the future <lb/>
new provinces of Canada, and that unless <lb/>
it is specially provided in the Acts author<lb break="no"/>izing the admission of new provinces into <lb/>
the Dominion, that this section 51 shall <lb/>
apply to them, it must be held to be re<lb break="no"/>stricted to the four original provinces. <lb/></p> 

<p>The right hon. gentleman the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister in introducing his Bill the other day, <lb/>
said, in reply to my hon. friend (Mr. Borden), <lb/>
who drew his attention to a telegram from <lb/>
the hon. Minister of Railways to the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of New Brunswick, that he intended <lb/>
to press the Bill, that he had no doubt as to <lb/>
the law on the question, and that he was <lb/>
only following the principles laid down in <lb/>
1882 and 1892. But there was no such prin<lb break="no"/>ciple at issue in 1882 or in 1892 as we are <lb/>
contending for now. The question then was <lb/>
not raised. It did not enter as an issue at <lb/>
all. It could not have any application at all, <lb/>
and the right hon. gentleman cannot take <lb/>
any authority from anything that was done <lb/>
in 1882 or in 1892, inasmuch as the one-<lb break="yes"/>twentieth provision in subsection four of <lb/>
section fifty-one did not affect the position <lb/>
of any of the provinces at that time. <lb/></p> 

<p>I have looked very carefully into the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the British North America Act. I <lb/>
was at first impressed by the opinion of the <lb/>
Minister of Justice that subsection four of <lb/>
section fifty-one referred to Canada as it is <lb/>
constituted at present, but looking at all the <lb/>
surroundings of the Act and having regard <lb/>
especially for the opinion cited by my hon. <lb/>
friend from Hamilton (Mr. Barker) of Sir <lb/>
Henry Strong on the subject. I am con<lb break="no"/>vinced that section fifty-one was not at all <lb/>
intended to apply to the provinces or terri<lb break="no"/>tories to be subsequently admitted. The <lb/>
principles which are laid down by Sir Henry <lb/>

clause:— <lb/></p>

<p>The history of the subject and the sur<lb break="no"/>rounding circumstances. Mr. Speaker— <lb/>
that opinion of Sir John Macdonald and his <lb/>

clearly to the conclusion that section fifty-<lb break="yes"/>one of the British North America Act was <lb/>
intended to apply only to the four provinces <lb/>
which originally constituted confederation. <lb/>
It is true that by special arrangement with <lb/>
the new provinces entering confederation and <lb/>
forming now part of the Dominion, section <lb/>
fifty-one is made specially to apply to them, <lb/>
but in every address, enactment and Act <lb/>
of parliament governing their admission, it <lb/>
is specially provided that the rule laid down <lb/>
in section fifty-one shall apply to their re<lb break="no"/>presentation, except in the case of British <lb/>
Columbia, one of the conditions of whose <lb/>
entrance into the Dominion was that in no <lb/>
event was its representation to be reduced. <lb/>
But what I protest against most of all is <lb/>
that by an address of this House, or of <lb/>
this House and any of the provinces com<lb break="no"/>bined, to the imperial authority, power should <lb/>

Mr. Speaker, we contend that Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island's case is a special one and a <lb/>
much stronger and entirely different case <lb/>
from that put forward by the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. Speaker, we object to the principles of <lb/>
this Bill insofar as it does not remedy the <lb/>
wrong done to the province of Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island in violating the special com<lb break="no"/>pact under which she entered the union and <lb/>
taking away, contrary to the special terms, <lb/>
the status of representation of six members <lb/>
given at that time and treating her as coming <lb/>
in under the general terms of representation <lb/>
as applies to provinces entering under the <lb/>
British North America Act of 1867. <lb/></p> 

<p>At the time of redistribution of 1891 a <lb/>
false interpretation was put upon the clause <lb/>
re our representation, and we object against <lb/>
that being recognized in this Bill and still <lb/>
further wronging her in again reducing her <lb/>
representation in giving her four instead <lb/>
of the original six with which she entered <lb/>
and perpetuating an erroneous and unjust <lb/>
principle which will eventually take away <lb/>
the entire political entity of a province that <lb/>
before confederation enjoyed to the full the <lb/>
principles of a self-governed colony. </p>

<cb/>

<p>
The objection to the principles of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population as regards Prince <lb/>
Edward Island, except as I shall hereafter <lb/>
point out, is general throughout the Island <lb/>
and maritime provinces by parties of both <lb/>
political leanings. <lb/></p> 

<p>At the opening of the provincial legislature <lb/>
on March 19. 1903, the Lieutenant Governor <lb/>
referred to this matter of representation as <lb/>
follows:— <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The claims of this province that its represen<lb break="no"/>tation under British North America Act, in the <lb/>
Dominion House of Commons should not be re<lb break="no"/>duced below the number of members conceded <lb/>
to it at the time of our entry into confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, have been pressed upon the federal gov<lb break="no"/>ernment by my premier and representatives of <lb/>
my administration, and I feel confident that the <lb/>
province will be given an opportunity to es<lb break="no"/>tablish its rights in this respect. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>And the mover of the address in reply to <lb/>
the speech from the Throne spoke strongly <lb/>
on this matter. His opening remarks were:- </p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>We now come to the question of representa<lb break="no"/>tion, this is to-day a most important question. <lb/>
In the very near future the Dominion parlia<lb break="no"/>ment will be called on to discuss a redistribu<lb break="no"/>tion Bill, and the House would be derelict in <lb/>
its duty if it should allow the central govern<lb break="no"/>ment to perpetrate another such error as in<lb break="no"/>flicted on this province in 1891 without the <lb/>
strongest protests. <lb/></p> 

<p>A false interpretation was put upon our terms <lb/>
of union by the Dominion government, the <lb/>
words: 'the representation to be re-adjusted <lb/>
from time to time, under the provisions of the <lb/>
British North America Act 1867 ' were torn from <lb/>
their context and made to do duty as law. Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, these words do not apply, and never <lb/>
have applied to this province by right—it was <lb/>
an iniquity and we should deny it and defy it. <lb/></p> 

<p>What, Sir, are the principles laid down in the <lb/>
various Acts of confederation; is there one <lb/>
essential principle or are there two distinct <lb/>
standards of representation, let us see. In 1864 <lb/>
a basis of confederation was adopted by the <lb/>
Quebec conference, in which the principle of <lb/>
representation was laid down, that principle <lb/>
was accepted after a time by the provinces of <lb/>
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, but it was not accepted by us. We stood <lb/>
out for another standard and after a long fight <lb/>
we succeeded in securing a representation of <lb/>
six members for 95,000 of a population; this, Sir, <lb/>
is quite another rule, and it is a rule or prin<lb break="no"/>ciple that has been acknowledged, accepted and <lb/>
applied to other provinces before and since that <lb/>
time, notably to Manitoba and British Columbia. <lb/>
One of the greatest obstacles to the scheme of <lb/>
confederation with this Island was the insist<lb break="no"/>ence of the Canadian statesmen that represent<lb break="no"/>ation by population should be part of the terms, <lb/>
while our people were quite as isistent on hav<lb break="no"/>ing not less than six members regardless of <lb/>
 population. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>In the first place, I do not believe that the <lb/>
principle of representation by population is <lb/>
found within the four corners of the con<lb break="no"/>federation document. And, so far as re<lb break="no"/>gards the reduction of the representation of <lb/>
Prince Edward Island, this was not intended <lb/>
if Prince Edward Island maintained the <lb/>
population with which she entered con<lb break="no"/>federation—95,857. And I think this clause <lb/>

<pb n="1271" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1903-04-14_Page_01271.jpg"/> 

<fw type="num">1271</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">1272</fw>


giving her representation of six members <lb/>
and the interpreting clause fully carry out <lb/>
this idea. To follow the unit of representa<lb break="no"/>tion as in Quebec with 65 members would <lb/>
render the whole scheme with regard to <lb/>
Prince Edward Island absurd. Because, if <lb/>
Quebec were as thickly populated as Prince <lb/>
Edward Island, we should have 65-152 of a <lb/>
unit of representation, because Quebec is 152 <lb/>
times as large as Prince Edward Island. <lb/>
We would not have half the population to <lb/>
make up one unit of representation, and so <lb/>
we should be deprived of representation alto<lb break="no"/>gether. It is absurd to suppose that such a <lb/>
thing could have been intended when Prince <lb/>
Edward Island entered confederation. Then, <lb/>
there are the reports of the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference and the speeches in the local legis<lb break="no"/>lature repudiating representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation; and, finally, we have a telegram, just <lb/>
before the close of the conference, admit<lb break="no"/>ting Prince Edward Island to the union and <lb/>
confirming a representation of six members <lb/>
as its representatives had been asking for. It <lb/>
was five years after the formation of the <lb/>
union of the provinces of Upper and Lower <lb/>
Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, <lb/>
that Prince Edward Island joined the union, <lb/>
having remained out up to that time for <lb/>
causes to which I shall refer later. Prince <lb/>
Edward Island came in under section 146 of <lb/>
the British North America Act. which pro<lb break="no"/>vides the terms under which Prince Edward <lb/>
Island, Newfoundland and other provinces <lb/>
might enter—that is, on addresses by the <lb/>
province and the Dominion, and the pass<lb break="no"/>ing of an imperial Order in Council which <lb/>
would have the effect of law. <lb/></p> 

<p>The clause of the British North America <lb/>
Act reads as follows: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with <lb/>
the advice of Her Majesty's Most Honourable <lb/>
Privy Council, on addresses from the Houses of <lb/>
the Parliament of Canada, and from the Houses <lb/>
of the respective legislatures of the colonies or <lb/>
provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land, and British Columbia, to admit those <lb/>
colonies or provinces, or any of them into the <lb/>
union, and on address from the Houses of Par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada to admit Rupert's Land and <lb/>
the North Western Territory, or either of them, <lb/>
into the union, on such terms and conditions <lb/>
in each case as are in the addresses expressed <lb/>
and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject <lb/>
to the provisions of this Act; and the prov<lb break="no"/>isions of any Order in Council in that behalf <lb/>
shall have effect as if they had been enacted <lb/>
by the parliament of the United Kingdom of <lb/>
Great Britain and Ireland. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>The Order in Council admitting Prince <lb/>
Edward Island was passed on the 26th of <lb/>
June, 1873, declaring that Prince Edward <lb/>
Island be admitted and become part of the <lb/>
Dominion of Canada upon the terms and <lb/>
conditions set forth in the addresses. The <lb/>
clauses in these addresses of the different <lb/>
Houses to the Sovereign regarding represent<lb break="no"/>ation is as follows: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>That the population of Prince Edward Island <lb/>
having been increased by 15,000 or upwards <lb/>



<cb/>

since the year 1861, the island shall be repre<lb break="no"/>sented in the House of Commons by six mem<lb break="no"/>bers; the representation to be readjusted from <lb/>
time to time under the provision of the British <lb/>
North America Act, 1867. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>This plea is made on the belief that, under <lb/>
this clause Prince Edward Island is justly <lb/>
entitled to retain the six members with <lb/>
which it came into the union, and given <lb/>
under this clause, and that the reduction in <lb/>
1892, and the further contemplated reduc<lb break="no"/>tion now, are contrary to the direct terms <lb/>
under which the island came into the union. <lb/>
I think this will be very clearly seen upon <lb/>
an intelligent interpretation of the Act, and <lb/>
from the manifest intention of the parties <lb/>
negotiating the terms, which intention, to <lb/>
my mind, should weigh greatly with <lb/>
this House, particularly when it comes <lb/>
to unjust interference with such paramount <lb/>
rights as the representation of a province in <lb/>
the House of Commons in Canada which <lb/>
will create and I know is creating, a great <lb/>
deal of dissatisfaction among the people of <lb/>
Prince Edward Island. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, to go back to the Quebec conference <lb/>
of 1864, where the different representatives <lb/>
of different provinces met to discuss the <lb/>
terms of confederation we find that the in<lb break="no"/>surmountable difficulty in the way of Prince <lb/>
Edward Island entering the union was the <lb/>
matter of representation. The position <lb/>
which our delegates took at that convention <lb/>
was firm and decided. They realized what <lb/>
that union might mean in the matter of re<lb break="no"/>presentation to a small province and one <lb/>
very thickly populated in proportion to the <lb/>
rest of the Dominion, as Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land was at that time. They insisted that <lb/>
the system of representation by population <lb/>
should not be applied to so small a province <lb/>
with no territory to enlarge her borders, no <lb/>
mines, and cut off from the mainland by a <lb/>
barrier of ice which would interfere with <lb/>
the development of manufacturing indus<lb break="no"/>tries on the island. They insisted on six <lb/>
members as a status before Prince Edward <lb/>
Island should enter the union. They fur<lb break="no"/>ther contended that Prince Edward Island, <lb/>
having three counties should have two <lb/>
members for each county. These counties <lb/>
had been established for many years, and <lb/>
each had its own institutions and should have <lb/>
equal representation in the House, two <lb/>
members for each. In proof of what I <lb/>
am saying I shall take the liberty of reading <lb/>
from Joseph Pope's Confederation Docu<lb break="no"/>ments, extracts from the speeches of our <lb/>
representatives to the Quebec conference. <lb/>
At page 68 of the documents, I find the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Mr. HAVILAND. Prince Edward Island would <lb/>
rather be out of confederation than consent to <lb/>
this motion. We should have no status. Only <lb/>
5 members out of 194 would give the island no <lb/>
position. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. TILLEY. That is rather a singular <lb/>
ground of objection,'for they have objected to <lb/>
the basis of representation by population. Now <lb/>

it was fully understood at Charlottetown that <lb/>
those who came to the conference expected re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population. Some difficulty <lb/>
might have arisen on those points, but not on <lb/>
this. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. PALMER. Representation by population <lb/>
is not applicable when a certain number of pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are throwing their resources into one <lb/>
confederation and giving up their own self-<lb break="yes"/>government and individuality. When a colony <lb/>
surrenders that right she should have some<lb break="no"/>thing commensurate in the confederation. The <lb/>
debt of Prince Edward island is nothing. Our <lb/>
taxation is vastly below that of other provin<lb break="no"/>ces. Our trade and revenue are rapidly in<lb break="no"/>creasing. Why give up so great a certainty for <lb/>
an uncertain benefit where we have only a feeble <lb/>
voice? Looking first at the larger provinces, <lb/>
Canada has secured for herself a greater num<lb break="no"/>ber of representatives than she had before. . . . <lb/>
Not even two or three more members could in<lb break="no"/>duce me to give my consent to the scheme. I <lb/>
never understood that any proposition at Char<lb break="no"/>lottetown was to be binding by representation <lb/>
by population. It was there made by those <lb/>
from Canada and I do not think it necessary to <lb/>
remark on it as it was a mere suggestion then <lb/>
thrown out by Canada for consideration. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. WHELAN. I do not think, however. I <lb/>
could say that I was satisfied with the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of five in the federal House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. We are in an isolated condition. Our <lb/>
resources are large and our people would not <lb/>
be content to give up their present benefits for <lb/>
their representation of five members. It may <lb/>
be said that the confederation will go on with<lb break="no"/>out Prince Edward Island and that we shall be <lb/>
eventually forced in. Better, however, that, <lb/>
than that we should willingly go into the con<lb break="no"/>federation with that representation. <lb/></p> 

<p>COLONEL GRAY. I am instructed by my co-<lb break="yes"/>delegates to say that the provision of five mem<lb break="no"/>bers is unsatisfactory. Prince Edward Island <lb/>
is divided longitudinally into three counties, <lb/>
each returning ten members. But they are al<lb break="no"/>ways opposed to change of representation. We <lb/>
cannot divide the three counties into five mem<lb break="no"/>bers. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. COLES. Mr. Gait had proposed six mem<lb break="no"/>bers for Prince Edward Island. I approved that <lb/>
rather than Mr. Brown's motion, because it al<lb break="no"/>lows us to give to our three counties two mem<lb break="no"/>bers each. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. POPE. I agree in all that has been said <lb/>
by Colonel Gray and Mr. Coles. But the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances of Prince Edward Island are such <lb/>
that I hope the conference will agree to give <lb/>
us such a number as we can divide amongst our <lb/>
three constituencies. Nature as well as the <lb/>
original settlement of the island has made three <lb/>
counties and would give rise to much difficulties <lb/>
and if we had to adjust five members to the <lb/>
three counties. I cannot ask it as a matter of <lb/>
right but one of expediency and one without <lb/>
which it is impossible for us to carry the mea<lb break="no"/>sure in Prince Edward Island. <lb/></p> 

<p>Mr. HAVILAND. I fully agree with Mr. <lb/>
Pope. It would be an insuperable difficulty <lb/>
with us if we had not six members. <lb/></p> </quote>
 

<p>Now, will any hon. member of this House <lb/>
deny that the plain intent of these delegates <lb/>
was that the island should be represented by <lb/>
six members as a condition precedent to <lb/>
entering the union? And is it not perfectly <lb/>

<cb/>

apparent that their intention was to safe<lb break="no"/>guard the interests of the province by a re<lb break="no"/>presentation in the House of Commons that <lb/>
would not fall below six members so long <lb/>
as we retained the status of 95,000 popu<lb break="no"/>lation? The asking for two for each county <lb/>
was not intended as a temporary arrange<lb break="no"/>ment until the next census, but that they <lb/>
should always be represented by two. The <lb/>
arguments used then have greater force at <lb/>
this time as regards giving us a respectable <lb/>
status in the House. A small province with <lb/>
a stationary population in a large and grow<lb break="no"/>ing confederacy, our voting power becomes <lb/>
less; and I contend that the principles for <lb/>
which our people fought so long, standing <lb/>
out from 1864 to 1873, should not be so <lb/>
easily filched from us to-day. These terms <lb/>
of union were discussed in the local legis<lb break="no"/>lature in several sessions following. To <lb/>
show the members of this House that the <lb/>
delegates at the conference had the full ap<lb break="no"/>proval of the local legislature, I shall again <lb/>
take the opportunity of quoting from some <lb/>
of the discussions. I apologize to the House <lb/>
for taking up its time, but this is a matter <lb/>
of paramount importance to Prince Edward <lb/>
Island, and I think it necessary that the <lb/>
intention of the parties 'to confederation <lb/>
should be well known in order that the <lb/>
government may be guided thereby before <lb/>
they finally adopt such a principle as that <lb/>
laid down in the Bill. Speaking on a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion introduced by the Colonial Secretary in <lb/>
favour of the Quebec terms, and which was <lb/>
overwhelmingly lost on division, the Hon. <lb/>
J. C. Pope said: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>It is proper to notice some of the objection<lb break="no"/>able features of the report. Without admit<lb break="no"/>ting the principle of representation according <lb/>
to population under all circumstances to be <lb/>
sound, it is, in the opinion of this House, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly objectionable as applied to this island <lb/>
in connection with Canada, taking into consid<lb break="no"/>eration that the number of our inhabitants is, <lb/>
and must continue comparatively small, owing <lb/>
to the fact that we have no Crown lands, mines, <lb/>
minerals or other resources sufficient to induce <lb/>
immigrants to settle here, and that we never <lb/>
can expect to become to any extent a manufac<lb break="no"/>turing people, in consequence of our navigation <lb/>
being closed for nearly half the year, and all <lb/>
trade and communication with other countries <lb/>
stopped. Under this principle, the city of <lb/>
Montreal alone would at the present time, have <lb/>
a representation greater than the whole pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Prince Edward Island, and under the <lb/>
provisions of the convention which regulate the <lb/>
mode of readjusting the relative representation <lb/>
of the various provinces at each decennial cen<lb break="no"/>sus, looking at the rapid increase of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of Upper and Lower Canada heretofore— <lb/>
particularly the former— and the certainty of a <lb/>
still greater increase therein in the future. <lb/>
over that of the population of this island, it <lb/>
follows as a certain and inevitable conse<lb break="no"/>quence, if a federation of the provinces were <lb/>
consummated upon the basis of the said con<lb break="no"/>vention, that the number of our representatives <lb/>
would. in the course of a comparatively short <lb/>
number of years, be diminished to a still <lb/>
smaller number than that allotted at the out<lb break="no"/>set to us. <lb/></p></quote>

<p>It seems to me that it is a perfectly plain <lb/>
statement from the leader of the government <lb/>
and shows that the concession of six mem<lb break="no"/>bers was a condition precedent, and could <lb/>
only have been six in perpetuity, for Mr. <lb/>
Pope fully realized that at the next census <lb/>
our representation according to population <lb/>
would be reduced, as has been actually the <lb/>
case. Mr. Pope further said: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Among these objections I may mention the <lb/>
principle of representation by population. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Speaking of Quebec he says: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Its statistics warrant the belief that in a few <lb/>
years the population will be so increased by <lb/>
the influx of the tide of immigration that the <lb/>
island would lose in the halls of legislation <lb/>
even the small voice which she might raise at <lb/>
her entrance into the union. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>The Hon. Mr. Howland, speaking on the <lb/>
same subject, said: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>In the seventeenth paragraph of the report <lb/>
we are told, ' The basis of representation in the <lb/>
House of Commons shall be population, as de<lb break="no"/>termined by the official census every ten years; <lb/>
and the number of members at first shall be <lb/>
194. Of this number Upper Canada is to have <lb/>
82, and Lower Canada 65—in all for Canada 147. <lb/>
The remainder of the 194 is distributed as fol<lb break="no"/>lows: Nova Scotia, 19; New Brunswick, 15; <lb/>
Newfoundland, 8; Prince Edward Island, 5—in <lb/>
all for the lower provinces, 47. By this ar<lb break="no"/>rangement it will be seen that Canada will <lb/>
have 100 representatives in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons more than the aggregate of all the other <lb/>
colonies. Representation by population might <lb/>
be very well for Canada herself, but in a gen<lb break="no"/>eral union of the colonies it would operate in<lb break="no"/>juriously for the maritime provinces, as they <lb/>
could not expect to protect their interests when <lb/>
they would have to contend with 100 of a clear <lb/>
majority over their own representation. This <lb/>
principle would give the city of Montreal with <lb/>
its 101,000 inhabitants one representative more <lb/>
than this island. Quite different is the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of Great Britain, for while London <lb/>
has about the same population as Scotland, that <lb/>
city has only 16 members in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons, while Scotland has 53. But it may be <lb/>
argued that as our population increases our <lb/>
representation will increase. This is very <lb/>
doubtful. Indeed under the operation of the <lb/>
twentieth and twenty-first clauses of the report <lb/>
it seems probable that we might lose our re<lb break="no"/>presentation altogether. Lower Canada is al<lb break="no"/>ways to have 65 members, and the representa<lb break="no"/>tion of the other colonies is to be arranged <lb/>
every ten years so as to give each the same <lb/>
ratio to population as she will then possess. <lb/>
Now, should the population of Lower Canada <lb/>
increase more rapidly than that of this island, <lb/>
which is almost certain to be the case, our re<lb break="no"/>presentation would decrease, and we would be <lb/>
left perhaps without a member at all. To show <lb/>
at least that it is much more likely that our <lb/>
representation will decrease than increase, I <lb/>
will read the Hon. George Brown's opinions on <lb/>
the subject, as given in the Toronto 'Globe.' <lb/>
In treating of the probable effect of these two <lb/>
clauses of the report to which I have been <lb/>
alluding, on the representation of the maritime <lb/>
provinces. that journal says: <lb/></p> 

<p>'The fact is best shown by illustration. <lb/>
Prince Edward Island with a population say of <lb/>
85,000 is, it is said, to have five representatives <lb/>
at starting. Suppose she increase at the rate <lb/>
of twenty per cent each ten years, at the end <lb/>
 

<cb/>

of twenty years her population will be 126,000. <lb/>
But at the same rate of progress the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of Lower Canada would be 1,596,000. Di<lb break="no"/>vided by 65, this would give one representative <lb/>
to every 24,550 of her people; so that the island <lb/>
would not be able to claim an increase of <lb/>
membership. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Mr. Duncan, speaking on the same ques<lb break="no"/>tion, said: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The five representatives allotted to us in the <lb/>
lower House would not give this colony much <lb/>
influence there; but as our population will not <lb/>
increase so rapidly as that of Canada, there <lb/>
is a prospect, through the operation of one <lb/>
clause in the report, that our five representa<lb break="no"/>tives would dwindle down to three. Taking all <lb/>
those points into consideration, therefore, it <lb/>
is clear to me that we have nothing to gain <lb/>
but much to lose by adopting the Quebec <lb/>
scheme. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Those speeches were made in 1865. In <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Nothing could be more unjust to Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island than representation on the basis <lb/>

representatives in the House of Commons, more <lb/>
than the aggregate of all the colonies, the num<lb break="no"/>ber assigned to us being only 5. Representa<lb break="no"/>tion on this basis might do very well for Can<lb break="no"/>ada; but as respects Prince Edward Island, it <lb/>
would be nothing but mere mockery. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>The Hon. Mr. Longworth said: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Another objection which I had to the union <lb/>
was that according to the scheme laid down in <lb/>
the report, representation in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons is to be based upon population. Repre<lb break="no"/>sentation on that basis is as objectionable as <lb/>
applied to those other two provinces, does not <lb/>
render less so to Prince Edward Island. Upper <lb/>
Canada is a growing country and her population <lb/>
will rapidly increase; and as that increases, <lb/>
so, according to the Quebec scheme of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation, her representation in the federal <lb/>
House of Commons would increase, whilst that <lb/>
of Prince Edward Island would decrease. And, <lb/>
in fact, if the increase in the population of Nova <lb/>
Scotia and New Brunswick does not, in the <lb/>
future, grow more rapidly than it has in the <lb/>
past, they will also, if the plan be strictly car<lb break="no"/>ried out, be losers instead of gainers as res<lb break="no"/>pects legislative representation. Thus, as res<lb break="no"/>pects representation on the basis of population, <lb/>
the scheme appeared to me to be unjust to us, <lb/>

present day. Even Earl Russell does not be<lb break="no"/>lieve in representation by population. As was <lb/>
said here last year, by that rule London would <lb/>
have more representatives than Scotland. If I <lb/>
had acted as a delegate when the delegates <lb/>

down that they would not entertain the ques<lb break="no"/>tion at all, unless representation by population <lb/>

not have done so, for it is one of the strongest <lb/>
objections to that scheme. <lb/></p></quote> 

<p>The Hon. Mr. Coles said: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The hon. the leader of the government said <lb/>

case, the first delegation ceased, and another <lb/>
was appointed. Therefore it was for the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to consider the matter. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that <lb/>
these speeches in the House of Represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of Prince Edward Island show very <lb/>
clearly that the principle of representation <lb/>
by population was not accepted by the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of that island. She contended that <lb/>
special terms should be conceded to her, <lb/>
that she should enter with six members, <lb/>
and as a matter of fact, I have pointed out <lb/>
that Prince Edward Island remained out of <lb/>
confederation until 1873, and then only con<lb break="no"/>sented to come into the union when this <lb/>
final point of six members was conceded, <lb/>
notwithstanding anything in the British <lb/>
North America Act as to representation by <lb/>
population. When the final arrangements <lb/>
were being completed, in reply to an inquir! <lb/>
from Governor Robinson, Mr. Haviland, one <lb/>
of our delegates wired in reply. ' Six mem<lb break="no"/>bers conceded.' The clause again reads: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>That the population of Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land having been increased by 15,000 or upwards <lb/>
since the year 1861, the island should be repre<lb break="no"/>sented in the House at Commons of Canada by <lb/>
six members. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Now, let us look at the facts, taking the <lb/>
first part of the clause. This would give <lb/>
us an alleged population of 95,857. On the <lb/>
basis of population at that time, under the; <lb/>
general terms, got by dividing sixty-five into <lb/>
the population of Quebec, we get the unit <lb/>
18,330, and by dividing this into the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of Prince Edward Island we get five <lb/>
and a fraction, 4,207. Thus, on the basis <lb/>
of population, we were only entitled to five <lb/>
members. But there is no sense or reason <lb/>
in the clause for giving us six unless six <lb/>
as a status. For any other construction <lb/>
would be ridiculous, after stopping out ten <lb/>
years, and knowing that the next census <lb/>
would deprive us of one, if the representa<lb break="no"/>tion was to be by population under the <lb/>
general terms. <lb/></p> 

<p>Our contention simply was this: We <lb/>
have a population of 931,857. and we <lb/>
want six members regardless of any unit <lb/>
of representation for other provinces. I con<lb break="no"/>sider, Mr. Speaker, that this ground is per<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

fectly tenable, that we were given six mem<lb break="no"/>bers on a status of entering union with <lb/>
95,857 population and that we were to have <lb/>
six in perpetuity. I repeat again that the <lb/>
reasons advanced then are more potent to<lb break="no"/>day in the history of events, and what a <lb/>
representation by population under the gen<lb break="no"/>eral terms would mean as regards Prince <lb/>
Edward Island, as I shall illustrate to the <lb/>
House later. Now as to the balance of the <lb/>
clause: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>The representation to be readjusted from <lb/>
time to time under the provisions of the British <lb/>
North America Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>This, in my opinion, can only refer to <lb/>
an increase of population in the event of <lb/>
our population increasing more rapidly than <lb/>
Quebec, and from the foregoing no other <lb/>
construction seems applicable, or in the <lb/>
case of a reduction of our population below <lb/>
the population we had on entering the union. <lb/>
This construction is also strengthened by the <lb/>
cases of British Columbia and Manitoba, <lb/>
both coming in after confederation and <lb/>
upon special terms. British Columbia came <lb/>
in in 1879, having a population of 10,586, <lb/>
which would give her under the general <lb/>
terms one member, yet she was given six. <lb/>
The clause reads as follows: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>British Columbia is entitled to be represented <lb/>
by six members, the representation to be in<lb break="no"/>creased under the provisions of the British <lb/>
North America Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>In 1881 she was entitled by population to <lb/>
two, yet she retained six; in 1891 her popu<lb break="no"/>lation would entitle her to four, yet she <lb/>
kept six. The rights under the Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island clause are certainly the same <lb/>
as the British Columbia clause, except that <lb/>
the language in the latter is possibly clearer. <lb/>
British Columbia has a right to enforce her <lb/>
special terms, and in fact it was never <lb/>
seriously questioned, and in the event of her <lb/>
population not having increased as it has, <lb/>
could any hon. member of this House ques<lb break="no"/>tion her right to retain six members? <lb/></p> 

<p>I can turn to the ' debates ' of 1892, when <lb/>
we had the right hon. leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment speaking of this matter of the re<lb break="no"/>presentation of British Columbia. He says: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>But, at the same time, I am myself taken by <lb/>
surprise at the objection raised, for it has al<lb break="no"/>ways been understood that British Columbia <lb/>
was entitled to six members. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Again he says: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>We have always understood that British Col<lb break="no"/>umbia was entitled to six members until such <lb/>
time that she was entitled to a larger number, <lb/>
but that she should not be represented by a <lb/>
less number than six. For my part I would <lb/>
be sorry to come to any conclusion which would <lb/>
deprive British Columbia of that which the <lb/>
people suppose themselves to be their right. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>I consider that Prince Edward Island is <lb/>
in exactly the same position as British Co<lb break="no"/>lumbia; the language of the clauses are <lb/>
practically the same. In the one case it <lb/>
says 'readjusted' and in the other case <lb/>

'increased,' but, as to the intention of the <lb/>
framers of these clauses and of the con<lb break="no"/>tracting parties at the time of the union, <lb/>
it cannot be successfully contradicted <lb/>
that the meaning and purpose was the same. <lb/>
There was the status under which these <lb/>
provinces should come in, there was a spe<lb break="no"/>cial provision under which small provinces <lb/>
should enter the union, and both of these <lb/>
provinces came in under this special provi<lb break="no"/>sion. Mr. Davies, of Prince Edward Island, <lb/>
speaking at that time, said: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>I beg to assure my hon. friend that so far as <lb/>
the individual members coming from British <lb/>
Columbia. are concerned. we entertain nothing <lb/>
but kindly feelings towards them personally. <lb/>
I am in thorough accord with my leader that <lb/>
this is a matter of good faith. I think it would <lb/>
be a breach of faith on the part of parliament <lb/>
to alter those terms it they could do it, but the <lb/>
point before the House is a purely legal ques<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Sir John Thompson contended at that <lb/>
time that there was no need of an appeal <lb/>
to the Privy Council. I think the present <lb/>
right hon. leader of the government (Hon. <lb/>
Sir Wilfrid Laurier) suggested at that time <lb/>
that as it was a legal point and that it <lb/>
should be handed over to the Privy Council <lb/>
or to some other authority to give ef<lb break="no"/>fect to the intent of the contracting <lb/>
parties. Sir John Thompson considered that <lb/>
even that was not necessary, that the plain <lb/>
intent of the Act was sufliciently expressed <lb/>
that British Columbia should have her six <lb/>
representatives until such time as the num<lb break="no"/>ber might be increased by an inflow of <lb/>
population. I consider that Prince Edward <lb/>
Island is in the same position as British <lb/>
Columbia was at that day, and I think her <lb/>
rights should be safeguarded by this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. <lb/></p> 

<p>Manitoba came in under an imperial Act <lb/>
and upon special terms. Her population <lb/>
in 1879 was 10,586, and under general terms <lb/>
would entitle her to one member, yet she <lb/>
came in with four. In 1881 her population <lb/>
would give her three, yet she still kept four. <lb/>
The section referring to representation in <lb/>
her case reads as follows: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>Provided that on the completion of the cen<lb break="no"/>sus of 1891, and of each decennial census after, <lb/>
the representation of the province shall be re<lb break="no"/>adjusted according to the provisions of section <lb/>
51 of the British North America Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>Why should Prince Edward Island be <lb/>
treated any differently from other provinces. <lb/>
Their special terms were manifested better <lb/>
than those of Prince Edward Island and <lb/>
yet they were not disturbed. <lb/></p> 

<p>There is another section of the Prince <lb/>
Edward Island terms to which I wish to <lb/>
draw attention. It reads as follows: <lb/></p> 

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>That the provisions of the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act, 1867, shall, except those parts thereof <lb/>
which are in terms made, or by reasonable in<lb break="no"/>tendment may be held to be specially applica<lb break="no"/>ble to and only to affect one and not the whole <lb/>
of the provinces now comprising the Dominion, <lb/>
and except so far as the same may be varied <lb/>
 

<cb/>

by these resolutions, be applicable to Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island in the same way and to the same <lb/>
extent as they apply to the other provinces of <lb/>
the Dominion, and as if the colony of Prince <lb/>
Edward Island had been one of the provinces <lb/>
united by the said Act. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>The qualifying words, 'except so far as <lb/>
the same may be varied by these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions,' are important. Clearly the 51st sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the British North America Act, which <lb/>
provides for representation by population <lb/>
was so 'varied' when with a special re<lb break="no"/>ference to our population, it was declared <lb/>
that the island shall be represented by six <lb/>
members, such six members being in excess <lb/>
of what we would then be entitled to by <lb/>
our population. <lb/></p> 

<p>Let us point out the position this province <lb/>
would be in taking the general terms of the <lb/>
British North America Act to apply. We <lb/>
will take the figures of the census of 1871 <lb/>
and compare the growth with the recent <lb/>
census of 1901, thirty years later, and for <lb/>
convenience let us make four groups to get <lb/>
the relative growth of the east, centre and <lb/>
west. For the purpose of this study we <lb/>
shall group the three maritime provinces <lb/>
together, take Quebec and Ontario each <lb/>
singly, forming the fourth and last group <lb/>
of Manitoba, British Columbia and the terri<lb break="no"/>tories, organized and unorganized, that are <lb/>
outside the provincial boundaries. The com<lb break="no"/>parison will show very unequal growth as <lb/>
we shall see. The western group, includ<lb break="no"/>ing Manitoba, British Columbia and the <lb/>
territories had in 1871 a population of 109,<lb break="no"/>475. In 1901 the population of the group <lb/>
was 624,970, showing a gain of 515,495 in <lb/>
the thirty years, or 470 per cent. Ontario <lb/>
in 1871, had a population of 1,620,851, and <lb/>
in 1901 this had increased to 2,182,847, show<lb break="no"/>ing a gain of 562,096 or 34 1/4 per cent. Que<lb break="no"/>bec, with 1,191,516 in 1871, and 1,684,898 in <lb/>
1901, gained 457,382 in the thirty years, or <lb/>
38 1/4 per cent. The maritime group of three <lb/>
provinces had a population of 767,415 thirty <lb/>
years ago, and 893,953, according to the last <lb/>
census, showing a gain of 126,538 or 16 1/2 <lb/>
per cent. <lb/></p> 

<p>Here then we have four different rates of <lb/>
growth, 16 1/2 per cent in the maritime sec<lb break="no"/>tion, 38 1/4 per cent in Quebec, 34 1/2 per cent <lb/>
in Ontario and 470 per cent in the great <lb/>
west. This comparison covers not a year <lb/>
or a ten year period merely, but the period <lb/>
of a generation. It indicates conditions that <lb/>
may operate for a generation to come. The <lb/>
rapid growth of the great west was a thing <lb/>
to be expected. What was not expected <lb/>
was that neither Ontario nor the maritime <lb/>
provinces have kept place with Quebec. <lb/>
And what is especially disappointing is that <lb/>
the increase in the population of the mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces in the thirty years has been <lb/>
less than one third of the increase that has <lb/>
taken place in Quebec, the pivot province <lb/>
on which our representation in parliament <lb/>
turns. <lb/></p> 

<p>To see whither we are drifting let us pro<lb break="no"/>ject these ratios of increase forward thirty <lb/>

years into the future, and note the results. <lb/>
We add 38 1/4 per cent—the past rate of in<lb break="no"/>crease—to the present population of Quebec <lb/>
and we find that province may have in <lb/>
thirty years from now 2,279,601 people. We <lb/>
add 16 1/2 per cent to the present population <lb/>
of the maritime provinces and we find they <lb/>
may then have 1,041,455 people. Assuming <lb/>
that Quebec has a population of 2,279,601 in <lb/>
the year 1931 the unit of representation in <lb/>
the Commons will be found, if we divide <lb/>
that number by 65—the number of members <lb/>
permanently allotted to Quebec—to be 35,<lb break="no"/>070. Dividing the unit of population into <lb/>
the prospective population of the maritime <lb/>
provinces in 1931—that is 1,040,455— and we <lb/>
find the maritime provinces would then be <lb/>
entitled to but 30 members at the most in<lb break="no"/>stead of the 43 we had when Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island entered the union. And where <lb/>
will Prince Edward Island be in the matter <lb/>
of representation after 1931, if our ratio of <lb/>
increase should be no better in the thirty <lb/>
years to come than it has been in the thirty <lb/>
years past? This is a simple matter of <lb/>
calculation. Our increase has been less <lb/>
than 10 per cent in the thirty years since <lb/>
1871. Add a full 10 per cent of gain in the <lb/>
thirty years forward and in 1931 we may <lb/>
count at most on a population of 113,585. <lb/>
Divide this by the unit of representation as <lb/>
it will then be, that is by 35,170 and it <lb/>
will be seen that we shall then be entitled <lb/>
to but three members—that is, if the terms <lb/>
of the British North America Act are ap<lb break="no"/>plied to us as is at present proposed by <lb/>
those in authority at Ottawa. Half our re<lb break="no"/>presentation as it was in 1873 would thus <lb/>
be swept away. It may be seen in the fact <lb/>
that just as soon as the province of Quebec <lb/>
becomes as densely populated as Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, we would not be entitled to <lb/>
any representation at all, which would be an <lb/>
absurdity, for the 22nd clause of the report <lb/>
of the Quebec conference declares that 'no <lb/>
fractional part of the unit of representation <lb/>
shall be considered, unless when exceeding <lb/>
one—half the number entitling to a member.' <lb/>
Quebec being 152 times our area, and the <lb/>
number of representatives limited to 65, we <lb/>
must need be more than twice as thickly <lb/>
populated as that province in order to have <lb/>
even one member. But Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land has not during the last decade nor is it <lb/>
likely to increase to the same extent as in <lb/>
the thirty years past. We came in with a <lb/>
population of 47 to the square mile and now <lb/>
have 51. Where will the representation of <lb/>
Prince Edward Island be when Quebec pop<lb break="no"/>ulation is even 40 to the square mile. Our <lb/>
province will be politically obliterated. <lb/>
Now, Mr. Speaker, these are well defined <lb/>
reasons why our representation should be <lb/>
the same as when we entered confederation. <lb/></p> 

<p>1. The very wording of the terms and the <lb/>
qualifying clause that the British North <lb/>
America Act shall apply 'except were alter<lb break="no"/>ed by these resolutions.' <lb/></p> 




<cb/>

<p>
2. To take any other interpretation would <lb/>
render us in time entitled to no representa<lb break="no"/>tion which would be an absurd and invalid <lb/>
contract. <lb/></p> 

<p>3. There are the demands of our delegates <lb/>
at the Quebec conference, the speeches on <lb/>
the Quebec terms in our local legislature, <lb/>
and the telegram announcing the granting <lb/>
of six members, the admission of a status <lb/>
of representation for a small self-governed <lb/>
province and varying the general terms— <lb/>
and the admission of British Columbia and <lb/>
Manitoba on the same principles and the <lb/>
stronger wording of British Columbia clause, <lb/>
is a good proof of our claim. <lb/></p> 

<p>If the government should persist in hold<lb break="no"/>ing that the representation of our province <lb/>
shall be reduced it will put in a very false <lb/>
position the men who made the confedera<lb break="no"/>tion bargain, and who may be accused of not <lb/>
safe-guarding the interests of the people of <lb/>
Prince Edward Island whom they repre<lb break="no"/>sented. All these things make a strong case <lb/>
why this government should not take from a <lb/>
small province the rights and privileges to <lb/>
which it is justly entitled. Speaking of the <lb/>
province of British Columbia in 1892 the <lb/>
right hon. the leader of the House said: <lb/>
That the intention of the parties should be <lb/>
considered, and British Columbia was in no <lb/>
different position than Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land is to-day. If the right hon. gentleman <lb/>
is still of that opinion I would ask him that <lb/>
the intention of the contracting parties be <lb/>
given effect to and that our province should <lb/>
be given its six representatives in this <lb/>
parliament. I ask the right hon. gentleman <lb/>
to see that the rights of our small province <lb/>
down by the sea are not lightly cast aside. <lb/></p>

representatives of the province of Ontario in <lb/>

pending before the Supreme Court it does <lb/>
seem to me that it is not the part of wisdom <lb/>
for the government to force this Bill through <lb/>
the House. This parliament has yet a long <lb/>
lease of life if it expires by eflux of time, <lb/>
and there is plenty of time left to us yet <lb/>
to legislate on the matter. In view of the <lb/>
dissatisfaction created in the provinces <lb/>
whose representation it is proposed to re<lb break="no"/>duce, it does seem to me that it is of the <lb/>
highest importance that the question should <lb/>
be first settled as to the constitutionality <lb/>
of reducing the representation of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. From the point of view of a lay<lb break="no"/>man it would seem that very serious ques<lb break="no"/>tion may arise. Suppose we should ille<lb break="no"/>gally reduce the representation of any of <lb/>
the provinces, and suppose the legality of <lb/>

the Supreme Court and then the judgment of <lb/>
the Supreme Court is final unless there is <lb/>
a special application made to grant leave <lb/>
to appeal from the Supreme Court to the <lb/>
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I thought that the conten<lb break="no"/>tion was that they could not appeal except <lb/>
a suit at law was actually brought, and that <lb/>
we were only applying to the Supreme <lb/>
Court for its advice. There is then all the <lb/>
stronger reason why we should ask delay. <lb/>
It seems to me that as the Judicial Commit<lb break="no"/>tee of the Privy Council is the highest court <lb/>
of the empire, we should if possible submit <lb/>
the case to it before going any further. That, <lb/>
I think would satisfy the provinces which <lb/>
are going to be deprived of part of their <lb/>
representation, and would satisfy the other <lb/>
provinces as well. We would then be sure <lb/>
of our ground and we would be going a <lb/>
long way towards destroying that feeling <lb/>
which is growing up to-day against the <lb/>
contention that the province of Ontario <lb/>
should have its representation reduced in <lb/>
this House by six members. Holding these <lb/>
views, and in view of the facts that there <lb/>
is no urgency, inasmuch as we are not near <lb/>
the end of the present parliament. I am dis<lb break="no"/>posed to move for delay. I therefore beg to <lb/>
move in amendment: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>That the Bill be not now read the second time <lb/>
but that the second reading thereof be deferred <lb/>
until after a judicial determination has been <lb/>
had with respect to the numbers of members <lb/>
to which the respective provinces are entitled <lb/>
under the census of 1901. <lb/></p> </quote>

<p>I do not think that any harm can result <lb/>
from the delay as we are not near the end <lb/>

to my hon. friend that the government can<lb break="no"/>not accept this amendment, and I think <lb/>
that, on reflection, he will agree with me <lb/>
it is not advisable we should. I would call <lb/>
his attention to the fact that we are bound <lb/>
by law to pass a Redistribution Bill imme<lb break="no"/>diately following the taking of the census. <lb/>
Parliament can be dissolved under our sys<lb break="no"/>tem at any time. Circumstances may arise <lb/>

that general election must take place ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the representation to which every <lb/>

more merely in order to illustrate the point <lb/>
I now make, that we are imperatively called <lb/>

on to pass a new Redistribution Bill. <lb/>
Section 51 provides: <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>On the completion of the census in the year <lb/>
1871, and of each subsequent decennial census. <lb/>
the representation of the four provinces shall <lb/>

<p>It does not say ' may,' but ' shall.' <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The census is not com<lb break="no"/>pleted yet. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">The PRIME MINISTER</persName>. The number of <lb/>
our population has been ascertained, so that <lb/>
all the information required for the pur<lb break="no"/>poses of redistribution is before us. If there <lb/>
were a very serious doubt as to whether or <lb/>
not the proposition advanced to-day is one <lb/>
which can be seriously entertained, I think <lb/>
it would be well perhaps to stay our hands. <lb/>
We have agreed to refer the question to <lb/>
the Supreme Court, not because we have <lb/>
any doubt, but simply in deference to the <lb/>
views held by some people in the different <lb/>
provinces, and in order to have their minds <lb/>
set at rest. But we think it is better to pro<lb break="no"/>ceed at once with the Bill and have the com<lb break="no"/>mittee, which the House will appoint, get <lb/>
to work at once. We propose to have the <lb/>
decision of the Supreme Court at a very <lb/>
early day. Should that decision be adverse <lb/>
to our pretention, we might fairly consider <lb/>
the proposition to stay our hands, but in <lb/>
the meantime I see no reason why the com<lb break="no"/>mittee should not go ahead with the mea<lb break="no"/>sure while the Supreme Court is considering <lb/>
the point we have submitted to it. If we <lb/>
find our views affirmed, I see no reason <lb/>
why the Bill should not become law. But <lb/>
if the Supreme Court should hold the view <lb/>
advanced by some hon. gentlemen opposite, <lb/>
then its decision would be a matter for <lb/>
consideration at the proper time. I submit <lb/>
that all the arguments advanced this after<lb break="no"/>noon against the proposed measure do not <lb/>
lead to the conclusion sought to be derived <lb/>
from them. It is admitted on all sides that <lb/>
when confederation was organized, it was <lb/>
not intended to be restricted to the four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces originally constituting it, but it was <lb/>
intended that other provinces should be al<lb break="no"/>lowed to come in later. It was contemplated <lb/>
that other provinces should be carved out <lb/>
in the west and also that other provinces <lb/>
might come in from the east. It was con<lb break="no"/>templated that Prince Edward Island should <lb/>
come in, and British Columbia and Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. as they have done, and also that we <lb/>
would be prepared to admit Newfoundland, <lb/>
and that in the course of time other terri<lb break="no"/>tories would be admitted as provinces into <lb/>
the full citizenship of the Canadian confed<lb break="no"/>eration. No one will contend that when this <lb/>
view was in the minds of those who framed <lb/>
confederation, of which we are all proud, <lb/>
it could have been intended that the law <lb/>
which was then enacted was to apply only <lb/>
to the four original provinces and not to all <lb/>
the provinces which were to come in later <lb/>
and form the Canadian family. It would <lb/>
 



<cb/>

not be reasonable to suppose that a certain <lb/>
law was framed to apply only to the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal constituent members of the confedera<lb break="no"/>tion and another law was to apply to those <lb/>
provinces which might come in later. At <lb/>
present we have not four but seven pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, next year we will have eight, and in <lb/>
a few years we shall have more, and the <lb/>
proposition, I believe, will be accepted by <lb/>
everybody, even by the hon. members for <lb/>
Lanark (Hon. Mr. Haggart), Hamilton (Mr. <lb/>
Barker), and Lincoln (Mr. Lancaster), that <lb/>
the same law should apply to all these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and that there should not be one <lb/>
law for four of them and another law for <lb/>
the rest. If there was anything in the minds <lb/>
of the framers of the constitution, it was <lb/>
that representation was to be based on popu<lb break="no"/>lation. That principle certainly was in the <lb/>
minds of the people at that time. It had <lb/>
been the subject of a long and very ardent <lb/>
controversy in two of the provinces. The <lb/>
province of Upper Canada had been insist<lb break="no"/>ing for a long time that there should be re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population. The province <lb/>
of Quebec did not object but insisted that <lb/>
there should not be representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation unless there were substantial guar<lb break="no"/>antees in favour of the minority in the con<lb break="no"/>federation. Representation by population <lb/>
was therefore certainly strong in the minds <lb/>
of the fathers of confederation, and <lb/>
in expecting that other provinces would <lb/>
come in later, it was certainly understood <lb/>
that when they did enter the same rule of <lb/>
representation and the same readjustment <lb/>
at every census should apply to them. But <lb/>
what do we hear to-day? We hear hon. <lb/>
members argue that we should have one <lb/>
rule for the four original provinces and an<lb break="no"/>other rule for the others; We are told that <lb/>
while it has been enacted that the province <lb/>
of Quebec should be the pivot around which <lb/>
the representation of all the other provinces <lb/>
should revolve, still this enactment is not <lb/>
to apply to the provinces of Ontario, Nova <lb/>
Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward <lb/>
Island. <lb/></p> 

<p> Mr. SPROULE. That the saving clause <lb/>
should apply to them. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">The PRIME MINISTER</persName>. I shall show <lb/>
that there is no saving clause. My hon. <lb/>
friend does not dispute that Quebec is to <lb/>
be the pivotal province. What is the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the province to-day? It is little <lb/>
less than two million souls. My hon. friend <lb/>
does not dispute that the unit of represen<lb break="no"/>tation in province of Quebec is 25,367. Now. <lb/>
the contention which we hold on this side <lb/>
of the House is that this 25,367 is to be the <lb/>
unit for all the provinces, not for the province <lb/>
of Quebec alone, but for the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario, the province of Nova Scotia, the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of British Columbia and the others. <lb/>
And, if that rule is to be applied and 25,367 <lb/>
souls is to be the unit of representation for <lb/>
the province of Quebec, does my hon. friend <lb/>
from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) contend that <lb/>
 

<pb n="1287" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1903-04-14_Page_01287.jpg"/>
<fw type="num">1287</fw>
<fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">1288</fw> 


the same rule should not apply to the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario? Would he contend that <lb/>
there should be for that province a difierent <lb/>
unit of representation? If the unit for the <lb/>
province of Ontario is to be the same as the <lb/>
province of Quebec then the province of <lb/>
Ontario is not entitled to ninety-two mem<lb break="no"/>bers, but only to eighty-six members. Will <lb/>
my hon. friend, considering this aspect of <lb/>
the case deliberately say that the same unit <lb/>
of representation is not to prevail in the <lb/>
one case as in the other? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. But it does not apply <lb/>
to all the provinces. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">The PRIME MINISTER</persName>. Yes, it will ap<lb break="no"/>ply to all. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Prince Edward Island is <lb/>
an exception. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">The PRIME MINISTER</persName>. Not at all; the <lb/>
same rule will apply to Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land, and under the application of the rule, <lb/>
Prince Edward Island must lose one member. <lb/>
But what is the view expressed by the hon. <lb/>
member for South Lanark (Hon. Mr. Hag<lb break="no"/>gart) and the hon. member for Hamilton <lb/>
(Mr. Barker)? It is that the unit of popu<lb break="no"/>lation for Ontario should not be the same <lb/>
as for Quebec, but that the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario should be entitled to ninety-two re<lb break="no"/>presentatives, that while it will require 25,367 <lb/>
to send one member to this House from Que<lb break="no"/>bec, it will require only 23,777 to send one <lb/>
from the province of Ontario. Was that <lb/>
ever contemplated at confederation? Will <lb/>
any one contend that that is a fair rule to <lb/>
apply? The compact at confederation stipu<lb break="no"/>lated that there should be a way open for <lb/>
other provinces to come in. The province <lb/>
of Manitoba comes in. The population of <lb/>
that province has increased according to the <lb/>
last census, so that it gains three members. <lb/>
British Columbia will gain one. The pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec will remain the same. This <lb/>
is the only basis upon which the operation <lb/>
could be carried on. Does any one suppose <lb/>
that the provinces of the west increasing <lb/>
their representation and the provinces of the <lb/>
east not decreasing proportionately to their <lb/>
population, the province of Quebec, which is <lb/>
the pivotal province would submit to such <lb/>
a state of things? I do not pretend that the <lb/>
province of Quebec would not submit to it <lb/>
if it were the law—it would undoubtedly. <lb/>
But if representation is to be based on popu<lb break="no"/>lation it must be that there is a balance <lb/>
swinging upwards and downwards—this <lb/>
province will lose, not having kept pace <lb/>
with the province of Quebec, and the other <lb/>
will gain having gone on more rapidly than <lb/>
Quebec. Therefore, it cannot be stated that <lb/>
the position we take is unreasonable. That <lb/>
is the reason why we thought it would not <lb/>
be advisable. under present circumstances, <lb/>
to wait until we have a judicial interpreta<lb break="no"/>tion of the law on this question. We pro<lb break="no"/>ceed on this occasion as has been done on <lb/>
 

<cb/>

former occasions, and the argument in court <lb/>
is to allow no room for misunderstanding. <lb/>
In deference to the provinces that lose, we <lb/>
have agreed to follow them into court and <lb/>
argue the matter there. I would like to say <lb/>
a word in answer to my hon. friend from <lb/>
Prince Edward Island (Mr. Lefurgey) whom <lb/>
I regret not to see in his place. That hon. <lb/>
gentleman has appealed to me. But the <lb/>
government is not a free agent in this <lb/>
matter, we have not a will of our own. It <lb/>
is not through caprice or whim or any other <lb/>
motive of that kind that we introduce this <lb/>
Bill; it is in deference to the imperative man<lb break="no"/>date of the law. But if the hon. gentleman <lb/>
(Mr. Lefurgey) believes that the province <lb/>
that he represents should be kept in the <lb/>
position, as to representation, that it now <lb/>
has, I can only say to him that we have told <lb/>
the representatives of the province that we <lb/>
are ready to follow them into court—not <lb/>
that we have any doubt on the subject, but <lb/>
because they have doubt, and as good com<lb break="no"/>rades and fellow citizens we should be glad <lb/>
to have the matter authoritatively adjudi<lb break="no"/>cated. On the 6th March I received a letter <lb/>
from the premier of Prince Edward Island, <lb/>
which I will read:— <lb/></p> 


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p rendition="simple:right">Charlottetown, P.E.I., <lb/>
March 6, 1903. <lb/></p> 

<p>Dear Sir,—When the delegation from our pro<lb break="no"/>vince, consisting of Mr. D. A. MacKinnon, M.P., <lb/>
Hon. Benjamin Rogers, Hon. Mr. Whear and <lb/>
myself waited upon your government in Ottawa <lb/>
a short time ago, with regard to the question of <lb/>
the representation of this province being main<lb break="no"/>tained as it was at the time of confederation, <lb/>
namely, six members, the matter, as you know <lb/>
was discussed by myself and Messrs. Whear, <lb/>
Rogers and MacKinnon, and your honourable <lb/>
board seemed to take a contrary view to the one <lb/>
which I and my colleagues held; that is, that <lb/>
at the time of confederation there was a con<lb break="no"/>tract expressed or implied, that this province <lb/>
should never have a less representation than <lb/>
six, as long, at any rate, as the population did <lb/>
not decrease below 95,000, which was the popu<lb break="no"/>lation we had when we entered confederation, <lb/>
and, upon which population we were granted <lb/>
six representatives.   <lb/></p> 

<p>The reasons given at the time for granting <lb/>
those six representatives were not on the <lb/>
ground of the population or the question of the <lb/>
unit of population, but, on account, as was ex<lb break="no"/>pressed in the correspondence, of the peculiar <lb/>
situation of the island, and it being divided in<lb break="no"/>to three counties, rendered it almost impossi<lb break="no"/>ble or very inconvenient to divide the province <lb/>
into districts for less than six. Upon this and <lb/>
other grounds, we contended and still contend <lb/>
that we were and are entitled to six representa<lb break="no"/>tives. However, as I have stated, your hon<lb break="no"/>ourable board took a contrary view to the one <lb/>
taken by us on this point. <lb/></p> 

<p>The delegation then requested your board. if <lb/>
you were fully convinced that we were not en<lb break="no"/>titled to six representatives, to permit the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Prince Edward Island, under the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the statute to state a case to the <lb/>
Supreme Court, if they thought proper, setting <lb/>
out all the correspondence and such other mat<lb break="no"/>ters as might be deemed advisable for the de<lb break="no"/>cision or the Supreme Court" as to whether or <lb/>

not, under the terms of union, Prince Edward <lb/>
Island was and is entitled to six members; and <lb/>
if you recollect, which I have no doubt you do, <lb/>
your answer to me was that you had no ob<lb break="no"/>jection to a case being stated and I thought <lb/>
your attorney-general, Mr. Fitzpatrick, con<lb break="no"/>curred in the matter and raised no objection. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now, our legislature meets on the 19th of <lb/>
this month, and I would like to be in a position <lb/>
to have some written statement from you or <lb/>
your government bearing out these facts, and <lb/>
that you are willing that this province, if it <lb/>
thinks proper, should state a case to the Su<lb break="no"/>preme Court. I do not think that you can have <lb/>
any objection to giving this assurance in writ<lb break="no"/>ing, that your government is willing that this <lb/>
province shall take this course, if it deems ad<lb break="no"/>visable. <lb/></p> 

<p>This application by our government to have a <lb/>
case stated to the Supreme Court will of course <lb/>
be understood by your government to be with<lb break="no"/>out prejudice to any right that we may have <lb/>
to any other course which may now be open to <lb/>
us to insist upon this right. <lb/></p>

province of Ontario, now represented by the <lb/>

<cb/>

even when the principle works to its own <lb/>
disadvantage. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Ontario raises no objec<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">The PRIME MINISTER</persName>. I believe it has <lb/>
agreed to follow the other provinces into <lb/>
court; but it has not taken the initial step, for <lb/>
it has, perhaps, the most proper ideas on the <lb/>
subject of representation by population of <lb/>
any of the provinces. But, I suppose, the hon. <lb/>
gentleman (Mr. Sproule) would insist upon <lb/>
this demand even to the detriment of the <lb/>
other provinces of the Dominion. He is of <lb/>
those who, opposed representation by popu<lb break="no"/>lation before, and he is true to his record. <lb/>
But I appeal to every Liberal member and <lb/>
also to many Conservative members, that <lb/>
the unit of representation should be the <lb/>
same for all provinces whether they lose or <lb/>
gain; and this is the principle upon which we <lb/>
proceed at the present time. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). On behalf of <lb/>
the Liberal government in Nova Scotia, I <lb/>
must resent the imputation which is cast <lb/>
upon it by the right hon. gentleman (Rt. <lb/>
Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier), and I do the same <lb/>
on behalf of the Liberal government of New <lb/>
Brunswick—for I believe it calls itself Lib<lb break="no"/>eral at the present time. I resent on behalf <lb/>
of my own province the invidious compari<lb break="no"/>son the right hon. gentleman has made be<lb break="no"/>tween the Liberal government of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince and the Liberal government of the <lb/>
province of Ontario. The right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man seems to have very peculiar ideas <lb/>
about this legislation. He says the unit of <lb/>
population in Nova Scotia, or Ontario, as <lb/>
the case may be, would be smaller if you <lb/>
applied section 4. Well, is not the statute <lb/>
before us? Does the right hon. gentleman <lb/>
deny that the statute would have that opera<lb break="no"/>tion if no other provinces had come in, and <lb/>
would not what he claims to be an evil <lb/>
have existed in that case by the very terms <lb/>
of the statute? Assuming that no other <lb/>
province had joined Canada up to the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time, nnd assuming that the four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces had increased as they have during <lb/>
the past ten years, then the very thing <lb/>
which the right hon. gentleman says is a <lb/>
scandal would have happened under the <lb/>
terms of the statute. Well, is it wrong <lb/>
to ask that the constitution should be ob<lb break="no"/>served? In the case I have suggested, <lb/>
surely it should not be attributed as blame <lb/>
to those provinces that they have asked <lb/>
that the constitution should be observed. <lb/>
There is no necessity for heat on the part <lb/>
of my right hon. friend, when these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are asking for the opinion of the <lb/>
court as to whether this provision still re<lb break="no"/>mains intact in the constitution, although <lb/>
other provinces have come in. That is <lb/>
all they are asking, and is any blame <lb/>

to be cast upon them, is any insinuation <lb/>
to be made against thém, for simply <lb/>
wanting to have the court determine <lb/>
whether or not that which admittedly was <lb/>
constitutional before the other provinces <lb/>
came in, is still constitutional notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing that these other provinces have been <lb/>
added? Why then should my right hon. <lb/>
friend seek to raise with regard to this <lb/>
question the matters which he has seen fit <lb/>
to bring to the attention of the House to<lb break="no"/>night? I am sure there is no harm in <lb/>
adhering to the constitution. My right hon. <lb/>
friend has always been a great admirer <lb/>
of the constitution. Then if we desire to <lb/>
adhere to the constitution, surely there is no <lb/>
harm in asking the courts to have that <lb/>
question determined. That is all that any <lb/>
one has asked up to the present time, so <lb/>
far as I am aware. <lb/></p> 

<p>My right hon. friend points to the unit <lb/>
of population. Well, the unit of Prince <lb/>
Edward Island, British Columbia and <lb/>
Manitoba, when those provinces came <lb/>
in, was not at all the same unit <lb/>
as prevailed in the other provinces. <lb/>
The right hon. gentleman knows that as <lb/>
well as I do, every member of the House <lb/>
knows it. Under this very Bill the unit of <lb/>
population in the North-west Territories is <lb/>
not the same. I am not finding any fault <lb/>
with the Bill in that regard, because I do <lb/>
not think that too great a representation is <lb/>
being given to the North-west Territories. <lb/>
But still the unit of population there is <lb/>
smaller than it is in the other provinces. <lb/>
The unit of population for the North-west <lb/>
Territories under the last census would be <lb/>
less than 16,000, whereas in the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces it is between 25,000 and 20,000. <lb/></p> 

<p>Now what is to be gained by going on <lb/>
while this matter is sub judice? It is practi<lb break="no"/>cally sub judice at the present time, because <lb/>
the Minister of Justice is taking steps, as I <lb/>
understand, to have ths matter referred to <lb/>
the Supreme Court, under a provision in <lb/>
the Supreme Court Act. Suppose that we <lb/>
go on in the meantime and delimit the con<lb break="no"/>stituencies in the provinces where changes <lb/>
have to be made, the work of our com<lb break="no"/>mittee will be all for naught in case the <lb/>
decision should be against the view which <lb/>
has been expressed by the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice. I have every possible respect for the <lb/>
opinion of my hon. friend the Minister of <lb/>
Justice, as I said before; but although he <lb/>
is strong on this point, he very candidly <lb/>
admits to the House that he is not infallible. <lb/>
None of us claim to be infallible, and it <lb/>
may happen that he is mistaken. I have <lb/>
not a very pronounced opinion myself, I <lb/>
have not a pronounced opinion against that <lb/>
of the Minister of Justice; but I can see <lb/>
that a strong argument can be made on the <lb/>
other side. I can also see that the argu<lb break="no"/>ment of the Minister of Justice leads to some <lb/>
extraordinary conclusions. For example, he <lb/>
based his argument almost entirely upon <lb/>
the opinion that under the provisions of <lb/>
 

<cb/>

section 146, the addition of other provinces <lb/>
to Canada had resulted in amending the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of section 51. He was Willing to <lb/>
make the admission that in section 51 the <lb/>
word Canada originally meant only the four <lb/>
provinces, as the right hon. gentleman him<lb break="no"/>self has stated. Well, suppose you had had <lb/>
in the addresses under which those different <lb/>
provinces were admitted, a provision that <lb/>
their representation should be such as the <lb/>
parliament of Canada might afterwards de<lb break="no"/>termine, it would logically follow from the <lb/>
argument of the Minister of Justice to-day <lb/>
that the parliament of Canada would have, <lb/>
by reason of the power so given in the ad<lb break="no"/>dresses, the right to alter the representa<lb break="no"/>tion of Ontario, and Quebec, and the mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces. I submit to the Minister <lb/>
of Justice, that this would be the logical <lb/>
result. It seems to me, with all deference to <lb/>
the opinion of the Minister of Justice, that <lb/>
if the argument cannot be based upon a <lb/>
higher ground than that, there is good cause <lb/>
for referring this matter to the Supreme <lb/>
Court. As I said before, we might simply <lb/>
be wasting our time by going on now and <lb/>
dealing with this matter while the question <lb/>
is sub judice. Therefore, I think the right <lb/>
hon. gentleman who leads the government <lb/>
might well consent to the amendement of <lb/>
my hon. friend from Grey, and allow the <lb/>
second reading of this Bill to stand until <lb/>
the court shall have given a judicial deter<lb break="no"/>mination with regard to this question, which <lb/>
has been discussed at such great length in <lb/>
the House to-day. <lb/></p>

<p>Amendment (Mr. Sproule) negatived; <lb/>

<cb/>

<p>
<persName ref="pers:LAUR5">The PRIME MINISTER</persName> (Rt. Hon. Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>frid Laurier) moved: <lb/></p> 

<p>That the said Bill be raferred to a special <lb/>
committee composed of Measrs. Fitzpatrick, <lb/>
Sutherland (Oxford), Hyman, Davis, Borden <lb/>
(Halifax), Haggart and Monk, with instruction <lb/>
to prepare schedules to contain and describe <lb/>
the several electoral divisions entitled to re<lb break="no"/>turn members to this House. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName> (Halifax). Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, for reasons which I have already <lb/>
stated and which I shall not repeat now, I <lb/>
think, if this proposed tribunal is to be of <lb/>
the nature of a conference, such as has been <lb/>
described, it should be composed of an equal <lb/>
number of members on each side of the <lb/>
House. My right hon. friend (Rt. Hon. Sir <lb/>
Wilfrid Laurier) in introducing this Bill laid <lb/>
down the principle that it was to be a con<lb break="no"/>ference, as I understood it, although I think <lb/>
he also used the word ' committee '—a <lb/>
conference designed for the purpose of agree<lb break="no"/>ment. A committee such as is now sug<lb break="no"/>gested is simply an ordinary committee re<lb break="no"/>presenting as far as may be the numerical <lb/>
strength of each side of the House, and <lb/>
therefore it cannot be in the nature in the <lb/>
nature of a committee to represent the views <lb/>
of the majority of the House. However, I <lb/>
do not want to take up the time of the <lb/>
House at this stage in repeating what I have <lb/>
already said this afternoon. I again renew <lb/>
the suggestion I made to my right hon. <lb/>
friend at that time that if it is really intend<lb break="no"/>ed to be a conference it should be composed <lb/>
of an equal number of members on each <lb/>
side of the House. <lb/></p> 

<p>There is one further suggestion I have to <lb/>
make in regard to the motion and that is <lb/>
that the committee shall be given power <lb/>
to examine witnesses on oath and to send <lb/>
for persons and papers. I have already <lb/>
mentioned that matter privately to my right <lb/>
hon. friend, and he thinks it is not neces<lb break="no"/>sary that that provision should be made <lb/>
now. I desire to reserve my right to make <lb/>
a motion to that effect if it should after<lb break="no"/>wards become necessary. I mention this, <lb/>
because, otherwise, it might be taken as an <lb/>
admission on my part that I considered the <lb/>
motion in its present form as absolutely <lb/>
sufficient for all contingencies which might <lb/>
hereafter arise. <lb/></p> 

<p>Motion agreed to. <lb/></p> 

<p>On motion of the Prime Minister, House <lb/>
adjourned at 11.15 p.m. <lb/></p>
