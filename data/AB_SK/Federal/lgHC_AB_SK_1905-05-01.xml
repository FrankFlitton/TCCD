     <lb/>
     amendment. Our law is the same as the 
     <lb/>
     English law according to the decisions in 
     <lb/>
     the Hanrahan and the Kempton Park 
     <lb/>
     cases. I say that there are enough means 
     <lb/>
     of fleecing the lambs of the Dominion with<lb break="no"/>out conferring any other facilities than 
     <lb/>
     what we have at the present time.

            <p>
     Mr. BUREAU. As far as the law in 
     <lb/>
     England in concerned, I have here a report 
     <lb/>
     in the London 'Times' of April 5. 1905. 
     <lb/>
     of an Act recently passed in England, for 
     <lb/>
     the suppression of gambling on streets and 
     <lb/>
     other public places. The Act defines what 
     <lb/>
     gambling is and there is a special section 
     <lb/>
     of the law which says: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to 
     <lb/>
     any ground used for the purpose of a race. 
     <lb/>
     course for racing with horses or adjacent there<lb break="no"/>to on the days on which races take place. 
     <lb/>
            </quote>
   
            <p>
     What we desire to exempt by this amend<lb break="no"/>ment are incorporated associations. There 
     <lb/>
     is a provision in the law. as the member for 
     <lb/>
     South Essex (Mr. Clarke) has said that 
     <lb/>
     betting can go on among individuals but all 
     <lb/>
     who have had to do with race tracks know 
     <lb/>
     that the betting on races is almost invari<lb break="no"/>ably carried on by bookmakers. These 
     <lb/>
     two clauses are conflicting. Individuals 
     <lb/>
     may bet among themselves and are not 
     <lb/>
     guilty, of any offence, under the law, but 
     <lb/>
     still if they go to a certain place to bet, 
     <lb/>
     where the bookmaker carries on business, 
     <lb/>
     they are guilty. The object of the present 
     <lb/>
     amendment is simply to make the law uni<lb break="no"/>form.

            <p>Hon. L. P. BRODEUR (Minister of In<lb break="no"/>land Revenue). Mr. Speaker, there is ob<lb break="no"/>jection I understand to the Bill being read<lb/>a thrid time, and as there have been some<lb/>amendments the third reading cannot go on <lb/>except with the unanimous consent of the <lb/>house.<lb/>

            </p>
            <p>Sir WILFRED LAURIER (Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ster). Before we resume the discussion up<lb break="no"/>on the main question which has been be<lb break="no"/>fore the House for some time, it is my duty<lb/>to inform the House that we have lost one<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
    

            <p>of our confreres in the person of Mr. De<lb break="no"/>mers of Lévis. Mr. Demers was a very <lb/>quiet, unobstrusive member of this House,<lb/>but he was at the same time a very intel<lb break="no"/>ligent and refined gentleman, and those who<lb/>had the pleasure of his acquaintance will <lb/>deeply regret his loss. All the members of<lb/>the House will unite in offering to his be<lb break="no"/>reaved family their sympathies and con<lb break="no"/>dolences.<lb/>

            <p>
     Mr. R. L. BORDEN (Carleton, Ont.) Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker. I am sure that on behalf of those 
     <lb/>
     who sit to your left, I can join most sin<lb break="no"/>cerely in the words of condolence which 
     <lb/>
     have just been uttered by the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister, and I can assure the family of the 
     <lb/>
     deceased gentleman that all those on this 
     <lb/>
    side of the House who have enjoyed the 
     <lb/>acquaintance of the hon. member will ex<lb break="no"/>tend to them their hearty sympathy in 
     <lb/>their bereavement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>Mr. O. E. TALBOT (Bellechasse.) (Trans<lb break="no"/>lation.) Mr. Speaker, it is with very pro<lb break="no"/>found emotion that I will add a few words 
     <lb/>of appreciation to those which have already 
     <lb/>fallen from the lips of the hon. Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier), and the hon. 
     <lb/>leader of the opposition (Mr. Borden), with 
     <lb/>respect to the lamented Mr. Demers, mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Lévis. Although his death was 
     <lb/>foreseen, it will none the less cause deep 
     <lb/>regret in this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The member for Lévis was one of my 
     <lb/>
     old friends. By his probity and high sense 
     <lb/>
     of honour, he had made his mark more 
     <lb/>
     distinct. He was esteemed and respected 
     <lb/>
     by every one. I think I voice the senti<lb break="no"/>ments of all the members of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, nay, all the members of the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons, who had the advantage 
     <lb/>
     of knowing him, in expressing here the pro<lb break="no"/>found regret that we feel on the occasion 
     <lb/>
     of his death. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Demers was a modest man; but by 
     <lb/>
     his courtesy and urbanity, he had won 
     <lb/>
     the respect and esteem of all his colleagues.

                  gentlemen. I have, however, read <lb/> with a great deal of care the speeches when
                  <lb/> the right hon. First Minister (Sir Wilfrid <lb/> Laurier) has made in
                  support of this mea<lb break="no"/>sure, as well as the speeches of the hon. <lb/>
                  Minister of Customs (Mr. Paterson), the <lb/> hon. Minister of Finance (Mr.
                  Fielding), the <lb/> hon. ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) <lb/> and the
                  hon. member for Labelle (Mr. <lb/> Bourassa), and I would very much Indeed <lb/>
                  have desired to have read everything else <lb/> that has been said on this very
                  important <lb/> subject, because, with the rest of the hon. <lb/> members of this
                  House and in common with <lb/> them, I look upon it as the most important <lb/>
                  matter that has been before this House, as <lb/> far as I know, since
                  confederation. But, <lb/> Sir, I am impressed by a further fact. This <lb/>
                  debate, in some measure, has drifted, I re<lb break="no"/>gret to say, into abuse.
                  If there is one thing <lb/> more than another that I admired in the <lb/> speech
                  of the right hon. First Minister in <lb/> which he introduced this Bill, it was
                  the <lb/> suggestion that we should proceed to its <lb/> consideration with
                  calmness, with modera<lb break="no"/>tion and with some effort to conceive that
                  <lb/> others besides ourselves might have honest <lb/> convictions in respect to
                  this very important <lb/> matter; but I deeply regret that some of <lb/> the
                  followers of the right hon. gentleman <lb/> have not seen fit to approach this
                  important <lb/> question with that feeling which the right <lb/> hon. gentleman so
                  well expressed. Why, Sir. <lb/> how can it be fairly or reasonably said <lb/> for
                  one moment that the city of Toronto, <lb/> in which I happen to live is bigoted
                  and <lb/> intolerant? Were it a fact true, how dis<lb break="no"/>graceful it
                  would be to throw up to us that <lb/> we were so ignorant, so far behind the rest
                  <lb/> of the people of this country in our knowl<lb break="no"/>edge of what is
                  reasonable and just, <lb/> how disgraceful that such language should <lb/> be
                  addresed to us rather than the <lb/> language of kindness, consideration and <lb/>
                  conciliation ? I wish to say, Sir, that the <lb/> constituency which I have the
                  great honour <lb/> to represent in this House, no later than the <lb/> 25th of
                  January last, gave a majority of <lb/> 2,800 votes in favour of a Roman Catholic
                  <lb/> (Hon. J. J. Foy), and I want to say <lb/> also that, bigoted as we are, or
                  as <lb/> we are said to be, we have the greatest <lb/> affection and admiration
                  for all our fellow- <lb break="yes"/> countrymen, whether they are Catholics or
                  <lb/> Protestants, whether they are of English, <lb/> Irish, Scotch or French
                  descent. We make <lb/> and we endeavour to make no distinction, <lb/> and I
                  sincerely trust that no member of <lb/> this House will in future feel constrained
                  <lb/> to use any such language as that to which <lb/> I have referred towards any
                  part of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario. But, dealing for the mo<lb
                     break="no"/>ment with the constituency which I have <lb/> the honour to
                  represent, and for which I <lb/> had the honour to be elected by acclamation,
                  <lb/> can it be said that this constituency, which, <lb/> in 1896, sent a
                  supporter of the right hon. <lb/> gentleman to this House, and which at that <lb/>
                  time sent five opponents of the coercion of <lb/>
                  <cb/> Manitoba to this House, is a constituency <lb/> which is guilty of bigotry
                  and intolerance ? <lb/> Of course as Orangemen and as Tories, <lb/> people
                  naturally expect abuse, but I <lb/> did not think the Liberal party would be <lb/>
                  disposed to use any such epithets towards <lb/> the leading Liberals of Ontario.
                  Now, Sir, <lb/> we have been told that there has been a <lb/> compromise in
                  respect to this Bill. I will <lb/> deal with that later ; but, Sir, if there is
                  any <lb/> compromise in respect to this Bill, what <lb/> has been the lever that
                  has brought about <lb/> this compromise? Has it been the argument <lb/> of my hon.
                  friend the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion (Mr. R. L. Borden)? Not at
                  all. If <lb/> any compromise has taken place, it has <lb/> taken place because of
                  the vigorous, united <lb/> and strong protests that have come to this <lb/> House
                  from nearly every Liberal consti<lb break="no"/>tuency in Ontario. I venture to
                  say that <lb/> in 1896 no Liberal ever got a warmer, more <lb/> enthusiastic,
                  heartier or more cordial recep<lb break="no"/>tion than that accorded to the right
                  hon. <lb/> First Minister, when he came to the city <lb/> of Toronto. Mr. Speaker,
                  if that was the <lb/> feeling of the people in the city of Toronto, <lb/> in 1896,
                  since When have they suddenly <lb/> become bigoted and intolerant? If their <lb/>
                  hearts and minds and feelings were stirred <lb/> with admiration of the right hon.
                  Prime <lb/> Minister, then in a constituency which, in <lb/> 1896, returned a
                  Liberal candidate (the late <lb/> Mr. Justice Lount), which, later on, returned
                  <lb/> a Liberal (Mr. Bertram), and which was <lb/> barely wrested from the Liberal
                  party in <lb/> 1900, in a constituency which, in 1904, with <lb/> the most popular
                  candidate the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive party could put in the field, was
                  barely <lb/> won by such candidate (the late Mr. E. F. <lb/> Clarke) by a majority
                  of 200, how is it no <lb/> Liberal candidate came forward in April <lb/> last?
                  What was the change? What facts <lb/> had intervened ? The people were not <lb/>
                  bigoted in 1896. They objected to the coer<lb break="no"/>cion of Manitoba. What
                  facts intervened <lb/> between the election in November and the <lb/> election by
                  acclamation in April last ? <lb/> Nothing assuredly but the introduction into
                  <lb/> parliament of these Bills. Now, Sir, I dare <lb/> say it has been quoted to
                  you, and I do not <lb/> propose to dwell on this matter at length, <lb/>but I do
                  feel that some justice should be <lb/>done to the people who honestly believe
                  <lb/>that this legislation is wrong, and that <lb/>Liberal members of this House
                  are misre<lb break="no"/>presenting the views and feelings of the <lb/>Liberal
                  party in this country. I wish to <lb/>read a paragraph from what was once sup<lb

     type of D. E. Thompson, K.C., a Liberal 
     <lb/>
     lawyer known throughout the whole coun<lb break="no"/>try, and by Rev. Dr. Milligan, a man most 
     <lb/>
     highly respected throughout this land. On 
     <lb/>
     behalf of such men, if I may be permitted to 
     <lb/>
     do so, I desire to repudiate the suggestion 
     <lb/>
     that they are either bigoted or intolerant, 
     <lb/>
     on the contrary, I could more truly describe 
     <lb/>
     them as patriots, as men who put principle 
     <lb/>
     above party, as men who were not quite so 
     <lb/>
     able as others were to cheerfully cast aside 
     <lb/>
     the political principles which during the 
     <lb/>
     last thirty years they had been educated 
     <lb/>
     in, by Mackenzie, by Blake, by Mowat, by 
     <lb/>
     Davies and by the right hon. the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister himself. And, Sir, if the Liberals 
     <lb/>
    in this parliament believe what they 
     <lb/>say, how unkind, how ungracious it 
     <lb/>was of them not to come to the 
     <lb/>great city of Toronto to talk with 
     <lb/>these brothers who were so misled, 
     <lb/>and to endeavour to convince them of their 
     <lb/>wrong. How much more courageous it 
     <lb/>would have been for the gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>to have come openly to that city, and stand<lb break="no"/>ing on the platform say, as the Prime 
     <lb/>Minister says in this House: I am stand<lb break="no"/>ing where I stood in 1896. I can assure 
     <lb/>the Prime Minister that had he done so he 
     <lb/>would have addressed men who would have 
     <lb/>felt in the kindliest way towards him, 
     <lb/>    
    
           
            <cb/>
          
     and men whose minds and hearts were 
     <lb/>
     open to conviction. If the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man and those associated with him in the 
     <lb/>
     government of this country believe that 
     <lb/>
     they are standing where they stood in 1896, 
     <lb/>
     I can assure them that the leaders of the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party who do not sit in this House 
     <lb/>
     have not been able to reach the same con<lb break="no"/>clusion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The subject under consideration seems 
     <lb/>
     to present itself in practically two ways; 
     <lb/>
     first, has the parliament of Canada the pow<lb break="no"/>er to pass this legislation? and, second, if 
     <lb/>
     it has the power, is it good policy to do so? 
     <lb/>
    I would have thought, in view of the able, 
     <lb/>
     and so far as I have been able to read, 
     <lb/>
     unanswered argument of the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition, that if it had been at all pos<lb break="no"/>sible to have saved this country the un<lb break="no"/>fortunate discussion which has taken place 
     <lb/>
     for the past two months, it would have 
     <lb/>
     been the part of wisdom, the part of good 
     <lb/>
     politics, and the part of good statesmanship 
     <lb/>
     to have endeavoured to do so. Assuredly, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, if the parliament of Canada has no 
     <lb/>
     power to pass this legislation, then all these 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary appeals, able as many of 
     <lb/>
     them have been, in favour of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools or in favour of the Bill before us 
     <lb/>
     are idle and useless, and the country has 
     <lb/>
     been unnecessarily aroused and the time of 
     <lb/>
     parliament unnecessarily wasted. I wish 
     <lb/>
     for a few moments to direct the attention 
     <lb/>
     of this House to the important question as 
     <lb/>
     to whether the parliament of Canada has 
     <lb/>
     the power to pass this legislation. When 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act was passed 
     <lb/>
     in 1867, there was I venture to think, no 
     <lb/>
     power given to the parliament of Canada to 
     <lb/>
     carve out new provinces. The only section 
     <lb/>
     which deals with the admission of new 
     <lb/>
     provinces and with the admission of these 
     <lb/>
     new Territories—which by the way were 
     <lb/>
     then not part of Canada and are not pos<lb break="no"/>sibly covered by the Act—the only section 
     <lb/>
     that deals with this at all is section 146, 
     <lb/>
     and I think the Minister of Justice will not 
     <lb/>
     endeavour to contend that under section 
     <lb/>
     146 the parliament of Canada has the pow<lb break="no"/>er to pass this legislation. I must confess 
     <lb/>
     that I would have considered it only fair 
     <lb/>
     to the members on this side of the House, 
     <lb/>
     if the Minister of Justice had been 
     <lb/>
     thoughtful enough at an early stage of 
     <lb/>
     this debate to have answered, if answer 
     <lb/>
     were possible the able argument of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition. His silence 
     <lb/>
     has placed us in the position that we are 
     <lb/>
     compelled in advance to criticise a pro<lb break="no"/>position which should have been established 
     <lb/>
     beyond all doubt by the government. The 
     <lb/>
     onus does not lie on us to show that this 
     <lb/>
     parliament has not the power to pass this 
     <lb/>
     legislation; the onus lies on the govern<lb break="no"/>ment to show parliament that we have 
     <lb/>
     that power. And, after such an able ans<lb break="no"/>wer as the leader of the opposition made 
     <lb/>
     to the argument of the Prime Minister, it 
     <lb/>
    was due to the House—if there was any 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="5145" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5145.jpg"/>

               <fw type="num">5146</fw>

     further light to be thrown on this consti<lb break="no"/>tutional question—that we should have had 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity, as early as possible, or hear<lb break="no"/>ing a pronouncement from the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice. I say, Sir, that there is no power 
     <lb/>
     contained in the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     to carve out new provinces, but, there was a 
     <lb/>
     power given in that Act to admit these new 
     <lb/>
     Territories which were not then part of 
     <lb/>
     the union. They were therefore, not cover<lb break="no"/>ed by section 93 of the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca Act at that time, because they were not 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion of Canada at all, they be<lb break="no"/>ing under the Hudson Bay Company under 
     <lb/>
     the imperial parliament. It takes some fur<lb break="no"/>ther enactment to bring them under that 
     <lb/>
     section. Having got those Territories into 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion under the Act of 1870, 
     <lb/>
     the province of Manitoba, in advance 
     <lb/>
     of legislation by the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, was carved out of these Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories by the parliament of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     but, it does not at all follow that if this 
     <lb/>
     parliament assumed jurisdiction to carve 
     <lb/>
     out the provinces, therefore the legislation 
     <lb/>
     was intra vires. The parliament of Canada 
     <lb/>
     evidently thought they had not the right to 
     <lb/>
     do so, and shortly afterwards there was 
     <lb/>
     legislation in this regard, passed by the 
     <lb/>
     imperial parliament, and the same imperial 
     <lb/>
     legislation which validated the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     Act, for the first time gave the parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada the power to carve provinces out 
     <lb/>
     of these new Territories. I call the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the House to section 2 of the Act of 1871, 
     <lb/>
     which gives this power, because if this 
     <lb/>
     power is not in the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, there is no inherent power in the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada to create these provinces; 
     <lb/>
     and for this reason, that any power the par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada has in respect to this 
     <lb/>
     legislation must of necessity come from the 
     <lb/>
     imperial parliament, and until the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1871 was passed, the imperial parliament 
     <lb/>
     alone had the power to carve out these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. So, Sir, it my argument is cor<lb break="no"/>rect, the parliament of Canada as repre<lb break="no"/>senting the imperial parliament, has just 
     <lb/>
     that power to carve out provinces, which 
     <lb/>
     the imperial parliament gave her. Let us 
     <lb/>
     look at what the power was that the im<lb break="no"/>perial parliament gave to the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Section 2 says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     The parliament of Canada may from time to

     <lb/>

            <p>
     I call special attention to the clause:

            <p>
     It does not say any constitution which 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada may think proper 
     <lb/>
     to establish; but it says that it may make 
     <lb/>
     provision for the constitution: and in 1886 
     <lb/>
     was passed the Act which provided that this 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1871 and the Act of 1867 should be 
     <lb/>
     read together. Now, Sir, what happened? 
     <lb/>
     Simply this, that if the Act of 1871 is to be 
     <lb/>
     construed as part of the Act of 1867, then 
     <lb/>
     assuredly the parliament of Canada, in ex<lb break="no"/>ercising the power to give a constitution, 
     <lb/>
     has only the right to give such a constitu<lb break="no"/>tion as the earlier sections of the empower<lb break="no"/>ing Act permitted it to give. In other words, 
     <lb/>
     if the imperial parliament in the later sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the Act says, you may carve out a 
     <lb/>
     province and give it a constitution, in the 
     <lb/>
     earlier sections it says the constitution must 
     <lb/>
     be thus and so. Where, then, does the par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada get the power to vary 
     <lb/>
     that constitution ? The imperial parliament, 
     <lb/>
     in section 92 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, provides what shall be the exclusive 
     <lb/>
     powers of provincial legislatures, and in 
     <lb/>
     section 93, dealing with education, it says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     In and for each province the legislature may

     <lb/>
               </quote>
   
            <p>
     Then the subsections follow. What I 
     <lb/>
     desire to submit to the consideration of this 
     <lb/>
     House is that the power having been given 
     <lb/>
     by the imperial parliament to this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to make the constitution, the section 
     <lb/>
     which gives that power being part of the 
     <lb/>
     Act which provides the special constitu<lb break="no"/>tion and powers of the province, the only 
     <lb/>
     power which this parliament has in this 
     <lb/>
     matter is to give these new provinces the 
     <lb/>
     constitution which the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act has provided, and no other. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Clement, in his work on the Canadian Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, confirms this opinion. The late 
     <lb/>
     Hon. David Mills expressed similar views. 
     <lb/>
     If this, then, is a correct interpretation of 
     <lb/>
     that Act, then I consider it a most 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate thing that we have had 
     <lb/>
     this unhappy discussion in this House 
     <lb/>
     and throughout the newspapers of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion; and, Sir, if I may be per<lb break="no"/>mitted to offer a criticism of the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. the Prime Minister, I must confess 
     <lb/>
     that I felt that it was most unfortunate if 
     <lb/>
     he stood on the rock of the constitution, that 
     <lb/>
     he should have thought proper to have in<lb break="no"/>troduced this measure with a speech con<lb break="no"/>taining a eulogy of separate schools 
     <lb/>
     as against national schools, which he above 
     <lb/>
     any other man knew must stir up the 
     <lb/>
     strongest feelings and prejudices of every 
     <lb/>
     Protestant in this country. If there was 
     <lb/>
     one method of proceeding with the consider<lb break="no"/>ation of this matter which could have caused 
     <lb/>
     anything but calmness and moderation, the 
     <lb/>
     speech of the right hon. the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter was that method. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, assuming for the moment that par<lb break="no"/>liament has the power to pass legislation 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="5147" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5147.jpg"/>

     of this character, the speakers on the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the House who followed the hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition, seemed to base 
     <lb/>
     their argument upon the idea of compromise 
     <lb/>
     and policy. I would like for a moment to 
     <lb/>
     consider whether there has been any com<lb break="no"/>promise; and the best way to see whether 
     <lb/>
     there has been or not is to examine the sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the Bill under discussion. Section 
     <lb/>
     16 of the Bill as originally presented read 
     <lb/>
     as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> 
     The provisions of section 93 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, 1867, shall apply to the 
     <lb/>
     said province as if, at the date upon which 
     <lb/>
     this Act comes into force, the territory com<lb break="no"/>prised therein were already a province, the 
     <lb/>
     expression 'the union' in the said section 
     <lb/>
     being taken to mean the said date. 
     <lb/>
               </quote>   
   
            <p>
     If section 93 is applied to one of the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces as if it were a sovereign province 
     <lb/>
     which had come into the union on the 1st 
     <lb/>
     of July, 1905, it is beyond question that sub<lb break="no"/>section 1 of that section would apply to it, 
     <lb/>
     that subsection being as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> 
     Nothing in any such law shall prejudically

     <lb/>
     persons have by law in the province at the 
     <lb/>
     union. 
     <lb/>
               </quote>
   
            <p>
     What follows ? It is quite plain that the 
     <lb/>
     laws that are given effect to by that sub<lb break="no"/>section are the ordinances of 1901, chapters 
     <lb/>
     29, 30 and 31, because these are precisely 
     <lb/>
     the laws relating to denominational schools 
     <lb/>
     which will be in existence in the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces on the 1st July, 1905. When I ex<lb break="no"/>amine the amended clause, what do I find ? 
     <lb/>
     I find that that which is supposed to be a 
     <lb/>
     compromise reads as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> 
     Nothing in any such law shall prejudically

     have at the date of the passing of this Act, 
     <lb/>
     under the terms of chapter 29 and 30 of the 
     <lb/>
     ordinances of the Northwest Territories, pass<lb break="no"/>ed in the year 1901. 
     <lb/>
               </quote>
   
            <p>
     Precisely the same as the other in every 
     <lb/>
     particular. But there is another clause of 
     <lb/>
     section 16, subsection 2, which the hon. the 
     <lb/>
     ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) em<lb break="no"/>phasized as introducing the law in relation 
     <lb/>
     to separate schools contained in the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1875. If anybody should be acquainted with 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of the school law of the west, 
     <lb/>
     it is the hon. the ex-Minister of the Interior. 
     <lb/>
     But there is another authority whom we have 
     <lb/>
     had the good fortune of hearing on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject, although the right hon. the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister apparently considered him a man 
     <lb/>
     of no importance when this matter was un<lb break="no"/>der discussion; that is, the hon. the premier 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories; and he has been good 
     <lb/>
     enough to give us some light on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. He has pointed out that section 41 
     <lb/>
     of chapter 29 of the ordinances of 1901, 
     <lb/>
     which is now being brought into force, is a 
     <lb/>
     provision creating separate schools in the 
     <lb/>
    

    
            <cb/>
          
     same words as those of subsection 2 of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 16 of this Bill. So, Sir, the introduction 
     <lb/>
     of this additional section was like putting 
     <lb/>
     up a straw man to knock him down, 
     <lb/>
     and then taking him out and saying, look 
     <lb/>
     what we have done ; because that statutory 
     <lb/>
     provision is not a mere regulation order in 
     <lb/>
     council which can be repealed, but is a 
     <lb/>
     statute law conferring the same right which 
     <lb/>
     the ex-Minister of the Interior said was 
     <lb/>
     conferred by the Act of 1875.

            <p>
     But that is not all. The third and final 
     <lb/>
     subsection of this much criticised section 
     <lb/>
     16 provides as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     In the appropriation of public moneys by 
     <lb/>
     the legislature in aid of education, and in the 
     <lb/>
     distribution of moneys paid to the government 
     <lb/>
     of the said province arising from the school 
     <lb/>
     fund established by the Dominion Lands Act, 
     <lb/>
     there shall be no discrimination between the 
     <lb/>
     public schools and the separate schools, and 
     <lb/>
     such moneys shall be applied to the support 
     <lb/>
     of public and separate schools in equable 
     <lb/>
     shares or proportion. 
     <lb/>
               </quote>
   
            <p>
     What does the new section say: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     In the appropriation by the legislature or 
     <lb/>
     distribution by the government of the province 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     chapter 29 or any Act passed in amendment 
     <lb/>
     thereof, or in substitution therefor, there shall 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     What are the schools described in the 
     <lb/>
     clauses of chapter 29 of the Northwest ordi<lb break="no"/>nances ? Why, they are the separate schools 
     <lb/>
     provided by section 41 of the statute of 1875 
     <lb/>
     which I have just read. And if I under<lb break="no"/>stand the question at all, I venture to say 
     <lb/>
     that there is no difference in principle or 
     <lb/>
     substance between the amended clauses now 
     <lb/>
     presented and the clause originally intro<lb break="no"/>duced. What then becomes of this extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary much vaunted compromise ? But 
     <lb/>
     let us assume that what is now provided is 
     <lb/>
     the law as it is at present in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. I would like to ask if anybody 
     <lb/>
     in this House is able to say what that law 
     <lb/>
     is. We are told that if this Bill be passed, 
     <lb/>
     everything will be lovely, there will he no 
     <lb/>
     litigation, and everybody will be happy. 
     <lb/>
     Well, Mr. Speaker, in view of the statement 
     <lb/>
     made by the ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton) that the amended section 16 
     <lb/>
     is a great compromise and practically in<lb break="no"/>troduces and makes permanent national 
     <lb/>
     schools in the new provinces—separate 
     <lb/>
     schools existing in name only—and in view 
     <lb/>
     of the contrary statement which my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the leader of the opposition has 
     <lb/>
     made, namely, that there is no difference 
     <lb/>
     in substance or principle between the orig<lb break="no"/>inal and the amended clause 16, in view of 
     <lb/>
     the statement made by the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest Territories (Mr. Haultain) 
     <lb/>
     to the same effect, which statement I have 
     <lb/>
     just endeavoured to make plain by an ex<lb break="no"/>amination and comparison of the original 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="5149" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5149.jpg"/>
               <fw type="num">5149</fw>
               <fw type="dateline">MAY 1, 1905</fw>
               <fw type="num">5150</fw>
      
     and amended clause 16, and in view of 
     <lb/>
     other statements we have had to the very 
     <lb/>
     opposite effect from other authorities in this 
     <lb/>
     House. I venture to say that no one can 
     <lb/>
     tell what this legislation we are asked to 
     <lb/>
     pass will eventually be found to mean. Let 
     <lb/>
     us consider for a moment what the effect 
     <lb/>
     of this measure is likely to be. The Act of 
     <lb/>
     1875, which introduced separate schools into 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest, was very fully dealt with 
     <lb/>
     by the ex-Minister of the Interior. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman pointed out what, in his judg<lb break="no"/>ment, were the great defects of that system<lb break="no"/>what he calls the dual system of edu<lb break="no"/>cation. But if the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior was correct in stating that this 
     <lb/>
     dual system and all the evil which he 
     <lb/>
     describes as following from it are embodied 
     <lb/>
     in the Act of 1875, section 14, and if 
     <lb/>
     the very section of the Act of 1875 
     <lb/>
     establishing separate schools is to be re<lb break="no"/>enacted by this parliament, word for word, 
     <lb/>
     for all time to come, how can he escape the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that by this measure we will be 
     <lb/>
     planting irrevocably in the west this ineffi<lb break="no"/>cient and useless system, for the weeding 
     <lb/>
     out of which in Manitoba he took so much 
     <lb/>
     credit ? But how has the change from 
     <lb/>
     the inefficient to the efficient system which 
     <lb/>
     the ex-minister describes to the one now 
     <lb/>
     existing in the Territories been brought 
     <lb/>
     about? That there is at present in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories what many people consider a 
     <lb/>
     good system is proved by the testimony 
     <lb/>
     of men who ought to know. Well, the 
     <lb/>
     change has been brought about in this 
     <lb/>
     way. In the Territories we have a Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Education whose position is similar 
     <lb/>
     to that of the Minister of Education in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario, and the Territorial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment assumed the responsibility of choos<lb break="no"/>ing the text-books and administering edu<lb break="no"/>cational matters generally. That they did 
     <lb/>
     by virtue of certain regulations which were 
     <lb/>
     adopted from time to time and not by 
     <lb/>
     amendment to the statute of 1875. It 
     <lb/>
     is by virtue of these regulations which 
     <lb/>
     have been adopted from time to time, and 
     <lb/>
     which may be repealed from time to time 
     <lb/>
     that the present school system in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories has been established. But if these 
     <lb/>
     regulations have gone beyond the statute of 
     <lb/>
     1875, if they have taken away any rights 
     <lb/>
     to which the minority are entitled, they were 
     <lb/>
     ultra vires, they were beyond the power of 
     <lb/>
     any Commissioner of Education of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories to pass. If that be 
     <lb/>
     the case, what will happen ? This will no 
     <lb/>
     doubt ensue. Once the measure before us 
     <lb/>
     becomes law, the minority will have the 
     <lb/>
     right to declare that they propose to have 
     <lb/>
     the statute of 1875 applied to their claims 
     <lb/>
     and privileges in its integrity. They will 
     <lb/>
     protest that their rights have been shame<lb break="no"/>fully taken from them by regulations which 
     <lb/>
     have not the power of the statute law and are 
     <lb/>
     in contravention of the statute law, that 
     <lb/>
     the essential section of the statute of 1875 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the right to separate schools 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
         
     has been re-enacted by this parliament, 
     <lb/>
     and they have the absolute right to have 
     <lb/>
     any regulations made in contravention of 
     <lb/>
     that statute declared null and void. They 
     <lb/>
     will be entitled to decline to obey these regu<lb break="no"/>lations or to permit their enforcement and 
     <lb/>
     to demand their abrogation. The ex-Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) has declared 
     <lb/>
     that in 1892 a law was passed which swept 
     <lb/>
     away separate schools in the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
     Well, we have the statement of the Pre<lb break="no"/>mier of the Northwest Territories that what<lb break="no"/>ever change was made in the Territories 
     <lb/>
     was made by these very repealable regu<lb break="no"/>lations which were passed by the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Education with the consent of 
     <lb/>
     Catholics and Protestants alike and not by 
     <lb/>
     changes in the statute. It is not, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     in virtue of any statute that the educational 
     <lb/>
     system for the Northwest is what it is today, 
     <lb/>
     but because of certain regulations passed 
     <lb/>
     by the Commissioner of Education for the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories and against which so 
     <lb/>
     far no appeal has been taken by the Catho<lb break="no"/>lics, but which the Catholics could have 
     <lb/>
     appealed against if they chose and can 
     <lb/>
     later on appeal against and have abrogated 
     <lb/>
     if they in any way contravene the statute 
     <lb/>
     law giving the right to separate schools 
     <lb/>
     which law, if this clause 16 goes through, 
     <lb/>
     will be the same as it was in 1875. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us deal for a moment with the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of policy. It has been stated by hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite that if we should adopt 
     <lb/>
     this measure, there will be no more trouble, 
     <lb/>
     no litigation, no unpleasantness, and that the 
     <lb/>
     duty and obligation rests on this parliament 
     <lb/>
     to deal with this matter and settle it for all 
     <lb/>
     time. But I submit first of all that if the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion parliament has not the power to 
     <lb/>
     pass this legislation, then the only result 
     <lb/>
     of our passing it will be to provoke litigation 
     <lb/>
     in order to determine our jurisdiction. In 
     <lb/>
     the second place should the courts hold that 
     <lb/>
     this parliament has power, the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories—who, if this legislation were not 
     <lb/>
     passed, would no doubt treat with fairness 
     <lb/> and justice every class of the community–
              
               <lb/>considering themselves oppressed by a law, 
     in the passing of which they had no voice, 
     <lb/>
     would resent its application and decline to 
     <lb/>
     obey it. And then, in all probability, we 
     <lb/>
     would have the parliament of Canada again 
     <lb/>
     called upon to exercise its remedial power. 
     <lb/>
     In that connection I wish to say that, so far 
     <lb/>
     as I am able to appreciate the jurisdiction 
     <lb/>
     of this parliament, it has no power to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the subject of education except by 
     <lb/>
     virtue of subsection 4 of section 93, and 
     <lb/>
     there it has only power to deal with it in cer<lb break="no"/>tain circumstances. Nowhere else in the 
     <lb/>
     Act is this parliament given the power to 
     <lb/>
     deal with that subject generally, and I 
     <lb/>
     would ask hon. gentlemen opposite whether 
     <lb/>
     they would consider for one moment that 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion parliament can have general 
     <lb/>
     power to deal with the subject of educa<lb break="no"/>tion when by the Confederation Act that 
     <lb/>
     parliament is only given the jurisdiction to 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="5151" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5151.jpg"/>
               <fw type="num">5151</fw>
               <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>
               <fw type="num">5152</fw>
           
     deal with it in one particular instance and 
     <lb/>
     the general power is given to the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     This is just the opposite when the Act 
     <lb/>
     deals with Dominion and provincial powers 
     <lb/>
     in all other matters ; then the general power 
     <lb/>
     is given to the Dominion and the special 
     <lb/>
     powers to the provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But supposing that we should pass this 
     <lb/>
     legislation, assuredly, in view of the diver<lb break="no"/>gence of opinion that exists regarding the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of the law we propose to enact, 
     <lb/>
     whichever side considers itself entitled to 
     <lb/>
     something more would at once proceed to 
     <lb/>
     find out what its rights are and endeavour 
     <lb/>
     to obtain them. And if it should turn out 
     <lb/>
     that by this measure we are re-enacting the 
     <lb/>
     statute of 1875, and if an inefficient and use<lb break="no"/>less system of education should be estab<lb break="no"/>lished by virtue of this measure in these 
     <lb/>
     Territories for all time, I am satisfied that 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman and those associ<lb break="no"/>ated with him would not care to have 
     <lb/>
     any such state of affairs put in force for all 
     <lb/>
     time. But if the effect of this legisla<lb break="no"/>tion is to establish national schools, 
     <lb/>
     then with equal force do I come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion, in view of the speech the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman made in introducing this Bill 
     <lb/>
     that it was no part of his intention to pro<lb break="no"/>pose any such legislation — under these cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances I for one am absolutely opposed 
     <lb/>
     to the parliament of Canada meddling in the 
     <lb/>
     educational affairs of this country. I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe that we have the power ; and if we 
     <lb/>
     had the power I do not believe it is good 
     <lb/>
     policy for this parliament to assume that it 
     <lb/>
     possesses the wisdom of all time and all 
     <lb/>
     the ages and that it is competent to give 
     <lb/>
     these people to-day the best system of edu<lb break="no"/>cation possible to last for centuries and 
     <lb/>
     without end. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now it has been urged that if we apply 
     <lb/>
     the sections of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, that matter will be left in uncertainty. 
     <lb/>
     Permit me to say that I dissent from that 
     <lb/>
     view. I dissent from it because I think, 
     <lb/>
     with all deference to those who differ, that 
     <lb/>
     were the educational clauses of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act to be given to these 
     <lb/>
     new provinces as their charter in this re<lb break="no"/>gard, subsection 1 would not apply to them, 
     <lb/>
     while subsection 3 would apply. And what 
     <lb/>
     would be the effect of it? Clearly the ef<lb break="no"/>fect would be that these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     would start with full power to deal with 
     <lb/>
     all matters relating to education ; but if 
     <lb/>
     the minority, by agitation or by any other 
     <lb/>
     means, obtained separate schools, then the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces would be bound to maintain 
     <lb/>
     that system or else become subject to re<lb break="no"/>medial legislation. That assuredly is tak<lb break="no"/>ing the matter out of the possibility of liti<lb break="no"/>gation, because I venture to think that if 
     <lb/>
     we deal fairly and reasonably with the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest, if we give them the 
     <lb/>
     same provincial charter as is possessed by 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia, Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     and Manitoba, under which they have 
     <lb/>
     power to deal with their educational affairs,
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
           
     I venture to think that there will be no 
     <lb/>
     injustice done to the minority, and that 
     <lb/>
     we will have no further trouble in this 
     <lb/>
     great country with discussions of this 
     <lb/>
     character, which are most regrettable and 
     <lb/>
     the sections of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     tend to cause discord and dissension. I for 
     <lb/>
     my part am a firm believer in the national 
     <lb/>
     school system, but I none the less believe 
     <lb/>
     it to be the part of wisdom, of good policy 
     <lb/>
     and of broad statesmanship to allow the 
     <lb/>
     people of those new provinces to determine 
     <lb/>
     that matter for themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I for one would be glad to see the day 
     <lb/>
     when people would forget, in discussing pol<lb break="no"/>itical affairs in this country, that they 
     <lb/>
     were Catholics or Protestants, that they be<lb break="no"/>longed to any religious sect whatever. I 
     <lb/>
     would be glad to see the day when the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country, while they might be 
     <lb/>
     proud of their origin, would forget, in dis<lb break="no"/>cussing political questions, that they were 
     <lb/>
     of French descent, or English descent or 
     <lb/>
     Irish descent. I would like to see all these 
     <lb/>
     matters dealt with on their merits, always 
     <lb/>
     provided that every section of the people 
     <lb/>
     received fair play. I desire to see such 
     <lb/>
     a state of affairs as that no class can con<lb break="no"/>sider themselves as the only tolerant peo<lb break="no"/>ple in this country, and that all classes 
     <lb/>
     recognize each other as animated by a feel<lb break="no"/>ing of kindness and generosity. I for one 
     <lb/>
     most strongly object to this new country 
     <lb/>
     having forced upon it, or placed upon it, by 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada, at this distance 
     <lb/>
     and at this time, a system of education 
     <lb/>
     which its people will not be able to change, 
     <lb/>
     except by imperial legislation, so long as 
     <lb/>
     the centuries last. Why, Sir, what has 
     <lb/>
     been the experience of legislation of this 
     <lb/>
     kind in the past? Take the effect of pro<lb break="no"/>hibition laws in this country. There is no 
     <lb/>
     more unsuccessful way of inducing a man 
     <lb/>
     to do right than to endeavour to coerce 
     <lb/>
     him to do right. There is this further ar<lb break="no"/>gument that I have seen advanced with 
     <lb/>
     respect to this matter, and that is that we 
     <lb/>
     cannot trust the people of these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to do what is fair. Sir, I for one 
     <lb/>
     am entirely out of sympathy with such an 
     <lb/>
     argument. The people of the great west 
     <lb/>
     have gone in there from all of our great 
     <lb/>
     provinces, they have certainly shown them<lb break="no"/>selves up-to-date, intelligent, and very able. 
     <lb/>
     If the school system, which so far they 
     <lb/>
     have been permitted to enact and to carry 
     <lb/>
     out, if such legislation as they have been 
     <lb/>
     permitted to pass during their tutelage, is 
     <lb/>
     a sample of what they can do, then I think 
     <lb/>
     we may safely entrust to the people of 
     <lb/>
     those new provinces full power to deal 
     <lb/>
     with their educational affairs, such powers 
     <lb/>
     as every other province has been given since 
     <lb/>
     confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, I desire to say in conclusion, 
     <lb/>
     that I deeply and sincerely regret the mis<lb break="no"/>fortune which has placed me in the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of member for Centre Toronto in this 
     <lb/>
     House. If there was one man for whom 
     <lb/>

     I had the highest possible admiration, both 
     <lb/>
     as a man and as a statesman, as a man 
     <lb/>
     who had the good of his country at heart, 
     <lb/>
     it was the late member for Centre To<lb break="no"/>ronto. I am sure that no one regrets more 
     <lb/>
     than I do that he is not present at this 
     <lb/>
     time and on this occasion to lend the power 
     <lb/>
     of his great personality and of his great 
     <lb/>
     eloquence in dealing with these important 
     <lb/>
     matters, than which no one in this country 
     <lb/>
     was more qualified to do.

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:GUTH1">Mr. H. GUTHRIE</persName> (South Wellington). <lb/> Mr. Speaker, in
                  rising at this late stage of <lb/> the debate, at a time when the chief point
                  <lb/> of controversy has been most thoroughly <lb/> discussed from almost every
                  point of view, <lb/> namely, the educational clauses of this mea<lb break="no"
                  />sure, one would almost require some excuse <lb/> for trespassing further on the
                  time of the <lb/> House. I merely rise on this occasion <lb/> to state, in as few
                  words as possible, <lb/> my own feeling and my own posi<lb break="no"/>tion in
                  regard to this Bill, without en<lb break="no"/>tering into details or repeating
                  arguments <lb/> except in the most general way, in order <lb/> to justify the
                  faith which is in me with <lb/> regard to this measure. When this Bill <lb/> was
                  before the House upon a former occa<lb break="no"/>sion, I stated that I was
                  unalterably in <lb/> favour of the measure as it was then be<lb break="no"/>fore
                  the House. So I say now, I was <lb/> in favour of it, as I then under<lb
                     break="no"/>stood it, so I am, as I understand it at <lb/> the present time, to
                  be a measure to con<lb break="no"/>tinue in the Northwest provinces that <lb/>
                  school system which they now enjoy and <lb/> which for many years past they have
                     en<lb break="no"/>joyed. If the amendments which have <lb/> been introduced to
                  the Bill since I spoke <lb/> on a former occasion, give more precision <lb/> to
                  the present state of affairs in regard to <lb/> education in the Northwest
                  Territories, <lb/> than did the original draft, then I think <lb/> they have been
                  wisely introduced. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve further that the measure as now be<lb
                     break="no"/>fore the House is acceptable to the vast <lb/> majority of the
                  people of the Northwest <lb/> Territories; and if so, then, apart from my <lb/>
                  own convictions altogether on this subject — <lb/> I may say that my convictions
                  are entirely <lb/> favourable to the measure — but apart from <lb/> them
                  altogether, I would feel it my duty <lb/> to support the measure, always with this
                  <lb/> provision, that this House has the power, <lb/> that this parliament has the
                  constitutional <lb/> authority, to pass this measure, and that <lb/> in so doing
                  we in no way hamper, or in<lb break="no"/>fringe upon, or deny any of those rights
                  <lb/> which we know under the general term <lb/> of provincial rights. Now, Mr.
                  Speaker, I <lb/> affirm the constitutional right of this par<lb break="no"
                  />liament to pass this measure, and I deny <lb/> that in so doing we in any way
                  infringe <lb/> upon provincial rights properly so-called. I <lb/> am well aware
                  that in taking that stand <lb/> and in discussing this measure from that <lb/>
                  point of view — which is the only point of <lb/> view from which I intend to
                  discuss it — I <lb/>
                  <cb/> find myself in direct conflict with the <lb/> views and opinions of many
                  hon. members <lb/> opposite Who have opposed this measure, <lb/> hon. members who
                  have obtained in the <lb/> legal profession a far greater eminence <lb/> than I
                  can ever hope to attain ; but, having <lb/> the very highest respect and deference
                  to <lb/> the opinions of hon. members who differ <lb/> from me, I still have to
                  affirm my convic<lb break="no"/>tion upon this point, after a critical and <lb/>
                  careful examination of the whole case, that <lb/> I believe the opinions offered
                  upon the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional aspect of the question by the <lb/> leader
                  of the opposition and by those who <lb/> have followed him, are erroneous, and it
                  is <lb/> only after very careful study that I have <lb/> made up my mind to
                  confront them and <lb/> Oppose them. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     In the first place I confess to some feel<lb break="no"/>ing of disappointment in respect to the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional objections urged against the 
     <lb/>
     measure by some hon. members oppo<lb break="no"/>site. They have been somewhat inclined 
     <lb/>
     to conjure up for themselves imagin<lb break="no"/>ary dificulties in connection with this 
     <lb/>
     measure. Possibly they may be able at 
     <lb/>
     some future time to shield themselves be<lb break="no"/>hind what one might call the somewhat in<lb break="yes"/>
     involved and somewhat refined doctrine of 
     <lb/>
     ultra vires, rather than that they should 
     <lb/>
     come out in the open and fight upon the mer<lb break="no"/>its of this measure. I am disappointed also 
     <lb/>
     to find, as I think I have found, a good 
     <lb/>
     many of those who have opposed this mea<lb break="no"/>sure who have done so on the principle 
     <lb/>
     that it must be illegal and unconstitutional 
     <lb/>
     simply because it has been met with the dis<lb break="no"/>approval of the hon. leader of the opposit<lb break="no"/>tion (Mr. R. L. Borden). That may be a 
     <lb/>
     very loyal course but it is not a very en<lb break="no"/>lightened course to pursue ; it may be 
     <lb/>
     very complimentary to the hon. leader but 
     <lb/>
     it is hardly complimentary to those who 
     <lb/>
     blindly follow his lead. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another matter which has caused me 
     <lb/>
     some trouble and not a little difficulty is 
     <lb/>
     that after many careful perusals of the 
     <lb/>
     speech of the hon. leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     and of those who have argued upon the 
     <lb/>
     same lines as he has done, I am unable de<lb break="no"/>finitely to ascertain whether it this measure 
     <lb/>
     be in fact constitutional and within the 
     <lb/>
     powers and jurisdiction of this parliament, 
     <lb/>
     if the constitutional question he conceded in 
     <lb/>
     favour of this measure, the leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position would support the Bill or withhold 
     <lb/>
     his support from it. I have failed in many 
     <lb/>
     careful perusals of his speech to find what 
     <lb/>
     his real attitude would be. I believe that 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada, this House and the 
     <lb/>
     electors of the county of Carleton, would in 
     <lb/>
     their hearts like to know what the attitude 
     <lb/>
     of the leader of the opposition is upon the 
     <lb/>
     merits of the Bill, apart from the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional question. Of course that is merely 
     <lb/>
     a hypothetical proposition, and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member need not give answer to it unless 
     <lb/>
     he sees fit. There is one thing further which 
     <lb/>
               I would point out, and I point that out per<lb break="no"/><pb n="5155" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5155.jpg"/> 
               <fw type="num">5155</fw>
               <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>
               <fw type="num">5156</fw>haps more in view of an utterance of the
            
          
     <lb/>
     last speaker than for any other reason. The 
     <lb/>
     last hon. member who addressed the House 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Bristol) took occasion to remark that 
     <lb/>
     when this Bill was originally introduced by 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier), he 
     <lb/>
     invoked moderation on the subject from all 
     <lb/>
     those who discussed the measure. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Centre Toronto (Mr. Bristol) 
     <lb/>
     Was inclined to praise the right hon. the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the House (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
     <lb/>
     for having asked for moderation, and hav<lb break="no"/>ing himself set an example of moderation 
     <lb/>
     in his speech. But a few moments later, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Centre Toronto changed 
     <lb/>
     his tone in this respect and said that the 
     <lb/>
     eulogy pronounced by the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     on separate schools stirred up the resent<lb break="no"/>ment of every Protestant in this House. 
     <lb/>
     What then does he think of the eulogy or 
     <lb/>
     complimentary apostrophe that was pro<lb break="no"/>nounced in respect to the minority, in re<lb break="no"/>spect to the Roman Catholic electors of this 
     <lb/>
     country by his own leader, the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden)? Now that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman. I think, went a little out 
     <lb/>
     of his way in the course of his speech to 
     <lb/>
     eulogize the Roman Catholic minority. It 
     <lb/>
     was not necessary for him to do so for the 
     <lb/>
     purposes of his argument. However, I 
     <lb/>
     have no doubt that the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     electors of the Dominion of Canada will be 
     <lb/>
     very much gratified by that eulogy, although 
     <lb/>
     it came to them in a sort of backhanded, 
     <lb/>
     apologetic manner, for at the same moment 
     <lb/>
     the opposition leader said that he could not 
     <lb/>
     support their claims, that he rested his case 
     <lb/>
     solely on the rock of the constitution, as he 
     <lb/>
     understood it, but he gave them not one 
     <lb/>
     single hint of what he would do provided 
     <lb/>
     this were a constitutional measure and this 
     <lb/>
     parliament had power to deal with this ques<lb break="no"/>tion of education in the Bills now before us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before entering upon an examination of 
     <lb/>
     the case, as one might put it, I might say 
     <lb/>
     that I listened with great care to the speech 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. member for Centre Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bristol), who has preceded me. I congra<lb break="no"/>tulate the hon. member on his maiden effort 
     <lb/>
     in this House. He certainly has succeeded 
     <lb/>
     a great man, who formerly represented that 
     <lb/>
     riding in this House, a man who had the 
     <lb/>
     affection of every member in this House, a 
     <lb/>
     man whose good judgment and whose 
     <lb/>
     ability were well recognized. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber is the follower in Centre Toronto of a 
     <lb/>
     great man, and I might express the hope 
     <lb/>
     that at some day in the future the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member who has just resumed his seat may 
     <lb/>
     be able to fill the place formerly occupied 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. E. F. Clarke, now deceased. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In taking the stand I do on this measure. 
     <lb/>
     it becomes necessary to go into a somewhat 
     <lb/>
     critical analysis of the whole constitution 
     <lb/>
     or of the British North America Act, and 
     <lb/>
     the Acts which bear upon it. I do not de<lb break="no"/>sire, and I do not find it necessary, for my 
     <lb/>
     purpose, to make more than passing refer<lb break="no"/>ence to conditions which existed prior to 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     confederation. There is no doubt that the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, 1867, was the 
     <lb/>
     outcome of a compact or agreement. It is 
     <lb/>
     not the outcome strictly speaking of im<lb break="no"/>perial legislation or imperial will, but it is 
     <lb/>
     the result of agreement between representa<lb break="no"/>tive men from Ontario, Quebec, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and Nova Scotia, and in the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1867 we find their agreement consolidated 
     <lb/>
     and put into legal shape by the imperial 
     <lb/>
     government. As I read that Act, I find in 
     <lb/>
     only two places reference of any kind made 
     <lb/>
     to any other provinces or territories. In the 
     <lb/>
     preamble of the Act it is true there is a 
     <lb/>
     slight reference to what might happen in 
     <lb/>
     the future. In the preamble we find this 
     <lb/>
     clause : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     And whereas it is expedient that provision be 
     <lb/>
     made for the eventual admission to the union 
     <lb/>
     of other portions of British North America. 
     <lb/>
               </quote>
   
            <p>
     And in section 146 we find a direct refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the provinces or colonies of British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia, Prince Edward Island and New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and a direct reference to Ru<lb break="no"/>pert's Land and the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     Now, can it be argued for a minute that 
     <lb/>
     these colonies or provinces or territories, 
     <lb/>
     which had no part in the making of the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Act, were parties to the 
     <lb/>
     agreement or compact which it embodies ? 
     <lb/>
     I submit the Act was framed solely and 
     <lb/>
     exclusively on the agreement of the dele<lb break="no"/>gates from the provinces which were inter<lb break="no"/>ested as the original provinces coming into 
     <lb/>
     confederation. Now, I think that the state<lb break="no"/>ment of my hon. friend the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the general purview of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, 1867, contains a very fair an<lb break="no"/>alysis of what that Act was, and I think 
     <lb/>
     perhaps I might read that statement by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition. found in his 
     <lb/>
     speech at page 3077 of 'Hansard.' He says 
     <lb/>
     there :

     far as analysis is necessary for the purpose of

     <lb/>
     In the first place you find the establishment of

     I submit that that is a very fair analysis

     of the Act, and I would point out that in 
     <lb/>
     section 91 of the Act we find the subjects 
     <lb/>
     which are to be entirely dealt with by this 
     <lb/>

     find enumerated all the matters which are 
     <lb/>
     to form the subjects of provincial legis<lb break="no"/>lation. Now, Mr. Speaker, marking these

     two sections, examining them carefully, we

     find that section 91 distinctly applies to

     Dominion jurisdiction and that section 92 
     <lb/>
     distinctly and exclusively applies to pro<lb break="no"/>vincial jurisdiction, and we find in neither 
     <lb/>
     of these sections any mention of the question 
     <lb/>
     of education. That is a fact that may well 
     <lb/>
     be pointed to. Why is it so ? It is because 
     <lb/>
     education was not given exclusively either 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces or to the Dominion and it 
     <lb/>
     is wrong to say as many hon. members have 
     <lb/>
     said, that education is exclusively within 
     <lb/>
     the jurisdiction of the provincial legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. It it were so it would form part of 
     <lb/>
     section 92, but it is put in a section of

     the_ Act which we in this House are all

     <lb/>
     my statement on this point may be a com<lb break="no"/>plete one, I am going to incorporate that

     section with my remarks. Section 93 reads

     Section 4 is the remedial clause which 
     <lb/>
     I need not read. Now it is argued that the 
     <lb/>
     subsections following section 93, only ap<lb break="no"/>plied to the original provinces coming into 
     <lb/>
     this union. Subsection 2 certainly covered 
     <lb/>
     the case of Ontario and Quebec. It is argu<lb break="no"/>ed that subsections 1, 3 and 4 only applied 
     <lb/>
     to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I do not think such an argument 
     <lb/>
     is tenable for one moment. The language 
     <lb/>
     of the section itself is clear enough upon 
     <lb/>
     that point. In the section and in each 
     <lb/>
     subsection the language is: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In and for each province- <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Then in the subsection :

     In subsection 3 again reference is made

     to rights and privileges held in the provinces 
     <lb/>
     at the union. I do not take that to refer 
     <lb/>
     merely to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     but to any province or colony of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion coming within the four corners of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, 1867. Can there 
     <lb/>
     be any doubt that when section 93 was 
     <lb/>
     framed it was framed in reference to On<lb break="no"/>tario and Quebec probably more particular<lb break="no"/>ly, because, in the Quebec resolutions, On<lb break="no"/><cb/>tario and Quebec are the only provinces 
     <lb/>
     we find mentioned in regard to education 
     <lb/>
     and in regard to the right to have separate 
     <lb/>
     schools? But, in section 146 other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces or colonies are enumerated, and as 
     <lb/>
     each of these Provinces or colonies would 
     <lb/>
     come into the union I submit that they 
     <lb/>
     would be entitled to all the benefit to be 
     <lb/>
     derived from subsections 1, 3 or 4 or section

                  (Mr. Guthrie) a question? He is <lb/> dealing with the Act that was brought back
                  <lb/> from the imperial parliament and going <lb/> back to the resolutions upon
                  which that Act <lb/> was based. The Act was to be in exact <lb/> accordance with
                  the resolutions. In these <lb/> resolutions there is assigned to the pro<lb
                     break="no"/>vinces the power to legislate upon education <lb/> saving the
                  rights and privileges that the <lb/> Protestant or Catholic minority of both <lb/>
                  Canadas may possess as to their denomin<lb break="no"/>ational schools at the time
                  the union comes <lb/>into operation. That saving clause had <lb/>reference only to
                  Canada east and Canada <lb/>west. Then, before that, when a motion was <lb/>made
                  by one of the members that this <lb/>Act should not be accepted until it was
                  <lb/>brought back and assented to by the Can<lb break="no"/>adian parliament, Sir

                  very questionable whether in the inter<lb break="no"/>pretation of a statute we

                  Sometimes it has been done, but the text <lb/> writers on the construction of

     What I submit in regard to section 146

    is this : that it provides a distinct means for 
     <lb/>the provinces or colonies, and the territories, 
     <lb/>to become a part of this confederation. A 
     <lb/>colony is described by the imperial Act,

     I can find no definition of what a pro<lb break="no"/>vince is: there was no such thing as a 
     <lb/>
     British province strictly so called ; the term 
     <lb/>
     'Colony' was applicable to them all. In 
     <lb/>
     section 146 of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, British Columbia and 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland are described as ' colonies 
     <lb/>
     or provinces.' They had legislatures of their 
     <lb/>
     own and could enact laws of their own. It 
     <lb/>
     was provided in respect of these three 
     <lb/>
     colonies that they may come into confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and how? Simply as the original 
     <lb/>
     provinces had confederated themselves by 
     <lb/>
     agreement, or upon a joint address of the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     Colonial House and of this parliament to 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty she could pass an Order in 
     <lb/>
     Council admitting them into confederation. 
     <lb/>
     But not so with the Territories. The Terri<lb break="no"/>tories had no voice in the matter whatever. 
     <lb/>
     They were, as described by the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition, practically unpeopled portions of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, there were a few fur traders, 
     <lb/>
     numberless bands of uncivilized Indians and 
     <lb/>
     for the rest, herds of buffalo. My submission 
     <lb/>
     is this : that there is a distinction in section 
     <lb/>
     146 which we must all recognize as the mode 
     <lb/>
     of admission. In one case colonies or pro<lb break="no"/>vinces could come in by agreement on a 
     <lb/>
     joint address ; in the other case the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories must come in on an address of this 
     <lb/>
     House approved by an Order in Council. 
     <lb/>
     The distinction is this : the colonial entities 
     <lb/>
     referred to in section 146 were to come in 
     <lb/>
     as provinces having rights subject to the 
     <lb/>
     terms of the British North America Act as 
     <lb/>
     stated in these seven words I have quoted. 
     <lb/>
     But for the Territories, it was provided that 
     <lb/>
     they should merely come in as a territorial 
     <lb/>
     enlargement of the country, an increased 
     <lb/>
     area for Canada ; that they should merely 
     <lb/>
     come within our boundaries and form a part 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion of Canada, not subject to 
     <lb/>
     any agreement or compact they made but 
     <lb/>
     subject to our will approved by an imperial 
     <lb/>
     Order in Council. And that is the manner 
     <lb/>
     in which the provinces did come in. I notice 
     <lb/>
     that the leader of the opposition in one part 
     <lb/>
     of his speech takes grave objection to the 
     <lb/>
     proposal in section 2 of the present Bill, 
     <lb/>
     namely. that the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     is made applicable to the new provinces 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     These words seem to create indignation 
     <lb/>
     in the mind of the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     if one may judge by the way he denounced 
     <lb/>
     them. He said : parliament has no right to 
     <lb/>
     alter the British North America Act of 1867, 
     <lb/>
     and the words in section 2 : except in so 
     <lb/>
     far as varied by this Act, have no place and 
     <lb/>
     there is no authority for inserting them. I 
     <lb/>
     mention this to show how other provinces 
     <lb/>
     came into the nation. Turn to the case of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. The Manitoba Act was passed 
     <lb/>
     in 1870 before the Territory out of which the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba was created became 
     <lb/>
     a part of Canada, and in section 2 of the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba Act you will find that the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act 1867 was made to apply :

     Was that wrong? was the Manitoba Act

     iemember that these words were contained 
     <lb/>
     in the Manitoba Act and that they were 
     <lb/>
     ratified by the imperial parliament the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing year. I take the case of British

     Columbia ; I take the joint address presented 
     <lb/>
     to Her Majesty in Council by the legislature 
     <lb/>
     of British Columbia and of this parliament, 
     <lb/>

     Then I take the case of Prince Edward

     Island which came into confederation in

     1873 upon joint address likewise, and I find 
     <lb/>
     that in one clause of that address the British

     Surely the leader of the opposition cannot 
     <lb/>
     argue, that Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, 
     <lb/>
     and British Columbia came into this union 
     <lb/>
     unconstitutionally. If it were proper in the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba Act which was confirmed by im<lb break="no"/>perial legislation ; if it were in the British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia Act which was approved by Order

     <lb/>
     Act ; if it were again proper in the Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island case which was approved by 
     <lb/>
     Order in Council having the force of an 
     <lb/>
     imperial Act ; if it were proper and constitu<lb break="no"/>tional in these three cases to insert these

            </p>

            <p>
     Now this clause is far reaching in its 
     <lb/>
    effect. If the clause is constitutional, and I 
     <lb/>argue it is constitutional, what does it 
     <lb/>mean ? It means that we have the right to 
     <lb/>vary the terms of the British North America 
     <lb/>Act, and it means more, because if we go 
     <lb/>beyond it we find we have varied the terms 
     <lb/>of confederation just as each of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces came in, and no one has challenged 
     <lb/>the constitutionality of these Acts, or, if it 
     <lb/>has been challenged the challenge has not 
     <lb/>been sustained. 1 turn once more to section 
     <lb/>146 and referring to that part of the section 
     <lb/>which relates exclusively to the Territories, 
     <lb/>and I apply to the Territories these words :

     What provision in the British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica Act of 1867 applies to Territories ? I 
     <lb/>
     challenge any hon. member in the House to 
     <lb/>
     answer that question—to point to one single 
     <lb/>
     clause or portion of a clause in the whole 
     <lb/>
     Act except section 146 which has any refer<lb break="no"/>ence to territorial government. Section 93 
     <lb/>
     does not apply ; it only applies in ex<lb break="no"/>press terms to provinces. Subsection 1 of 
     <lb/>
     section 93 applies to rights in denominat<lb break="no"/>ional schools which have existed, not in 
     <lb/>
     any territory, but in any province which 
     <lb/>
     had previously been a colony with its own 
     <lb/>
     government. You may search the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act from its preamble to its 
     <lb/>
     last section, and you will not find a single 
     <lb/>
     clause applicable expressly or by implica<lb break="no"/>tion to the case of Territories. I state that 
     <lb/>
     conclusion with a good deal of confidence, 
     <lb/>
     because I am aware that it has been con<lb break="no"/>firmed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     As I have said, in 1870 we passed the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba Act in anticipation of the entrance 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories into this Dominion. They 
     <lb/>
     did not as a matter of fact become a part 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion until the 15th of July, 1870, 
     <lb/>
     three months after the Act had been passed ; 
     <lb/>
     and note the language of the Order in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil which admitted them ; that these Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories should form part of Canada—not 
     <lb/>
     as provinces or colonies, but territorially 
     <lb/>
     should form part of Canada, and that the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada shall from the day 
     <lb/>
     aforesaid have full power and authority to 
     <lb/>
     legislate for the peace, welfare and good 
     <lb/>
     government thereof; these words being 
     <lb/>
     taken from the Imperial Order in Council 
     <lb/>
     passed on the 30th of June, 1870, to take 
     <lb/>
     effect on the 15th of July, 1870 ; clearly 
     <lb/>
     showing that all that transpired was that 
     <lb/>
     the Territories became part of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     territorially at that date, and that the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion was authorized to legislate for those 
     <lb/>
     Territories so far as their peace, welfare 
     <lb/>
     and good government were concerned. 
     <lb/>
     Now, what happened under the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     Act ? That Act was passed in May, 1870, 
     <lb/>
     and sought to form the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba out of those very Territories which 
     <lb/>
     came into the Dominion in July, 1870. All 
     <lb/>
     the authority to form the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba was contained in section 146 of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act of 1867; and 
     <lb/>
     when that Act was laid before the law offi<lb break="no"/>cers of the Crown, they held it to be ultra 
     <lb/>
     vires. They held that there was no author<lb break="no"/>ity in section 146 to pass such an Act or to 
     <lb/>
     constitute a province—that the only author<lb break="no"/>ity there given was to bring those Terri<lb break="no"/>tories territorially within the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Then it became necessary either to 
     <lb/>
     have a new Imperial Act or a new Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Order in Council to rectify matters, and 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Act known as the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act of 1871 was thereupon passed. 
     <lb/>
     It was mentioned in this House by the 
     <lb/>
     late Sir John Macdonald as an Act which 
     <lb/>
     was necessary to confirm the Manitoba Act, 
     <lb/>
     on account of doubts which had arisen as 
     <lb/>
     to its validity. Now, what did the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     Act profess to do ? By section 2 it enacted 
     <lb/>
     that the British North America Act of 1867 
     <lb/>
     should apply except in so far as varied 
     <lb/>
     by this Act ; and they varied it. The edu<lb break="no"/>cational clause of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, section 93. was varied ; but when it 
     <lb/>
     was confirmed by the imperial Act of 1871, 
     <lb/>
     the imperial Act went a little further than 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba Act did. The imperial legis<lb break="no"/>lature no doubt thought that they would set 
     <lb/>
     at rest for ever the question of these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, and the greater question of their 
     <lb/>
     formation into provinces when the time to 
     <lb/>
     form them into provinces should arrive. 
     <lb/>
     Now, the British North America Act of 1871, 
     <lb/>
     in its preamble, reads as follows: 
     <lb/>

     This section is wide enough for all the 
     <lb/>
     enactments which we hope to make by the 
     <lb/>
     present Bill. It is true that a subsequent 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, known as the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1886, was passed, which says that 
     <lb/>
     the Acts must be read together, and it is 
     <lb/>
     on that point that the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition bases his argument. He says that 
     <lb/>
     we must read into that statute these words: 
     <lb/>
     'Subject to the provisions of this Act.' I 
     <lb/>
     submit, with all deference to his opinion, 
     <lb/>
     that those words occurring in section 146 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act of 1867 
     <lb/>
     apply only to the provinces and colonies 
     <lb/>
     mentioned in that section. They can only 
     <lb/>
     apply where they can be applied ; and they 
     <lb/>
     cannot be applied to territories. We must 
     <lb/>
     construe all portions of a statute in such 
     <lb/>
     a way as to give them their true and rea<lb break="no"/>sonable meaning, and the only way in 
     <lb/>
     which we can give the words of this section 
     <lb/>
     a reasonable meaning is to apply them to 
     <lb/>
     the colonies or provinces enumerated in it ; 
     <lb/>
     because by no interpretation which I can 
     <lb/>
     imagine, or by nothing in the Act itself, 
     <lb/>
     can it he said that these words have any 
     <lb/>
     reference to territories. If there are any 
     <lb/>
     words about territories in that Act, will 
     <lb/>
     some hon. member point them out ? I will 
     <lb/>
     withdraw all I have said if it can be shown 
     <lb/>
     that within the four corners of the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1867 there is anything expressed or implied 
     <lb/>
     regarding territorial legislation or the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of a province out of territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, reading the Acts together, what is 
     <lb/>
     the rule ? The rule is well established, that 
     <lb/>
     where there is a general enactment followed 
     <lb/>
     by a special enactment, the language of the 
     <lb/>
     special enactment shall govern the language 
     <lb/>
     of the general enactment. That is a cardi<lb break="no"/>nal rule in the interpretation of statutes. 
     <lb/>
     I can express it in the language of the text<lb break="no"/>books better than I can in my own lan<lb break="no"/>guage. Here we have the general enact<lb break="no"/>ment in section 146 of the Act of 1867, and 
     <lb/>
     we have in section 2 of the Act of 1871 the 
     <lb/>
     precise special enactment drawn to meet 
     <lb/>
     the defective Act known as the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     Act, drawn to cover the case of the Terri<lb break="no"/><cb/>ories explicitly and implicitly, and for no 
     <lb/>
     other purpose ; and it says that the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada ' may make provision for 
     <lb/>
     the constitution and administration of any 
     <lb/>
     such province, and for the passing of laws 
     <lb/>
     for the peace, order and good government 
     <lb/>
     of such province.' Have we gone beyond 
     <lb/>
     that ?  Is there any suggestion in the Bill 
     <lb/>
     that we are going beyond that ? Is not the 
     <lb/>
     question of education included in the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the new province for which we 
     <lb/>
     are making provision? Is it not included 
     <lb/>
     in the language 'peace, welfare and good 
     <lb/>
     government of the province ' ? These terms 
     <lb/>
     have received judicial interpretation, and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps it is just as well to give them the 
     <lb/>
     interpretation they have received.

                  <persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Mr. HAGGART</persName>. Then you give <lb/> them any powers you like?

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:GUTH1">Mr. GUTHRIE</persName>. I should fancy every <lb/> power would come
                  under that Act. I think <lb/> that is the correct conclusion, with all de<lb
                     break="no"/>ference to the opinion of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>, man who
                  apparently thinks otherwise? The <lb/> language used is 'peace, order and good
                  <lb/> government'; and to give these words the <lb/> interpretation which they
                  have received at <lb/> the hands of the Privy Council is to say <lb/> that they
                  authorize the exercise by the <lb/> Dominion government 'of the utmost dis<lb
                     break="no"/>cretion of enactment for the attainment <lb/> of the objects
                  pointed to.' That is the <lb/> opinion of the Privy Council expressed in <lb/> the
                  case of Riel vs. Regina, Vol. 10 of the <lb/> appeal cases, page 675, and stated
                  in Mr. <lb/> Clement's work on the Canadian Consti<lb break="no"/>tution. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     My hon. friend, the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, says we cannot constitute a province 
     <lb/>
     on a different basis from that on which the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces are constituted. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know where he finds authority for such a 
     <lb/>
     statement, unless it be in a foot note in 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Clement's work on the Canadian Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, but that is only an editorial note, 
     <lb/>
     not supported by any authority. Yet it is 
     <lb/>
     relied upon in toto by the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition. Can we constitute a province 
     <lb/>
     on a different basis from that on which 
     <lb/>
     any other province is constituted ? I should 
     <lb/>
     say certainly we can. There is ample 
     <lb/>
     power given in the Confederation Act, and 
     <lb/>
     what is more we have done so time and 
     <lb/>
     time again and our right has never been 
     <lb/>
     challenged. Why, take the province of 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia and take section 91 of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act of 1867, and 
     <lb/>
     what do we find ? We find that although 
     <lb/>
     by section 91 the question of marriage and 
     <lb/>
     divorce rests exclusively within the juris<lb break="no"/>diction of the parliament of Canada. yet 
     <lb/>
     they have their divorce courts in British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia. Likewise in Nova Scotia and 
     <lb/>
     New-Brunswick. In Ontario and Quebec, 
     <lb/>

     however, the subject is one which is left 
     <lb/>
     to the jurisdiction of this parliament. It 
     <lb/>
     cannot be said that in that respect the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are on equal terms. And it must be 
     <lb/>
     borne in mind that that power was left to 
     <lb/>
     the province of British Columbia when it 
     <lb/>
     entered this union, three years after our 
     <lb/>
     Federal Act came into force. We al<lb break="no"/>lowed British Columbia to retain that power, 
     <lb/>
     either expressly or by implication, although 
     <lb/>
     the question is exclusively within the juris<lb break="no"/>diction of this parliament, according to sec<lb break="no"/>tion 91 of the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:STOC1">Mr. STOCKTON</persName>. Is it not provided in <lb/> the British North
                  America Act that all laws <lb/> in force in a province at the time that Act <lb/>
                  came into operation shall continue in force <lb/> until repealed, and were not the
                  divorce <lb/> courts of Nova Scotiu and New Brunswick <lb/> continued under that
                  section of the Act? <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:GUTH1">Mr. GUTHRIE</persName>. It is quite possible that <lb/> that clause to
                  which the hon. member re<lb break="no"/>fers is the one under which these courts
                  <lb/> do exist ; but I am pointing out the in<lb break="no"/>equality which does
                  exist to-day between <lb/> the legislative powers in the different pro~ <lb/>
                  vinces. Let me point to another matter <lb/> with regard to British Columbia. By
                     sec<lb break="no"/>tion 92 of the British North America Act, <lb/> the lands of
                  the provinces shall be exclu<lb break="no"/>sively under their own management. Yet
                  <lb/> the lands of the province of British Colum<lb break="no"/>bia were not left
                  entirely to it. Large por<lb break="no"/>tions of those lands were transferred to
                  the <lb/> Dominion government. And when the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba
                  was carved out of the <lb/> Territories, its lands, which would other<lb
                     break="no"/>wise have become provincial lands, were <lb/> expressly excepted
                  and came under the <lb/> management and control of the Dominion <lb/> parliament,
                  contrary to section 92 of the <lb/> Confederation Act. Such cases might be <lb/>
                  multiplied. The case of the exemption <lb/> from taxation of the Canadian Pacific
                     Rail<lb break="no"/>way has already been mentioned, and you <lb/>must not fail
                  to mark that all municipal <lb/>rights of taxation, belong exclusively, under
                  <lb/>section 92, to the provinces. And now that <lb/>we are about to create these
                  two new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, the right to tax those Canadian <lb/>Pacific
                  Railway lands, which otherwise <lb/>they would have, we are not granting them.
                  <lb/>In Ontario the Canadian Pacific Railway <lb/>lands could be taxed and I
                  presume also in <lb/>Quebec. All these go to show that in the <lb/>different
                  provinces which we have taken <lb/>into the union, as well as in those which.
                  <lb/>originally came into the union, there has <lb/>been no hard and fast line
                  laid down at <lb/>all, and no rule followed by which they <lb/>would be all on the
                  same basis and enjoy <lb/>the same legislative power. <lb/>
               </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Another question presents itself with re<lb break="no"/>gard to this matter, and it is this. Is there 
     <lb/>
     any right on the part of the Territories to 
     <lb/>
     come here and demand from this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment provincial autonomy as something we 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     cannot refuse? Has this parliament not the 
     <lb/>
     right to refuse to grant it? I submit that 
     <lb/>
     we have a perfect right either to grant or 
     <lb/>
     withhold autonomy, and if we have the 
     <lb/>
     right to grant it, cannot we limit it? 
     <lb/>
     Surely the one proposition is a corrollary 
     <lb/>
     of the other. Should we refuse to grant 
     <lb/>
     it altogether, what is there to prevent the 
     <lb/>
     people of those Territories appealing to the 
     <lb/>
     imperial parliament, which has a pleni<lb break="no"/>tude of power in the matter ? And if the 
     <lb/>
     imperial parliament saw fit to grant their 
     <lb/>
     petition and enact this legislation with re<lb break="no"/>gard to education which we wish to enact, 
     <lb/>
     would not that parliament have the power 
     <lb/>
     to enact it? I submit that if the imperial 
     <lb/>
     parliament has the power, so have we, be<lb break="no"/>cause it is a matter beyond dispute that 
     <lb/>
     the powers of this parliament, in all that is 
     <lb/>
     granted to us under this British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, are what we know as plen<lb break="no"/>ary powers. They are powers as ample 
     <lb/>
     and complete as those of the imperial par<lb break="no"/>liament in this respect. They are not dele<lb break="no"/>gated powers. We are not acting as 
     <lb/>
     agents of the imperial government, but are 
     <lb/>
     acting by virtue of our plenary powers to 
     <lb/>
     pass this legislation; and in this respect 
     <lb/>
     our powers are as high as those of the im<lb break="no"/>perial parliament itself. This view of the 
     <lb/>
     law has been given out by the very highest 
     <lb/>
     authority. It will be found in the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council cases. and I submit that on that 
     <lb/>
     ground the Bill before us is strictly con<lb break="no"/>stitutional. For the sake of argument let 
     <lb/>
     me put this case. Let us suppose that 
     <lb/>
     there is no reference whatever in this Bill 
     <lb/>
     to the subject of education. Let the Bill 
     <lb/>
     go through without any educational clause 
     <lb/>
     whatever in it, what will be the position of 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces? They would come un<lb break="no"/>der the main part of section 93 which says 
     <lb/>
     that education shall remain exclusively 
     <lb/>
     within the jurisdiction of the provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislatures. The subsections would not 
     <lb/>
     apply because they only apply to pro<lb break="no"/>vinces which have established rights regard<lb break="no"/>ing denominational schools. They would 
     <lb/>
     come in under the first clause of section 93 
     <lb/>
    and there would be no right to have any 
     <lb/>denominational schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Then I take the case of the free colonial 
     <lb/>
     legislature of Newfoundland. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know whether there is a system of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in that colony or not, but 
     <lb/>
     I will assume that it has by law such a 
     <lb/>
     system ; and I say that if Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     should knock at the door of confederation 
     <lb/>
     for admission and we should admit her, 
     <lb/>
     that colony would come in subject to the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of section 93. subsections 1, 3 
     <lb/>
     and 4, as it is a colony with a free legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, able to enact its own laws, and higher 
     <lb/>
     than a territory governed from another 
     <lb/>
     source. It would therefore come in under 
     <lb/>
     section 93 while a territory would come in 
     <lb/>
     practically unrestricted. I submit then that 
     <lb/>
     a free colony is in a minor position to a 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="5167" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5167.jpg"/>

               <fw type="num">5168</fw>
         
     territory, which has no government in that 
     <lb/>
     respect. That can never have been the 
     <lb/>
     intention either of the framers of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution or of the Act that was the result 
     <lb/>
     of their labours. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I noticed in the amendment which, 
     <lb/>
     was moved by the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     that he has seen fit to stop short of the, 
     <lb/>
     subsections of section 93. He has framed 
     <lb/>
     his amendment in such a way that by no 
     <lb/>
     possibility could a minority claim any rights 
     <lb/>
     whatever. He has transposed the whole 
     <lb/>
     meaning of section 93, which says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
           
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     In and for each province the legislature may 
     <lb/>
                  exclusively make laws in relation to educa<lb break="no"/>tion — 
               </quote>
               
                  <p>And he stops there. New section 93 is 
     <lb/>
     broader than the amendment of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member. Section 93 continues : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     —subject and according to the following 
     <lb/>
     provisions : 
               </quote>
       
   
            <p>
     And it does make provisions for the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the minority. May we gather 
     <lb/>
     from the amendment as drawn and as pre<lb break="no"/>sented to this House the real feelings of 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition upon the merits 
     <lb/>
     of this question? May we assume from the 
     <lb/>
     manner and the language he has employed 
     <lb/>
     in drawing up his amendment that he is dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly opposed to any claims of minorities 
     <lb/>
     in this matter ? Were his amendment to 
     <lb/>
     carry, and were section 93 to stop as it stops 
     <lb/>
     in the amendment which he has placed be<lb break="no"/>fore the House, there never could be a claim 
     <lb/>
     by a minority for separate schools in any 
     <lb/>
     way, shape or form, in the new provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Is that what the hon. member means ? and 
     <lb/>
     is that a fair indication of his real feelings 
     <lb/>
     upon the merits of this question, apart from 
     <lb/>
     the highly technical argument which he 
     <lb/>
     placed before the House, and in regard to 
     <lb/>
     which he said he stood upon the rock of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, I do not desire to 
     <lb/>
     detain the House any longer. I have tried 
     <lb/>
     to place before you as clearly as I could 
     <lb/>
     the reasons which impel me, which force 
     <lb/>
     me, to the conclusion that this parliament 
     <lb/>
     has the power, the constitutional right, to 
     <lb/>
     pass this law : and if it has, and if it does 
     <lb/>
     pass it, then I submit that no other tri<lb break="no"/>bunal or no other legislative body has that 
     <lb/>
     power. We have, I submit, the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional right, and we should exercise it. It 
     <lb/>
     is said that it will create turmoil, confusion, 
     <lb/>
     prejudice and bad feeling. The educational 
     <lb/>
     question in Canada has done so from about 
     <lb/>
     the year 1840 or 1850, in the old provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and will do so probably for all eternity, 
     <lb/>
     unless it is settled by some legislation 
     <lb/>
     emanating from an authorized source. We 
     <lb/>
     have the right, and I submit that we should 
     <lb/>
     exercise it. Why leave this question to 
     <lb/>
     cmbitter the people in those new provinces 
     <lb/>
     when this is the proper tribunal to settle the 
     <lb/>
     matter? I agree that if we have the pow<lb break="no"/><cb/>er to settle it under the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act of 1871, we have the right also 
     <lb/>
     to leave it unsettled and refer it to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Would it be wise to do that ? 
     <lb/>
     Would it be manly to do it ? I know 
     <lb/>
     there is a disposition on the part of many 
     <lb/>
     members in this House to shirk, or to shrink 
     <lb/>
     from the question. I know also that there is 
     <lb/>
     a disposition on the part of many hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers opposite to fall in behind their leader 
     <lb/>
     on the constitutional question, and to satisfy 
     <lb/>
     themselves on the pure technicality which 
     <lb/>
    he raised on the letter rather than on the 
     <lb/>spirit of the law—and I submit the letter 
     <lb/>is against them—rather than come out in 
     <lb/>the open and vote upon the merits of the 
     <lb/>question. Has anybody challenged our right 
     <lb/>to pass the Act of 1875? Was that a con<lb break="no"/>stitutional Act ? Has it ever been challeng<lb break="no"/>ed ? I submit it was constitutional, and 
     <lb/>came within the powers granted by that 
     <lb/>Order in Council passed in June, 1870, an 
     <lb/>Order in Council which had the same force 
     <lb/>and effect as an imperial statute. Under 
     <lb/>that Act what do we find? After the 
     <lb/>Act had gone into operation, an elective 
     <lb/>body was formed in those Territories 
     <lb/>with power to make laws, subject to 
     <lb/>the assent of this parliament. We have 
     <lb/>acted upon the educational clauses of the 
     <lb/>Act of 1875, we have changed them time and 
     <lb/>again, we have restricted their application. 
     <lb/>We have been the representatives of the 
     <lb/>people of the Territories. and it is not fair 
     <lb/>to say that the Territories had no repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in this House in 1875 ; this par<lb break="no"/>liament represented the Territories. Surely 
     <lb/>the members of parliament of that day 
     <lb/>felt their obligation towards that part of 
     <lb/>Canada, as towards any other part of Can<lb break="no"/>ada. I think that from the year 1888 they 
     <lb/>had direct representation in this House, 
     <lb/>and also in the Senate. They amended 
     <lb/>their school law by ordinances passed in 
     <lb/>1890 and 1891, and this government has 
     <lb/>assented to them. For thirty years the 
               <lb/>people have had a guarantee, with the con<lb break="no"/>sent of this House, that the system of 
     <lb/>schools in operation there would be per<lb break="no"/>petuated. Shall we place these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces on a lower plane than we would 
     <lb/>place the colony of Newfoundland ? Shall 
     <lb/>we say to these new provinces : If you 
     <lb/>come in you must come in without the 
     <lb/>benefit of subsections 1, 3 and 4 of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>while Newfoundland would come in sub<lb break="no"/>ject to those subsections ? I submit that, 
     <lb/>from the point of justice, of equity, of fair 
     <lb/>dealing with the minority in this country, 
     <lb/>as a pure matter of expediency, if on no 
     <lb/>higher ground, for the purpose of taking 
     <lb/>this matter out of provincial politics—as a 
     <lb/>pure matter of expediency, as well as a 
     <lb/>matter of justice, the educational clauses 
     <lb/>of the Bill as now framed should be passed.

                  <persName ref="pers:BOYE1">Mr. G. BOYER</persName> (Vaudreuill). (Translation.) <lb/> Mr. Speaker,
                  it is with some emotion and <lb/> fear that I rise to take part in the discussion
                  <lb/> which has been going on for several weeks <lb/> between a number of leading
                  hon. members <lb/> on both sides of the House. Following in <lb/> the footstepts
                  of the hon. member for Haldi<lb break="no"/>mand, I trust my hearers will not lose
                  <lb/> sight of the fact that I am fighting my <lb/> first battle on the floor of
                  the House, within <lb/> whose precincts racial and religious pass<lb break="no"
                  />ions have waxed warm of late, amidst, on <lb/> the one hand, the noble accents
                  of legiti<lb break="no"/>mate vindications and, on the other, danger<lb break="no"
                  />ous and foolish appeals to prejudice, the <lb/> whinings of deceptive and
                  chimerical fears. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     I have listened, Mr. Speaker, to the two 
     <lb/>
     leaders and to followers of each one of 
     <lb/>
     them. One of these is at the head of the 
     <lb/>
     party which has been governing this country 
     <lb/>
     in such an admirable way for nearly nine 
     <lb/>
     years. The other is heir to an enfeebled 
     <lb/>
     party, the leader of a loyal opposition but, 
     <lb/>
     it is time it should be stated, of an opposi<lb break="no"/>tion unsettled in its aim and framing its 
     <lb/>
     policy on a basis of unpardonable intoler<lb break="no"/>ance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The issue between these two leaders and 
     <lb/>
     their followers is, Mr. Speaker, a most im<lb break="no"/>portant one. You have, Sir, listened to the 
     <lb/>
     discussion which has been going on and 
     <lb/>
     you are in a position to decide whether 
     <lb/>
     the parallel which I am about to draw 
     <lb/>
     as to the respective merits of the stand 
     <lb/>
     taken by them is acceptable and reasonable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. leader of the government has the 
     <lb/>
     almost unanimous support, under the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, of hon. members on this side 
     <lb/>
     of the House, while the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition, finding differences of opinion 
     <lb/>
     among his followers has thought fit to leave 
     <lb/>
     them free to vote as they please. I quote 
     <lb/>
     his own words: (See Hansard, page 2929). 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
     I say, that, in taking the position which I

     the House, following the dictates of his con<lb break="no"/>science and of his good judgment should feel

            <p>
     Now, we have observed, Mr. Speaker, that 
     <lb/>
     several of that hon. gentleman's followers 
     <lb/>
     have taken advantage of the privilege thus

     granted them, since we see rising against

     It is not my intention to enter into a de<lb break="no"/>tailed discussion of the Bill, the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of which have been already fully debated. 
     <lb/>
     I lack the boldness to do so, and besides, 
     <lb/>
     I may be permitted to state that I have 
     <lb/>
     come too late to shed new light on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, all available material having been al<lb break="no"/><cb/>ready utilized. On the other hand, I see be<lb break="no"/>fore me in this House quite a number of 
     <lb/>
     leading gentlemen, supporters of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, who will carry on the discussion 
     <lb/>
     with ability, and who will succeed no doubt, 
     <lb/>
     in enlivening it more than once. That dif<lb break="no"/>ficult task, I shall leave to them to perform. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I shall confine myself, Mr. Speaker, to 
     <lb/>
     a very few remarks. In the first place, 
     <lb/>
     on the organization of these provinces ; 
     <lb/>
     in the second place, on the educational 
     <lb/>
     clause of the Bill ; in the third place, on 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of intolerance of certain hon. 
     <lb/>
     members, and fourthly, I shall conclude 
     <lb/>
     with some general remarks. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Canada is progressing faster than any 
     <lb/>
     other country. Our export trade, within 
     <lb/>
     recent years, has increased in greater ratio 
     <lb/>
     than that of any other country in the 
     <lb/>
     world ; and the output of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, makes up a large proportion 
     <lb/>
     of our total trade returns. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I shall merely state the value of the out<lb break="no"/>put of cereals in the Northwest : In 1903, 
     <lb/>
     it was valued at $55,000,000, not to speak 
     <lb/>
     of other agricultural commodities, dairy pro<lb break="no"/>ducts and live stock. The following statis<lb break="no"/>tics give us an idea of the possibilities of 
     <lb/>the Northwest Territories as regards three 
     <lb/>leading cereals :-

            <p>The population of these Territories, 
     <lb/>which in 1891 numbered only 98,967, rose in 
     <lb/>1901 to 211,649, and reaches just now 
     <lb/>500,000. In those prairies, formerly, a few 
     <lb/>huts were strewn here and there ; to—day, 
     <lb/>houses are closer, sturdy farmers have 
     <lb/>built their homes all over this once desert 
     <lb/>land. Villages, large communities have 
     <lb/>sprung up here and there over these great 
     <lb/>and fertile plains. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     These localities have their banking 
     <lb/>
     houses, their business firms, their lawyers, 
     <lb/>
     their doctors, their brokers, in a word all 
     <lb/>
     the essentials of commerce and progress. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Bold, ambitious and industrious settlers 
     <lb/>
     have come there from all parts to make 
     <lb/>
     their homes. A goodly number come from 
     <lb/>
     the United States, others from Europe, 
     <lb/>
     from the mother country and other parts of 
     <lb/>
     the old continent ; then the older provinces 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion, and more especially On<lb break="no"/>tario and Quebec, has sent a good many. 
     <lb/>
     That influx of immigrants which I am re<lb break="no"/>ferring to just now, has been constantly 
     <lb/>
     increasing of late years, and we are forced 
     <lb/>
     to admit that, through the ingress of these 
     <lb/>
     thousands of settlers, through their daily 
     <lb/>
     work, through their unsparing efforts, the 
     <lb/>
     axis of the Dominion will be displaced 
     <lb/>
     towards the west. For the Northwest, with 
     <lb/>
     its magnificent farming areas, its grazing 
     <lb/>
     lands, which are the richest in America, 
     <lb/>
     is generally recognized as the greatest field 
     <lb/>
     open to settlement; and the best proof in 
     <lb/>

     support of this statemenms to be found in 
     <lb/>
     the addition of these 500,000 settlers to the 
     <lb/>
     population of the west within the last seven 
     <lb/>
     years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The government, therefore, are justified 
     <lb/>
     in establishing the provinces of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan and Alberta. In so doing, they are 
     <lb/>
     only following in the wake of the mar<lb break="no"/>vellous progress which has been the result 
     <lb/>of their own efforts. I am proud, Mr. 
     <lb/>Speaker, to have a seat in this parliament 
     <lb/>which, by carving out these new provinces, 
     <lb/>is turning a new leaf in the history of 
     <lb/>Canada. These two new sister provinces, 
     <lb/>entering confederation, will strengthen the 
     <lb/>bounds which unite old and new Canada, 
     <lb/>and bind more firmly together, through 
     <lb/>mutual interest, all the provinces of 
     <lb/>Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, hon. members of both sides 
     <lb/>
     of the House seem to agree as regards 
     <lb/>
     almost every clause of this Bill. One 
     <lb/>
     single clause, besides that relative to the 
     <lb/>
     lands, has. therefore, taken up the time of 
     <lb/>
     the House: I mean the clause relative to 
     <lb/>
     education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before proceeding any further, I may be 
     <lb/>
     allowed, Mr. Speaker, to quote some statis<lb break="no"/>tics as to the number of schools, teachers, 
     <lb/>
     &amp;c., for 1903: 
     <lb/>

     Ten, of these, Mr. Speaker, are separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. The right hon. leader of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment has thought fit to add to clause 
     <lb/>
     16 of the Autonomy Bill, an amendment 
     <lb/>
     which, practically, cannot give any but 
     <lb/>
     good and favourable results.

            <p>
     Conservative newspapers of the province

     of Quebec,—I may be pardoned for not 
     <lb/>
     stating the exact number, for it is not 
     <lb/>
     large,—taunt the right hon. Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     for sacrificing, as they allege, the minority 
     <lb/>
     by this amendment. They speak dispara<lb break="no"/>gingly of the Prime Minister and rebuke 
     <lb/>
     him for having altered the original clause. 
     <lb/>
     The clause, in its present form, they say, 
     <lb/>
     does not grant to Catholics the rights they 
     <lb/>
     are entitled to . 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I quote the following from the 'Evene<lb break="no"/>ment,' a Conservative newspaper of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     The article is under the heading: 'Cain,

     Notwithstanding the provisions of the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion Act, the legislative assembly of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories pass ordinances forbidding religious

     teaching and the use of the French language 
     <lb/>

     What does Mr. Laurier do ?

            </p>

            <p>
     Instead of enforcing the existing Dominion 
     <lb/>
     Act, he introduces a Bill which deprives the

     Catholic and French majority of their most 
     <lb/>
     sacred rights. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For a moment, Mr. Laurier thought of main<lb break="no"/>taining the existing legislation by repeating it 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     word for word in the new Bill, but Sifton 
     <lb/>
     showed fight and Mr. Laurier knuckled down. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Instead of basing the new legislation on the 
     <lb/>
     old, Mr. Laurier endorsed the grievances con<lb break="no"/>tained in the ordinances passed contrary to the 
     <lb/>
     law, and his new legislation sanctions these 
     <lb/>
     in turn. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     French will no longer be taught in the 
     <lb/>
     school's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Religious teaching will no longer be given 
     <lb/>
     to Catholics in the N.W.T. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In localities where our fellow-countrymen are 
     <lb/>
     in the majority, they are to be deprived of the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     by the public school, the neutral school. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Such is Mr. Sifton's dictum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Such is Mr. Laurier's compromise.

     We have here, Mr. Speaker, the two ex<lb break="no"/>tremes ; those who complain that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment are not doing justice to the Catho<lb break="no"/>lic minority, and those who complain that 
     <lb/>

     party or on any man, if the minorities in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories are not receiving 
     <lb/>
     all that they should receive, let us find out 
     <lb/>
     who is responsible for this state of things. 
     <lb/>
     Let us glance over the history of educational 
     <lb/>
     institutions in the Territories we are about 
     <lb/>
     to organize. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1875, when the Dominion parliament 
     <lb/>
     passed the Northwest Territories Act 
     <lb/>
     was provided that the minorities, whether 
     <lb/>
     Catholic or Protestant, would have the right 
     <lb/>
     to establish separate schools and would not 
     <lb/>
     be called upon to pay taxes for any others 
     <lb/>
     but such schools. That was the only pro<lb break="no"/>vision contained in that Act. In 1884, the 
     <lb/>
     legislature organized a system of education, 
     <lb/>
     similar, or almost similar, to that of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec, and comprising, more 
     <lb/>
     particularly, a council divided into two 
     <lb/>
     boards, the one Catholic and the other Pro<lb break="no"/>testant. In 1888, the ordinances of 1884 were 
     <lb/>
     consolidated by the legislature. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     However, in 1892, these ordinances of 
     <lb/>
     1884-88, were repealed by the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories legislature. The council of edu<lb break="no"/>cation was to be no longer divided into a 
     <lb/>
     Catholic and Protestant board, and was re<lb break="no"/>duced to the mere rank of a consulting 
     <lb/>
     body. The new ordinance provided at the 
     <lb/>
     same time that teaching in the said schools 
     <lb/>
     would be given in English : but subsection 
     <lb/>
     1 of section 83 provided that school com<lb break="no"/>missioners might have elementary courses 
     <lb/>
     taught in the French language. Catholics 
     <lb/>
     endeavoured to have that ordinance dis<lb break="no"/>allowed by the Dominion government, who 
     <lb/>
     had authority to do so ; however, the latter, 
     <lb/>
     by Order in Council dated February 5th, 
     <lb/>
     1894, on the recommendation of Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Thompson, then Prime Minister and Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Justice, refussed to disallow the 
     <lb/>
     ordinances of 1892 and 1893. Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Thompson's recommendation stated that the 
     <lb/>
     facts brought to the knowledge of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor in Council were not such as to war<lb break="no"/>rant the disallowance of these ordinances. 
     <lb/>
     The latter provided that the council of edu<lb break="no"/>cation would no longer be divided into two 
     <lb/>
     boards and put the whole school system 
     <lb/>
     under the control of a single member of the 
     <lb/>
     government, who was to appoint inspectors, 
     <lb/>
     decide upon text books to be used, &amp;c. The 
     <lb/>
     then government decided that the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories legislature had the right to 
     <lb/>
     make these changes and to pass these ordin<lb break="no"/>ances. The ministers present at the sitting 
     <lb/>
     of council at which the order of February 
     <lb/>
     5 was passed. were Sir John Thompson, Sir 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie Bowell, Sir Adolphe Caron, Sir 
     <lb/>
    Charles Tupper. Hon. Messrs. Costigan. 
     <lb/>Haggart, Ouimet, Patterson, Daly and 
     <lb/>Angers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Now, at these various stages, what was 
     <lb/>
     the part taken by the right hon. present 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, who is now being accused 
     <lb/>
     of sacrificing the rights of the minority? 
     <lb/>
     Was is not the Northwest Territories legis<lb break="no"/>lature that passed those ordinances in 1884. 
     <lb/>
     and repealed them in 1892 ? Was it not the 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
         
     party whose present leader is the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Carleton, that refused, in 1894, 
     <lb/>
     when it had the power to do so, to disallow 
     <lb/>
     those ordinances of 1892 ? How can the 
     <lb/>
     present government be fairly called upon 
     <lb/>
     to disallow ordinances which have been 
     <lb/>
     sanctioned by a previous government ? 
     <lb/>
     Let us for a moment view the question 
     <lb/>
     from the standpoint of the majority in 
     <lb/>
     those Territories under whose unrestricted 
     <lb/>
     control these schools have been for thirteen 
     <lb/>
     years past. Would they willingly allow that 
     <lb/>
     control to be interfered with ? How is it 
     <lb/>
     that the then government, under the leader<lb break="no"/>ship of a Catholic, Sir John Thompson, has 
     <lb/>
     been spared the aspersions of those good 
     <lb/>
     Catholics who are at the same time out- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     and-out Tories ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The government, through its leader, in<lb break="no"/>troduces two Bills for the provincial organi<lb break="no"/>zation of two districts, that of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan and that of Alberta. These two Bills 
     <lb/>
     are similar, and both contain a clause 
     <lb/>
     which, even taking into account the amend<lb break="no"/>ment which has been inserted since, ensures 
     <lb/>
     to the minorities those rights and privil<lb break="no"/>eges enjoyed by them since the passing of 
     <lb/>
     the 1892 ordinances. Once those provinces 
     <lb/>
     have been organized, the system of edu<lb break="no"/>cation in force at present will become for 
     <lb/>
     ever the lawful system of the country. The 
     <lb/>
     legislatures of the new provinces, should 
     <lb/>
     they desire to do so, will not be in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to repeal it. Were they not sanctioned 
     <lb/>
     and guaranteed by the constitution, these 
     <lb/>
     rights of the minorities would be left en<lb break="no"/>tirely in the hands of immigrants who are 
     <lb/>
     coming to us from all parts of the world. 
     <lb/>
     Thanks to that provision contained in the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, minorities will retain separate schools 
     <lb/>
     to the extent they have them to-day. With<lb break="no"/>out that guarantee, those rights might be 
     <lb/>
     taken away to-morrow at a mere whim of 
     <lb/>
     the legislatures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Autonomy Act and its amendments, 
     <lb/>
     now before the House, will render further 
     <lb/>
     interference impossible. The following are 
     <lb/>
     the advantages ensured to the minority by 
     <lb/>
     the said Act, under various circumstances 
     <lb/>
     and subject to the various provinces con<lb break="no"/>tained in the educational Acts: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A Separate school house, a Catholic 
     <lb/>
     teacher, Catholic trustees to superintend the 
     <lb/>
     school, the asurance that text books on his<lb break="no"/>tory, geography, arithmetic, grammar, will 
     <lb/>
     not contain anything objectionable from 
     <lb/>
     the standpoint of the Catholic church, a 
     <lb/>
     half hour per day of religious teaching, ex<lb break="no"/>emption from taxation for the support of 
     <lb/>
     public schools, their share of public grants 
     <lb/>
     from the provincial government, an ele<lb break="no"/>mentary course in French, at least two 
     <lb/>
     out of five members of the board of educa<lb break="no"/>tion to be Catholics. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Such are, Mr. Speaker, the indisputable 
     <lb/>
     rights which the Autonomy Bill ensures to 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic minority in the northwest. 
     <lb/>
     Thanks to the Autonomy Act these rights 
     <lb/>
     become sacred and indisputable.

            <p>
     I have had the honour, Sir, to be elected to 
     <lb/>
     represent my constituency by voters belong<lb break="no"/>ing to various races and various creeds; 
     <lb/>
     and I am proud to state, in this House, that 
     <lb/>
     none of these electors, whether Catholic or 
     <lb/>
     Protestant, French or English, have laid 
     <lb/>
     down terms or suggested a policy for me to 
     <lb/>
     follow on religious or racial issues, such as 
     <lb/>
     that now being discussed. And I may add 
     <lb/>
     this, to the credit of the English-speaking 
     <lb/>
     section of my electors, who are quite numer<lb break="no"/>ous, that they have not sent me one single 
     <lb/>
     petition or protest such as those which have 
     <lb/>
     rejoiced the hearts of some hon. members on 
     <lb/>
     the other side. As a further proof of what 
     <lb/>
     I say, I may invite the hon. members for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey (Mr. Sproule), for Victoria, (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sam. Hughes) and for South York (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Maclean), to come and spend a few days in 
     <lb/>
     the English-speaking section of Vaudreuil, 
     <lb/>
     in order to judge for themselves what a 
     <lb/>
     happy and contented life lead those whose 
     <lb/>
     digestion is not troubled by the heartburn<lb break="no"/>ings of bigotry. These hon. members would 
     <lb/>
     find there inspiring examples and unfailing 
     <lb/>
     recipes to restore tranquillity to their un<lb break="no"/>settled minds. There would they find pure- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     blooded Englishmen; Scotchmen, who are 
     <lb/>
     the direct descendants of those proud High<lb break="no"/>landers; Irishmen, from the Emerald Isle, 
     <lb/>
     living in close neighbourhood with people of 
     <lb/>
     pure French Canadian stock, all in perfect 
     <lb/>
     peace and harmony. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     However, I fear it may grate on the rather 
     <lb/>
     sensitive ears of the hon. member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey, that faithful interpreter of the ' Hun<lb break="no"/>tingdon Gleaner,' if I state that, in those 
     <lb/>
     same English sections of the county, the 
     <lb/>
     French population is usually not very 
     <lb/>
     wealthy, but that, there as elsewhere, they 
     <lb/>
     have the love of religious ceremonies and 
     <lb/>
     have built for themselves unpretentious 
     <lb/>
     churches where they congregate to pray to 
     <lb/>
     God after their fashion and in accordance 
     <lb/>
     with the tenets of their church. Now, much 
     <lb/>
     of the material which has been used in the 
     <lb/>
     construction of these buildings, has been 
     <lb/>
     paid for out of the generous donations of 
     <lb/>
     Protestants. A resident in one of these 
     <lb/>
     localities, and its mayor, an Englishman - 
               <lb/>    and one that I only wish hon. gentlemen 
     
     who oppose us would resemble in some little 
     <lb/>
     degree—donated the sum of one hundred 
     <lb/>
     dollars towards the building of one of these 
     <lb/>
     modest chapels. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Protestant populations in my county 
     <lb/>
     have schools fully equipped, wherein child<lb break="no"/>ren receive a complete education. Besides 
     <lb/>
     these Protestant schools there are Catholic 
     <lb/>
     schools. In some of the schools, the teach<lb break="no"/>ing is given in English, in others it is given 
     <lb/>
     in French. The English population speaks 
     <lb/>
     English and the French speaks French, 
     <lb/>
     whenever it suits or pleases them. In that 
     <lb/>
     way, all enjoy equal rights and live in 
     <lb/>
     harmony. And on Sundays, all, English as 
     <lb/>
     well as French, Protestants as well as 
     <lb/>
     Catholics, enjoy rest under the eye of the 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
        
     same Master whom they all serve and hon<lb break="no"/>our, although in various ways. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The state of things which I have just des<lb break="no"/>cribed is not special to the county I repres<lb break="no"/>ent, it is to be found in all the counties of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec wherein Englishmen and Scotchmen 
     <lb/>
     are to he found. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I wonder at times whether the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers for East Grey. Victoria and South York 
     <lb/>
     are sincere in their intolerant warfare: I 
     <lb/>
     will do them the kindness of believeing they 
     <lb/>
     are. However, I cannot help calling to 
     <lb/>
     mind, just now, inflammatory editorials 
     <lb/>
     against French Canadians, and more especi<lb break="no"/>ally Catholics, which appeared, some nine 
     <lb/>
     years ago, in the Morrisburg 'Courier,' the 
     <lb/>
     leading organ of the ' P.P.A.' That paper 
     <lb/>
     was, at the time, under the control of an 
     <lb/>
     ally of hon. gentlemen opposite who was 
     <lb/>
     then, the leader, or about to become the 
     <lb/>
     leader, of the Opposition in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, and who is to-day the head of the 
     <lb/>
     government in that province. And to, that 
     <lb/>
     wrathful opponent of the French Canadians 
     <lb/>
     and of our fellow-believers in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario, unexpectedly touched by heaven<lb break="no"/>ly grace, and no doubt, also by the expect<lb break="no"/>ation of some future reward, mellowed, little 
     <lb/>
     by little, into a kindlier feeling towards us. 
     <lb/>
     And soon the political sky of his province 
     <lb/>
     cleared up, brighter days shone for him; 
     <lb/>
     he emerged from the cold shades, or rather 
     <lb/>
     from the warm purgatory, of opposition : he 
     <lb/>
     won a great battle and became Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of his province. And then what did he 
     <lb/>
     do, but take into his cabinet, two Catholics, 
     <lb/>
     and one of them a French Canadian. With 
     <lb/>
     one stroke of that pencil which made up the 
     <lb/>
     list of his future colleagues, the new Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister made amends for his past re<lb break="no"/>cord and won the consideration of the 
     <lb/>
     whole Catholic and French population 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I wonder whether the hon. members for 
     <lb/>
     South York, East Grey and Victoria will 
     <lb/>
     not some day imitate such conduct and get 
     <lb/>
     converted. It is high time they do so, for 
     <lb/>
     should they delay until they become minis<lb break="no"/>ters of the Crown to atone for their intoler<lb break="no"/>ant warfare of to-day, I fear they will die. 
     <lb/>
     impenitent; and for the information and 
     <lb/>
     edification of the future generation, we 
     <lb/>
     might inscribe on their tombs: under this 
     <lb/>
     barren soil lies the unwholsome seed of 
     <lb/>
     hateful principles which have never germin<lb break="no"/>ated in this beautiful country. Allow me, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, to call the attention of those hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the other side to whom I 
     <lb/>
     have referred several times to what has 
     <lb/>
     occurred in the provincial legislature of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, not later than last week, when the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. Weir, a Scotch Protestant, was 
     <lb/>
     elected Speaker of the House, it being the 
     <lb/>
     first time that an English-speaking Pro<lb break="no"/>testant was elected to fill such a position 
     <lb/>
     in the province. In the meantime, the 
     <lb/>
     French population of that province are wit<lb break="no"/>nesses of outbreaks of feeling in Ottawa 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="5177" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5177.jpg"/>
               <fw type="num">5177</fw>

               <fw type="num">5178</fw>
     which are not of a nature to induce a 
     <lb/>
     spirit of toleration. But, in Quebec, as 
     <lb/>
     well as in Ottawa, the French-speaking 
     <lb/>
     members are swayed solely by principles of 
     <lb/>
     justice and fair play. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now what do we hear from parties most 
     <lb/>
     concerned in the matter ? What is the 
     <lb/>
     stand taken by the majority, what is the 
     <lb/>
     stand taken by the minority in these North<lb break="no"/>west provinces ? Of the various minorities 
     <lb/>
     to be found in the western country the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority is the most deeply con<lb break="no"/>cerned; they it is who we should consult, 
     <lb/>
     they it is who will protest if protests are in 
     <lb/>
     order. Have they not done so in 1893 and 
     <lb/>
     1894? There also do we find leading men 
     <lb/>
     who, of course, are better informed as to 
     <lb/>
     the needs of the people of the west than 
     <lb/>
     can possibly be the firebrands at work in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec and elsewhere. And 
     <lb/>
     what do we find ? We find that they ex<lb break="no"/>press satisfaction at the present state of 
     <lb/>
     things. Should not their views prevail over 
     <lb/>
     those of outsiders who point out to treach<lb break="no"/>ery and surrender of the rights of the min<lb break="no"/>ority ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I for one, Mr. Speaker, am of opinion 
     <lb/>
     that our fellow countrymen and fellow-be<lb break="no"/>lievers in the west have not been granted 
     <lb/>
     all the rights and privileges to which they 
     <lb/>
     are fairly entitled. But, in a country with 
     <lb/>
     a mixed population, honourable compromises 
     <lb/>
     should not be spurned, especialy when, on 
     <lb/>
     looking back into the past I find that the 
     <lb/>
     present government in not responsible for 
     <lb/>
     the existing condition of things, and that 
     <lb/>
     the reasons which induced the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment to ratify the ordinances of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories legislature in 1892 still ex<lb break="no"/>ist. Is not compromise, is not conciliation 
     <lb/>
     the best way out of the difliculty, when 
     <lb/>
     other means fail and the majority are 
     <lb/>
     against us ? In 1892, the minority had a 
     <lb/>
     feeling that they were downtrodden, and 
     <lb/>
     that they could not get along under the new 
     <lb/>
     ordinances. However, subsequent events 
     <lb/>
     showed that their fears had been exagger<lb break="no"/>ated, and it seems as if things had been 
     <lb/>
     going on pretty smoothly as regards edu<lb break="no"/>cational matters in those great western 
     <lb/>
     plains. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another very striking circumstance was 
     <lb/>
     the return of the member for Alberta, the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. Oliver, on the occasion of his 
     <lb/>
     promotion to the position of Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior. The minority had there a unique 
     <lb/>
     opportunity for asserting their rights; on 
     <lb/>
     the other hand Protestants were given the 
     <lb/>
     same opportunity of making known their 
     <lb/>
     views, of carrying on the holy crusade be<lb break="no"/>gun by the hon. members for East Grey, 
     <lb/>
     for South York and for Victoria. Now, 
     <lb/>
     there was no agitation carried on. neither on 
     <lb/>
     the one side or on the other, Is not this 
     <lb/>
     unanimity of opinion a proof that people 
     <lb/>
     in the west live in a state of peace and 
     <lb/>
     these people more deeply concerned in the 
     <lb/>
     question than the members for East Grey, 
     <lb/>
     for Victoria and for South York, who 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
 
                   
     though strangers to that province would fain 
     <lb/>
     make us believe that they are better ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with the needs of the people out 
     <lb/>
     there than the very parties concerned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The leader of the opposition, in his am<lb break="no"/>endment, contends that we are invading 
     <lb/>
     the rights of the new provinces, and insists 
     <lb/>
     that we should leave to them the exclusive 
     <lb/>
     right of legislature in reference to educa<lb break="no"/>tional matters, as well as in reference to 
     <lb/>
     all others. Residents in the west do not 
     <lb/>
     seem to worry as to that either, and the 
     <lb/>
     return by acclamation of the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Oliver, in one of the Western constituencies, 
     <lb/>
     is clear evidence of the state of peace 
     <lb/>
     which prevails in those quarters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me give here, Mr. Speaker, a further 
     <lb/>
     proof of what I have just stated. The fol<lb break="no"/>lowing is an extract of the Edmonton 
     <lb/>
     'Journal,' a Conservative organ, regarding 
     <lb/>
     the Bills now before us :-</p>

                  <p>
                  It seems as though the educational clauses
     <lb/>
     of the Autonomy Bills were to give occasion 
     <lb/>
     to inflammatory appeals to racial and religious 
     <lb/>
     prejudices. In the interest of Western Canada, 
     <lb/>
     such a contingency is to be deeply deplored. 
     <lb/>
     Heretofore the main object of western people 
     <lb/>
     has been to build up a free and united pro<lb break="no"/>vince, to profit by the experience of old Canada 
     <lb/>
     to reduce to a minimum the occasions of fric<lb break="no"/>tion between followers of various creeds, to 
     <lb/>
     insist with calm on the necessity of equal 
     <lb/>
     rights for all citizens, without vainly clamour<lb break="no"/>ing for provincial rights, but resting our con<lb break="no"/>fidence in the wise decision of the western 
     <lb/>
     members and in the breadth of mind of the 
     <lb/>
     political leaders, for the settlement of that

     Two new provinces will be added to the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada, Saskatchewan and Al<lb break="no"/>berta. Within these two new provinces, 
     <lb/>
     there are Catholics and French Canadians. 
     <lb/>
     Their numbers, already large, will always 
     <lb/>
     go on increasing, and they will be there, 
     <lb/>
     along the banks of the Saskatchewan. 
     <lb/>
     What they have been along the shores of 
     <lb/>
     the St. Lawrence; loyal citizens, respectful 
     <lb/>
     of law, lovers of peace and harmony; and 
     <lb/>
     if that race proves as prolific in those great 
     <lb/>
     western plains as it is in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, we will have before long the spec<lb break="no"/>tacle of a compact body of these sturdy 
     <lb/>
     settlers advancing hand in hand along the 
     <lb/>
     path of progress, not only as regards agri<lb break="no"/>culture, but as regards industry, and 
     <lb/>
     worthily playing their part in public affairs. 
     <lb/>
     And do we know what the future has in 
     <lb/>
     store for us? Possibly, some day to come, 
     <lb/>
     our English speaking and other fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     citizens may witness with admiration, 
     <lb/>
     a second battle of Chateauguay in that 
     <lb/>
     country, which, perhaps, has in store for 
     <lb/>
     us in the near future, surprises as great 
     <lb/>
     as its agricultural wealth. For who can 
     <lb/>
     say that those French Canadians, whom a 
     <lb/>
     few bigots are anxious to injure to-day, 
     <lb/>
     will not be the last to remain loyal to the

     <lb/>
     Canadian. That compliment paid by one 
     <lb/>
     of our governors to the inhabitants of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, might properly, to my mind, be ap<lb break="no"/>plied to their worthy and loyal descendants 
     <lb/>
     who have made their homes in the plains

     I appeal to my English speaking coll<lb break="no"/>eagues in this House ; I appeal to their 
     <lb/>
     good will and to their spirit of fairness, I 
     <lb/>
     beg of them to help in putting a stop to 
     <lb/>
     this racial and religious strife which breeds 
     <lb/>
     nothing but evil for the country. I ask 
     <lb/>
     them, why should we not all, hand in hand, 
     <lb/>
     work together towards the aggrandisement 
     <lb/>
     of our common country; why should we 
     <lb/>
     not, by our common efforts, build up, in 
     <lb/>
     this great country, which extends from the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic to the Pacific, a great, strong and 
     <lb/>
     united nation ?

                  <persName ref="pers:MCIN1">Mr. G. H. McINTYRE</persName> (South Perth). Mr. <lb/> Speaker, the
                  debate on this important ques<lb break="no"/>tion which has been prolonged for
                  such a <lb/> great length of time is now in its last stages <lb/> and as a new
                  member, if I found myself <lb/> seeing eye to eye in every particular with <lb/>
                  the party to which I belong, with my Liberal <lb/> friends generally, it is not
                  likely that I <lb/> would have felt called upon to make any <lb/> remarks upon the
                  matter, but as I see some<lb break="no"/>what differently from some of my friends,
                  <lb/> I have thought it wise and proper to put <lb/> on record the reasons for my
                  action. I have <lb/> noticed that some speakers, especially in the <lb/> later
                  stages of the debate. have as it were <lb/> apologized for speaking owing to the
                  fact <lb/> that the matter has been so thoroughly <lb/> threshed out, and all
                  arguments from the <lb/> various points of view so fully presented to <lb/> the
                  House that there seemed little left for <lb/> them to do except to present them
                  again <lb/> with perhaps a little local colouring from the <lb/> Speaker's own
                  individuality, and they seem<lb break="no"/>ed to regret that it was impossible
                  <lb/> for them to make their speeches interest<lb break="no"/>ing. But as I
                  listened to their speeches <lb/> I found that they did make them interest<lb
                     break="no"/>ing, even in spite of the familiarity of any <lb/> of the
                  arguments. Not only so, but they <lb/> made them exceedingly interesting for some
                  <lb/> of their opponents. I have no such desire <lb/> or intention in addressing
                  the House to<lb break="no"/>night. My intention is rather to give an <lb/>
                  explanation of my position nor will I need, <lb/> I think, to speak at any length.
                  Many of <lb/> the speeches, if I may use a little criticism, <lb/> have been of
                  considerable length and pos<lb break="no"/>sibly this debate would have been much
                  <lb/> shorter if each speaker had confined him<lb break="no"/>self very closely to
                  the question at issue. <lb/> It seems to have been the natural inclination <lb/>
                  of many to rather criticise the immediate<lb break="no"/>ly preceding speech. Many
                  speeches have <lb/> dealt with matters not strictly pertinent to <lb/> this
                  question, matters such as the boundar<lb break="no"/>ies of Manitoba and many
                  matters of that <lb/> nature entirely outside the question have <lb/> been
                  discussed at great length. I shall <lb/>
                  <cb/> endeavour to adhere to the question as <lb/> closely as possible and I
                  intend no criticism <lb/> of those who preceded me or who take <lb/> different
                  views from those which I take. <lb/> The question itself is certainly an important
                  <lb/> one. The educational clauses, have been <lb/> the features of the Bill
                  principally debated. <lb/> These clauses are not the only nor may we <lb/> say the
                  principal item in the Bill. They <lb/> are, however, the features that have caused
                  <lb/> the greatest antagonism and discussion. In <lb/> itself the matter of
                  education does neces<lb break="no"/>sarily bring about friction of any kind. It
                  <lb/> so happens, however, that a portion of our <lb/> people have conscientious
                  views in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter of the necessity of associating religious
                  <lb/> teaching with the education of the young <lb/> and when that happens and it
                  will always <lb/> happen when a religious turn is given to any <lb/> question
                  there is the greatest necessity for <lb/> prudence and moderation of speech. Many
                  <lb/> gentlemen who have spoken in this debate <lb/> have been careful and
                  prudent. Some of <lb/> them I have admired very much; others <lb/> I am afraid
                  have handled the matter unwise<lb break="no"/>ly and in some cases if I may
                  proceed that <lb/> iength in criticism have handled it almost <lb/> recklessly. It
                  is unfortunate that this <lb/> should be the case, but I think that the con<lb
                     break="no"/>sensus of opinion is that when the matter <lb/> is handled with any
                  exaggeration of state<lb break="no"/>ment the intention of the member is lost,
                  <lb/> that is the effect of his argument is lost. <lb/> The occasion of this Bill
                  is certainly a <lb/> great event in the history of Canada, an <lb/> event which
                  you might almost call a na<lb break="no"/>tional epoch; we have reached a time in
                  <lb/> the history of our country when we can <lb/> carve out from these
                  Territories two large <lb/> and important provinces, and such an oc<lb break="no"
                  />casion ought to be one of great rejoicing. It <lb/> should be an occasion on
                  which we should <lb/> all unite together with pride in inaugur<lb break="no"
                  />ating these provinces ; it should be such an <lb/> occasion as one would have in
                  his family <lb/> say for the coming out party of a <lb/> daughter or a marriage or
                  the coming of <lb/> age of a son in whom he has pride, in whom <lb/> he has great
                  hope and confidence, and it is <lb/> natural on such an occasion that if it were
                  <lb/> at all possible all parties should unite to<lb break="no"/>gether in making
                  it an occasion in which <lb/> we can drop politics. Unfortunately this <lb/> event
                  has been marked by a good deal of <lb/> friction, especially over the educational
                  <lb/> clauses. In considering such an event it is <lb/> very natural that the mind
                  should be turn<lb break="no"/>ed to quite an extent to the progress of our <lb/>
                  country, that we should turn with pride to <lb/> the progress we have made, and
                  note how <lb/> rapidly we are progressing, note to what an <lb/> extent the
                  commerce and the population <lb/> of the country have grown, note especially <lb/>
                  as we listen to the speeches of the various <lb/> members in this debate the
                  unanimity with <lb/> which every man speaks with glowing con<lb break="no"
                  />fidence of the future of the country. There <lb/> is not and has not been a
                  pessimistic note <lb/> in regard to the future of our country dur<lb break="no"

                  <fw type="num">5182</fw>ing the whole of this discussion. The growth <lb/> of
                  Canada, while not always in the past <lb/> satisfactory, has of recent years been
                  quite <lb/> up to our expectations and fully warrants <lb/> all the optimism that
                  has been shown, and <lb/> we have not only grown in resources and <lb/>
                  population, but I think we have grown in <lb/> intellgence, in richness, and in
                  all other <lb/> marks of progress. And yet, as I consider <lb/> the treatment of
                  some public questions, it has <lb/> been a question in my mind whether with <lb/>
                  all that progress we have quite held our own <lb/> — I shall not say progressed —
                  but quite held <lb/> our own in matters requiring deliberation <lb/> and
                  self-restraint. Possibly it may be a <lb/> passing phase in our career, but I
                  regret <lb/> that at the moment there is some evidence <lb/> of at least a
                  standing still in that respect. <lb/> In a country like ours, that is new and
                  <lb/> young, that has immense territories, that has <lb/> a sparse population
                  spread over a great <lb/> area, it is exceedingly necessary that care <lb/> should
                  be used in all the legislation we <lb/> bring forward. The cohesion between the
                  <lb/> difierent portions of the country is not yet <lb/> strong ; the national
                  feeling has not grown <lb/> possibly, to the extent it should; we have <lb/> been
                  so busy in many other respects. Our <lb/> country is divided in various ways; we
                  <lb/> have in the east a fine set of provinces <lb/> speaking one language. They
                  are partially <lb/> divided from the next province by a ter<lb break="no"/>ritory
                  which possibly is not fertile or fit <lb/> for agriculture, and then we come to a
                     pro<lb break="no"/>vince in which another language is spoken. <lb/> Then we
                  pass on to Ontario and there again <lb/> we have the English language. Between
                  <lb/> Ontario and Manitoba there is a portion of <lb/> territory almost unsettled
                  and so we find <lb/> breaks as we continue through our country <lb/> and
                  necessarily that leads to a lack of co<lb break="no"/>hesion between the various
                  parts of it, and <lb/> it is necessary in all our legislation that we <lb/> should
                  be particularly careful to avoid any<lb break="no"/>thing that would break or
                  strain or separate. <lb/> This is particularly applicable to questions <lb/> of
                  the kind that is at present under dis<lb break="no"/>cussion. The educational
                  features of this Bill <lb/> are the ones that have aroused the greatest <lb/>
                  friction, but there are many other import<lb break="no"/>ant questions involved in
                  it and some of <lb/> them may have untoward results if they <lb/> are not
                  carefully handled. In all new pro<lb break="no"/>posals that come before one it is
                  natural <lb/> that some special features in them should <lb/> first take
                  pre-eminence, that you would first <lb/> find your mind coming to a decision on
                  <lb/> certain points, and this has been most strik<lb break="no"/>ingly so in the
                  consideration of this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. It sometimes happens that you find
                  <lb/> that the point on which you first come to a <lb/> decision is not the point
                  that you should <lb/> have first decided; the sequence is not <lb/> always of
                  importance. It was natural when <lb/> this Bill was brought in for the formation
                  <lb/> of two new provinces out of those Terri<lb break="no"/>tories that our minds
                  should revert to the <lb/> history of our country, to the time at which <lb/>
                  those lands became either in the union of <lb/>
                  <cb/> Canada or in the possession of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, which ever term one
                  may use, <lb/> to the years 1870 when, by a certain class <lb/> of purchase from
                  the Hudson Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany we obtained possession of them, not <lb/> I
                  think, as I have heard it stated, by a pur<lb break="no"/>chase of these lands
                  from the Hudson Bay <lb/> Company, but by the purchase of their <lb/> rights,
                  whatever they were, and by the <lb/> grant of that country from the Crown to <lb/>
                  Canada. That country contained a very <lb/> small population and, by the Act of
                  1871 we <lb/> were entrusted with the government of it. <lb/> In the Act, I think,
                  we will agree, that <lb/> while they were territories we were en<lb break="no"
                  />trusted with the power to govern them as <lb/> we saw fit. They were governed
                  under <lb/> that Act by a lieutenant governor and coun<lb break="no"/>cil. Later
                  on, when the population had <lb/> grown larger and when the needs of the <lb/>
                  country were greater, they were given a <lb/> certain amount of legislative
                  control of <lb/> their own affairs, and in the Mackenzie Act <lb/> of 1875. that
                  was carried to a considerable <lb/> extent, and they had, even before they be<lb
                     break="no"/>came a province, representatives and have <lb/> representatives in
                  this parliament. Under <lb/> the Act of 1875, a legislature with certain <lb/>
                  powers was created there and while full <lb/> powers were not given, comparatively
                  large <lb/> powers were given although certain limi<lb break="no"/>tations were
                  placed upon the powers <lb/> granted. Under that legislative power <lb/> these
                  Territories enacted certain ordinances <lb/> and among them were those relating to
                  <lb/> education, and it so happened that in the <lb/> Mackenzie Act there was a
                  specific refer<lb break="no"/>ence made to the privileges of minorities in <lb/>
                  regard to denominational schools and it <lb/> was under that that these schools
                  were <lb/> first established. Later on this legislature, <lb/> acting, perhaps,
                  not under the law of 1875, <lb/> but it seems to me rather acting beyond that
                  <lb/> law, or taking power not granted to them <lb/> by the law of 1875, passed
                  ordinances which <lb/> appeared to restrict the privileges given in <lb/> regard
                  to denominational schools in that <lb/> territory. Later on it made other changes
                  <lb/> and we find by the record that the Roman <lb/> Catholic minority in the
                  Territories made an <lb/> appeal to the government here at Ottawa, <lb/> of which
                  Sir John Thompson was then a <lb/> member, for redress or for the veto of those
                  <lb/> ordinances. This was not granted, but these <lb/> ordinances remained in
                  force and certain <lb/> regulations also passed by their educational <lb/>
                  council. That state of affairs has con<lb break="no"/>tinued down to the present
                  time. We are <lb/> told that on the whole these ordinances have <lb/> been fairly
                  acceptable. We realize, how<lb break="no"/>ever, that the Law of 1875 has not been
                  <lb/> fully carried out by the ordinances and <lb/> the regulations now in force.
                  We realize <lb/> also that we cannot say positively that the <lb/> schools or the
                  educational regulations are <lb/> entirely acceptable to the Roman Catholic <lb/>
                  minority in these Territories. But such of <lb/> the privileges as under the law
                  of 1875 and <lb/> these ordinances and regulations have re<lb break="no"/><pb

                  and made with great <lb/> force and I think with a force that should <lb/> be
                  given proper consideration that it is im<lb break="no"/>possible to grant
                  privileges of this kind, to <lb/> allow them to remain in force for many
                  <lb/>years, to allow the people in the country <lb/>to grow up with them and then
                  to arbitra<lb break="no"/>rily or unnecessarily remove them without <lb/>grave
                  cause. I know that it is claimed that <lb/>the law of 1875 was a temporary law,
                  that <lb/>it could have been abrogated or repealed by <lb/>this parliament at any
                  time and that this <lb/>parliament could do so to-day. That is true, <lb/>but this
                  parliament has not done so and <lb/>the law has remained in force. I know also
                  <lb/>that it is impossible to bind future genera<lb break="no"/>tions by an Act of
                  the present. I know <lb/>that the present generation, if it found any <lb/>special
                  law or even bargain, passed by our <lb/>great grandfathers, to be particularly
                     irk<lb break="no"/>some would feel bound to honour it. <lb/>If it had to be so,
                  if we were positively <lb/>bound by every bargain. possibly entered <lb/>into in
                  good faith by our great grand<lb break="no"/>fathers. there would be no progress
                  made in <lb/>this world, nothing could be changed. But <lb/>on the present
                  occasion, I do not feel that <lb/>there have been any special changes in the
                  <lb/>situation that would warrant us in depart<lb break="no"/>ing from the policy
                  which has been followed <lb/>in the past in regard to the privileges of the
                  <lb/>minority in the Northwest Territories. I <lb/>feel that if I were in a
                  legislative body that <lb/>was properly empowered to deal with the <lb/>matter and
                  I felt assured of the power of <lb/>that legislative body to deal with it, and
                  <lb/>this question coming before me, it would <lb/>be impossible to pass over the
                  vested rights, <lb/>if I may call them so, and the customs of <lb/>thirty years
                  unless there could be shown <lb/>the very gravest reasons of state for doing
                  <lb/>so. I was interested a short time ago in a <lb/>discussion which I had with a
                  Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic friend in regard to these schools, to <lb/>hear him
                  say that although there had been <lb/>a great deal of legislation from time to
                  time <lb/>and although apparently privileges were <lb/>given to Roman Catholic
                  minorities in re<lb break="no"/>gard to schools they had failed to get what
                  <lb/>they expected or what they thought the <lb/>law gave them and that it was the
                  shadow <lb/>and not the substance which they had ob<lb break="no"/>tained. I was
                  rather surprised at that de<lb break="no"/>claration and I endeavoured to look
                  into <lb/>the events in regard to education in the var<lb break="no"/>ious
                  provinces and see if they would sub<lb break="no"/>stantiate it. In looking over
                  the legisla<lb break="no"/>tion in regard to education, first, in the pro<lb
                     break="no"/>vince of Ontario, I felt that the claim was <lb/>not a good one. In
                  the province of Ontario <lb/>I believe that the compact of confederation <lb/>in
                  regard to separate schools has been hon<lb break="no"/>ourably kept. More than
                  that I find that <lb/>the law in that respect has been amended in <lb/>such a way
                  as to increase the usefulness <lb/>and proper working of the Act in regard to
                  <lb/>separate schools. When I look into the <lb/>Question as it affects the
                  province of Que<lb break="no"/><cb/>bec, and when I listened to speeches such as
                  <lb/> we have heard from the hon. Minister of <lb/> Agriculture (Mr. Fisher) and
                  others, I real<lb break="no"/>ize that the compact there has been hon<lb
                     break="no"/>ourably kept in regard to minorities. When <lb/> I look into the
                  question in regard to the <lb/> provinces of New Brunswick and Nova <lb/> Scotia,
                  in which no special provision had <lb/> been made and in which at one time there
                  <lb/> appeared to have been a little friction I <lb/> realize that a modus vivendi
                  has been <lb/> found, that, as far as we can judge is satis<lb break="no"/>factory
                  ; so that in all these provinces <lb/> there appears to be no ground for this
                     com<lb break="no"/>plaint that I refer to. But, when I come to <lb/> Manitoba
                  and the west the question takes <lb/> on a different appearance. Our Roman Ca<lb
                     break="no"/>tholic friends claims, and I am afraid they <lb/> claim with a
                  considerable amount of force, <lb/> that they have not received entirely what
                  <lb/> they are entitled to, and I cannot say that <lb/> the record in the province
                  is satisfactory in <lb/> regard to the form assumed by the legisla<lb break="no"
                  />tion, or in regard to the reasonable way in <lb/> which the legislation has been
                  introduced, <lb/> or in regard to the way in which the com<lb break="no"/>pacts of
                  legislation have been adhered to. <lb/> And when I come to the Northwest Terri<lb
                     break="no"/>tories that are in question now and consider <lb/> the privileges
                  given by the law of 1875 and <lb/> the infringements, if I may call them so. <lb/>
                  of these privileges by the later ordinances, I <lb/> say again there is some
                  ground for the com<lb break="no"/>plaint. In the consideration of the ques<lb
                     break="no"/>tion it struck me that there is a reason and <lb/> that reason. I
                  think, is largely found in this <lb/> fact that the provinces coming together and
                  <lb/> specifically entering into a bargain as pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, knowing
                  what they had to do, have <lb/> honourably kept that bargain, but when you <lb/>
                  come to provinces such as Manitoba and the <lb/> Territories of the Northwest who,
                     them<lb break="no"/>selves, have not been parties to the bargain, <lb/> and who
                  have been legislated for rather <lb/> than legislating for themselves, there is a
                  <lb/> difference in their attitude. There is an <lb/> antagonism against any
                  restraints we may <lb/> put upon them, and I think in the very <lb/> action of
                  this province and these Territo<lb break="no"/>ries, there is a warning to us as
                  to the <lb/> manner in which we shall be wise to deal <lb/> with them and with
                  this question. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     When this Bill was first brought forward 
     <lb/>
     in the very able speech by the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister, I thought possibly from the remarks 
     <lb/>
     of the leader of the opposition that it might 
     <lb/>
     not lead to much political antagonism, but 
     <lb/>
     that hope was not borne out by subsequent 
     <lb/>
     happenings. Some striking events followed 
     <lb/>
     the introduction of the Bill. There was in 
     <lb/>
     a portion of our country quite an agitation 
     <lb/>
     against it, and perhaps the most remark<lb break="no"/>able thing that happened was the resigna<lb break="no"/>tion of the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton) on account of his objection to the 
     <lb/>
     first draft of the Bill. That was even a 
     <lb/>
     more marked event than would have 
     <lb/>
     been on the resignation of some other 
     <lb/>
     member of the government, because of Mr. 
     <lb/>
            <pb n="5185" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5185.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5185</fw>
            <fw type="dateline">MAY 1, 1905</fw>
            <fw type="num">5186</fw>
           
     Sifton's close connection with the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and his previous record on educa<lb break="no"/>tional matters in that part of the country. 
     <lb/>
     Naturally we watched events with a very 
     <lb/>
     great deal of interest indeed, and I have 
     <lb/>
     been almost amused at the reasons ad<lb break="no"/>vanced by many Conservative speakers for 
     <lb/>
     that resignation; reasons which showed a 
     <lb/>
     very great versatility of imagination. We 
     <lb/>
     were even told by these gentlemen that the 
     <lb/>
     whole matter of the resignation and of his 
     <lb/>
     ultimate support of the Bill was prear<lb break="no"/>ranged for effect. I cannot conceive that 
     <lb/>
     this could possibly have been the case, but 
     <lb/>
     it did strike me that if these gentlemen had 
     <lb/>
     said that the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton), who very naturally was interested 
     <lb/>
     in that country and who had done much to 
     <lb/>
     encourage large immigration into it, had 
     <lb/>
     taken the course he did with the object of 
     <lb/>
     advertising that country, these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     might have been using their imagination 
     <lb/>
     very freely, but they would have recognized 
     <lb/>
     at all events the result that has actually 
     <lb/>
     occurred. One thing at least has come out 
     <lb/>
     of this unfortunate trouble and that is, that 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces have had a more mag<lb break="no"/>nificent series of advertisements than any 
     <lb/>
     part of Canada has ever had before. Every 
     <lb/>
     hon. member who has spoken has dwelt on 
     <lb/>
     the magnificent resources of that territory, 
     <lb/>
     its scope for development and progress, and 
     <lb/>
     out of our tribulation has resulted this good, 
     <lb/>
     that the minds and thoughts of all people 
     <lb/>
     will be directed towards the development 
     <lb/>
     of this rich portion of our heritage. But, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, while the resignation of the minister 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton) caused us anxiety we still were 
     <lb/>
     in hopes that some means would be found 
     <lb/>
     by which the apparent divergent interests 
     <lb/>
     would come together. I do not say that we 
     <lb/>
     felt that the decision on this question must 
     <lb/>
     stand between the ex-minister and the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and that we must not think for 
     <lb/>
     ourselves, but it was very natural that we 
     <lb/>
     should consider that the minister (Mr. Sif<lb break="no"/>ton represented very largely one view, and 
     <lb/>
     that the government represented the other. 
     <lb/>
     And so, Sir, we waited for the outcome. 
     <lb/>
     At that time I presume the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton) did not stand alone, but that 
     <lb/>
     there were many other Liberals who felt 
     <lb/>
     more or less doubtful about the Bill, or 
     <lb/>
     possibly who were not sure as to the ex<lb break="no"/>tent to which it went in giving privileges 
     <lb/>
     to the minority. I may say that at that 
     <lb/>
     time in whatever opposition I myself felt 
     <lb/>
     towards the Bill I did not feel so much 
     <lb/>
     alone among the Liberal members as I do 
     <lb/>
     to-night. My misfortune is that in the 
     <lb/>
     changes that have been made the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has rather pleased those who felt with 
     <lb/>
     the ex-Minister of the Interior and has over<lb break="no"/>looked that particular obiection that stands 
     <lb/>
     in my way. However, Sir, I listened with 
     <lb/>
     great interest to the explanation made by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman (Mr. Sifton) when he 
     <lb/>
     eventually supported the amended Bill and 
     <lb/>
     I have listened with great interest to the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     various speeches of members from the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest with regard to the character 
     <lb/>
     of the schools. I will not take up the time 
     <lb/>
     of the House in reading extracts from their 
     <lb/>
     speeches, although I had thought of doing 
     <lb/>
     so, but you will all agree with me that 
     <lb/>
     their speeches as a rule pointed out how 
     <lb/>
     almost completely national these schools 
     <lb/>
     were and how exceedingly limited was the 
     <lb/>
     time devoted to religious training, or, if I 
     <lb/>
     may put it in another way, how exceedingly   
     <lb/>
     small were the privileges granted to the 
     <lb/>
     minority. I am not exaggerating when I 
     <lb/>
     say that this was the general colouring of 
     <lb/>
     the speeches delivered along that line, and 
     <lb/>
     indeed I may say that from the evidence 
     <lb/>
     presented it does appear to me that they 
     <lb/>
     are very largely national schools, and that 
     <lb/>
     the amount of religious teaching that is 
     <lb/>
     available in the last half hour is not very 
     <lb/>
     great. As I listened to very many of these 
     <lb/>
     speeches I could not but think again of my 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic friend, of whom I have 
     <lb/>
     already spoken, and whether after all it 
     <lb/>
     was not the shadow rather than the sub<lb break="no"/>stance which the Roman Catholics were get<lb break="no"/>ting. I would rather think that the claim 
     <lb/>
     in support of this Bill should be based, as 
     <lb/>
     it is based of course in part, on the actual 
     <lb/>
     justice of the case rather than on the 
     <lb/>
     small amount of the privilege given. Of 
     <lb/>
     course I realize that one must take some 
     <lb/>
     of these speeches with a proper degree of 
     <lb/>
     care. We know that in all bargains, if you 
     <lb/>
     listen to the conversation, you will think 
     <lb/>
     that the man who is buying is not getting 
     <lb/>
     very much, and yet he eventually buys. So 
     <lb/>
     it is like that in this case, as in the case 
     <lb/>
     spoken of in the good book in which we 
     <lb/>
     read of the bargainer: it is naught; it is 
     <lb/>
     naught saith the buyer and when he goeth 
     <lb/>
     his way he boasteth. And so I am afraid 
     <lb/>
     that in this case the parties on the one side 
     <lb/>
     speak to a certain audience and the parties 
     <lb/>
     on the other side speak to another audience. 
     <lb/>
     But if the settlement itself is good that 
     <lb/>
     would be satisfactory, and if the people 
     <lb/>
     who make the settlement have the right to 
     <lb/>
     do so that would be also satisfactory. The 
     <lb/>
     more the hon. gentlemen minimize the privi<lb break="no"/>leges that are given to the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     minority in these schools, the loss interest 
     <lb/>
     would there appear to he to take any risk 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the constitutionality of the 
     <lb/>
     proceeding. Personally I have no desire to 
     <lb/>
     accept the present Bill just because it gives 
     <lb/>
     little to the Roman Catholic minority. If 
     <lb/>
     the present arrangement is a compromise 
     <lb/>
     which gives justice that would be well, for 
     <lb/>
     a compromise is not necessarily wrong so 
     <lb/>
     long as it is not an actual compromise of 
     <lb/>
     principle. However, it is necessary that the 
     <lb/>
     proper people should enter into a com<lb break="no"/>promise, or do whatever justice may be 
     <lb/>
     necessary. In this case we do not positive<lb break="no"/>ly know that this Bill is acceptable to all. 
     <lb/>
     We find at least that the Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic archbishop, who is nearest, as I under<lb break="no"/>stand, to that portion of the country, objects 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="5187" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5187.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5187</fw>
               <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>
            <fw type="num">5188</fw>
            
     that sufficient is not given to his people, 
     <lb/>
     and in this case we do not know who, in 
     <lb/>
     the negotiations that went forward, repre<lb break="no"/>sented the Roman Catholic people. If we 
     <lb/>
     are going to do justice we should be sure 
     <lb/>
     indeed that we have the right to do it. We 
     <lb/>
     may go abroad and see a quarrel between 
     <lb/>
     two persons on the street and we may ac<lb break="no"/>tually know what is the right settlement 
     <lb/>
     between them, but it does not necessarily 
     <lb/>
     follow we are empowered to enforce that 
     <lb/>
     settlement. We must be sure not only that 
     <lb/>
     our settlement is just, but we must be also 
     <lb/>
     sure that we are the right authority to make 
     <lb/>
     that settlement. And when we consider 
     <lb/>
     that phase of the question it brings us up 
     <lb/>
     against a fact we must all realize: that 
     <lb/>
     there is a constitutional and a legal feature 
     <lb/>
     of this question that has to be settled be<lb break="no"/>fore we determine whether a particular com<lb break="no"/>promise is a fair and just one and should 
     <lb/>
     be enforced. We must know that we are 
     <lb/>
     properly empowered to make that com<lb break="no"/>promise, to make that settlement and to 
     <lb/>
     pass an enactment legalizing it. Other ques<lb break="no"/>tions such as the merits of the schools 
     <lb/>
     and the justice of the settlement may fol<lb break="no"/>low. I claim that it is not quibbling on 
     <lb/>
     a point of law to say that it is essential in 
     <lb/>
     this case to know that we should be first 
     <lb/>
     sure of our ground ; that we should be first 
     <lb/>
     sure we are actually on the rock of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution before we undertake to pass a law 
     <lb/>
     of this kind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not enough to say that the end will 
     <lb/>
     justify the means. that the settlement we 
     <lb/>
     believe is just, and therefore we will put it 
     <lb/>
     through in any case. I am not afraid to 
     <lb/>
     face the constitution lest it should give more 
     <lb/>
     to Roman Catholic minorities than the 
     <lb/>
     present Bill. To say to me that the Bill 
     <lb/>
     gives little to Roman Catholic minorities is 
     <lb/>
     not in itself a recommendation. I am not 
     <lb/>
     seeking to find how little I can give to the 
     <lb/>
     minority in this case, but I am urging on the 
     <lb/>
     government the desirability of ascertaining 
     <lb/>
     exactly what the constitution does give. If 
     <lb/>
     the constitution itself, according to the 
     <lb/>
     decision of the courts should give more to 
     <lb/>
     the minority than the present Bill gives 
     <lb/>
     why should we seek to deny that to them ? 
     <lb/>
     If it should be found that, owing to the 
     <lb/>
     special circumstances of the case the con<lb break="no"/>stitution did not apply, and that possibly 
     <lb/>
     nothing was given to the minority, then 
     <lb/>
     would be the time for us, or whatever body 
     <lb/>
     was properly constituted to consider what 
     <lb/>
     the merits and the justice of the case might 
     <lb/>
     demand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What is this constitution, then, which I 
     <lb/>
     claim should govern in the case, and not 
     <lb/>
     merely our ideas of what is abstract justice? 
     <lb/>
     It is embodied in the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Acts from 1867 to 1886, and when one up 
     <lb/>
     proaches that constitution at the present 
     <lb/>
               time. he finds the path very well worn in<lb break="no"/>deed by those who have recently been there. 
     <lb/>
     Those old Acts have been awakened from 
     <lb/>
     their slumbers in the library, and have been 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
          
     brought forward at the most unexpected 
     <lb/>
     moments. And what do the seekers get ? 
     <lb/>
     Very often they simply get what they go to 
     <lb/>
     seek for, and they only bring away, I am 
     <lb/>
     afraid, what suits or pleases them. There is 
     <lb/>
     in them very much of what is definite for 
     <lb/>
     the provinces that entered into the confeder<lb break="no"/>ation compact, but there is a lack of definite<lb break="no"/>ness for territories which are to be made 
     <lb/>
     into provinces. As a layman approaches the 
     <lb/>
     constitution, the natural question he asks 
     <lb/>
     himself is what should be his attitude and 
     <lb/>
     what is his duty under such circumstances ? 
     <lb/>
     When he is brought face to face with legal 
     <lb/>
     and constitutional questions in this House, 
     <lb/>
     and when these questions have, as he be<lb break="no"/>lieves, to be decided upon before he can 
     <lb/>
     proceed to decide on other or further stops, 
     <lb/>
     it is very natural that he should hesitate, 
     <lb/>
     that he should approach these questions with 
     <lb/>
     diffidence. He realizes that he is untrained 
     <lb/>
     in that class of work ; he realizes that he 
     <lb/>
     does not know the law, that he does not 
     <lb/>
     know where the law is, that he does not 
     <lb/>
     know whether he has the whole of the law 
     <lb/>
     or not when he reaches it. He knows that 
     <lb/>
     in all lines of work practice makes perfect, 
     <lb/>
     and he lacks practice. But he knows also 
     <lb/>
     that he has to make a decision of some 
     <lb/>
     kind ; he has either to make a decision of 
     <lb/>
     his own, or he has to entrust that decision to 
     <lb/>
     some one else ; and if there is one fault more 
     <lb/>
     than another that has in this country been 
     <lb/>
     found with politicians, I think it is that in<lb break="no"/>stead of trying to decide for themselves, they 
     <lb/>
     have always allowed their party leaders to 
     <lb/>
     do the thinking for them. It may be that, 
     <lb/>
     with the greater wisdom and ability of that 
     <lb/>
     party leader, that is a wise course, but it 
     <lb/>
     is one that is open to reproach. However, 
     <lb/>
     while all that is true with regard to the lay<lb break="no"/>men, it is also true that there are certain 
     <lb/>
     advantages that come to him in the consider<lb break="no"/>ation of such a question. It is usually con<lb break="no"/>ceded by the legal men that the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     layman has suflicient intelligence to grasp a 
     <lb/>
     legal point if it is properly explained to him ; 
     <lb/>
     and in this case we have not only the ex<lb break="no"/>planation, but we have a full and able de<lb break="no"/>bate from the legal men in this House. We 
     <lb/>
     have their views on every point argued out 
     <lb/>
     very carefully. We have not only the law 
     <lb/>
     supplied to us, but we have all the law. We 
     <lb/>
     do not need to ask, is there any more that 
     <lb/>
     is not quoted to us ? We find that these 
     <lb/>
     Acts are in the language which we speak. 
     <lb/>
     When we examine them, we find that they 
     <lb/>
     are not highly technical in their wording, 
     <lb/>
     and as we read we realize that there has 
     <lb/>
     been an intention to make them clear. In 
     <lb/>
     addition, there is the fact that we are forced 
     <lb/>
     to judge in the case. and, as far as the law 
     <lb/>
     will allow, to make a decision. We cannot 
     <lb/>
     depute that duty to any one else. I may also 
     <lb/>
     say, as an encouragement to any Liberal 
     <lb/>
     who chooses to think for himself in the case, 
     <lb/>
     that we have a good example before US. In 
     <lb/>
     the year 1896 the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     undertook in a wonderful manner the study 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="5189" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5189.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5189</fw>
               <fw type="dateline"> MAY 1, 1905</fw> 
            <fw type="num">5190</fw>
          
     of constitutional law. The Liberal party as 
     <lb/>
     a whole studied very carefully indeed, not 
     <lb/>
     only constitutional law generally, but con<lb break="no"/>stitutional law as it related to education in 
     <lb/>
     provinces. They studied and discussed and 
     <lb/>
     debated, and formed very strong opinions on 
     <lb/>
     that question ; and I may say that my own 
     <lb/>
     feelings and views on that question to-night 
     <lb/>
     are largely coloured by the debates and the 
     <lb/>
     feeling of that time. I have noticed also 
     <lb/>
     that the speakers who have discussed this 
     <lb/>
     matter, the laymen if not the legal men, 
     <lb/>
     have announced that they had no intention 
     <lb/>
     of discussing the legal question; and yet 
     <lb/>
     they have not been speaking for more than 
     <lb/>
     ten or fifteen minutes before they have been 
     <lb/>
     led into the temptation, and have been dis<lb break="no"/>cussing the constitutional features of the 
     <lb/>
     question. While the legal question is dis<lb break="no"/>cussed by legal men, we laymen have also 
     <lb/>
     to consider it as judges. We do not ap<lb break="no"/>proach the matter as advocates but rather 
     <lb/>
     as jurymen, and we have the benefit, in all 
     <lb/>
     the arguments which have been presented 
     <lb/>
     by the legal men, of what I may call pre- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     digested food. I may say also that if legal 
     <lb/>
     minds only are capable of arguing and de<lb break="no"/>bating and coming to a decision on these 
     <lb/>
     questions, it naturally follows that they will 
     <lb/>
     reach the same conclusion; and yet in this 
     <lb/>
     instance we find legal men differing just 
     <lb/>
     as much as laymen could possibly differ. 
     <lb/>
     So that there is no absolute certainty of a 
     <lb/>
     proper result from the fact that legal men 
     <lb/>
     happen to be arguing the case. However, it 
     <lb/>
     is not a matter of preference on the part of 
     <lb/>
     laymen. I myself would have preferred 
     <lb/>
     very much if this matter had not been left 
     <lb/>
     to a decision in this way. I would have pre<lb break="no"/>ferred that a decision of the courts on these 
     <lb/>
     questions had been obtained before the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment proceeded to act. I would not 
     <lb/>
     claim that a decision of the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     would be necessarily better than a decision 
     <lb/>
     of this government or of the Supreme Court 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. But it would be a decision of 
     <lb/>
     the final court of appeal, and it would be 
     <lb/>
     acceptable even by those who did not favour 
     <lb/>
     it, and action based on a decision of that 
     <lb/>
     kind would not be attacked—those attacking 
     <lb/>
     it would be undermined by the very quota<lb break="no"/>tion of such a decision. I regret exceedingly 
     <lb/>
     that before this legislation was introduced 
     <lb/>
     such a decision was not obtained. To as<lb break="no"/>sume that we have the power to act is, I 
     <lb/>
     think, unwise in the face of the opposition; 
     <lb/>
     but if we are forced to face it, where then 
     <lb/>
     does the battle lie ? We can trust the legal 
     <lb/>
     men at least to produce everything in that 
     <lb/>
     way. We have sections 93 and 146 of the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1867 brought forward ; we have the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Acts of 1871 and 1886 and the Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie Act of 1875 ; we have the ordinances 
     <lb/>
     and the regulations : and we have such ques<lb break="no"/>tions as: does section 93 act automatically, 
     <lb/>
     and if so when ? Has it been modified, and 
     <lb/>
     if so, what is the date of the modification ? 
     <lb/>
     Has this parliament power to act, and if so, 
     <lb/>
     how is it to exercise that power, and must 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     it exercise it ? We have also the fact that 
     <lb/>
     almost all the speakers declare that they 
     <lb/>
     are on the ground of the constitution, a very 
     <lb/>
     good place indeed to be ; and I must believe 
     <lb/>
     that the Act of 1867 is the real rock of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution, that.wherever it is applicable 
     <lb/>
     it should be the foundation, that at all events 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of the Act of 1867 is actually the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the confederation of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     which make up this Dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Act of 1867 was a special bargain 
     <lb/>
     between certain provinces which came to<lb break="no"/>gether to form confederation; and like all 
     <lb/>
     bargains it was made with an eye to the 
     <lb/>
     special circumstances immediately before 
     <lb/>
     them, each province looking to its own par<lb break="no"/>ticular interests and safeguarding what it 
     <lb/>
     valued the most—refusing to concede any<lb break="no"/>thing likely to injure it. When this bargain 
     <lb/>
     was completed, then—and then only—was 
     <lb/>
     provision made for future additions to con<lb break="no"/>federation—for the addition of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, British Columbia, Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land, Ruperts Land, and the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. They did not make a very specific 
     <lb/>
     provision for these additions. They 
     <lb/>
     saw that they might come. They knew the 
     <lb/>
     bargain that they had made for themselves, 
     <lb/>
     and they thought it would be sufficient to 
     <lb/>
     provide that any additions of these other 
     <lb/>
     provinces and Territories would be subject 
     <lb/>
     to the provisions of the Act they had 
     <lb/>
     agreed to. That, I think was the whole 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the Act. I doubt if any one of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces would have gone into con<lb break="no"/>federation had they been told: We will 
     <lb/>
     make this bargain with you to-day as it 
     <lb/>
     stands, but we may to-morrow introduce 
     <lb/>
     another element into confederation and 
     <lb/>
     deal with it in an entirely different manner 
     <lb/>
     and spirit. They evidently considered that 
     <lb/>
     the provision ' subject to the provisions of 
     <lb/>
     this Act' was to be the spirit which would 
     <lb/>
     govern all future additions to confederation. 
     <lb/>
     It is not likely that the different parties 
     <lb/>
     then entering confederation had any spe<lb break="no"/>cific thought in their minds of a territorial 
     <lb/>
     form of government in any part of the coun<lb break="no"/>try before it became a province. That is 
     <lb/>
     one of the misfortunes in the case. The 
     <lb/>
     law itself is, I think, a very creditable law 
     <lb/>
     for the purposes which they had in view; 
     <lb/>
     but like all other laws, it will not at all 
     <lb/>
     suit other circumstances and conditions to 
     <lb/>
     the same extent, and it is but imperfectly 
     <lb/>
     fitted to the present set of circumstances. 
     <lb/>
     The trouble with us now is that we are 
     <lb/>
     literally trying to bring into this law certain 
     <lb/>
     meanings and applications that perhaps 
     <lb/>
     were not foreseen or intended at all ; and it 
     <lb/>
     is probably a defect of the legal mind that 
     <lb/>
     it insists that because this is the law it 
     <lb/>
     must be made applicable in some way. It 
     <lb/>
     might easily happen that such a law will 
     <lb/>
     not in any one case fit the circumstances. 
     <lb/>
     The first question we have to decide is   
     <lb/>
     whether this parliament has the requisite 
     <lb/>
     authority to pass such a law. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion may afterwards follow : Is it impera<lb break="no"/><pb n="5191" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5191.jpg"/><fw type="num">5191</fw><fw type="num">COMMONS</fw><fw type="num">5192</fw>tive on us to pass it ? It is evidently con<lb break="no"/>ceded that if this parliament has the power 
     <lb/>
     to adopt such a law, it it has the power to 
     <lb/>
     enact these educational clauses, that power 
     <lb/>
     mustbe found either in section 146 of the 
     <lb/>
     Act or 1867 or section 2 of the Act of 1871. 
     <lb/>
     Section 146 of the Act of 1867, which has 
     <lb/>
     been so often quoted, I may take the liberty 
     <lb/>
     of quoting again:

            <p>
     It seems to me that while this is not very 
     <lb/>
     definite with regard to the procedure, the 
     <lb/>
     words 'subject to the provisions of this. 
     <lb/>
     Act ' shows so clearly the intent that in all 
     <lb/>
     future considerations they should not be 
     <lb/>
     forgotten or overlooked. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     that in any future or subsequent additions 
     <lb/>
     to confederation, it was intended or ex<lb break="no"/>pected that a new or different class of bar<lb break="no"/>gain, a new or different class of constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, should be given, compared with what 
     <lb/>
     the different provinces confederated had at 
     <lb/>
     that time. That is strongly impressed on 
     <lb/>
     my view. Of course I know it is open to 
     <lb/>
     discussion, and other clauses come in that 
     <lb/>
     must be considered. Section 2 of the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1871, which is known to you all as probably 
     <lb/>
     the main clause and which is regarded as 
     <lb/>
     giving the powers to enact the present edu<lb break="no"/>cational clauses of the Bill before us, reads 
     <lb/>
     as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     This is the clause upon which those who 
     <lb/>
     favour the present Bill, on constitutional 
     <lb/>
     grounds base their claim as to the power 
     <lb/>
     of this parliament to enact ; and there is no 
     <lb/>
     doubt that, looking at it in a certain way 
     <lb/>
     and from a certain standpoint, it is possible 
     <lb/>
     to read such a power within it. We have 
     <lb/>
     very different opinions, however, given by 
     <lb/>
     very able men upon that question. I shall 
     <lb/>
     not read them at length, but we have the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of Sir Louis Davies which does not 
     <lb/>
           

    
            <cb/>
           
     concede that power as being granted by 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of the Act of 1871. We have the 
     <lb/>
     same opinion given by the late Mr. Justice 
     <lb/>
     Mills, of the Supreme Court, and we have a 
     <lb/>
     contrary one from the late Sir John Thomp<lb break="no"/>son. All these are interesting and valuable ; 
     <lb/>
     but considering the circumstances under 
     <lb/>
     which they were delivered, I do not think 
     <lb/>
     we can consider them as specifically definite 
     <lb/>
     or convincing. They were very likely poli<lb break="no"/>tical arguments delivered in the course of 
     <lb/>
     political speeches and not possibly evi<lb break="no"/>dencing as much care as had been recently 
     <lb/>
     given this question. We have likewise opi<lb break="no"/>nions from very able men indeed at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time. The Prime Minister of this coun<lb break="no"/>try no doubt thinks that the Dominion par<lb break="no"/>liament has the power, under this section of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act of 1871, and 
     <lb/>
     should exercise it, or he would not have sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to us the measure we are now con<lb break="no"/>sidering. The ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton) thinks also the Dominion has 
     <lb/>
     the power, but he prefers that we should 
     <lb/>
     not use it. He thinks it should be left to 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces ; and he suggests that, 
     <lb/>
     in the event of our using it, it would be well 
     <lb/>
     to get a confirming Act. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) thinks this 
     <lb/>
     parliament has only the power to create a 
     <lb/>
     province or call it into existence and to 
     <lb/>
     enact all the necessary details in that con<lb break="no"/>nection, and that after our powers in that 
     <lb/>
     respect are fully exercised, the province 
     <lb/>
     comes automatically under the control, of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act of 1867. We 
     <lb/>
     find further that that very able lawyer, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Christopher Robinson, is doubtful whether 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion has the power. We find the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition saying that we have 
     <lb/>
     no constitutional authority to pass the edu<lb break="no"/>cational clauses. All these conclusions are 
     <lb/>
     arrived at from consideration of the same 
     <lb/>
     clause, and no doubt all these men have 
     <lb/>
     conscientiously come to these different con<lb break="no"/>clusions through a desire to arrive at what 
     <lb/>
     is true and correct in the case. If that be 
     <lb/>
     so, it necessarily causes some anxiety to 
     <lb/>
     one who approaches the question for him<lb break="no"/>self. I have watched with some interest 
     <lb/>
     the methods by which, as far as I can judge, 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen arrived at their conclusions. 
     <lb/>
     If there be anything specially legal or con<lb break="no"/>stitutional in their methods that is shut out 
     <lb/>
     from ordinary laymen, then we must leave 
     <lb/>
     the question entirely to these legal gentle<lb break="no"/>men. We admire and cannot equal their 
     <lb/>
     very skilful method of presenting their 
     <lb/>
     arguments, but as far as I have been able to 
     <lb/>
     judge their methods of interpretation, I 
     <lb/>
     find they make selection of clauses hear<lb break="no"/>ing on the subject, I find that each one 
     <lb/>
     groups together the features that bear out 
     <lb/>
     his contention and draws comparison be<lb break="no"/>tween the importance of those features and 
     <lb/>
     others that are antagonistic to it. There 
     <lb/>
     is a certain amount of inquiry as to the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the law there is an examination of 
     <lb/>
     certain words and phrases, and an examina<lb break="no"/><pb n="5193" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5193.jpg"/><fw type="num">5193</fw><fw type="dateline">MAY 1, 1905</fw><fw type="num">5194</fw>tion of the special circumstances of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent case and how far the law is applicable 
     <lb/>
     to them, and if I may say it without offence, 
     <lb/>
     there is alway an appearance of wisdom, 
     <lb/>
     and an impressive appearance of impartial<lb break="no"/>ity. Then while you are still waiting to 
     <lb/>
     see the constltutional or mental machinery 
     <lb/>
     put to work, there is suddenly the announ<lb break="no"/>cement of a decision which is usually pre<lb break="no"/>faced by 'It seems to me,' 'I am of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion,' or ' There is no doubt.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, while one has been waiting for 
     <lb/>
     something mysterious in the manner of 
     <lb/>
     reaching this decision, I think it is abund<lb break="no"/>antly evident that the methods by which 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen reach their decision is just 
     <lb/>
     the ordinary mental process by which 
     <lb/>
     one would reach a decision on such points. 
     <lb/>
     I say there is nothing mysterious, there is 
     <lb/>
     nothing that, when properly explained, a 
     <lb/>
     business man or a literary man who is ac<lb break="no"/>customed to measure and weigh the mean<lb break="no"/>ing of words, could not understand and 
     <lb/>
     reach a decision upon although he could 
     <lb/>
     not put the argument with the skill of 
     <lb/>
     the lawyer. I find, however, nothing un<lb break="no"/>usual in the manner in which they reach 
     <lb/>
     these decisions, and we have not found 
     <lb/>
     cases cited, or judgments or precedents 
     <lb/>
     cited. Acting in that way, and after listen<lb break="no"/>ing carefully to the debate, one naturally 
     <lb/>
     reaches conclusions of his own. Acting so 
     <lb/>
     far as possible as a juror and not as an 
     <lb/>
     advocate, I must say that I cannot follow 
     <lb/>
     those who find in section 2 of the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1871 plenary power to do any thing in 
     <lb/>
     making a constitution Without having re<lb break="no"/>gard to the circumstances in that country. 
     <lb/>
     I cannot conceive that it is the intent and 
     <lb/>
     purpose, the spirit of the Act, that this 
     <lb/>
     parliament should be allowed entirely to 
     <lb/>
     abrogate the law of 1867, as they would 
     <lb/>
     be capable of doing, or that they should 
     <lb/>
     make any kind of a constitution different 
     <lb/>
     from that proposed by the Act of 1867. 
     <lb/>
     They might if possessed of plenary power 
     <lb/>
     establish an autocracy, they might make 
     <lb/>
     a government up there under one man. 
     <lb/>
     It has been said that there is some in<lb break="no"/>definite kind of an obligation, that the 
     <lb/>
     constitution must be in some way ana<lb break="no"/>logous to that of other provinces. As you 
     <lb/>
     have plenary power, then you may do as 
     <lb/>
     you like, and if plenary power had been 
     <lb/>
     intended, I think it would have been put 
     <lb/>
     in very much more explicit language than 
     <lb/>
     it is put in this section. If it had been in<lb break="no"/>tended, it could have been put in such a 
     <lb/>
     way that we would not have required all 
     <lb/>
     this argument to prove it. For myself I 
     <lb/>
     have been unable to accept the reasoning 
     <lb/>
     of those who claim that section 2 of the 
     <lb/>
     Act, 1871, gives this plenary power. If I 
     <lb/>
     could, I would not be at a loss as to my 
     <lb/>
     position on this question. If I felt that plen<lb break="no"/>ary power existed in section 2 of 
     <lb/>
     1871, I would heartily support the present 
     <lb/>
     Bill. But after looking at section 2 of 1871. 
     <lb/>
     listening to all these arguments, considering 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
    
     it from all the points of view from which 
     <lb/>
     it has been presented and reading it in con<lb break="no"/>nection with 146 and 93, I feel it is utterly 
     <lb/>
     impossible for me to support that contention. 
     <lb/>
     It may be said that 146 does not give the 
     <lb/>
     power. It may be a question as to whether 
     <lb/>
     power that exists in 146 has already 
     <lb/>
     been used. These also are questions that I 
     <lb/>
     would like very much if they had been re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the courts, and that a necessity 
     <lb/>
     did not exist for laymen to endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     judge of them. We are asked him to con<lb break="no"/>sider whether 93 acts automatically. We 
     <lb/>
     find the member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Monk) declaring that it does; we find others 
     <lb/>
     declaring to the contrary. I believe that 93, 
     <lb/>
     like any other class of machinery, works 
     <lb/>
     when you supply the proper material. You 
     <lb/>
     may invent a machine that will put cloth<lb break="no"/>ing on a man, but it is necessary in all 
     <lb/>
     cases that you bring both the clothing and 
     <lb/>
     the man to the machine ; 93 might act auto<lb break="no"/>matically in a special case. If 93 acts au<lb break="no"/>tomatically, why should we put it in the 
     <lb/>
     Bill? If it does not, I think the spirit of 
     <lb/>
     93 should control. It might be that a ref<lb break="no"/>erence to the courts would not satisfy all; 
     <lb/>
     but it would have the value that its deci<lb break="no"/>sion would be respected. If by such a refer<lb break="no"/>ence we found that greater privileges were 
     <lb/>
     due the minorities, then I am willing for one 
     <lb/>
     leges should be given. I am willing for one 
     <lb/>
     to give all the privileges that the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion provides for. In considering this 
     <lb/>
     section there are certain principles that ap<lb break="no"/>pear to be stated rather strongly. and the 
     <lb/>
     decision on the main point will be guided 
     <lb/>
     by the degree of importance which you at<lb break="no"/>tach to one or other of these principles. 
     <lb/>
     Now, in looking at 93 I find it provides for 
     <lb/>
     the exclusive right of legislating on educa<lb break="no"/>tion to the provinces, and also provides for 
     <lb/>
     the rights of minorities, with certain ex<lb break="no"/>ceptions. It reads as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
                  <p>
     In and for each province the legislature may 
     <lb/>
     exclusively make laws in relation to education, 
     <lb/>
     subject and according to the following provi<lb break="no"/>sions : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
                  <p>
     Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially 
     <lb/>
     affect any right or privilege with respect to de<lb break="no"/>nominational schools which any class of per<lb break="no"/>sons have by law in the province at the union. 
     <lb/>
                  </p>
     </quote>
            <p>
     I noticed that when the Minister of Agri<lb break="no"/>culture was speaking on that question he 
     <lb/>
     said that the preservation of the privileges 
     <lb/>
     to minorities was there as strongly as the 
     <lb/>
     exclusive right to legislate on education. It 
     <lb/>
     is indeed a question which many minds 
     <lb/>
     will look at in different ways. To my mind 
     <lb/>
     the chief principle underlying section 93 is 
     <lb/>
     the exclusive right over education granted 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces, and that exclusive right is 
     <lb/>
     I think the real point at issue when pro<lb break="no"/>vinces enter the confederation. At all events 
     <lb/>
     we find that no other body has concurrent 
     <lb/>
     right with the provinces. It has been said 
     <lb/>
     that this is an exclusive right. It is possi<lb break="no"/>bly an exclusive right within a circuit, but 
     <lb/>
     no other power has a concurrent right to 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="5195" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-01_Page_5195.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5195</fw>
            <fw type="num">COMMONS</fw>
            <fw type="num">5196</fw>
          
     legislate either in or out of that circle, and 
     <lb/>
     no body has power to make that circle 
     <lb/>
     larger or smaller than was prescribed by 
     <lb/>
     the Act of '67. The restrictions that are 
     <lb/>
     made to this section 93 I do not think take 
     <lb/>
     away from the exclusiveness, but rather 
     <lb/>
     limit distance. There is another principle 
     <lb/>
     in section 93 which I would put before that 
     <lb/>
     giving privileges to minorities, and that is 
     <lb/>
     that the initial right of legislation on mat<lb break="no"/>ters of legislation lies with the provinces, 
     <lb/>
     that the Dominion parliament never under 
     <lb/>
     any circumstances legislates with regard to 
     <lb/>
     educational matters in the provinces un<lb break="no"/>til the provincial legislature has gone 
     <lb/>
     beyond its powers and then only does 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion interfere in order to provide a 
     <lb/>
     remedy. 
     <lb/></p>
            

            <p>
     The principle of the preservation to min<lb break="no"/>orities of their rights also exists, but I 
     <lb/>
     think in a subordinate degree to these others, 
     <lb/>
     If I were to ask myself what particular 
     <lb/>
     training or what colouring to my mind, or 
     <lb/>
     what influence caused me to place such an 
     <lb/>
     interpretation upon section 93, I think that 
     <lb/>
     on careful examination I would very likely 
     <lb/>
     find that the campaign of 1896 with the 
     <lb/>
     various cries used in that campaign of, I 
     <lb/>
     shall not say 'Hands off Manitoba,' but 
     <lb/>
     certainly 'Let the provinces attend to their 
     <lb/>
     own educational affairs, would have a 
     <lb/>
     large bearing on it. I may be right or 
     <lb/>
     I may be wrong, but with all due 
     <lb/>
     deference to many gentlemen whose opin<lb break="no"/>ions I would value and perhaps defer to in 
     <lb/>
     many other cases, I am inclined to think 
     <lb/>
     that in my present attitude I am nearer to 
     <lb/>
     the position of the Liberal party who swept 
     <lb/>
     the county in 1896 on 'provincial rights' 
     <lb/>
     than they are at the present moment. I real<lb break="no"/>ize of course how very subtle is the dividing 
     <lb/>
     line that will at a certain point separate 
     <lb/>
     minds that have been examining various 
     <lb/>
     arguments and that have been up to that 
     <lb/>
     time in agreement. It you take section 93 
     <lb/>
     which gives exclusive rights of legislation 
     <lb/>
     in regard to education to provinces and at 
     <lb/>
     the same time makes an exception in favour 
     <lb/>
     of minorities, it is easy to ask what is the 
     <lb/>
     dominant idea. Reading it with the whole 
     <lb/>
     case in view and remembering the struggles 
     <lb/>
     that led up to confederation, one mind is 
     <lb/>
     struck with the thought that the preserv<lb break="no"/>ation to minorities of any privileges they 
     <lb/>
     enjoyed was the most prominent feature, 
     <lb/>
     the principle to be most conserved and 
     <lb/>
     safeguarded even to the extent of providing 
     <lb/>
     for remedial legislation if infringed upon, 
     <lb/>
     To another mind the setting apart to 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the exclusive right to make 
     <lb/>
     laws on education is the prominent one<lb break="no"/>and that mind is impressed with the thought 
     <lb/>
     that exclusiveness is the real essence<lb break="no"/>the exceptions being only limitations to the 
     <lb/>
     distance to which such exclusive legislation 
     <lb/>
     may go. According as you give pre-emin<lb break="no"/>ence to one or other of these views, will 
     <lb/>
     not your whole course of thought leading 
     <lb/>
     up to your final decision on the present 
     <lb/>
           
    
            <cb/>
         
     question he settled ? I can readily see how 
     <lb/>
     others may take the other view. I have 
     <lb/>
     followed the arguments advanced with as 
     <lb/>
     much care as I can and with all the 
     <lb/>
     ability that has been given me, and my 
     <lb/>
     course appears to be clear. I think that 
     <lb/>
     the proper course in a case of this kind 
     <lb/>
     would have been when it was known before<lb break="no"/>hand that these questions would be debated 
     <lb/>
     as we had fought them out on previous 
     <lb/>
     occasions, to have ascertained exactly what 
     <lb/>
     the constitution was in the case and to 
     <lb/>
     have adhered to it, and then we would not 
     <lb/>
     have had a Bill brought in that would 
     <lb/>
     cause almost a mutiny in a party, that 
     <lb/>
     would make it necessary to have reconsider<lb break="no"/>ation and a change. A decision on an ap<lb break="no"/>peal to the Privy Council would have 
     <lb/>
     obivated all or a great portion of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition that has arisen. Our constitution be<lb break="no"/>ing a written one can be interpreted and it 
     <lb/>
     has not the elasticity of an unwritten con<lb break="no"/>stitution. The only elasticity that I think 
     <lb/>
     our constitution has is found in such amend<lb break="no"/>ments as may be made by a vote of the 
     <lb/>
     people on certain actions of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and it has been claimed that the re<lb break="no"/>medial portion of our Act of 1867 has been 
     <lb/>
     abrogated by the elections following 1896 
     <lb/>
     which may be true. There are other ques<lb break="no"/>tions in regard to which we may well con<lb break="no"/>sider. If these new provinces are not 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with the legislation we give will 
     <lb/>
     they obey ? If they do not obey what will 
     <lb/>
     follow? The west is impatient of restraint; 
     <lb/>
     it is unwise, I think, to try to bind them too 
     <lb/>
     closely. It may be that they will accept, I 
     <lb/>
     hope they will. It may be these Bils will 
     <lb/>
     work out well, I hope they will, but I have 
     <lb/>
     a fear that possibly we are not at the end 
     <lb/>
     of the trouble, but only at the beginning. 
     <lb/>
     It has been urged over and over again by 
     <lb/>
     members of the opposition in this House 
     <lb/>
     that it would be well even yet for the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to take the step of appealing to the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council before they put this Bill in 
     <lb/>
     force. I notice in the 'Sunday World' 
     <lb/>
     which is not a very good authority to 
     <lb/>
     quote to the government, a statement that 
     <lb/>
     there were rumours in the corridors that 
     <lb/>
               such a course would be taken, that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would yet before putting the Act 
     <lb/>
     in force submit certain questions to the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council in regard to these educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses. I may say that while my vote is 
     <lb/>
     of no importance to the government on the 
     <lb/>
     present occasion, if such a step was taken 
     <lb/>
     it would enable me with very great pleas<lb break="no"/>ure to vote for the government on both of 
     <lb/>
     these Bills. As I said the vote of a single 
     <lb/>
     member in such a case is not of very much 
     <lb/>
     value and importance to them, and it of 
     <lb/>
     itself would not be sufiicient reason for the 
     <lb/>
     government taking such action but it might 
     <lb/>
     easily happen that such a course would be of 
     <lb/>
     value to them in the future, throughout the 
     <lb/>
     country at large and it might happen that 
     <lb/>
     numbers of the Conservatives who now feel 
     <lb/>
     somewhat disinclined on the constitutional 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     There is an alternative presented to us, 
     <lb/>
     the amendment of the leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>stion (Mr. R. L. Borden). It is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion always with a member, to what extent 
     <lb/>
     he should accept an amendment, even if 
     <lb/>
     certain portions or it are satisfactory. There 
     <lb/>
     are portions of that amendment with which 
     <lb/>
     I shall not say I find fault, but the closing 
     <lb/>
     portion of it leaves some doubt as to its act<lb break="no"/>ual meaning; whether the closing words are 
     <lb/>
     simply a repetition of the idea conveyed 
     <lb/>
     by the earlier ones or whether they are in<lb break="no"/>tended to be a distinct addition to the 
     <lb/>
     powers given to the provisions, it is not 
     <lb/>
     easy to state; it is possibly left to the 
     <lb/>
     members to decide each for himself. Ow<lb break="no"/>ing to that indefiniteness in the matter, I 
     <lb/>
     feel it would be unwise on my part to sup<lb break="no"/>port it, and therefore I shall not support 
     <lb/>
     the amendment of the leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition, but I would again urge on the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, in view of all the danger that 
     <lb/>
     may come from pressing this Bill through, 
     <lb/>
     to consider well and carefully the wisdom 
     <lb/>
     of getting a decision of the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     on these questions.

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:DERB1">Mr. D. DERBYSHIRE</persName> (Brockville). Mr. <lb/> Speaker, in
                  beginning to speak on this <lb/> Autonomy Bill, I feel it my duty to express <lb/>
                  my sympathy with you who have sat <lb/> through these long weary weeks listening
                  <lb/> to this debate. It must have been a torture <lb/> to you to listen to some
                  of these long drawn <lb/> out addresses that have hardly touched the <lb/>
                  question under discussion, listening to quota<lb break="no"/>tions day after day,
                  none of which dealt <lb/> with the business under discussion, the same <lb/>
                  attack made on both sides of the House, the <lb/> same hairsplitting, the same
                  twisting of <lb/> language to suit the object of the different <lb/> speakers. I
                  had intended to save you the <lb/> pain of listening to me on this question on
                  <lb/> which there is now but little left to be said. <lb/> After the able speech
                  of the right hon. First <lb/> Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) and the hon. <lb/>
                  leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) <lb/> very little new can be said on
                  the question. <lb/> It was natural that hon. members from the <lb/> west should be
                  heard from as they were the <lb/> people most particularly interested in <lb/>
                  this Bill and they have expressed themselves <lb/> most freely. I have been struck
                  with the <lb/> remarkable unanimity amongst these mem<lb break="no"/>bers as to
                  the position they take in regard to <lb/> the school question. They seem to think
                  <lb/> that the law as it now stands is all right, <lb/> that it is the best
                  possible system that could <lb/> be inaugurated for the Northwest. I think <lb/>
                  in such a case it would be right to incorpor<lb break="no"/>ate this in the
                  constitution of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. One thing has impressed me,
                  Sir, <lb/> very much, and that is that this discussion, <lb/> although weary, has
                  not been in vain. We <lb/> are learning more of Canada, we are realiz<lb
                     break="no"/>ing that every part of this Dominion is dear <lb/> to us and we are
                  more hopeful for Canadian <lb/>
                  <cb/> unity than ever before. I have always <lb/> thought provincially. Ontario,
                  to me, has <lb/> been the brightest jewel in this whole <lb/> country, but after
                  hearing some of my <lb/> hon. friends from the province of Quebec, it <lb/> has
                  amazed me how these men can speak so <lb/> eloquently in a language which is
                  foreign <lb/> to them. It has broadened my patriotism <lb/> and increased my
                  admiration of my fellow <lb/> countrymen of the province of Quebec to <lb/> know
                  that they have elected an English <lb/> speaking Protestant as the speaker of
                  their <lb/> legislative assembly in a province which is <lb/> largely composed of
                  French Canadians. <lb/> Nova Scotia is particularly to be envied. <lb/> Solid
                  eighteen! What a Liberal paradise <lb/> this must be and such a bunch of fine
                     repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives! I have had to admire a great <lb/> many of the
                  men from the west as well. <lb/> Nearly all the speakers have said that this <lb/>
                  was the most important Bill that was ever <lb/> presented to this House. Possibly
                  it is true, <lb/> but I think, if it is not one of the most <lb/> important since
                  confederation, it is the most <lb/> remarkable. It gives to the two new pro<lb
                     break="no"/>vinces a constitution. It deals with the diff<lb break="no"/>cult
                  matter of boundaries and it makes <lb/> financial arrangements for the conduct of
                  <lb/> the business of these new provinces. It <lb/> makes provision for education,
                  and yet such <lb/> judgment has been exercised in the drafting <lb/> of this Bill
                  and so carefully has it been <lb/> worded that there has practically been no <lb/>
                  discussion on any of the points of this Bill <lb/> save on that in regard to
                  education. The <lb/> new provinces have accepted this Bill in its <lb/> entirety.
                  The school clauses have been en<lb break="no"/>dorsed by public opinion and the
                  reception <lb/> given to the newly appointed Minister of the <lb/> Interior (Mr.
                  Oliver) in the most important <lb/> constituency between Winnipeg and the <lb/>
                  Rocky Mountains is a most significant evi<lb break="no"/>dence of the feeling of
                  the people in the <lb/> west. The receptions which have been ac<lb break="no"
                  />corded him after his election at Calgary and <lb/> Winnipeg have shown the
                  unanimity of the <lb/> western people in connection with this Bill. <lb/> I am
                  sure everybody will rejoice on July <lb/> 1st, when these Bills are brought into
                     oper<lb break="no"/>ation and the new provinces are allowed to <lb/> take their
                  places in confederation. Let us <lb/> look for a few moments at the details. The
                  <lb/> boundaries have been marked out in a way <lb/> to meet with the general
                  approval of the <lb/> people in the west. It is true that the hon. <lb/>
                  ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) <lb/> raised some objection and that the
                  hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) thought <lb/> that
                  possibly something could be done to <lb/> assist the farming and ranching interest
                  in <lb/> that section of the country. Great discretion <lb/> has been shown in
                  leaving the northern <lb/> boundaries of Saskatchewan unsettled. Had <lb/> the
                  northern extension been made at this <lb/> time endless trouble might have ensued.
                  As <lb/> it was for political capital the Roblin—Rogers <lb/> gang have plotted to
                  make trouble for the <lb/> government in the west. They dragged the <lb/> Papal
                  ablegate's name into the Autonomy <lb/>

                  <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>
                  <fw type="num">5200</fw> Bill discussion in a way that was most dia<lb break="no"
                  />bolical. The facts have already been fully <lb/> given by the right hon. First
                  Minister, but <lb/> they will bear repeating. Mr. Rogers begged <lb/> an interview
                  of the government on the <lb/> boundary question and afterwards published <lb/> a
                  statement intended to lead the public to <lb/> believe that he came to Ottawa at
                  the soli<lb break="no"/>citation of the right hon. First Minister. <lb/> He and
                  Mr. Campbell urged on the premier <lb/> and his associates the extension of
                     Mani<lb break="no"/>toba's boundaries to the westward and to <lb/> Hudson bay.
                  Naturally they were in<lb break="no"/>formed that it could not possibly be done
                  <lb/> unless the other provinces were consulted in <lb/> regard to the question.
                  The hon. the Post<lb break="no"/>master General (Sir William Mulock) was <lb/>
                  very emphatic in the statement that no ex<lb break="no"/>tension of their
                  territory should take place, <lb/> and that Ontario must be heard on this im<lb
                     break="no"/>portant question as it had rights in this <lb/> matter. The hon.
                  Postmaster General in<lb break="no"/>sisted upon this province being heard while
                  <lb/> Mr. Rogers, in the meantime, insisted that <lb/> Ontario had no rights in
                  the matter. But <lb/> the hon. Postmaster General, as the repre<lb break="no"
                  />sentative of this province, stood firm on this <lb/> question, as he always
                  stands on every <lb/> question which is for the benefit of the <lb/> country. He
                  withdrew from the conference <lb/> and the matter was at an end. Now, the <lb/>
                  plotting began. The Manitoba delegate <lb/> waited on the Papal ablegate and got
                  him, <lb/> no doubt at his suggestion, to put into <lb/> writing his wishes in
                  regard to the educa<lb break="no"/>tion of the minority in the province of Mani<lb
                     break="no"/>toba. This private document, of which the <lb/> government had no
                  knowledge until it was <lb/> made public by Mr. Rogers, was used to <lb/> make
                  political capital in the interests of <lb/> Dominion Conservatives and they made a
                  <lb/> useless effort to lead the public to believe <lb/> that they were promised
                  that if they would <lb/> grant the wish of the ablegate their bound<lb break="no"
                  />aries would be extended. While all this <lb/> was taking place no doubt the
                  delegates <lb/> were thinking of the words of the Post<lb break="no"/>master
                  General that no extension could take <lb/> place, and also of the words of the
                  right <lb/> hon. First Minister in introducing the Bill <lb/> on February 21st
                  when he said that no ex<lb break="no"/>tension could take place until the sister
                     pro<lb break="no"/>vinces were consulted on this matter. The <lb/> right hon.
                  Prime Minister at this time said <lb/> that he had the authority of his colleagues
                  <lb/> to make that announcement. The provinces <lb/> of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba
                  and Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan must meet here and decide on the im<lb break="no"
                  />portant question of the division of this par<lb break="no"/>ticular territory in
                  the interests of all the <lb/> people connected with the question. Yet, <lb/> in
                  the light of these statements made to the <lb/> Manitoba delegates in private
                  conference <lb/> and from the floor of this House, they had <lb/> the stupid
                  impudence to insinuate that the <lb/> government were prepared to make a <lb/>
                  crooked deal with them. Their plot had not <lb/> even the merit of cleverness.
                  <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     Saskatchewan has been heard from. The 
     <lb/>
            <cb/>
     western members who have been indiffer<lb break="no"/>ent in regard to the school clauses, have 
     <lb/>
     expressed themselves with great indignation 
     <lb/>
     at the suggestion of having any part of 
     <lb/>
     their territory annexed to Manitoba. In 
     <lb/>
     nothing is the Autonomy Bill wiser than 
     <lb/>
     in the boundary clause. Manitoba can 
     <lb/>
     rest assured that justice will be done her. 
     <lb/>
     The boundaries of the new provinces have 
     <lb/>
     been honestly marked out; Manitoba and 
     <lb/>
     Ontario will both have their boundaries 
     <lb/>
     extended, and in such a way that the har<lb break="no"/>mony that has been in Canada since 1896 
     <lb/>
     will continue to reign under the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     government for the balance of the twentieth 
     <lb/>
     century. The action of the government in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the lands of the Northwest shows 
     <lb/>
     equally good judgment, and the decision 
     <lb/>
     that the Dominion lands shall continue to 
     <lb/>
     be invested in the Crown and administered 
     <lb/>
     by the government of Canada for the bene<lb break="no"/>fit and for the purpose of Canada must 
     <lb/>
     meet with universal approval. The ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton), the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) and the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member from West Assiniboia, all of 
     <lb/>
     whom are best capable of expressing them<lb break="no"/>selves on this question have given their un<lb break="no"/>reserved approval to this proposal. What 
     <lb/>
     Canada needs most is men and women. 
     <lb/>
     Anything that will tend to check immigra<lb break="no"/>tion of the desirable class that is now rush<lb break="no"/>ing into the Northwest would be a serious 
     <lb/>
     misfortune to this country. The federal 
     <lb/>
     government has built up a fine immigration 
     <lb/>
     policy and it is best qualified to carry it 
     <lb/>
     on ; any break or change in its manage<lb break="no"/>ment might have disastrous results. Great 
     <lb/>
     railways are being constructed with the 
     <lb/>
     expectation that within the next ten years 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces will have several millions 
     <lb/>
     of people ; factories and wholesale estab<lb break="no"/>lishments in the east have been increased 
     <lb/>
     and enlarged to meet the present demands, 
     <lb/>
     and in future they expect vastly greater 
     <lb/>
     results. Under the proposed arrangement, 
     <lb/>
     capital can rest assured that the country 
     <lb/>
     will continue to grow under the wise immi<lb break="no"/>gration policy that was inaugurated by the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. Sifton ; a policy with which the 
     <lb/>
     new Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) 
     <lb/>
     is thoroughly in accord. If the lands of 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces had been controlled by 
     <lb/>
     the federal government with a wide awake 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior in charge, instead 
     <lb/>
     of an increase of the population of one half 
     <lb/>
     million or so for the last twenty years, the 
     <lb/>
     population of the country would have in<lb break="no"/>creased several millions. The older prov<lb break="no"/>inces are now beginning to wake up to 
     <lb/>
     imitate the policy of the federal government 
     <lb/>
     and a bright day is dawning. The tramp 
     <lb/>
     of the host of willing workers of the right 
     <lb/>
     class in all the provinces will be heard. 
     <lb/>
     The action of the government with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the lands of the new provinces necessi<lb break="no"/>tated the making of special financial 
     <lb/>
     arrangements, and criticism might have 
     <lb/>
     been expected with regard to this provision 
     <lb/>

     but there has been none. It is, as the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister has said in introducing this 
     <lb/>
     Bill, an extraordinary provision. It is a 
     <lb/>
     sound principle of finance, he said, and a 
     <lb/>
     still sounder principle of government that 
     <lb/>
     those Who have the duty of expending the 
     <lb/>
     revenue of the country should also be 
     <lb/>
     saddled with the responsibility of levying 
     <lb/>
     and of providing for it. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman deliberately departed from this 
     <lb/>
     principle, but so just and reasonable are 
     <lb/>
     the financial provisions for Saskatchewan 
     <lb/>
     and Alberta that all criticism has been 
     <lb/>
     silenced. The financial provisions have 
     <lb/>
     been dealt wilth at length by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) 
     <lb/>
     and by the Minister of Finance, and any 
     <lb/>
     words of mine would be mere useless repe<lb break="no"/>tition in connection with this question. I 
     <lb/>
     fully endorsed the words of the member for

     section 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act; everybody has read and everybody 
     <lb/>
     has heard it read many hundreds of times 
     <lb/>

                  prairies when all at once it turned <lb/> awfully dark and commenced to thunder
                  <lb/> and rain as he had never before experi<lb break="no"/>enced. In his dire
                  distress he got down on <lb/> his knees and commenced to pray : O Lord, <lb/> if
                  it is all the same to you I would like a <lb/> little more light and a good deal
                  less noise. <lb/> That is just what we want in this House <lb/> of Commons to-day.
                  We want more light <lb/> and less noise. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:DERB1">Mr. DERBYSHIRE</persName>. Now, Sir we have <lb/> had a great many
                  speeches and I must say <lb/> some of them were good ones, but I ques<lb
                     break="no"/>tion the good judgment of an hon. member <lb/> standing up and
                  occupyng the attention of <lb/> this House for two hours and hardly touch<lb
                     break="no"/>ing the subject under discussion. To me, <lb/> at least, it is most
                  tiresome. I have sat <lb/> here and I have heard these hon. gen<lb break="no"
                  />tlemen reading from all kinds of books <lb/> and newspapers and hardly touching
                  the <lb/> question at issue. I think that is a great <lb/> mistake providing we
                  want to do business <lb/> and it seems to me that we should come to <lb/> this
                  House with the object of doing the <lb/> business of the nation in the very best
                  way <lb/> possible. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     What is this system of education ? The 
     <lb/>
  hon. members from the Territories say that 
     <lb/>
     there is not in Canada to-day a school 
     <lb/>
     system better adapted to their needs than 
     <lb/>
     that established in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. As has already been pointed out 
     <lb/>
     more than once, these ordinances make pro<lb break="no"/>vision for a national school system from 
     <lb/>
     nine o'clock in the morning until half past 
     <lb/>
     three o'clock in the afternoon. There is not 
     <lb/>
     an essential element of a national school 
     <lb/>
     system that is not to be found in these or<lb break="no"/>dinances. Let me again call the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the members of this House to the powers 
     <lb/>
     of the government in relation to these 
     <lb/>
     schools; for I am satisfied that if the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House and the people or 
     <lb/>
     Canada had an accurate knowledge of the 
     <lb/>
     school laws of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     which parliament is being asked to confirm, 
     <lb/>
     we would not have had the agitation which 
     <lb/>

               <fw type="num">5204</fw>
           
     has been going on in the country for the<lb/>last month. Nor would we have had par<lb break="no"/>liament flooded with the number of peti<lb break="no"/>tions that have been presented to this 
     <lb/>
     House.  These ordinances declare that the 
     <lb/>
     government shall control and manage all 
     <lb/>
     schools, kindergarten, public, separate and 
     <lb/>
     normal. The government have power to 
     <lb/>
     make regulations for the inspection of 
     <lb/>
     schools, the licensing and grading of teach<lb break="no"/>ers and to authorize text-books and refer<lb break="no"/>ence books for the use of pupils and teach<lb break="no"/>ers in all schools. In short, the schools of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories under these or<lb break="no"/>dinances are organized under the direction 
     <lb/>
     of the government. The conduct of schools, 
     <lb/>
     separate as well as public, must be in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the regulations laid down 
     <lb/>
     by the government, and that conduct is ex<lb break="no"/>actly the same both in separate and public 
     <lb/>
     schools from nine in the morning until half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     past three in the afternoon. From half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     past three until four o'clock religious in<lb break="no"/>struction is allowed, but only such religious 
     <lb/>
     instruction may be given as is permitted 
     <lb/>
     or desired by the board of trustees. Not 
     <lb/>
     such religious instruction as any clergyman 
     <lb/>
     or priest may desire, but such as may be 
     <lb/>
     desired by the board of trustees, which shall 
     <lb/>
     be selected by the ratepayers of the district 
     <lb/>
     each year.

            <p>
     The hon. member for Saskatchewan (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lamont) said in his excellent address the 
     <lb/>
    other evening that after nearly twenty-two 
     <lb/>years residence in the Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies, he believed firmly that the public school 
     <lb/>system as at present administered is the 
     <lb/>one best suited to the needs of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. The people of the two new provinces 
     <lb/>are satisfied with it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, Sir, if this system of education, 
     <lb/>
     enacted by this parliament in 1875, and im<lb break="no"/>proved from time to time since by the peo<lb break="no"/>ple themselves, to meet their requirements, 
     <lb/>
     is satisfactory to the people, why should this 
     <lb/>
     House not confirm this law, which has given 
     <lb/>
     such general satisfaction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Bishop Worrell, who was a clergyman of 
     <lb/>
     the Church of England in the town of Brock<lb break="no"/>ville, and also at Kingston and Morrisburg, 
     <lb/>
     delivered an address the other evening 
     <lb/>
     to the St. George's Society of the city of 
     <lb/>
     Halifax. The report of his speech is head<lb break="no"/>ed ' Be Fair and Tolerant ' and is as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :

     Bishop Worrell, patron of the society, who 
     <lb/>
     responded was greeted with applause. He es<lb break="no"/>teemed it a great honour and privilege to speak 
     <lb/>
     as the representative of all Christian bodies. 
     <lb/>
     As he went through Nova Scotia his eyes had 
     <lb/>
     been opened as he saw her beautiful scenery 
     <lb/>
     and expanding industries. He humorously re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the snow blockades and muddy streets. 
     <lb/>
     Best of all he had met the grand sons of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and he felt satisfied now that this little 
     <lb/>
     province does produce great men, and he only 
     <lb/>
     regretted that his parents did not permit him 
     <lb/>
     to be born in Nova Scotia. He eloquently re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the growth of the Canadian spirit and 
     <lb/>
     the development of the imperial idea, looking to 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          
     the time when we shall have an imperial feder<lb break="no"/>ation. But we must remember that here in 
     <lb/>
     Canada our varying elements must be blended 
     <lb/>
     together in the common interests of the mother 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have in Canada a composite race and, as 
     <lb/>
     in England, the Norman and Celtic blended, so 
     <lb/>
     in Canada the maple leaf will be the brightest 
     <lb/>
     when it is seen to grow not only from the rose, 
     <lb/>
     the thistle and the shamrock, but from the lily 
     <lb/>
     of France. (Applause.) Let us remember that 
     <lb/>
     we must have the spirit of give and take, the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of respecting the consciences and con<lb break="no"/>victions of all Canadians and we would make a 
     <lb/>
     great mistake if we would cause friction to 
     <lb/>
     grow between the different nationalities of this 
     <lb/>
     great country. Referring to Empire Day he 
     <lb/>
     said we should teach our children in the Chris<lb break="no"/>tian faith. The little churches have been the 
     <lb/>
     strength of England and have made British fair-
               <lb break="yes"/>
    play, which is after all the principle of Christ 
     <lb/>known the world over. (Applause). </p>

     I think these are grand sentiments.

            </p>

            <p>
     What is the trouble with the opposition 
     <lb/>
     anyway ? Shortly after this Bill was intro<lb break="no"/>duced, the hon. member for South York (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     W. F. Maclean) moved the adjournment of 
     <lb/>
     this House from day to day, looking wild, 
     <lb/>
     and shouting, threatening the stopping of 
     <lb/>
     supplies, and winding up loudly by want<lb break="no"/>ing a Minister of the Interior at once, and 
     <lb/>
     I am glad to inform the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     that we have one, and he will be here to<lb break="no"/>morrow. The hon. member for South York 
     <lb/>
     also wanted the Minister of Public Works 
     <lb/>
     in his place. We all regret the cause of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Minister of Public Works' absence, 
     <lb/>
     and trust that he will soon be restored to 
     <lb/>
     his usual good health and resume his usual 
     <lb/>
     place, which he has filled with so much ac<lb break="no"/>ceptance. But in the meantime no loss is 
     <lb/>
     sustained to this House or the country 
     <lb/>
     when we have such an able acting minister 
     <lb/>
     doing the work ; and if anything should 
     <lb/>
     happen that the city of London is opened, 
     <lb/>
     you will find the intelligent electors re<lb break="no"/>turning Mr. Hyman by a larger majority 
     <lb/>
     than he ever had before. In fact, I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to bet that he would be. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for South York wound up by im<lb break="no"/>ploring the hon. the Postmaster General to 
     <lb/>
     resign his place, and run him a race in 
     <lb/>
     North York or challenging the acting Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Public Works to resign, or the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to open any constituency in the 
     <lb/>
     west in order that the renowned editor of 
     <lb/>
     the ' World ' might bare his scalping knife 
     <lb/>
     and wound the government by politically 
     <lb/>
     killing any opponent that might rashly stand 
     <lb/>
     before him. We find, however, that this 
     <lb/>
     John Alexander Dowie, of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons, is brave only in words, and that 
     <lb/>
     his most brilliant efforts are for flaming 
     <lb/>
     headlines in his little paper, which after all 
     <lb/>
     exerts no greater influence in the moulding 
     <lb/>
     of thought of the intelligent people of On<lb break="no"/>tario, than the hon. member himself, exerts 
     <lb/>
     in this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another remarkable address was deliver<lb break="no"/>ed in this House, that delivered by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Leeds (Mr. Taylor). No one, I 
     <lb/>

               <fw type="num">5206</fw>
     think, will accuse my hon. friend of 
     <lb/>
     modesty after having listened as carefully 
     <lb/>
     as I did to the speech he made. But I wish 
     <lb/>
     to say, lest some hon. member should be led 
     <lb/>
     astray, that my esteemed friend is an hon<lb break="no"/>est business man of more than ordinary 
     <lb/>
     ability, who has been and is now success<lb break="no"/>ful in commercial matters, but politically I 
     <lb/>
     think he is warped. In fact, as one gentle<lb break="no"/>man told me, our friend is so politically 
     <lb/>
     bent that rain coming down straight will 
     <lb/>
     not touch him. His story about the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Tarte going to Winnipeg in 1896 to settle 
     <lb/>
     the school question with the Greenway gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, getting Joe Martin a $10,000 job, 
     <lb/>
     appointing the Hon. Mr. Preudergast to the 
     <lb/>
     Supreme Court Bench, getting the ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) to fix all 
     <lb/>
     these fellows up and giving him as compen<lb break="no"/>sation the management of the Department 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior free from all restraint, and 
     <lb/>
     having it so arranged that he could make 
     <lb/>
     two million dollars in eight years—all this 
     <lb/>
     was possibly one of my hon. friend's great<lb break="no"/>est efforts and shows what a fruitful im<lb break="no"/>agination he enjoys. But he made one 
     <lb/>
     great omission in that address of his. He 
     <lb/>
     forgot to state—and I find it difficult to ac<lb break="no"/>count for the omission—that the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses of this Bill were prepared in Rome, 
     <lb/>
     and that the Pope's representative was sent 
     <lb/>
     with them to this country with instructions 
     <lb/>
     to have the right hon. the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     government introduce them into this House. 
     <lb/>
     If those details had been added to his speech, 
     <lb/>
     it would have been complete and have been 
     <lb/>
     a most wonderful piece of fiction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for North Cape Breton 
     <lb/>
     and Victoria, N.S. (Mr. D. D. McKenzie) 
     <lb/>
     and the hon. member for Cornwall and Stor<lb break="no"/>mont (Mr. Pringle) delivered carefully pre<lb break="no"/>pared speeches from a legal standpoint. I 
     <lb/>
     was very much impressed with their ad<lb break="no"/>dresses and also with that of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk). From a 
     <lb/>
     legal standpoint, I think they were possibly 
     <lb/>
     the best addresses I have heard; and after 
     <lb/>
     studying all these, I feel prouder than ever 
     <lb/>
     of my right hon. friend, the leader of this 
     <lb/>
     House. I believe that he was standing on 
     <lb/>
     the rock of the constitution in 1896 when 
     <lb/>
     he would not allow Manitoba to be coerced, 
     <lb/>
     and I think he is standing on the same firm 
     <lb/>
     ground in continuing to the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     the school system which is so satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     to the people interested. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In conclusion I feel it my duty to state here 
     <lb/>
     clearly why I am going to vote for this Bill. 
     <lb/>
     I do so because I believe that the bounda<lb break="no"/>ries of the new provnces are wisely marked 
     <lb/>
     out and that the government showed great 
     <lb/>
     judgment in leaving the nothern extension 
     <lb/>
     of Saskatchewan unsettled and allowing 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and the other provinces interested 
     <lb/>
     to have a final say in the adjustment of this 
     <lb/>
     great question. I do so because I am con<lb break="no"/>vinced that the action of the government on 
     <lb/>
     the land question is a wise one and that 
     <lb/>
     their action on the school question is in no 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
       
     way contrary to the spirit and intention of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act of 1867. I 
     <lb/>
     approve of the government's policy because 
     <lb/>
     the financial clauses are in my opinion just, 
     <lb/>
     generous and satisfactory to these young 
     <lb/>
     giants of the west. I approve of this Bill 
     <lb/>
     because it is in the best interests of Canada 
     <lb/>
     as a whole that the public lands of the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces should remain the property of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I endorse this measure because 
     <lb/>
     the rights of the minority are protected by 
     <lb/>
     it and because I believe that the school 
     <lb/>
     clauses, over which there has been so much 
     <lb/>
               bitter debate, will in the end be found bene<lb break="no"/>ficial to Canadian unity, to which, as my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Shefford (Mr. Parmelee) 
     <lb/>
     pointed out the other day, the First Minis<lb break="no"/>ter has consecrated his life. This Bill, in 
     <lb/>
     my opinion, is the crowning glory of the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman's political career. At 
     <lb/>
     length Canada is a united country from the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic to the Pacific, and we have now 
     <lb/>
     from end to end of this great Dominion a 
     <lb/>
     confederation of practically self-governing 
     <lb/>
     provinces. The cope stone has been placed 
     <lb/>
     on our union, and the last provinces ad<lb break="no"/>mitted are coming in under the most favour<lb break="no"/>able circumstances, because we know, from 
     <lb/>
     the reports daily coming to us from the 
     <lb/>
     west, that the people of these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     will appreciate the generous treatment they 
     <lb/>
     are receiving at the hands of this govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and the name of Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
     <lb/>
     will shine as one of the very brightest in 
     <lb/>
     Canadian history. It will go down to pos<lb break="no"/>terity as the name of a man revered, trusted 
     <lb/>
     and loved for his courage, wisdom and in<lb break="no"/>tegrity and who stands to-day, as he has 
     <lb/>
     always stood, for everything that is in the 
     <lb/>
     best interests of the Canadian people.

                  <persName ref="pers:FORG1">Mr. RUDOLPHE FORGET</persName> (Charlevoix). <lb/> I do not intend, Mr.
                  Speaker, to detain the <lb/> attention of the House more than a few <lb/> minutes,
                  because I think the discussion on <lb/> this Bill has been already too long for
                  the <lb/> good it has done in the country. In fact it <lb/> has done much harm.
                  The bad feeling <lb/> which was created some ten years ago, <lb/> when somewhat
                  similar legislation was in<lb break="no"/>troduced into this House, had all been
                     for<lb break="no"/>gotten, but I am sorry to say it has all been <lb/> revived
                  by some members of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment who initiated the agitation
                  which has <lb/> since been kept up by hon. members on this <lb/> side. This
                  agitation has done no good to <lb/> our country but considerable harm. By <lb/>
                  some members it has been kept up, I be<lb break="no"/>lieve, through fanaticism.
                  Others have <lb/> been inspired, I think, by ignorance. Some <lb/> others have
                  been moved both by ignorance <lb/> and fanaticism, but I think the majority of
                  <lb/> them were actuated by the idea of ousting <lb/> the government from office
                  and getting in <lb/> themselves. Such political tactics I cannot <lb/> approve. I
                  was not elected to this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to support any such policy :
                  and rather <lb/> than do so I would prefer to remain in <lb/> opposition all my
                  life. I was sent here, <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">5208</fw> like all the other members, with the view <lb/> of
                  working for the progress, prosperity and <lb/> advantage of our country and of
                  thereby <lb/> making a nation of our people ; and it is <lb/> not by talking
                  religion for eight weeks or <lb/> by exciting French against English or Ca<lb
                     break="no"/>tholics against Protestants or province <lb/> against province that
                  we can do this. In <lb/> my opinion, the best way to promote unity <lb/> and
                  harmony and good feeling and every<lb break="no"/>thing that goes to make a
                  strong, prosper<lb break="no"/>ous and united nation is to respect each others
                  <lb/> honest convictions both in religion and poli<lb break="no"/>tics. Much has
                  been said here of the ima<lb break="no"/>ginary bigotry and fanaticism of the
                     pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec. Well, Mr. Speaker, I was <lb/> born in the
                  province of Quebec, I have lived <lb/> there all my life, and I have come in daily
                  <lb/> contact with English Protestants for the <lb/> last thirty years in all
                  kinds of business. <lb/> And I can say sincerely that in all my rela<lb break="no"
                  />tions with my fellow citizens and theirs with <lb/> me, difference in religion
                  has never entered <lb/> as an element and has never interfered <lb/> within our
                  good understanding of each <lb/> other. In the province of Quebec we have <lb/>in
                  that sense no nationality and no religion <lb/>and we never talk of religion.
                  <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:BARR1">Mr. BARR</persName>. Oh, oh. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:FORG1">Mr. FORGET</persName>. My hon. friend may laugh, <lb/> but I repeat what
                  I say. We are there all <lb/> Canadians in spirit as well as in fact. In <lb/> the
                  city of Montreal, where seventy-five <lb/> per cent of the population are French
                     speak<lb break="no"/>ing and seven-eights Catholics, we elect an <lb/> English
                  Protestant mayor every two years. <lb/> In the legislature of the province of
                     Que<lb break="no"/>bec we have an English Protestant speaker <lb/> and our
                  provincial treasurer, whose port<lb break="no"/>folio is the most important in the
                  cabinet <lb/> from my point of view, is an English-speak<lb break="no"/>ing man. I
                  have seen as many as three <lb/> English Protestant ministers out of seven <lb/>
                  in the Quebec cabinet. More than that, <lb/> there is at present in the Quebec
                     legisla<lb break="no"/>ture an English Protestant, a resident of <lb/> Nova
                  Scotia, representing a French Canadian <lb/> constituency in that province. I see
                  on this <lb/> side of the House and on the other side, <lb/> English-speaking
                  Protestants of Ontario re<lb break="no"/>presenting French Canadian counties in
                  the <lb/> province of Quebec. In the legislative coun<lb break="no"/>cil of Quebec
                  the English Protestants again <lb/> have more than they are entitled to. It is
                  <lb/> so in the city council of Montreal, it is so <lb/> in the house of assembly
                  of Quebec. So far <lb/> as education is concerned, if you go into <lb/> our
                  Catholic schools, our Catholic convents, <lb/> our Catholic universities, you will
                  find a <lb/> great number of English Protestant child<lb break="no"/>ren being
                  educated there. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     I said I would not detain the House very 
     <lb/>
     long. But before sitting down I have to an<lb break="no"/>nounce that it is my intention to vote 
     <lb/>
     against the amendment of the hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition. I have a great admira<lb break="no"/>tion for that hon. gentleman, but I am afraid 
     <lb/>he has made a mistake this time. Not only 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
        
     shall I vote against the amendment, but I 
     <lb/>
     shall vote in favour of the Bill. I approve 
     <lb/>
     of the creation of these two new provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Some hon. members have said they would 
     <lb/>
     prefer to see only one province. I think 
     <lb/>
     that in creating only one province we would 
     <lb/>
     have been creating a Dominion within the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, because that province would be 
     <lb/>
     unduly large. I also approve of the settle<lb break="no"/>ment of the land question, because those 
     <lb/>
     Territories were purchased by the money 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion, they were developed by 
     <lb/>
     the money of the whole Dominion. The 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific Railway was constructed 
     <lb/>
     by the aid of money from the whole Domin<lb break="no"/>ion for the purpose of developing those Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. The present government is doing 
     <lb/>
     the same thing with regard to the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk Pacific, borrowing money on the 
     <lb/>
     credit of all the provinces in order to de<lb break="no"/>velop those Territories. Millions have been 
     <lb/>
     spent on immigration, money that was taken 
     <lb/>
     from the Dominion treasury in order to de<lb break="no"/>velop those Territories. They are now with<lb break="no"/>out any debt, they are getting a good sub<lb break="no"/>sidy to set them going. The federal gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, by keeping control of the lands, 
     <lb/>
     will be able to idemnify, directly or indir<lb break="no"/>ectly, the other provinces for their expendi<lb break="no"/>ture in developing the Northwest. These 
     <lb/>lands will constitute the finest asset of 
     <lb/>the Dominion of Canada. Within ten 
     <lb/>years, probably, these lands will be worth 
     <lb/>hundreds of millions of dollars. Why should 
     <lb/>we leave them to these provinces which have 
     <lb/>been developed with the money of the whole 
     <lb/>country? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     So far as the school question is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     I would like to have seen the same system 
     <lb/>
     established in the Northwest as we have in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and Quebec. I would have liked to 
     <lb/>
     see that system in every province in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada. But as our Catholic 
     <lb/>
     minority cannot expect to get that from the 
     <lb/>
     generosity of the majority, we must take 
     <lb/>
     what we can get. I have no doubt the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister and some of his colleagues 
     <lb/>
     have got all they could out of the majority 
     <lb/>
     of the cabinet. I have no doubt they worked 
     <lb/>
     very hard to get more. I am willing to ac<lb break="no"/>cept what they have got, trusting that in 
     <lb/>
     the near future one of those provinces will 
     <lb/>
     have a majority of Catholics. That time 
     <lb/>
     may come in ten years, and then we shall 
     <lb/>
     see in which of those two provinces the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the minority will be best respected. 
     <lb/>
     I trust that the spirit of British fair play 
     <lb/>
     which is now being stifled by a portion of 
     <lb/>
     the Ontario press and some of the Ontario 
     <lb/>
     members will assert itself some day and 
     <lb/>
     give justice to the minorities in the North<lb break="no"/>west.
