     PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT IN THE

     NORTHWEST.

            </head>
   
            <p>
     House resumed adjourned debate on the 
     <lb/>
     proposed motion of Sir Wilfrid Laurier for 
     <lb/>
     the second reading of Bill (No. 69) to estab<lb break="no"/>lish and provide for the government of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Alberta, and the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. R. L. Borden thereto. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Hon. L. P. BRODEUR</persName> (Minister of In<lb break="no"/>land Revenue). Mr. Speaker, I desire to 
     <lb/>
     express my deep gratitude to the House 
     <lb/>
     that I have the opportunity of taking part 
     <lb/>
     in such an important discussion as the one 
     <lb/>
     now going on. We must all feel gratified 
     <lb/>
     that this debate has been carried on in such 
     <lb/>
     a manner that the citizens of Canada must 
     <lb/>
     feel proud of this parliament. In fact, we 
     <lb/>
     have not heard throughout the whole debate 
     <lb/>
     any expression which could hurt the feelings 
     <lb/>
     of any member of this House. The debate 
     <lb/>
     has been carried on in a dignified way, and 
     <lb/>
     I will try, in the few remarks which I intend 
     <lb/>
     to offer, to follow the example set by those 
     <lb/>
     who have preceded me. The first ques<lb break="no"/>tion which we have to consider is whether 
     <lb/>
     we should create new provinces in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest, and, if so, what constitution we 
     <lb/>
     should give to those provinces. The unani<lb break="no"/>mous feeling in this House is in favour of 
     <lb/>
     granting provincial autonomy to the North<lb break="no"/>west. It has been suggested that we should 
     <lb/>
     have only one province instead of two ; 
     <lb/>
     but generally the opinion of the members 
     <lb/>
     is strongly in favour of the creation of two 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Now, what constitution should 
     <lb/>
     we give to those provinces ? On that 
     <lb/>
     question there has been some difference of 
     <lb/>
     opinion, especially with regard to the school 
     <lb/>
     question, and I will try to give the reasons 
     <lb/>
     why I think the educational clauses of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, as amended should be supported by the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House. The hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition the other day, at page 3096 
     <lb/>
     of ' Hansard,' spoke as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     If my hon. friend is able to show me that 
     <lb/>
     there is, in respect of those proposed provi<lb break="no"/>sions, any such compact as that which was 
     <lb/>
     made before confederation between the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Ontario and Quebec, I will then read<lb break="no"/>ily accept his illustration. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     The illustration referred to was to the 
     <lb/>
     effect that since Ontario and Quebec have 
     <lb/>
     their separate schools, the new provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Alberta and Saskatchewan should not be 
     <lb/>
     denied that privilege. We see, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     that my hon. friend the leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition has declared that if we can establish 
     <lb/> a compact or agreement with regard to 
     <lb/>separate schools in the Northwest such as 
     <lb/>there was with regard to schools in the 
     <lb/>provinces of Ontario and Quebec, he is 
     <lb/>ready to concede that separate schools 
     <lb/>should be established in the new provinces 
     <lb/>we are now creating. Well, Mr. Speaker, in 
     <lb/>my opinion, there was a formal agreement  
     <lb/>and compact by virtue of which separate 
     <lb/>schools were to be established in the North<lb break="no"/>

     west Territories. I shall prove this by re<lb break="no"/>ferring to what occurred in 1869 and 1870, 
     <lb/>
     and that consequently the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada is to-day bound to give separate 
     <lb/>
     schools to the new provinces. I need not 
     <lb/>
     refer to the treaties which were passed be<lb break="no"/>tween England and France in 1763, because 
     <lb/>
     those treaties cannot be called upon to estab<lb break="no"/>lish any rights or privileges with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories. We know very 
     <lb/>
     well that Rupert's Land or the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories were under the sovereignty of 
     <lb/>
     England for more than two centuries. We 
     <lb/>
     know very well that they were under the 
     <lb/>
     laws and constitution of England from 1670 
     <lb/>
     to 1870, when they were brought under the 
     <lb/>
     control of the Canadian government. We 
     <lb/>
     well recollect that in 1869 or 1870 there was 
     <lb/>
     a disturbance in the Northwest. The Cana<lb break="no"/>dian government, without having the neces<lb break="no"/>sary authority, sent up some persons to 
     <lb/>
     that country to take possession of it. At 
     <lb/>
     that time there was no law which had been 
     <lb/>
     passed by the British parliament, there was 
     <lb/>
     no proclamation issued by the British par<lb break="no"/>liament, handing this territory over to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government. However, the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian government took upon itself to send 
     <lb/>
     people up there to exercise the sovereign 
     <lb/>
     power. An agitation and disturbance en<lb break="no"/>sued, and a very serious agitation it was in<lb break="no"/>deed. The imperial government then tried 
     <lb/>
     by all means to adjust the differences of 
     <lb/>
     opinion which existed at that time between 
     <lb/>
     the settlers of the west and the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government. Lord Granville, then Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary, sent a despatch to Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Young, then Governor General of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     in 1869, and Sir John Young wrote to Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor McTavish, of the Territories, a letter 
     <lb/>
     in which he transmitted the despatch from 
     <lb/>
     Lord Granville. Speaking of that despatch 
     <lb/>
     from Lord Granville, Sir John Young used 
     <lb/>
     the following language , 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The message conveys the matured opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the imperial cabinet. The proclamation I have 
     <lb/>
     issued is based upon it, and you will observe 
     <lb/>
     that it requests all who have desires to ex<lb break="no"/>press or complaints to make, be referred to me 
     <lb/>
     as invested with authority on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     British government, to the inhabitants of Ru<lb break="no"/>pert's Land ; and all classes of persuasion 
     <lb/>
     may rest assured that Her Majesty has no 
     <lb/>
     intention of interfering with, or setting aside, 
     <lb/>
     or allowing others to interfere with the reli<lb break="no"/>gion and rights and the franchise hitherto en<lb break="no"/>joyed.

            <p>
     Thus we find, in the words of that letter 
     <lb/>
     from Sir John Young, the representative of 
     <lb/>
     the imperial government in Canada, that all 
     <lb/>
     the rights and privileges enjoyed by the 
     <lb/>
     settlers of the Northwest Territories were to 
     <lb/>
     be continued. Sir John Young at the same 
     <lb/>
     time issued a proclamation to the settlers, 
     <lb/>
    in which he said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     I do, therefore, assure vou that in the union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada all your civil rights and religious

     rights and privileges will be respected.

   <p>
     At the request, both of the imperial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and the Canadian government, 
     <lb/>
     Archbishop Taché, who was then in Rome, 
     <lb/>
     came back to Canada for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     inducing his people to come willingly under 
     <lb/>
     the control of the Canadian confederation. 
     <lb/>
     In a book which he published some years 
     <lb/>
     ago on this school question, Archbishop 
     <lb/>
     Taché quotes a personal letter from Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Young, in which Sir John Young said, in 
     <lb/>
     substance, that his people may be assured 
     <lb/>
     their rights and privileges will be maintain<lb break="no"/>ed. That is not all. We find that after 
     <lb/>
     Archbishop Taché went to the Northwest, a 
     <lb/>
     delegation was sent from the settlers of that 
     <lb/>
     country to Ottawa to confer with the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian government and the Governor General, 
     <lb/>
     Sir John Young. Those settlers presented a 
     <lb/>
     Bill of Rights covering the demands which 
     <lb/>
     they intended to make upon the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government. Among other things, they ask<lb break="no"/>ed the Canadian government that the 
     <lb/>
     privileges which they had hitherto enjoy<lb break="no"/>ed should be continued. More than that. 
     <lb/>
     Let me call special attention to this fact, 
     <lb/>
     because it shows what was the agreement 
     <lb/>
     and contract then entered into. The imperial 
     <lb/>
     and Canadian governments had both been 
     <lb/>
     asking the settlers to formulate their de<lb break="no"/>mands, to mention what they wanted in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the establishment of Canadian 
     <lb/>
     authority in their country. The represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of these settlers came to Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     and among the demands they made is the 
     <lb/>
     following, which we find in article 7 of their 
     <lb/>
     Bill of Rights: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

       That the public money for schools be distri<lb break="no"/>buted among the different religious institutions 
     <lb/>
     in proportion to the number of people belonging 
     <lb/>
     to the same creed, according to the system es<lb break="no"/>tablished in the province of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     So we see that the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     settlers came to the government here and 
     <lb/>
     asked that a system of separate schools 
     <lb/>
     should be established in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     similar to that in the province of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     And I may add that the governor, Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Young, afterwards telegraphed to Lord 
     <lb/>
     Granville the Secretary of State for the 
     <lb/>
     Colonies : ' Negotiations with delegates close 
     <lb/>

     privileges have been absolutely denied. At 
     <lb/>
     the same time, in certain parts of the North<lb break="no"/>west, they have been denied. Perhaps in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest they have not gone so far 
     <lb/>
     as to destroy entirely the separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     but they have certainly to a large extent 
     <lb/>
     decreased the privileges which the minority 
     <lb/>
     enjoy with regard to separate schools.

     <lb/>
     it not perfectly clear that they had voluntary 
     <lb/>
     schools in the Northwest at that time ?

     <lb/>
     to my friend : Is it not true that the author<lb break="no"/>ity then exercising rights of sovereignty in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories, the Hudson Bay

     Company, was giving a share of money

     to these schools whether Catholic or Pro<lb break="no"/>testant ?

            <p>

            <fw type="num">5215</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
         

     ple had were voluntary schools, and that 
     <lb/>
     the decision of the Privy Council with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the Manitoba case was that these 
     <lb/>
     people were not to be denied any right 
     <lb/>
     which they had in the church schools, vol<lb break="no"/>untary schools. And that is clear, for they 
     <lb/>
     could have those schools today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. There is one fact which 
     <lb/>
     cannot be disputed,—that the Catholics had 
     <lb/>
     their schools which they controlled, and 
     <lb/>
     the Protestants had their schools which 
     <lb/>
     they controlled. The people in the west 
     <lb/>
     were afraid that these rights would be 
     <lb/>
     taken away from them, and so they showed 
     <lb/>
     hesitation in accepting the terms of union. 
     <lb/>
     At last there was a promise made by the 
     <lb/>
     imperial government and by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government, and by Lord Strathcona, who 
     <lb/>
     had been sent out there to settle the diffi<lb break="no"/>culty, that these rights and privileges would 
     <lb/>
     be continued ;—that is to say, Catholics 
     <lb/>
     would have the right to their schools and 
     <lb/>
     Protestants to their schools. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sproule) will not deny, I suppose, that 
     <lb/>
     the delegates who came from the west were 
     <lb/>
     recognized by the Dominion government. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, the cable which was sent by Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Young, to Lord Granville, the Secretary of 
     <lb/>
     State for the colonies, recognizes them as 
     <lb/>
     such ; and more than that, I am informed 
     <lb/>
     that the expenses of these delegates on their 
     <lb/>
     journey to Ottawa were paid by the Can<lb break="no"/>adian government. So. Mr. Speaker, there 
     <lb/>
     was a formal agreement, a formal compact 
     <lb/>
     by which these rights and privileges, should 
     <lb/>
     continue to be exercised by the Protestants 
     <lb/>
     and Catholics of the Northwest. There is 
     <lb/>
     no doubt about that. And, now that we are 
     <lb/>
     called upon to give autonomy to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, some elements in this 
     <lb/>
     country would have the government and 
     <lb/>
     parliament not carry out the promise which 
     <lb/>
     was made to the minority by the imperial 
     <lb/>
     government, by the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     and by Lord Strathcona. Sir, the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of this country will not commit such 
     <lb/>
     an injustice; we will not go back on the 
     <lb/>
     promise which was made in 1869-70. The 
     <lb/>
     government of this country will give the 
     <lb/>
     minority their rights which were guaranteed 
     <lb/>
     to them by the promise then made, the 
     <lb/>
     rights which they enjoy under the consti<lb break="no"/>tution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While on the subject of compacts, and 
     <lb/>
     before dealing with the constitutional aspect 
     <lb/>
     of the question, I would like to say a word 
     <lb/>
     or two with regard to the compact with the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces. I noticed a few days ago 
     <lb/>
     in the Toronto 'News,' a statement which 
     <lb/>
     has been made time and again in the course 
     <lb/>
     of this controversy. The Toronto 'News' 
     <lb/>
     is a newspaper of great importance, but one 
     <lb/>
     which, perhaps, in this agitation, has not 
     <lb/>
     done its duty to the country as it should 
     <lb/>
     have done. The Toronto 'News' has said 
     <lb/>
     that the compact with regard to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools was one which affected only the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Quebec and Ontario and not 
     <lb/>
     the others. Mr. Speaker. I am here to as<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5215</fw>
     <fw type="num">5216</fw>


     sert that there was a compact with regard 
     <lb/>
     to separate schools not only in connection 
     <lb/>
     with Ontario and Quebec but in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the other provinces which formed the 
     <lb/>
    union or might later enter the union. Now. 
     <lb/>
     what is the history of section 93 of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, 1867 ? There 
     <lb/>
     was a conference at Quebec in 1864, at<lb break="no"/>tended by representatives of Upper Canada, 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia, Prince Edward Island and Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. After discussing the question of con<lb break="no"/>federation for several days, the delegates 
     <lb/>
     came to the conclusion that the educational 
     <lb/>
     laws should be under the control of the le<lb break="no"/>gislatures of the several provinces. saving 
     <lb/>
     the rights and privileges which the minority 
     <lb/>
     in Upper and Lower Canada might enjoy. 
     <lb/>
     It is true that the compact then applied 
     <lb/>
     only to those two provinces, it is true that 
     <lb/>
     the compact then simply embraced Quebec 
     <lb/>
     and Ontario. But I am going to show, and 
     <lb/>
     I am going to put before this House con<lb break="no"/>clusive evidence, that the compact later 
     <lb/>
     on was extended to all the provinces, not 
     <lb/>
     only to those which had entered into con<lb break="no"/>federation, but to those which would come 
     <lb/>
     in later on. What have we then? Imme<lb break="no"/>diately after the Quebec conference, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Galt, then representing the Protestant mino<lb break="no"/>rity of Quebec, made a speech in Sher<lb break="no"/>brooke in which he said :

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, we find this gentleman 
     <lb/>
     representing the Protestant minority of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, saying that the compact should not only 
     <lb/>
     cover the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     but should cover also the other provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and especially the provinces of New Bruns-<lb/>
    to a population than to compel them to have 
     <lb/>wick and Nova Scotia. But the negotiations 
     <lb/>did not stop there, there was something 
     <lb/>more. What was done? After the conference 
     <lb/>at Quebec, the negotiations went to London. 
     <lb/>they had a conference in London, and my 
     <lb/>hon. friend will find at page 98 of Pope's 
     <lb/>Confederation Documents, that the follow<lb break="no"/>ing provinces were represented in London : 
     <lb/>Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>Brunswick. They discussed the question of 
     <lb/>confederation, and the way in which the Bill 
     <lb/>which was to be introduced into the im<lb break="no"/>perial parliament should be drafted. What 
     <lb/>occurred then ? When they came to discuss 
     <lb/>section 43 of the Quebec conference, we find

     Now, Mr. Speaker, we find in the same

     <lb/>
     the motion which was made by Mr. Galt, in 
     <lb/>
     the handwriting of Mr. Galt, which motion 
     <lb/>
     proves that Mr. Galt wanted the compact 
     <lb/>
     with regard to separate schools extended so 
     <lb/>
     as to apply not only to Quebec and Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     but to all the provinces, not only to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces which were then in existence, not 
     <lb/>
     only to Quebec, Ontario. New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     and Nova Scotia, but also to those provinces 
     <lb/>
     which might come in later and form part 
     <lb/>
     of the confederation. What then happened, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker ? We are told that the com<lb break="no"/>pact existed only between Quebec and On<lb break="no"/>tario. Well, Sir, we find in the handwriting 
     <lb/>
     of Sir John A. Macdonald. in the same fac<lb break="no"/>.simile to which I have just alluded, that there 
     <lb/>
     was a vote taken on the question whether 
     <lb/>
     these powers with regard to separate schools 
     <lb/>
     should be extended to all the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     that is to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
     <lb/>
     others which might come in: there was a

     vote taken, and we find the result stated in

     <lb/>

            <p>
     So, Mr. Speaker, the agreement did not

     cover only the two provinces but it covered 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces which then entered into the

     delegates who went home after the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions were submitted to the parliament here 
     <lb/>
     and accepted by that parliament. and after 
     <lb/>
     the most emphatic assurance was given by

     the delegates would bring back no Bill but 
     <lb/>
     one which was exactly in accord with the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions. Then that amendment was made 
     <lb/>
     in England, but it was not assented to by 
     <lb/>

     hear him express the opinion that those 
     <lb/>
     who made that agreement in England were 
     <lb/>
     not authorized to do so. Will he say for one 
     <lb/>
     moment that Sir Charles Tupper was not 
     <lb/>
     authorized to speak for his province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia ? Will he say that Sir Samuel 
     <lb/>
     Leonard Tilley did not represent his pro<lb break="no"/>vince of New Brunswick. and was not 
     <lb/>
     authorized to do what he did on that occa<lb break="no"/>sion ? Will he say that Sir John A. Mac<lb break="no"/>donald, that Sir George Etienne Cartier 
     <lb/>
     were in error, and did not carry out the pro<lb break="no"/>mises which they made to this country ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I will say this, if the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman will allow me to say it, that when 
     <lb/>
     the question arose in the Canadian <choice><sic>parli<lb break="no"/>ment</sic><corr>parliament</corr></choice> as to whether the Bill, after it had 
     <lb/>
     passed the imperial parliament, should or 
     <lb/>
     should not be submitted to the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     parliament, an amendment was moved that 
     <lb/>
     it should be submitted, and it was claimed 
     <lb/>
     as; a reason for that amendment that laws 
     <lb/>
     were often brought back from the imperial 
     <lb/>
     parliament that did not exactly accord with 
     <lb/>
     the resolutions that were made and carried 
     <lb/>
     by the Canadian parliament, and that there<lb break="no"/>fore it was necessary to review these laws 
     <lb/>
     and ascertain whether they were exactly in 
     <lb/>
     accord with the resolutions. In opposition 
     <lb/>
     to that amendment Sir George E. Cartier 
     <lb/>
     was the one who spoke on behalf of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and declared that he would bring 
     <lb/>
     back no law but one which was exactly the 
     <lb/>
     same as the resolutions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I think my hon. friend is 
     <lb/>
     entirely mistaken as to that. He reminds 
     <lb/>
     me of something which I have read some<lb break="no"/>where, that it was perfectly understood be<lb break="no"/>tween Mr. Galt, Sir George E. Cartier and 
     <lb/>
     Sir John A. Macdonald that when they went 
     <lb/>
     to England they would see that the Protes<lb break="no"/>tant minority in Quebec was absolutely pro<lb break="no"/>tected. and would receive special power to 
     <lb/>
     dispose of their money and control the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of their schools. I think my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend must remember that. Therefore 
     <lb/>
     it was not understood that those Quebec 
     <lb/>
     resolutions should be embodied in a law 
     <lb/>
     passed in England in precisely the same 
     <lb/>
     form as they were passed here. No, there 
     <lb/>
     was a conference de novo, the delegates of 
     <lb/>
     each province united together. discussed the 
     <lb/>
     question and they came to the conclusion, a 
     <lb/>
     conclusion which cannot be denied. that the 
     <lb/>
     compact in regard to separate schools should

     apply not only to both Canadas but to all 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces—the provinces which were 
     <lb/>
     then entering confederation as well as the 
     <lb/>
     provinces which would come later on into 
     <lb/>
     the confederation.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. May I ask the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman a question? Is he making the 
     <lb/>
     point that there is something in this com<lb break="no"/>pact which was not embodied in the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America Act, or does he con<lb break="no"/>ceive that everything in this compact made 
     <lb/>
     at London was embodied in the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act? What is the point? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I have not discussed 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act so far. I 
     <lb/>
     have simply been speaking of the compact 
     <lb/>
     which was existing and answering the as<lb break="no"/>sertion that has been made almost every 
     <lb/>
     day in some of the papers that the com<lb break="no"/>pact was only in regard to Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and did not affect the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. What I would like 
     <lb/>
     to know is if the hon. gentleman contends 
     <lb/>
     that in this compact to which he has just 
     <lb/>
     referred and which was made in London, 
     <lb/>
     there is anything which was not embodied 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     every thing in the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I do not think my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend has understood exactly. It is pro<lb break="no"/>bably my fault; it is probably my mistake; 
     <lb/>
     I speak so badly that perhaps I have been 
     <lb/>
     misunderstood by my hon. friend. The 
     <lb/>
     point which I wanted to make is this, that 
     <lb/>
     it has been asserted time and again in the 
     <lb/>
     papers, for instance in the Toronto ' News' 
     <lb/>
     of the 1st April, that the compact had re<lb break="no"/>ference purely and simply to both Canadas. 
     <lb/>
     That has been asserted almost every day. 
     <lb/>
     I wanted to prove by the book which I 
     <lb/>
     have just quoted and by the motion which 
     <lb/>
     was made by Sir Alexander Galt and 
     <lb/>
     which was assented to by the delegates 
     <lb/>
     from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick that 
     <lb/>
     a system of separate schools should not 
     <lb/>
     only be maintained in the provinces which 
     <lb/>
     were then entering the union, but that a 
     <lb/>
     system of separate schools should be main<lb break="no"/>tained that was later on, even after con<lb break="no"/>federation, embodied in the laws and that 
     <lb/>
     future provinces in consequence should be 
     <lb/>
     bound also to maintain a system of sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools Whether they should estab<lb break="no"/>lish these separate schools at the union or 
     <lb/>
     whether they should establish them later 
     <lb/>
     on. That has been embodied in the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act and that is the reason 
     <lb/>
     why I am surprised that papers that want 
 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5219</fw>
     <fw type="num">5220</fw>


     to inflame public opinion in all parts of the 
     <lb/>
     country are always repeating the story 
     <lb/>
     that the compact was simply in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the two provinces. I have proved that the 
     <lb/>
     compact affected all the provinces in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, before I discuss the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     question my hon. friend, the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition, will probably forgive me if I 
     <lb/>
     discuss for a moment or two the amend<lb break="no"/>ment which he has moved and which we 
     <lb/>
     have now to consider. I have read this 
     <lb/>
     amendment over several times and I have 
     <lb/>
     had some difficulty in making up my mind 
     <lb/>
     as to its exact meaning. Perhaps it is my 
     <lb/>
     mistake. I am sure it is my mistake, be<lb break="no"/>cause my hon. friend certainly wanted to 
     <lb/>
     put before the House a concrete motion em<lb break="no"/>bodying perfectly his views and ideas. I 
     <lb/>
     will read the amendment again in order to 
     <lb/>
     find out whether, with the help of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, I will be able to understand ex<lb break="no"/>actly its meaning. It says:

     I understand perfectly well the latter

     part, that the provincial legislature shall 
     <lb/>
     have the right, if this amendment carries, 
     <lb/>
     to exclusively make laws in relation to 
     <lb/>
     education. Does it mean, however, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that these laws shall be subject 
     <lb/>
     to section 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act? Does it mean that the provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislature shall have the right to exclu<lb break="no"/>sively make laws in regard to education, 
     <lb/>
     and that at the same time these laws should 
     <lb/>
     be submitted to the federal parliament con<lb break="no"/>trol under section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act? That is the point which I have 
     <lb/>
     not been able to understand. It is true, as I 
     <lb/>
     have said, that my hon. friend is very clear 
     <lb/>
     in the latter part of his amendment, but 
     <lb/>
     he does not seem to be so clear in the quali<lb break="no"/>fication which he gives to these powers. 
     <lb/>
     What does he mean by 'subject to and in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the provisions of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America Act"? Does he mean 
     <lb/>
     that section 93 will apply or does he mean 
     <lb/>
     that section 93 shall not apply as far as 
     <lb/>
     education is concerned? I would like to 
     <lb/>
     put to him a question to know exactly whe<lb break="no"/>ther I understand the exact meaning of 
     <lb/>
     his amendment. Suppose that his amend<lb break="no"/>ment should carry, suppose the legislature 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Saskatchewan should 
     <lb/>
     pass a law creating separate schools—could 
     <lb/>
     this legislature vary, or decrease, or abolish 
     <lb/>
     these separate schools? I do not know

     should pass a law establishing separate

     schools—I am supposing that this motion

     <lb/>would be permitted to abolish separate 
     <lb/>schools. They would have the authority to 
     <lb/>abolish them. As to whether or not there 
     <lb/>would be any remedy by an appeal to the 
     <lb/>executive and to this parliament would 
     <lb/>bear upon the question as to whether the 
     <lb/>4th subsection of section 93 had applica<lb break="no"/>tion to the new provinces, when you apply

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I suppose, so far as 
     <lb/>
     that is concerned, if you apply the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of Canada it depends on whether sub<lb break="no"/>section 4 would apply. If my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     had been careful enough to read my speech 
     <lb/>
     he would have seen that I had already pro<lb break="no"/>nounced an opinion on that and he need 
     <lb/>
     not have asked me the question. I said that 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, the application of subsection 
     <lb/>
     1 might give the answer as to the applica<lb break="no"/>tion of subsection 4, and I thought subsec<lb break="no"/>tion 1 would not apply to conditions existing 
     <lb/>
     in the Territories. Some hon. gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     this side of the House have not taken that 
     <lb/>
     view, and most hon. gentlemen on the other 
     <lb/>
     side have taken precisely the opposite view. 
     <lb/>
     That is a point on which I do not pretend to 
     <lb/>
     have a very strong opinion. I have not con<lb break="no"/>sidered it very carefully. My proposition 
     <lb/>
     was simply to apply the constitution of Can<lb break="no"/>ada as contained in the Acts of 1867, 1871 
     <lb/>
     and 1886 to these new provinces. I was pre<lb break="no"/>pared and am prepared to abide by the re<lb break="no"/>sult of the application of that constitution. 
     <lb/>
     But in any event. I would point out to my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend that the question of remedial 
     <lb/>
     legislation could not be one of very great 
     <lb/>
     importance in his opinion, because, if the 
     <lb/>
     minority in the provinces would apply for 
     <lb/>
     remedial legislation, undoubtedly my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend and his leader would oppose it in the 
     <lb/>
     future just as they did in 1896.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. My hon. friend (Mr. R. 
     <lb/>
     L. Borden) has not given me a very definite 
     <lb/>
     answer and I think I can go a little further 
     <lb/>
     and ask him: leaving aside what the 
     <lb/>
     judges may decide in the future, whether 
     <lb/>
     in his own opinion he is ready to declare 
     <lb/>
     that the minority will have the right to 
     <lb/>
    remedial legislation under the circumstances 
     <lb/>which I have mentioned. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. R. L. Borden) proposes to make 
     <lb/>the law now ; he should know exactly what 
     <lb/>he intends in making that law and he must 
     <lb/>be in a position to declare whether that law 
     <lb/>will be sufficient or not.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I told my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend already—why does he ask me to re<lb break="no"/>peat it—that in my opinion subsection 1 
     <lb/>
     certainly does not apply. That surely is the 
     <lb/>
     important question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. What about subsections 
     <lb/>
     3 and 4 ?

  <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Subsection 1 as I 
     <lb/>
     understand it gives the key note. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that subsection 1 would not apply to terri<lb break="no"/>tories coming in under legislation of the 
     <lb/>
     character I asked for in my resolution, and 
     <lb/>
     I thought also that subsections 3 and 4 
     <lb/>
     might be governed by the considerations af<lb break="no"/>fecting subsection 1. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I think my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     is absolutely mistaken because While sub<lb break="no"/>section 2 may not apply subsections 3 and 4 
     <lb/>
     might apply. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I concede that, and 
     <lb/>
     the hon gentleman may be right; but 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend asked me for my opinion and 
     <lb/>
     I stated there was a dilference of opinion 
     <lb/>
     in the House on the subject. I was simply 
     <lb/>
     giving my own opinion with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     matter and with every deference to the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of hon. gentlemen in this House 
     <lb/>
     who differ from me. I could not do any 
     <lb/>
     more than give my opinion in reply to his 
     <lb/>
     question, and I think I have given it with 
     <lb/>
     sufficient clearness. I have a strong opin<lb break="no"/>ion about subsection 1. but not a strong 
     <lb/>
     opinion about subsections 3 and 4. The 
     <lb/>
     question is not the same. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I am not yet absolutely 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that my hon. friend has answered 
     <lb/>
     my question. I thought that when be under<lb break="no"/>took to propose this law he should be in a 
     <lb/>
     position to tell us whether remedial legisla<lb break="no"/>tion would apply or would not apply. For 
     <lb/>
     my part I believe it is the duty of this 
     <lb/>
     parliament to decide to-day what is the 
     <lb/>
     law and what should be the law. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. As my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     is in a questioning mood I would like to put 
     <lb/>
     him a question. Does he mean that this 
     <lb/>
     parliament can decide any matter of that 
     <lb/>
     kind by assuming powers which it may be 
     <lb/>
     found eventually not to possess ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I will be in a position in 
     <lb/>
     a few moments to discuss that phase of the 
     <lb/>
     question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. That is a very perti<lb break="no"/>nent point just now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I am here to assert that 
     <lb/>
     I consider this parliament has the right. I 
     <lb/>
     cannot be certain whether the future will 
     <lb/>
     agree with me or not. but I assert here that 
     <lb/>
     this parliament has today the right to de<lb break="no"/>cide what the law should be with regard 
     <lb/>
     to separate schools in the Northwest. I 
     <lb/>
     go further than my hon. friend does. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The only difference 
     <lb/>
     Is that I am not quite so cock sure as my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Then I stand in a 
     <lb/>
     better position than does my hon. friend, 
     <lb/>
     and the government stands in a better 
     <lb/>
     position than he .does because the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment have decided as to its course 
     <lb/>
     While my hon. friend does not seem to 
     <lb/>
     be able to decide what is the meaning of

     <fw type="num">5223</fw>
     <fw type="num">5224</fw>
       

     his amendment. I may be mistaken, but I 
     <lb/>
     do say here that if under the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the oppostion, remedial legis<lb break="no"/>lation does not apply, then it is the most 
     <lb/>
     unjust proposition which has ever been 
     <lb/>
     brought before the parliament of this coun<lb break="no"/>try. In view of the agreements which I 
     <lb/>
     have just quoted. in view of the agreement 
     <lb/>
     which was made in London in 1867, in view 
     <lb/>
     of the agreement which was made with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the schools in the Northwest in 
     <lb/>
     1869, I say that we should be in a position 
     <lb/>
     now to declare whether we shall guarantee 
     <lb/>
     the rights and privileges which the minority 
     <lb/>
     should enjoy in this country; that we 
     <lb/>
     should not leave it to the future to decide 
     <lb/>
     what shall be the position of the minority, 
     <lb/>
     but that we shall be brave enough to say 
     <lb/>
     to them: here is the law under which you 
     <lb/>
     shall live. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD1">Mr. BORDEN</persName>. May I ask my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     one question. Does he attach importance 
     <lb/>
     to the remedial legislation which is pro<lb break="no"/>vided for by subsection 4 ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Certainly I attach a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of importance to it, and for the 
     <lb/>
     reason that if the legislature should estab<lb break="no"/>lish separate schools in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories and if it should afterwards abolish 
     <lb/>
     these separate schools. then this parliament 
     <lb/>
     would have the right to disallow that law 
     <lb/>
     as it should have the right to disallow a 
     <lb/>
     law so unjust.

     <lb/>
     to the hon. gentleman—

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. I would like to point out 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. member (Mr. Brodeur) that I 
     <lb/>
     remember when he took hours to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     reasons why there should not be remedial 
     <lb/>
     legislation in Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Now that we do not 
     <lb/>
     know exactly where the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition stands with regard to his motion, 
     <lb/>
     we will proceed to discuss the question 
     <lb/>
     whether or not we have the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     power to pass this Bill. With regard to 
     <lb/>
     this question of constitutional powers, we 
     <lb/>
     must not forget one thing: Section 91 of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act determines 
     <lb/>
     what are the powers of the federal parlia<lb break="no"/>ment; section 92 deals with the powers of 
     <lb/>
     the local legislatures ; section 93 deals with 
     <lb/>the powers of local legislatures in re<lb break="no"/>gard to education, but; at the same time 
     <lb/>gives the federal parliament a certain con<lb break="no"/>trol over that subject; section 95 places 
     <lb/>some subjects. like agriculture, under the 
     <lb/>control of both 'the provincial legislatures 
     <lb/>and the federal parliament. Now, it has 
     <lb/>been asserted time and again that this legis<lb break="no"/>lation is an infringement upon provincial 
     <lb/>rights. I say with regard to education that 
     <lb/>it is not a question of provincial rights. It 
     <lb/>is not a question whether the province will 
     <lb/>have an absolute right or not, such as it 
     <lb/>has in regard to the matters embodied in 
     <lb/>section 92; but it is purely and simply a 
     <lb/>question of minority rights. It is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion whether the minority shall enjoy the 
     <lb/>rights and privileges which are guaranteed 
     <lb/>by the constitution or rights and privileges 
     <lb/>which they may acquire under the consti<lb break="no"/>tution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, have we the power to pass the Bill 
     <lb/>
     now before us ? I say, without the least 
     <lb/>
     hesitation, that we have that power. I am 
     <lb/>
     not going to dwell on that question at great 
     <lb/>
     length. I hope my hon. friend the Minister 
     <lb/>of Justice will have occasion to take part 
     <lb/>in this debate, and he is certainly in a better 
     <lb/>position than .1 am to discuss that question ; 
     <lb/>but I may be permitted to say a word or 
     <lb/>two upon it. What says section 4 of the 
     <lb/>Act of 1871 ? It says: 
     <lb/>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Certainly. If there is <lb/>legislation which is going to bring peace<lb/>and order, and which should be dealt with <lb/>by this parliament, the present is that legis<lb break="no"/>lation. I am glad that my hon. friend has 
     <lb/>
     drawn my attention to that point. Now, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, in 1875 this parliament passed a 
     <lb/>
     law providing that Catholic and Protestant 
     <lb/>
     minorities in the Northwest should have the 
     <lb/>
     right to establish such schools as they 
     <lb/>
     thought fit. There was no objection to that 
     <lb/>
     law; why ? Sir John Macdonald was then 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition in this House, 
     <lb/>
     and why did he not object to the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of separate schools in the Northwest ? 
     <lb/>
     Because he remembered the promise he had 
     <lb/>
     made in 1869 to those minorities. He re<lb break="no"/>membered that he. Lord Strathcona and the 
     <lb/>
     imperial government and Archbishop Taché 
     <lb/>
     had promised that the rights of the minori<lb break="no"/>ties in the Northwest should never be dis<lb break="no"/>turbed; and, faithful to his word, he did 
     <lb/>
     not object to that legislation, and the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the minorities were preserved. In 1880 
     <lb/>
     this parliament re-enacted most of the law 
     <lb/>
     which was passed in 1875. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) was then in 
     <lb/>
     the House, and I see by the Debates of that 
     <lb/>
     day that he made a speech—not on that 
     <lb/>
     question ; oh, no ; but he made a speech on 
     <lb/>
     some other question which was brought up 
     <lb/>
     on the same day on which the Bill was 
     <lb/>
     under consideration. Let us see what was 
     <lb/>
     declared in that Bill. Section 9, which was 
     <lb/>
     a new section, provided: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     When this matter was up before, I re<lb break="no"/>member that the hon. leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion asked me if this was a re-enactment. 
     <lb/>
     I have looked into the question since, and 
  

            <pb n="5227" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5227.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
      

     I find that it was not a re-enactment. I find 
     <lb/>
     that that section was enacted in 1880, and 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule), who to-day claims that the rights 
     <lb/>
     of minorities should not be protected, did 
     <lb/>
     not rise and protest against the incorpora<lb break="no"/>tion of such a law in our statutes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. When the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man asked me before in reference to that. 
     <lb/>
     I said that I had no recollection of it. I 
     <lb/>
     said that I was not then as familiar with 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act as I am to<lb break="no"/>day, and I did not know the purport of 
     <lb/>
     many of the clauses of that Act; so that 
     <lb/>
     enactments bearing upon it might be passed 
     <lb/>
     in this House without my knowing anything 
     <lb/>
     about them. But when the question was 
     <lb/>
     brought before the House in such a way 
     <lb/>
     that I understood it, I always opposed such 
     <lb/>
     an enactment. In support of that statement, 
     <lb/>
     I need only mention the fact that when Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Dalton McCarthy moved a resolution with 
     <lb/>
     regard to one of the clauses of the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1875, I both spoke and voted in favour of 
     <lb/>
     his motion, and what were the reasons I 
     <lb/>
     gave for doing so ? I said that while Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Thompson says we shall have power 
     <lb/>
     to give the Territories any kind of constitu<lb break="no"/>tion we like when we come to form them 
     <lb/>
     into provinces, and while other members 
     <lb/>
     think the same, the tendency of members. 
     <lb/>
     especially lawyers, was to have great re<lb break="no"/>gard for precedents, and when we come to 
     <lb/>that time the very fact that the minority 
     <lb/>may have enjoyed those rights for a num<lb break="no"/>ber of years will be quoted as giving them 
     <lb/>vested rights, which it will be held we have 
     <lb/>no moral right to take away from them. 
     <lb/>As I did not want to have that claim made, 
     <lb/>I voted against it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Is it true that before 
     <lb/>
     the introduction of this Bill which we are 
     <lb/>
    now considering, the hon. gentleman sent 
     <lb/>through the country some circulars asking 
     <lb/>people to protest against separate schools ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That is not true at all.

     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Is it true that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman was connected in any way, shape 
     <lb/>
     or form with the agitation which was excit<lb break="no"/>ed before the Bills in question were intro<lb break="no"/>duced ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. There is not a word with 
     <lb/>
     regard to separate schools in those petitions. 
     <lb/>
     They simply ask that the provinces be al<lb break="no"/>lowed free and absolute right to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the subject of education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. There is a great dif<lb break="no"/>ference then between the position taken by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman in 1880 and the position 
     <lb/>
     he now takes, before the introduction of 
     <lb/>
     these Bills. In 1880 when a Bill was passed 
     <lb/>
     by this Parliament containing this section 
     <lb/>
     10, which I shall read so that there may be 
     <lb/>
     no misunderstanding, he made no protest 
     <lb/>
     against it. My hon. friend says he does not 
     <lb/>
     know constitutional law. but this clause 10 
 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5227</fw>
     <fw type="num">5228</fw>
          

     speaks for itself and may be understood 
     <lb/>
     even by one who is-not versed in constitu<lb break="no"/>tional law. It is as follows :

     My hon. friend says he did not under<lb break="no"/>stand that section, and that is why he did

     not protest against it; but this session, 
     <lb/>
     before the Bills were even introduced, and 
     <lb/>
     consequently before he could have seen the

     I said I was not as amiliar with the clause

     <lb/>
     I am to-day. I did not say that I did not

     <lb/>
     friend was then able to read that clause 
     <lb/>
     10, and understand it. and I presume that 
     <lb/>
     when it spoke of separate schools, he knew 
     <lb/>
     what it meant. and when it spoke of the 
     <lb/>
     rights of minority he must have known what 
     <lb/>
     it meant. He did not then object. He did 
     <lb/>
     not then say a word against that clause 10 
     <lb/>
     of the Act of 1880 establishing separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. He did not protest that it was in 
     <lb/>
     violation of the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
     He had a speech to make that day on 
     <lb/>
     some other question, but on that question 
     <lb/>
     he had not a word to say. This session how<lb break="no"/>ever, before the Bills to establish these

     new provinces were introduced, and conse<lb break="no"/>quently before he could have known what

     <lb/>he started an agitation against them.

 <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The hon. gentleman must 
     <lb/>
     be aware that when the same question was 
     <lb/>
     brought up by the late Mr. Dalton McCarthy 
     <lb/>
     and discussed in this House, I took part in 
     <lb/>
     that discussion and stood exactly where I 
     <lb/>
     stand to-day. I then condemned, as I do 
     <lb/>
     now, the principle of taking the question 
     <lb/>
     of education out of the control of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I do not want to con<lb break="no"/>tinue the discussion longer with my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend. I suppose, however, we can agree 
     <lb/>
     that his position to-day would perhaps he 
     <lb/>
     more consistent, if he had taken a firmer 
     <lb/>
     stand in 1880. I am not complaining. I 
     <lb/>
     am glad, however, to note that to-day he 
     <lb/>
     is giving to his duties a little more atten<lb break="no"/>tion than he was then giving them. Per<lb break="no"/>haps the change of government may have 
     <lb/>
     something to do with the change in his 
     <lb/>
     position.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. And that change may 
     <lb/>
     equally account for the difference between 
     <lb/>
     the position which my hon. friend took in 
     <lb/>
     1896 and that which he takes in 1905.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. My hon. friend, the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition, said the other day 
     <lb/>
     that the Northwest Territories became en<lb break="no"/>titled in 1870 to the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act with regard to 
     <lb/>
     education. I am not sure that I could ac<lb break="no"/>cede to that legal proposition, but if there 
     <lb/>
     be any doubt that the minority acquired 
     <lb/>
     certain rights in 1870, there can be no 
     <lb/>
     doubt that section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act was applied to the minority 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories by the Act 
     <lb/>
     which we passed in 1880. Well, since 1880 
     <lb/>
     the minority have acquired some rights and 
     <lb/>
     privileges. They got some ordinances pas<lb break="no"/>sed in connection with education; and I 
     <lb/>
     am glad to say that the legislation which 
     <lb/>
     was passed in 1883, and which gave to the 
     <lb/>
     minority in the Territories the full meas<lb break="no"/>ure of their rights and privileges, was pre<lb break="no"/>pared by two of my colleagues, one of 
     <lb/>
     whom is the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Oliver). My hon. friend, the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior, was then a member of the 
     <lb/>
     territorial assembly and one of those who 
     <lb/>
     passed this legislation giving the minority 
     <lb/>
     the full measure of justice and the full 
     <lb/>
     measure of their rights. Whether the min<lb break="no"/>ority acquired those rights in 1870 or whe<lb break="no"/>ther they acquired them by the legislation of 
     <lb/>
     1880, there is no doubt that in 1880 separate 
     <lb/>
     schools were established, and there is no 
     <lb/>
     doubt that the minority have since been 
     <lb/>
    enjoying these rights in the Territories. 
     <lb/>Why then today, when we are constituting 
     <lb/>these Territories into provinces, should we 
     <lb/>not carry out the provisions of the law as 
     <lb/>embodied in the constitution of 1875 and in 
     <lb/>the British North America Act ? My hon. 
     <lb/>friend, the leader of the opposition says 
     <lb/>that section 93 of the Confederation Act 
     <lb/>should apply to these Territories when 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5229</fw>
     <fw type="num">5230</fw>
        

     they entered confederation in 1870. Well, 
     <lb/>
     if it does, the rights which the minority 
     <lb/>
     have since acquired can be protected by 
     <lb/>
     this government. The rights which they 
     <lb/>
     have achIired since their entry into confed<lb break="no"/>eration in 1870 can he and should be pro<lb break="no"/>tected by this government. We certainly 
     <lb/>
     have the right to legislate in that sense. I 
     <lb/>
     suppose my hon. friend will not dispute 
     <lb/>
     that We have the right to pass remedial 
     <lb/>
     legislation. Well, if We have the right by 
     <lb/>
     remedial legislation to give to the minority 
     <lb/>
     their rights and privileges, why should we 
     <lb/>
     not do that when we are giving these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces a constitution ?

            </p>
   
            <p>

     applies absolutely to the new provinces, can 
     <lb/>
     we, under the proposed amendment before 
     <lb/>
     us. vary that section 93 ? He will remem<lb break="no"/>ber that under the proposed amendment 
     <lb/>
     we eliminate subsection 1 of section 93— 
     <lb/>
     a very important clause—and substitute a 
     <lb/>
     new section. Have we power to do that? 
     <lb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I have not the least 
     <lb/>thought that we have power to do it. But 
     <lb/>section 2 of the Act of 1871 provides not 
     <lb/>only for giving a constitution to the North<lb break="no"/>west, but also for passing laws to preserve 
     <lb/>law and order in that portion of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. If we have the right to pass laws 
     <lb/>to maintain peace and order within these 
     <lb/>provinces, I say we certainly have the right 
     <lb/>to vary section 93 as we have done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. Then, section 93 does not 
     <lb/>
     apply absolutely if we have the right to 
     <lb/>
     vary it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. It does apply, but we 
     <lb/>
     have the right to change it, which is a 
     <lb/>
     different proposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. With the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's (Mr. Brodeur's) permission, I 
     <lb/>
     would like to ask a question in order that 
     <lb/>
     I may understand his argument. Does he 
     <lb/>
     mean that the Act of 1871 is broad enough 
     <lb/>
     to permit us to provide, in a Bill such as 
     <lb/>
     that we are now discussing, that the cus<lb break="no"/>toms or the post oflice, for example, should 
     <lb/>
     be within the legislative control of the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I do not think so ; and 
     <lb/>
     for this simple reason—that the address pre<lb break="no"/>sented by this parliament asking for the 
     <lb/>
     passing of this Act of 1871 expressly asked 
     <lb/>
     that the powers of the federal parliament 
     <lb/>
     should not be encroached upon by the legis<lb break="no"/>latures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Then does the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Mr. Brodeur) say that we could 
     <lb/>
     take any subject confided to the provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislatures by section 92 and transfer it to 
     <lb/>
     the authority of this parliament, when creat<lb break="no"/>ing the new provinces ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Yes, that is my opinion. 
     <lb/>
     Because the rights given under section 92 
     <lb/>
     are broad enough to even cover that. And 
     <lb/>
     we have to do it ; we actually are doing 
     <lb/>
     it in the case of the lands. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) discussed 
     <lb/>
     that question the other day, contending that 
     <lb/>
     we had not the right to change the law 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the lands. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     whether the leader of the opposition (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     R. L. Borden) is of the same opinion. I 
     <lb/>
     think we have the right to dispose of the 
     <lb/>
     question of lands as we are doing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. Is my hon. friend (Mr. Bro<lb break="no"/>deur) of opinion that we could take, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, exclusive jurisdiction over the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of agriculture? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I think so. Now, I 
     <lb/>
     must deal for a minute or two with a sub<lb break="no"/>ject which was not brought before this 
     <lb/>
     House, but was discussed in an address by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) 
     <lb/>
     at a meeting held in Montreal some time 
     <lb/>ago, and also in a letter which he wrote to<lb/>

     <fw type="num">5231</fw>
     <fw type="num">5232</fw>
      

     'La Patrie.' My hon. friend said that our 
     <lb/>
    Bill may protect the rights of the minority 
     <lb/>as to separate schools, but that the Cath<lb break="no"/>olic public schools would not fall under the 
     <lb/>constitutional enactment. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Bourassa) relies simply on subsec<lb break="no"/>tion 1 of section 93. Confining our attention 
     <lb/>to that subsection we find that, perhaps, his 
     <lb/>argument may have some weight. But I 
     <lb/>think that in order to have a proper under<lb break="no"/>standing of the subject we should not con<lb break="no"/>fine ourselves to that subsection, but should 
     <lb/>also consider the effect of subsections 3 and 
     <lb/>4. In his letter to ' La Patrie,' he forgot to 
     <lb/>quote the first part of the amendment moved 
     <lb/>by the leader of the government (Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>Laurier), which is as follows:

     Section 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act includes two different things ; Sub<lb break="no"/>section 1 deals with powers which the min<lb break="no"/>ority enjoy in regard to separate schools at 
     <lb/>
     the union, and subsections 3 and 4 provide 
     <lb/>
     for remedial legislation, and concern not 
     <lb/>
     only separate schools but any rights and pri<lb break="no"/>vileges which any minority may acquire 
     <lb/>
     with regard to education. Now, let us see 
     <lb/>
     section 93. Subsection 3 provides: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Where in any province a system of separate 
     <lb/>
     or dissentient schools exists by law at the 
     <lb/>
     union or is thereafter established by the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the province, an appeal shall lie to the

     Governor General in Council from any Act or

     decision of any provincial authority affecting 
     <lb/>
     any right or privilege of the Protestant or

     Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's sub<lb break="no"/>jects in relation to education.

            <p>
     We see that this subsection is much 
     <lb/>
     broader than subsection 1. Subsection 1 
     <lb/>
     simply protects the minority with regard to 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. But, under subsection 3 
     <lb/>
     not only the rights of the minority with 
     <lb/>
     respect to separate schools are protected, 
     <lb/>
     but all the rights of the minority in re<lb break="no"/>lation to education. So it comes to this,— 
     <lb/>
     if the legislature of the Northwest, after 
     <lb/>
     the Bill has been passed, should try to 
     <lb/>
     prevent the minority in any section of the 
     <lb/>
     province establishing schools to give edu<lb break="no"/>cation satisfactory to them or to use the 
     <lb/>
     French in these schools, there would be 
     <lb/>
     occasion to discuss the advisability of press<lb break="no"/>ing remedial legislation and exercising'the 
     <lb/>
     power of disallowance of the Act. So, I 
     <lb/>
     think the argument of my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Labelle is not a very strong one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. HENRI BOURASSA</persName>. Would the

     hon. gentleman (Mr. Brodeur) permit me? I 
     <lb/>
     did not hear the beginning of his argument 
     <lb/>
     in reply to the remarks I made in Mont<lb break="no"/>real. But I understand that he contends 
     <lb/>
     that, according to subsection 3 of section 93, 
     <lb/>
     there would be an appeal to the Governor 
     <lb/>
    in Council, and therefore an opening for

     remedial legislation, in case the legislature 
     <lb/>
     of one of the new provinces should deprive 
     <lb/>
     the Catholics of any rights they may pos<lb break="no"/>sess in relation to education outside the 
     <lb/>
     subject of separate schools. But I pre<lb break="no"/>sume that he agrees that under subsection 
     <lb/>
     1, is the only one under which the min<lb break="no"/>ority could come before any tribunal to 
     <lb/>
     have a law that encroaches upon these 
     <lb/>
     rights declared null. The proposed amend<lb break="no"/>ment deprives them of the right to ask for 
     <lb/>
     anything except protection of their rights 
     <lb/>
     in separate schools. I am not asking the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman to express any view on the 
     <lb/>
     subject, but, in view of the history of the 
     <lb/>
     last thirty years I have come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that while remedial legislation, so 
     <lb/>
     far as the Catholic minority are concerned, 
     <lb/>
     may exist in the letter of the law, it does 
     <lb/>
     not exist in fact. Anything that is not 
     <lb/>
     legally granted to minorities so that they 
     <lb/>
     may come before the tribunal and get a 
     <lb/>
     remedy of their grievance is no protection 
     <lb/>
     of their rights. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I do not quite agree 
     <lb/>
     with my hon. friend. I have always be<lb break="no"/>lieved that every legislature in this country 
     <lb/>
     must be supposed to carry out the law with 
     <lb/>
     a certain degree of honesty and rectitude. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps my hon. friend will not agree to 
     <lb/>
     that, but I may say this, that any law 
     <lb/>
     that might be passed in this parliament, if 
     <lb/>
     the provincial authorities did not try to 
     <lb/>
     carry it out according to its terms, that law 
     <lb/>
     would be of no effect, even if drafted by 
     <lb/>
     the ablest men you can find in this country. 
     <lb/>
     I say we must always rely to a large ex<lb break="no"/>tent upon the honesty and rectitude of the 
     <lb/>
     legislatures. I know very well, Mr. Speak<lb break="no"/>er, that in the province of Ontario, in spite 
     <lb/>
     of the law which now protects the minority 
     <lb/>
     in their rights, any provincial government 
     <lb/>
     could defeat the effect of that law without 
     <lb/>
     passing any legislation which would be de<lb break="no"/>clared illegal or unconstitutional under sec<lb break="no"/>tion 1. My hon. friend knows very well 
     <lb/>
     that the same thing could be done in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec with regard to the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant minority. But I repeat, we must 
     <lb/>
     have some faith in the rectitude and in the 
     <lb/>
     honesty of provincial legislatures. More<lb break="no"/>over, Mr. Speaker, why should we say 
     <lb/>
     that the rights of a minority are not suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently protected when the minority itself 
     <lb/>
     does not even complain of What has oc<lb break="no"/>curred since 1892? In 1892 an ordinance 
     <lb/>
     was passed by the Northwest legislature by 
     <lb/>
     which the rights of the minority were toa 
     <lb/>
     considerable extent curtailed. The mino<lb break="no"/>rity came before this government for relief, 
     <lb/>
     and the government refused to disallow the 
     <lb/>
     ordinance. My hon. friend from Beauhar<lb break="no"/>nois (Mr. Bergeron) said the other day that 
     <lb/>
     the government refused to disallow that 
     <lb/>
     ordinance because it was too late ; and also, 
     <lb/>
     because Mr. Blake had made a motion 
     <lb/>
     by which the government could not dis<lb break="no"/>allow that ordinance. I suppose my

     hon. friend will not make that contention 
     <lb/>
     to-day ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. Bergeron</persName>. Mr. Blake was speak<lb break="no"/>ing about the Manitoba Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. No, about the North<lb break="no"/>west. My hon. friend, in discussing the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest ordinances, said that they could 
     <lb/>
     not be disallowed because Mr. Blake had 
     <lb/>
     secured the adoption by the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons of a certain motion which prevented 
     <lb/>
     the government from acting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I was speaking about 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba law, not about the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     law. I gave another reason regarding the 
     <lb/>
     ordinances, I said that the ordinance of 
     <lb/>
     1892 was not disallowed because it was a 
     <lb/>
     reenactment of an ordinance of 1891, and 
     <lb/>
     that it was too late to disallow the ordi<lb break="no"/>nance of 1891. Then in answer to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend who asked why the government had 
     <lb/>
     not disallowed the ordinance of 1891, whe<lb break="no"/>ther it was too late to disallow the ordi<lb break="no"/>nance of 1892, I said, No, it was not too 
     <lb/>
     late, but the disallowance of the ordinance 
     <lb/>
     of 1892 would have been of no effect be<lb break="no"/>cause it was a re-enactment of the ordinance 
     <lb/>
     of 1891. That was the answer I gave my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Well, Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     was pretty sure- that my hon. friend, in dis<lb break="no"/>cussing the question of the Northwest, had 
     <lb/>
     mentioned the motion of Mr. Blake. But 
     <lb/>
     he must remember that the motion of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Blake had not the effect which he say it 
     <lb/>
     had. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I have just said that 
     <lb/>
     I was not talking about the motion of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Blake in regard to the Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies. When I mentioned the motion of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Blake, it was in connection with the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba question, not the other, although it 
     <lb/>
     might have the same effect. But I was not 
     <lb/>
     talking about that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Well, the government 
     <lb/>
     refused to disallow the ordinance of 1892, 
     <lb/>
     because the minority did not come here to 
     <lb/>
     ask the disallowance of an ordinance pre<lb break="no"/>viously passed. I speak subject to correc<lb break="no"/>tion, but that is my recollection. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. It was the ordinance 
     <lb/>
     of 1892 that came down here in 1893. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. At all events, the mino<lb break="no"/>rity since then has accepted that state of

     affairs. They had a right to come here and 
     <lb/>
     ask for remedial legislation. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) did not deny 
     <lb/>
     that they could have come to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment here and asked for remedial legisla<lb break="no"/>tion. But they did not do so, they accepted 
     <lb/>
     the situation, they abided by the decision of

     if the government dared to open a consti<lb break="no"/>tuency in the west, so strong was the feel<lb break="no"/>ing of the people against this Bill that no 
     <lb/>
     Liberal candidate would dare present him<lb break="no"/>self. Now we have the answer in the elec<lb break="no"/>tion by-acclamation of my hon. colleague 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     understand that the hon. gentleman made 
     <lb/>
     some reference to myself at a moment when 
     <lb/>
     I happened to be out of the chamber. Would 
     <lb/>
     he please repeat it ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I was merely saying 
     <lb/>
     for the benefit of my hon. friend that be<lb break="no"/>fore the present Minister of the Interior was 
     <lb/>
     called upon to enter the cabinet, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for South York boasted that the 
     <lb/>
     government dared not open any constituency 
     <lb/>
     in the west, and that if a constituency was 
     <lb/>
     opened no Liberal member would dare re<lb break="no"/>sign his seat and accept a portfolio in the 
     <lb/>
     cabinet. I remember the member for South 
     <lb/>
     York making that boast, and now I am 
     <lb/>
     surprised that the hon. gentleman was not 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently courageous to go into the North<lb break="no"/>west and oppose my hon. friend and col<lb break="no"/>league the Minister of the Interior. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Mr. Speaker. the 
     <lb/>
     challenge I made I repeat to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName> Yes, and it was. 
     <lb/>
     a challenge— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men will listen surely ? If they mean fight 
     <lb/>
     they will be fair in fighting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. The challenge I 
     <lb/>
     made— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>. Order.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Now, will you 
     <lb/>
     listen ? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. Yes.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Well listen then. 
     <lb/>
     The challenge I made was that if the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would open a seat in Ontario— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh.

     <fw type="num">5235</fw>
     <fw type="num">5236</fw>
       

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. I named the seats, 
     <lb/>
     and this in intolerant Ontario of which we 
     <lb/>
     hear so much, in which I would run. I will 
     <lb/>
     resign my seat to-day and run in South 
     <lb/>
     York against the hon. Postmaster General 
     <lb/>
     (Sir William Mulock), or I will resign my 
     <lb/>
     seat and if the hon. Postmaster General will 
     <lb/>
     resign his seat I will run against him in 
     <lb/>
     North York, or I will run in London or 
     <lb/>
     in Oxford. That is the challenge I made 
     <lb/>
     and, Mr. Speaker, you may have my resig<lb break="no"/>nation now if any hon. member will accept 
     <lb/>
     this challenge. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I accept, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     the explanation which has just been given by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for South York. I thought 
     <lb/>
     that he intended to go and fight in the North<lb break="no"/>west, but I see now that he wants simply 
     <lb/>
     to confine himself to the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario. Who are the people most interested? 
     <lb/>
     Who are people who should take the most 
     <lb/>
     interest in this question ? Is it the people 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario, or should it be the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest ? That is the question. In view 
     <lb/>
     of the alleged shackles which we are going 
     <lb/>
     to put on the new provinces it was in the 
     <lb/>
     west that the fight should have been made 
     <lb/>
     and I am sorry that my hon. friend who is 
     <lb/>
     full of vigour and energy has not enough 
     <lb/>
     vigour to go and fight in the Northwest as 
     <lb/>
     he should have done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Mr. Speaker—

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. I would go far<lb break="no"/>ther. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. My hon. friend, I sup<lb break="no"/>pose, does not intend to make a speech.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. No, but my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend asks me about the Northwest and he 
     <lb/>
    has thrown it up again at me. I will resign 
     <lb/>my seat to-day— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. And run against 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Lisgar (Mr. Greenway) 
     <lb/>
     or the hon. member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott). Let the hon. member for West 
     <lb/>
     Assinilioia, or the hon. member for Lisgar— 
     <lb/>
     Thomas Greenway—resign his seat to-day 
     <lb/>
     and I will run against him in his own con<lb break="no"/>stituency. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. We have had enough of 
     <lb/>
     all that. We know very well that this agita<lb break="no"/>tion which has been brought up by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for South York is now subsiding. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Well then take 
     <lb/>
     the challenge.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. We know very well 
     <lb/>
     that every day his friends are complaining 
     <lb/>
     of the action which he got his paper to 
     <lb/>
     take on this question. No, I will not follow 
     <lb/>
     him any more. He must accept the humil<lb break="no"/>iating position in which he put his party

     when to-morrow night the vote is taken on 
     <lb/>
     this question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. All right. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Now, I was discussing— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. BENNETT</persName>. Greenway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I was discussing the 
     <lb/>
     question which was brought up the other 
     <lb/>
     day in Montreal by my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Labelle and I was saying that if the min<lb break="no"/>ority has accepted the state of affairs which 
     <lb/>
     has existed since 1892, there is no reason 
     <lb/>
     why in this parliament we should go farther 
     <lb/>
     than what the minority has been accepting. 
     <lb/>
     Bishop Legal, who is certainly a good 
     <lb/>
     authority on this subject— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. Will the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man permit me a word again ? I am sorry 
     <lb/>
     to interrupt him so often, but as he has 
     <lb/>
     paid special attention to me, I suppose he 
     <lb/>
     will allow me an opportunity of expressing 
     <lb/>
     my opinion. As far as the right of inter<lb break="no"/>ference by this parliament is concerned in 
     <lb/>
     respect to the Northwest Territories I was 
     <lb/>
     under the impression, as was expressed, I 
     <lb/>
     think, by Sir John Thompson himself, that so 
     <lb/>
     far as the Northwest Territories were con<lb break="no"/>cerned, this government had no power of 
     <lb/>
     remedial legislation, but simply the power of 
     <lb/>
     disallowance. The minority came here and 
     <lb/>
     asked for disallowance in 1892, and it was re<lb break="no"/>fused by the then government. It is only be<lb break="no"/>cause they were refused this justice to which 
     <lb/>
     they were entitled that they accepted the 
     <lb/>
     I repeat in a nutshell that all I stated in 
     <lb/>
     Montreal was that the minority of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories are expecting from 
     <lb/>
     condition of affairs that then existed. But 
     <lb/>
     this parliament a full guarantee under the 
     <lb/>
     law of all they possess now and not simply 
     <lb/>
     the guarantee that this government may 
     <lb/>
     pass remedial legislation in respect to nine- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     tenths of what they are enjoying. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. For my part I rely on 
     <lb/>
     what the minority have been doing since 
     <lb/>
     1892, and I say that they get some protection 
     <lb/>
     under the legislation which we are now 
     <lb/>
     passing. If the legislature undertakes later 
     <lb/>
     on to destroy or abolish separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     or to abolish the Catholic public schools, 
     <lb/>
     then there will be a remedy at the hands 
     <lb/>
     of this parliament and besides there will be 
     <lb/>
     the right of disallowance. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     says that Sir John Thompson declared that 
     <lb/>
     remedial legislation could not exist in regard 
     <lb/>
     to the Northwest Territories. I never knew 
     <lb/>
     of any such opinion being expressed— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. Under the Act of 1875. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I have never heard of 
     <lb/>
     such an opinion being expressed, and I would 
     <lb/>
     be inclined to think that Sir John Thomp<lb break="no"/>son, if he did so express himself, was mis<lb break="no"/>taken, because, in the statute of 1880 and 
     <lb/>
     the Revised Statutes of 1886, it was 
     <lb/>
    specially provided that section 93 should 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5237</fw>
     <fw type="num">5238</fw>
     

     apply to the Northwest Territories. Under 
     <lb/>
     section 93 the power of remedial legislation 
     <lb/>
     exists and if section 93 was incorporated in 
     <lb/>
     the law of 1880, and 1886, I claim that there 
     <lb/>
     was the right of remedial legislation. But, 
     <lb/>
     the minority did not go so far. They 
     <lb/>
     accepted the situation as it was. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. They had to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. They accepted that state 
     <lb/>
     of affairs and I do not see why we should 
     <lb/>
     go into the province of Quebec and say the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics are asking for much more than is 
     <lb/>
     presented in this Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am sorry that I have detained the House 
     <lb/>
     so long. I had some other points that I 
     <lb/>
     wanted to make but I have kept the House 
     <lb/>
     so long that I think I will go no farther. 
     <lb/>
     We are now engaged in the consideration of 
     <lb/>
     a most serious question. Confederation, is 
     <lb/>
     now being submitted to a severe test. Old 
     <lb/>
     appeals on racial and religious grounds have 
     <lb/>
     been revived. We all remember how, a few 
     <lb/>
     years before confederation, these appeals 
     <lb/>
     contributed to render the government of 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty absolutely impossible in this 
     <lb/>
     country. Governments lasting a few years, 
     <lb/>
     a few months, a few days, were succeeding 
     <lb/>
     themselves and none was strong enough to 
     <lb/>
     carry on the affairs of the country. In 
     <lb/>
     spite of the most prosperous times the 
     <lb/>
     development of the country was at a stand<lb break="no"/>still. Some of these engaged most actively 
     <lb/>
     in that sectional warfare found one day 
     <lb/>
     that their unhappy policy was the cause of 
     <lb/>
     that unfortunate situation. They reflected 
     <lb/>
     and came to the conclusion that they had 
     <lb/>
     to lay down their arms and adopt a more 
     <lb/>
     sensible policy. Then, the confederation 
     <lb/>
     scheme was brought before the country. 
     <lb/>
     They thought that a confederation of all 
     <lb/>
     the British provinces would remedy the 
     <lb/>
     existing evil and they were right. Since 
     <lb/>
     confederation a spirit of toleration has ani<lb break="no"/>mated the great men that have been at the 
     <lb/>
     head of both political parties. Macdonald. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell, Tupper, Tilley, Mackenzie and 
     <lb/>
     Blake always respected the creed and the 
     <lb/>
     views of the minority. Confederation de<lb break="no"/>veloped in a most extraordinary way. New 
     <lb/>
     provinces were brought into the union, a 
     <lb/>
     vast territory was acquired, a great trans<lb break="no"/>continental railway was built, our canals 
     <lb/>
     and waterways were deepened, railways 
     <lb/>
     were subsidized throughout the country and 
     <lb/>
     millions have been spent to bring immi<lb break="no"/>grants from all parts of the world. We are 
     <lb/>
     all glad to know that during the last few 
     <lb/>
     years Canada has developed in to one of the 
     <lb/>
     most prosperous nations of the world. It 
     <lb/>
     was expected that those sacred traditions 
     <lb/>
     of the Conservative party would be kept 
     <lb/>
     up and that we would continue to enjoy 
     <lb/>
     peace and harmony. But, unfortunately, 
     <lb/>
     a section of the Conservative party today 
     <lb/>
     is forgetting the lessons of history and re<lb break="no"/>fuses to give to the minority the rights to 
     <lb/>
     which they are entitled under the constitu<lb break="no"/>

     <lb/>
     Already newspapers friendly to the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, but which are not in this fight of 
     <lb/>
     hatred, have given a warning note. The

     one of the best organs of the Conservative

     We must dwell together in mutual harmony and

     The 'Star' though a Conservative news<lb break="no"/>paper deplores the conduct of some of its 
     <lb/>
     political friends in relation to this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and it sees that they are going too 
     <lb/>
     far. I do not know whether the 'Star' 
     <lb/>
     would be justified in suggesting that our 
     <lb/>
     colonial relations might depend on the re<lb break="no"/>sult of this short-sighted policy of its 
     <lb/>
     friends. I sincerely hope that is not the 
     <lb/>
     case, and I trust and believe that those 
     <lb/>
     who for political purposes have been creat<lb break="no"/>ing a deplorable agitation in this country 
     <lb/>
     will not be seconded in their unpatriotic 
     <lb/>
     efforts by the electorate of Canada. In the 
     <lb/>
     name of my countrymen I can declare here 
     <lb/>
     that we are too much devoted to the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Crown to think for a moment of break<lb break="no"/>ing the British tie. And why? It is be<lb break="no"/>cause we are always certain to find under 
     <lb/>
     the British Crown protection for our rights 
     <lb/>
     and privileges ; it is because we will al<lb break="no"/>ways find on the throne of the British em<lb break="no"/>pire a sovereign desirous of supporting the 
     <lb/>
     cause of the weak and feeble ; it is because 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain will always respect her 
     <lb/>
     treaties. And, Sir, if mayhap. one day the 
     <lb/>
     agitators, backed up by a majority, should 
     <lb/>
     succeed in depriving the Catholics of their 
     <lb/>
     rights and privileges, we know that Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain will come to their rescue and pro<lb break="no"/>tect them against injustice. Is not the 
     <lb/>
     mother country to-day showing consider<lb break="no"/>ation for the sentiments of the minority by 
     <lb/>
     sending to Canada a representative whose 
     <lb/>
     family traditions are all on the side of tol<lb break="no"/>eration. We cannot forget that the Lord 
     <lb/>
     Grey of 1805 moved in the British parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to abolish the restriction that pre<lb break="no"/>vented Catholics from being officers in the 
     <lb/>
     army and navy ; we cannot forget that the 
     <lb/>
     Lord Grey of 1848 proposed in the House 
     <lb/>
     of Lords to restore the use of the French 
     <lb/>
     language in this parliament of Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     we remember his conduct with feelings of 
     <lb/>
     gratitude. Sir, what has been the at<lb break="no"/>titude taken by the opposition in this 
     <lb/>
     House during this controversy. We have 
     <lb/>
     them praising the institutions of the United 
     <lb/>
     States and casting slurs upon an institu<lb break="no"/>tion which all the best men of Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain have undertaken to preserve. Glad<lb break="no"/>stone once said:

     But, in this parliament we have men 
     <lb/>
     who uphold the neutral schools of the United 
     <lb/>
     States against the religious schools of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, and try in consequence to create 
     <lb/>
     distrust in British institutions. Gladstone's 
     <lb/>
     idea was that the colonies should try to 
     <lb/>
     reproduce in their laws the laws of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, and not seek inspiration for their 
     <lb/>
     laws in a foreign country. I submit, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     that the very legislation which the govern<lb break="no"/>ment now proposes is in conformity with 
     <lb/>
     our duty to incorporate in our laws the 
     <lb/>
     British ideas in order to cement our tie with 
     <lb/>
     the mother country. I have already said, and 
     <lb/>
     I repeat it now, that if by any misfortune, 
     <lb/>
     the ties between Canada and Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     should be strained, it will not be on account 
     <lb/>
     of any action on the part of my fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     citizens in the province of Quebec. How 
     <lb/>
     can this country continue to enjoy pros<lb break="no"/>perity and progress if the normal happy 
     <lb/>
     relations between different sections of the 
     <lb/>
     population are to be supplanted by feelings 
     <lb/>
     of mutual distrust and discord ? The only 
     <lb/>
     wise policy for Canada is a policy based 
     <lb/>
     on broad toleration, frank recognition of 
     <lb/>
     differences of opinion, and scrupulous re<lb break="no"/>gard for the feelings of those who may he 
     <lb/>
     in the minority. May I urge here the wis<lb break="no"/>dom, and not only the wisdom but the 
     <lb/>
     patriotic duty of every Canadian at a time 
     <lb/>
     like this when questions are at issue cal<lb break="no"/>culated to arouse rancorous feelings and 
     <lb/>
     heated prejudices; or the dangers of sec<lb break="no"/>tarian strife the result of which no man 
     <lb/>
     can foresee ; may I urge here that true pat<lb break="no"/>riotism decrees that the utmost tenderness 
     <lb/>
     and consideration for the conscience of 
     <lb/>
     others is perfectly consistent with the most 
     <lb/>
     valorous defence of the dictates of ones

     Mr. Speaker, I can assue you that it is with 
     <lb/>
     a great deal of temerity I rise to contri<lb break="no"/>bute a few words to this debate. I feel 
     <lb/>
     that I can add but little to what has been 
     <lb/>
     already said, but I believe it my duty, to 
     <lb/>
     give reasons for my vote on such an impor<lb break="no"/>tant matter as this. I formed an opinion 
     <lb/>
     upon the merits of the question when the 
     <lb/>
     Bill was first introduced, and I have listen<lb break="no"/>ed to the discussion which has taken place 
     <lb/>
     with the intention of becoming informed 
     <lb/>
     as far as possible from the views of others 
     <lb/>
     older in this parliament, older in the pub<lb break="no"/>lic life of this country and abler in debate 
     <lb/>
     than I am. I may say, Sir, that I am of 
     <lb/>
     the same opinion now that I was when this 
     <lb/>
     matter was first brought before the House. 
     <lb/>
     I regard this as a measure intended to give 
     <lb/>
     autonomy to two new provinces ; a mea<lb break="no"/>sure giving birth to two province; probably 


            <pb n="5241" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5241.jpg"/>

     the last to enter the confederation of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, and I feel that in granting that 
     <lb/>
     autonomy we should do so to the same ex<lb break="no"/>tent as other provinces have been given 
     <lb/>
     their rights and powers. I believe that the 
     <lb/>
     word 'autonomy' as mentioned in the Bill 
     <lb/>
     should have the significance that is given to 
     <lb/>
     it in common parlance and in the diction<lb break="no"/>aries which define autonomy to mean 'liv<lb break="no"/>ing according to one's own law or mind ; 
     <lb/>
     self-government.' I desire to view this 
     <lb/>
     Bill purely from the standpoint of the legal 
     <lb/>
     and constitutional questions involved, and 
     <lb/>
     I regret that on this occasion we are call<lb break="no"/>ed upon to deal with acrimonious questions 
     <lb/>
     that were discussed in former days and 
     <lb/>
     which we had hoped were set at rest when 
     <lb/>
     confederation was formed. I believe it 
     <lb/>
     was the intention of the founders of con<lb break="no"/>federation to arrive at a final decision as 
     <lb/>
     to what should be the underlying principles, 
     <lb/>
     the substrata of the confederation of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, and it seems to me that the idea of 
     <lb/>
     the public men of that day was that the 
     <lb/>
     questions which we are now discussing 
     <lb/>
     were then finally settled. In my view the 
     <lb/>
     powers which the then provinces were to 
     <lb/>
     have, and that all new provinces were to 
     <lb/>
     be accorded were laid down in defined and 
     <lb/>
     well understood axioms of our constitution. 
     <lb/>
     I believe that the educational question 
     <lb/>
     which is a very important one was sought 
     <lb/>
     to be set at rest by the Confederation Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1867, as amended by subsequent Acts. 
     <lb/>
     In looking at this Bill from a general stand<lb break="no"/>point the two most important features of 
     <lb/>
     it refer to the control of the lands and ques<lb break="no"/>tion of education. It is my opinion that 
     <lb/>
     the public domain of the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     should be controlled by those who are to 
     <lb/>
     administer the affairs of that country, and 
     <lb/>
     I found this opinion largely upon the state<lb break="no"/>ments of Hon. Alexander Mackenzie and 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Edward Blake, which were made 
     <lb/>
     during the discussion in this parliament 
     <lb/>
     when the Northwest Territories were being 
     <lb/>
     admitted into the union as Territories, and 
     <lb/>
     when the question also arose as to the then 
     <lb/>
     proposed admission of Newfoundland. It 
     <lb/>
     was proposed that Newfoundland should be 
     <lb/>
     given $150,000 a year in lieu of its lands. 
     <lb/>
     and the Hon. Edward Blake is on record as 
     <lb/>
     having said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     He was very strongly opposed to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion acquiring the Crown lands of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, and he has as strongly objected to New<lb break="no"/>foundland being deprived of its Crown lands. 
     <lb/>
     He commended the policy of the framers of the

     constitution in leaving to each of the provinces

     the control of their own public lands. This 
     <lb/>
     was from the Canadian point of view. Then as

     to Newfoundland the arrangement was equally

     objectionable : (1) its distance from the seat 
     <lb/>
     of government, (2) and its small representation

     I think that is a very fair statement 
     <lb/>
     of the principle that should guide parliament 
     <lb/>
     to-day ; and I cite the case of my own 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario, in which we exer<lb break="no"/>cise actual ownership over the public do<lb break="no"/>main—the land, the timber and the minerals 
     <lb/>
     —as do the other provinces. There may 
     <lb/>
     be minor reasons why it might be Wise to 
     <lb/>
     keep the lands under the management of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion ; but we are not legislating 
     <lb/>
     simply for to-day ; we are legislating for 
     <lb/>
     all time, and I think all the larger points 
     <lb/>
     of advantage are in favour of allowing the 
     <lb/>
     public domain to remain in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces and not in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. I think that the policy we should 
     <lb/>
     pursue in Canada in regard to the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of the public domain should be the 
     <lb/>
     British policy ; and the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act lays down in its very first recital 
     <lb/>
     that it is intended to establish ' a Domin<lb break="no"/>ion under the Crown of the United King<lb break="no"/>dom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a 
     <lb/>
     constitution similar in principle to that 
     <lb/>
     of the United Kingdom.' Now, we find that 
     <lb/>
     it has been the custom of the imperial autho<lb break="no"/>rities, I may safely say at all times, to allow 
     <lb/>
     the colonies, be they great or small, after 
     <lb/>
     they have ceased to be Crown colonies, and 
     <lb/>
     have become entitled to representative gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, to retain in their hands the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of their own affairs with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the public domain. We are to-day giv<lb break="no"/>ing these provinces an indemnity in lieu 
     <lb/>
     of their lands ; and I venture to say that 
     <lb/>
     that is only a matter of guess work. We 
     <lb/>
     are giving them what is now considered a 
     <lb/>
     fair compensation for depriving them of 
     <lb/>
     their lands. That may or may not be an 
     <lb/>
     adequate amount in- the future. It may 
     <lb/>
     work out as a hardship on this parliament, 
     <lb/>
     or as a hardship on the Territories, as the 
     <lb/>
     case may be. Further, pursuing what I 
     <lb/>
     understand to be the policy of the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party, the policy of decentralization, which 
     <lb/>
     has always commended itself to my mind, 
     <lb/>
     I think it is best to let the local authorities 
     <lb/>
     have such power as they are entitled to, 
     <lb/>
     and as it is reasonably possible to let them 
     <lb/>
     have, so as to prevent congestion at one 
     <lb/>
     particular point of interest which may be

     question ; as a representative of the city of 
     <lb/>
     Toronto, I regret to have heard in this House 
     <lb/>
     on more than one occasion references made 
     <lb/>
     to that city which I think were highly un<lb break="no"/>fair. I submit, Sir, that the language was 
     <lb/>
     unparliamentary, it certainly was untrue, 
     <lb/>
     in which Toronto was referred to as being 
     <lb/>
     a hot-bed of bigotry and intolerance. This 
     <lb/>
     remark was made by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair) by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Ontario (Mr. Grant) and I 
     <lb/>
     think by other hon. gentlemen opposite. I 
     <lb/>
     myself stand here in this parliament as a 
     <lb/>
     living protest against that statement, be<lb break="no"/>ing a member of the minority, not only the 
     <lb/>
     minority in this country, but the minority 
     <lb/>
     in the city of Toronto, where there is a dis<lb break="no"/>parity of about five or six to one in the rid<lb break="no"/>ing which I represent and some ten to one 
     <lb/>
     throughout the whole city ; and I think 
     <lb/>
     it fair to say that that city is not bigoted 
     <lb/>
     and intolerant, which elected me in the face 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition of two governments, the 
     <lb/>
     late Ross government and this government. 
     <lb/>
     I am not complaining of that. for we 
     <lb/>
     have to face opposition in the politi<lb break="no"/>cal world as in other departments of 
     <lb/>
     life ; but I am placing on record the 
     <lb/>
     fact that in the face of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     of these two governments, I a Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic, was elected by a very substantial 
     <lb/>
     majority in a constituency where there 
     <lb/>
     were some ten thousand votes on the list, 
     <lb/>
     about two thousand of which were Catholic 
     <lb/>
     votes ; and I attribute that to the fair<lb break="no"/>ness, the liberaiity and the toleration of 
     <lb/>
     my non-Catholic brethren, my friends and 
     <lb/>
     neighbours in the city of Toronto. I will 
     <lb/>
     go further : I will say that hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite found the city of Toronto not a 
     <lb/>
     bigoted place in 1896. I recollect the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General (Sir William Mulock) 
     <lb/>
     coming there as the representative of the 
     <lb/>
     present premier of this country to attend 
     <lb/>
     a public meeting, and expressing senti<lb break="no"/>ments and opinions which were then in 
     <lb/>
     accord with the public sentiment of that 
     <lb/>
     city. He took advantage of that public 
     <lb/>
     sentiment, and his government took advant<lb break="no"/>age of it then and have taken advantage of 
     <lb/>
     it ever since. I will go further, and will 
     <lb/>
     quote an authority. I think no hon. member 
     <lb/>
     of this House, either present or past, can be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as a more representative exponent 
     <lb/>
     of the French Canadian race than the late 
     <lb/>
     member for L'Islet, the Hon. Mr. Tarte ; 
     <lb/>
     and when he on more than one occasion, as 
     <lb/>
     one of the ministers of the Crown, visited 
     <lb/>
     that city, he was always given a most hand<lb break="no"/>some and cordial reception, and he is on 
     <lb/>
     record as saying that there was no place 
     <lb/>
     which he had greater pleasure in visiting 
     <lb/>
     than the city of Toronto, to make new 
     <lb/>
     acquaintances and to renew old ones. And 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     he will be given a courteous hearing, he Will

     I ventured a moment ago to say that the 
     <lb/>
     question of the legality of the Bill now 
     <lb/>
     before the House was purely a constitutional 
     <lb/>
     question. That Bill, as now framed, is, in 
     <lb/>
     my opinion, a direct invasion of the provin<lb break="no"/>cial prerogative in regard to the matters 
     <lb/>
     therein contained, those more especially 
     <lb/>
     which are referred to in the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. leader of the opposition. We have 
     <lb/>
     to see in what way this parliament is em<lb break="no"/>powered to pass an Act creating two new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. These provinces are being creat<lb break="no"/>ed or erected under the Act of 1871. What 
     <lb/>
     does that Act say ? By section 4 it gives 
     <lb/>
     plenary powers to this parliament to admin<lb break="no"/>ister the affairs of those districts so long 
     <lb/>
     as they are territories ; but when they are 
     <lb/>
     to be created into provinces, we have to 
     <lb/>
     look to section 2, which is the authority 
     <lb/>
     under which these provinces are now being 
     <lb/>
     created. It is unnecessary for me to read 
     <lb/>
     that section to the House, which is already 
     <lb/>
     familiar with it. I desire to refer for a 
     <lb/>
     moment to the correspondence that took 
     <lb/>
     place regarding the passing of this imperial 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1871, because it is contended by 
     <lb/>
     some that the powers vested in the Do<lb break="no"/>minion by this Act are what are called plen<lb break="no"/>ary powers and give to this parliament the 
     <lb/>
     right to clothe these provinces with any con<lb break="no"/>stitution it may deem fit. It is well, there<lb break="no"/>fore, to see what was the intention of the 
     <lb/>
     framers of this Act, what was the view they 
     <lb/>
     had in mind when it was being framed and 
     <lb/>
     put through the imperial House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. When it was found necessary for 
     <lb/>
     Canada to pass what is called 'the doubt 
     <lb/>
     removing Act,' both with regard to Manito<lb break="no"/>ba and the Territories, an Order in Council 
     <lb/>
     was passed by the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     and sent to the home authorities requesting 
     <lb/>
     that legislation of this nature be enacted. 
     <lb/>
     and I shall read now an extract from the 
     <lb/>
     report of the then Minister of Justice of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, the late Sir John Macdonald, ap<lb break="no"/>proved by His Excellency the Governor 
     <lb/>
     General in Council on the 27th December, 
     <lb/>
     1870, and which was in effect a petition to 
     <lb/>
     the Earl of Kimberly, then Secretary of 
     <lb/>
     State for the Colonies, to have the imperial 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1871 passed by the British parlia» 
     <lb/>
     ment. That Act is entitled 'An Act to em<lb break="no"/>power the Dominion parliament from time 
     <lb/>
     to time to establish other provinces in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories,' and it goes on to

     The undersigned has to observe that it is

     <lb/>
     and like them shall hold its constitution subject

            <p>
     I submit that this correspondence shows 
     <lb/>
     conclusively the intention of the framers of 
     <lb/>
     the Act, and I submit that the Act contains 
     <lb/>
     this underlying principle, namely, that it 
     <lb/>
     was absolutely necessary that any province 
     <lb/>
     to be created under this Act shall hold the 
     <lb/>
     same status as the four provinces then in 
     <lb/>
     the confederation. We can understand very 
     <lb/>
     readily why such language was used. The 
     <lb/>
     then provinces comprising this Dominion 
     <lb/>
     were jealous lest any other province should, 
     <lb/>
     by any possibility, in the future obtain great<lb break="no"/>er powers than they themselves enjoyed. 
     <lb/>
     There had been a struggle for equality all 
     <lb/>
     through. All through the framers of con<lb break="no"/>federation were struggling for equality. 
     <lb/>
     Sometimes the elfort was to repress the 
     <lb/>
     struggles for supremacy that would break 
     <lb/>
     out here and there on the part of certain 
     <lb/>
     provinces, and they were all exceedingly de<lb break="no"/>sirous that no new province should have 
     <lb/>
     any greater powers than they themselves 
     <lb/>
     possessed. Undoubtedly it was not thought 
     <lb/>
     necessary then to suggest to the imperial 
     <lb/>
     authorities to pass an Act which would give 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion parliament the right to create 
     <lb/>
     new provinces with less power. No one 
     <lb/>
     then considered the possibility of our creat<lb break="no"/>ing new provinces with less powers than 
     <lb/>
     those which the older provinces had acquir<lb break="no"/>ed. Suppose, for instance, that in this Bill 
     <lb/>
     we omitted to provide for certain powers 
     <lb/>
     which properly pertain to a province with 
     <lb/>
     regard to many matters that suggest them<lb break="no"/>selves, and which are provided for in sec<lb break="no"/>tion 92 of the British North America Act— 
     <lb/>
     suppose these powers were left out, who 
     <lb/>
     would supply them ? That is a very perti<lb break="no"/>nent question. This parliament could not 
     <lb/>
     do so. I apprehend that the powers of this 
     <lb/>
     parliament would be exhausted by enacting 
     <lb/>
     the constitution, and consequently would be 
     <lb/>
     ' functus officio ' as regards the amending 
     <lb/>
     of it afterwards. These provinces would 
     <lb/>
     simply have to go to the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment in order to obtain imperial legislation 
     <lb/>
     to rectify any omission that might have 
     <lb/>
     occurred in the Act creating them, and to 
     <lb/>
     which they are entitled by law as members 
     <lb/>
     of the confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We had that Act passed—the Act of 1871. 
     <lb/>
     Then the Act of 1886 was passed ; and by

     <fw type="num">5245</fw>
     <fw type="num">5246</fw>
      

     section 3 of that Act we find that the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal Act of 1867 and the Act of 1871 and 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1886 are all to be construed to<lb break="no"/>gether as the BritiSh North America Act of 
     <lb/>
     1867 to 1886. In that way I consider that 
     <lb/>
     the full force and effect of the original Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Act is brought in, and 
     <lb/>
     it is made to form part of the Act or 1871 
     <lb/>
     and the Act of 1886, so that they are all to 
     <lb/>
     be construed together in the creation of 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces. And I submit, there<lb break="no"/>fore, that wherever you find the words ' sub<lb break="no"/>ject to the provisions of this Act in the 
     <lb/>
     original Act of 1867.' You must read them 
     <lb/>
     as applying to these three Acts concurrently 
     <lb/>
     and correlatively, and that these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are to be considered as being con<lb break="no"/>stituted under these combined Acts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to refer for a moment to the 
     <lb/>
     bargain, if I may describe the transaction 
     <lb/>
     by that term, which took place when these 
     <lb/>
     lands first came under the jurisdiction of 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada, and I think it 
     <lb/>
     will be found to bear out my contention, 
     <lb/>
     namely, that the constitution of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces must be in accord with the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act of 1867. 
     <lb/>
     I shall refer first to the address from the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Senate and House of Commons to 
     <lb/>
     the Queen, praying that the territory, then 
     <lb/>
     known as Rupert's Land, be taken over 
     <lb/>
     from the Hudson Bay Company and that 
     <lb/>
     Canada be given the right to legislate for 
     <lb/>
     its peace, order and good government. From 
     <lb/>
     that address I take the following extract:

     So, throughout all the documents leading 
     <lb/>
     up to the transfer of this territory to Can<lb break="no"/>ada, stress is laid upon the fact that when 
     <lb/>
     this territory becomes part of Canada, it 
     <lb/>
     shall do so under and in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the terms of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act. Now, in that view of the case, and 
     <lb/>
     having the British North America Act im<lb break="no"/>ported into the Act of 1871, under which 
     <lb/>
     this Bill is brought down, it seems clear, 
     <lb/>
     according to my reason and judgment, that 
     <lb/>
     the whole Act applies, and that these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are entitled to the same measure of 
     <lb/>
     responsibility as the other provinces under 
     <lb/>
     all the sections of the Act, except where 
     <lb/>
     by direct statement of reasonable intend<lb break="no"/>ment only one or more provinces and not 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces is intended. That being 
     <lb/>
     the case, it seems to me that section 93 
     <lb/>
     applies to the Territories referred to in this 
     <lb/>
     Bill. It seems to me that section 93 applies 
     <lb/>
     by force and operation of the law, and, by 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of the Bill it is made to apply 
     <lb/>
     expressly, for it is so stated in the section, 
     <lb/>
     and the side note states 'British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act, 1867 to 1886 to apply.' And 
     <lb/>
     so the minority in that province will have 
     <lb/>
     every benefit of these sections and every 
     <lb/>
     benefit of the law. And, whatever the 
     <lb/>
     law may be, in all parts of Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     minority equally with the majority have to 
     <lb/>
     submit. It may be that to-morrow the mino<lb break="no"/>rity may be seeking the protection of the 
     <lb/>
     statute that is now being invoked ; they 
     <lb/>
     may need the protection of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. It does seem to me that it is 
     <lb/>
     better that the law should be lived up to, 
     <lb/>
     that in these matters we should, as it were, 
     <lb/>
     hue to the line, and that the law as laid down 
     <lb/>
     in our constitution should be maintained 
     <lb/>
     with regard to all classes of the community. 
     <lb/>
     And I believe that the minority in this coun<lb break="no"/>try have no desire to wrest from the major<lb break="no"/>ity anything to which they are not entitled. 
     <lb/>
     Moreover. I believe that the minority in 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces will receive a larger 
     <lb/>
     measure of justice if they are left to their 
     <lb/>
     legal rights.

     would be a blessing or whether that would be

     a great detriment to those new provinces, but 
     <lb/>
     I do say that hon. gentlemen opposite who have 
     <lb/>
     gone out of their way to attack separate schools 
     <lb/>
     should think twice and that they should think 
     <lb/>
     long before they vote for an amendment which 
     <lb/>
     will have the effect that I have just pointed out.

     And the hon. member for North Simcoe

     ——in there as it stands—and they are certainly

     entitled to something like that—if you do not

     vary it, you will have a system of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools imposed upon these provinces, a more 
     <lb/>
     effective system, in the interests of supporters 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools, than the present clause 16. 
     <lb/>
     In that respect I agree with the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Beaurharnois (Mr. Bergeron), who made the 
     <lb/>
     suggestion last night that such would be the 
     <lb/>
     result. Now, if that is so, I ask again for pro<lb break="no"/>tection in that regard for those who think as 
     <lb/>
     I do upon that question. It is necessary to vary 
     <lb/>
     this Act if you want to get rid of the effect of 
     <lb/>
     clause 93 of the British North America Act, and 
     <lb/>
     to do that you will have to insert in this Bill 
     <lb/>
     some such clause as that the provinces shall

     have unconditionally the exclusive right to 
     <lb/>
     legislate on educational matters. If you do not 
     <lb/>
     do that. then I say that the constitution will 
     <lb/>
     take its course, and the courts will decide that

     be what is in clause 16 now and what clause 93

     would give them.

     Now, Sir, a word as to the changes we have 
     <lb/>
     made in that clause. I stated the other day 
     <lb/>
     that we propose to make a change and we have 
     <lb/>
     given notice of an amendment which we intend 
     <lb/>
     to move to clause 16. What is the reason of 
     <lb/>
     this change ? It is a fair question to ask and 
     <lb/>
     a question to be answered. Sir, we have taken 
     <lb/>
     the ground on more than one occasion, we again 
     <lb/>
     take this ground and it is the ground upon 
     <lb/>
     which we stand in dealing with the present 
     <lb/>
     case, that wherever a system of separate schools 
     <lb/>
     exists that system comes into force and is con<lb break="no"/>stitutionally entitled to the guarantees which 
     <lb/>
     are embodied in secion 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. Be that system much, be it 
     <lb/>
     little, whatever it is, it is entitled to those 
     <lb/>
     guarantees. That is the position we take, and 
     <lb/>
     when we introduce section 16, as it is in the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, we had no other intention than to give to 
     <lb/>
     the minority the rights and privileges to which 
     <lb/>
     they are entitled under the law which they have

     So, Sir, now whenever a province comes here 
     <lb/>
     knocking at this door asking to be admitted 
     <lb/>
     into confederation, if in that province there 
     <lb/>
     exists a system of separate schools, the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Act has provided that the 
     <lb/>
     same guarantee we give to the minority in Que<lb break="no"/>bec and Ontario shall also be given to the min<lb break="no"/>ority in that province.

            <p>
     I think that is a fair statement of the 
     <lb/>
     effect of the law as it stands. Now I sub<lb break="no"/>mit, this is a legal question, not a question 
     <lb/>
     or a matter of policy. I repeat what I said 
     <lb/>
     before, that I believe this question was set 
     <lb/>
     at rest when confederation was formed, 
     <lb/>
     because in the Acts embodying confeder<lb break="no"/>ation and carrying out its principles we 
     <lb/>
     find all the machinery, so to speak, and, I 
     <lb/>
     may safely say a method of working out all 
     <lb/>
     questions which might come before the par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada in the then future. It 
     <lb/>
     does seem to me that the foundation was 
     <lb/>
     laid sufficiently broad and sufficiently deep, 
     <lb/>
     and that the terms of confederation were 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently elastic in themselves to permit 
     <lb/>
     of an honest and fair interpretation of 
     <lb/>
     that Act by the parliament of Canada in 
     <lb/>
     such a way that it will at all times bear 
     <lb/>
     the fruits intended by its founders, and 
     <lb/>
     at all times work out, the good that it was 
     <lb/>
     intended to produce for the Canadian peo<lb break="no"/>ple. There is little we can differ upon in 
     <lb/>
     that Act. It does seem to me to be a great 
     <lb/>
     pity that we in Canada who agree upon 
     <lb/>
     so many and who differ upon so few things, 
     <lb/>
     should be at variance on this question, a 
     <lb/>
     question which has aroused so much un<lb break="no"/>pleasantness, and I am sorry to say, so much 
     <lb/>
     bitterness in this country. I regret it ex<lb break="no"/>ceedingly. I say it is a lamentable condi<lb break="no"/>tion of affairs that we should be face to 
     <lb/>
     face with the heat of discussion in this


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5249</fw>

     House and with the heat of discussion out<lb break="no"/>side of this House and in the press of the 
     <lb/>
     country. I must say that in my opinion 
     <lb/>
     I think all that is unnecessary. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that the law as it was laid down could have 
     <lb/>
     been admirably worked out in such a way 
     <lb/>
     as to have avoided all this discussion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I desire to revert once more to that 
     <lb/>
     feature of the constitution, because to my 
     <lb/>
     mind it is an all important question. In 
     <lb/>
     discussing this matter in parliament hon. 
     <lb/>
     members may have different opinions, the 
     <lb/>
     opposition may differ from the government, 
     <lb/>
     hon. members on the same side of the 
     <lb/>
     House may differ from one another. But 
     <lb/>
     after all, where are these questions ultimate<lb break="no"/>ly to be settled, where do they wind up ? I 
     <lb/>
     am safe in saying that constitutional mat<lb break="no"/>ters of this kind, matters of great weight 
     <lb/>
     and moment, do not end in parliament. The 
     <lb/>
     courts are to that extent above parliament 
     <lb/>
     in their right of deciding that they may 
     <lb/>
     interpret the powers of parliament, they 
     <lb/>
     have the power of deciding whether an 
     <lb/>
     Act of this parliament is ultra vires or in<lb break="no"/>tra vires. whether this parliament can in<lb break="no"/>vade the provincial domain with impunity 
     <lb/>
     or whether it cannot. That principle has 
     <lb/>
     been invoked a hundred times in respect 
     <lb/>
     of provincial legislation, the correlative 
     <lb/>
     remedy has been applied, for in many cases 
     <lb/>
     where it has been invoked against provin<lb break="no"/>cial legislation which has been declared null 
     <lb/>
     and void. So it will be in the future with 
     <lb/>
     regard to this Bill. Acts of this parliament 
     <lb/>
     have been passed upon by the courts and 
     <lb/>
     they will be in the future. It seems to me to 
     <lb/>
     be begging the question to say that we must 
     <lb/>
     take a business man's view of a constitu<lb break="no"/>tional question, or we must take a states<lb break="no"/>man's view, because after all the view that 
     <lb/>
     will prevail will be the legal view. Why 
     <lb/>
     not view this whole question as a legal one, 
     <lb/>
     because that is what it will ultimately be, 
     <lb/>
     If I am correctly informed, the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the validity of this Act will 
     <lb/>
     not rest here. If I am credibly in<lb break="no"/>formed—and I have very little doubt 
     <lb/>
     of the correctness of my information—it 
     <lb/>
     will pass on to the courts. It will not end 
     <lb/>
     here, but it may come back here in the 
     <lb/>
     shape of an application for remedial legis<lb break="no"/>lation. History may repeat itself. I hope 
     <lb/>
     sincerely on behalf of the minority that 
     <lb/>
     history will not repeat itself in the calam<lb break="no"/>itous disasters that resulted from the last 
     <lb/>
     appeal to this parliament by a minority for 
     <lb/>
     remedial legislation. Now, Sir. I pass on to 
     <lb/>
     the View of this question, not of a legal 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, not of a statesman, but of a lay<lb break="no"/>man, the Postmaster General. What does 
     <lb/>
     he say upon this question ?

     Now, Mr. Speaker, I submit with all due

     deference to the hon. gentleman who utter<lb break="no"/>ed these words, that this parliament has 
     <lb/>
     no discretion to grant or to withhold from 
     <lb/>
     a province, when creating it, what it is 
     <lb/>
     legally entitled to under the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. I submit that parliament has 
     <lb/>
     no discretion in regard to what powers 
     <lb/>
     the provinces shall receive; because if it 
     <lb/>
     has a discretion, where does that discretion 
     <lb/>
     end ? Parliament might go the full limit, 
     <lb/>
     they might confer upon the province all 
     <lb/>
     those powers that the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act reserves to the Dominion, they might 
     <lb/>
     give to the province all the powers the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion has, and they might withhold 
     <lb/>
     from the province all the powers the pro<lb break="no"/>vince has under the British North America

     Act. In referring to this subject, 1 men<lb break="no"/>tion the question of education. I am tak<lb break="no"/>ing it from the lawyer's standpoint, from 
     <lb/>
     the standpoint of the framers of the consti<lb break="no"/>tution. If, as it is contended, the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada has a right to pass the 
     <lb/>
     Bill now before the House, which contains 
     <lb/>
     legislation in regard to education, we admit 
     <lb/>
     the principle, and how far can that prin<lb break="no"/>ciple be carried ? If you admit the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple where are you going to end ? Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment might go to the full extent of legis<lb break="no"/>

     lating in regard to education for all time to 
     <lb/>
     come, they might take all educational mat<lb break="no"/>ters out of the hands of the province abso<lb break="no"/>lutely. I submit with all deference to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman that it cannot be argued 
     <lb/>
     that the parliament of Canada who created 
     <lb/>
     this province can take from it every vestige 
     <lb/>
     of a right to legislate in regard to matters 
     <lb/>
     of education, because another government 
     <lb/>
    might come in who would act in 
     <lb/>a very different way, another gov<lb break="no"/>ernment might act in direct oppo<lb break="no"/>sition to the way this government has acted, 
     <lb/>because, after all, governments go and gov<lb break="no"/>ernments come. If the government have 
     <lb/>the right and power to legislate in the do<lb break="no"/>main of education, no doubt they can legis<lb break="no"/>late to the full extent either adversely to 
     <lb/>the minority, or in favour of the minority, 
     <lb/>or adverseiy to the majority or in favour 
     <lb/>of the majority. Where is it going to end? 
     <lb/>Surely the argument, if they have the right 
     <lb/>to pass this legislation, in view of that 
     <lb/>statement, must hold good. It does seem 
     <lb/>to me that the British North America Act 
     <lb/>opposes very strongly the passing of this 
     <lb/>legislation because we have always thought 
     <lb/>that we had the British North America Act 
     <lb/>as our guarantee and we have relied upon 
     <lb/>it as we should rely upon our constitution. 
     <lb/>It does seem to me that it is ignoring and 
     <lb/>overriding that Act because the Bill in its 
     <lb/>very terms does proceed to amend the 
     <lb/>British North America Act in vital points. 
     <lb/>I do not know what the intention of 
     <lb/>hon. gentlemen opposite may be whether 
     <lb/>it is their intention to ask the imper<lb break="no"/>ial parliament to confirm this legislation 
     <lb/>or not, but certainly in the absence of 
     <lb/>confirmation by the imperial authorities, I 
     <lb/>do not think it will be seriously contend<lb break="no"/>ed in this House that the parliament of 
     <lb/>Canada has the right to pass the legislation 
     <lb/>now before the House. I think if they do 
     <lb/>it will be a matter of regret, because I be<lb break="no"/>lieve the question will find its way into the 
     <lb/>courts, and if my opinion is worth any<lb break="no"/>thing on, this subject, and if the opinion 
     <lb/>of eminent counsel whom I have consulted 
     <lb/>is worth anything, then I say the Act is 
     <lb/>ultra vires. I have consulted counsel who 
     <lb/>will probably be concerned in this case if 
     <lb/>it ever reaches the courts and I believe I 
     <lb/>am correctly informed by counsel as to 
     <lb/>what will be in all likelihood the result of

     desire to point out that parliament today 
     <lb/>
     is not, as it were, dealing with children or 
     <lb/>
     babies in regard to this Northwest ques<lb break="no"/>tion. It is dealing with Territories which 
     <lb/>
     parliament itself has been treating as pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, to which it has been giving the

     power of provinces, and parliament has 
     <lb/>
     been dealing with them in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     matter of education as if they were under 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act and subject

     Now, I just desire to say a few words

     more. I desire to put on record my pro<lb break="no"/>test against legislation by reference such 
     <lb/>
     as this is. This measure embodies a form 
     <lb/>
     of legislation that is not now enacted in 
     <lb/>
     regard to any important matter. At the 
     <lb/>
     present time this form of legislation has 
     <lb/>
     almost entirely disappeared from the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish House of Commons. This is legislation 
     <lb/>
     by legislatlng into an Act some other Act, 
     <lb/>
     or parts of another Act or parts of other 
     <lb/>
     Acts. The legal authorities are all very 
     <lb/>
     clear upon this point. Hardcastle on the 
     <lb/>
     Construction and Effect of Statute Law is 
     <lb/>
     a book that is well known, a leading au<lb break="no"/>thority on that matter, and at page 28 of 
     <lb/>
     that book we find the following statement :

     Legislation by reference is usually

     the outcome, not of negligence, ignorance, or 
     <lb/>
     incapacity in the draughtsman, but of the foibles 
     <lb/>
     of parliament, and is excused on the ground 
     <lb/>
     that it lessens political difficulties and simpli<lb break="no"/>fies the process of getting Bills through com<lb break="no"/>mittee by lessening the area for amendment. 
     <lb/>
     The same excuse is made for the practice of

     difficult that the judges themselves can hardly

            <p>
     That was in 1875. Since then the prac<lb break="no"/>tice has been gradually discontinued and 
     <lb/>
     is today looked upon with disfavour in the 
     <lb/>
     British House of Commons. I think that 
     <lb/>
     is a good reason Why the Bill should not 
     <lb/>
     be approved of in its present form. Now, 
     <lb/>
     I claim that it is unwise to stereotype and 
     <lb/>
     crystallize into law for ever a certain condi<lb break="no"/>tion of affairs existing at any one time. I 
     <lb/>
     think that to remove the elasticity which 
     <lb/>
     should be about a measure of this kind and 
     <lb/>
     to limit for all time to come a set of prin<lb break="no"/>ciples which in future years may become a 
     <lb/>
     hardship to the minority or to the majority 
     <lb/>
     of the people of that country is a mistake, 
     <lb/>
     and that it would have been better to have 
     <lb/>
     left it subject to the power to change from

     time to time. Now, it cannot be changed 
     <lb/>
     except by legislation by the imperial House 
     <lb/>
     if this Act is held to be good which I very 
     <lb/>
     much doubt. What will the minority get 
     <lb/>
     by the Bill? It is said that it is going to 
     <lb/>
     give them something of very great value 
     <lb/>
     and importance. The hon. ex-Minister of

            <p>
     Before I conclude, I desire, Sir, to put 
     <lb/>
     myself personally on record as being strong<lb break="no"/>ly in favour of religious instruction in the 
     <lb/>
     schools. I hold that opinion myself, and it 
     <lb/>
     is the opinion of the church to which I be<lb break="no"/>long. I believe lt is good for Catholic chil<lb break="no"/>dren; I believe it is good for the children 
     <lb/>
     of all religious beliefs, that religion should 
     <lb/>
     have a place in the schools. I believe that 
     <lb/>
     the character of the child can be better 
     <lb/>
     moulded in the love and fear of God than 
     <lb/>
     by any other training. I believe that youth 
     <lb/>
     is the proper time to inculcatethe knowledge 
     <lb/>
     between right and wrong. But, Sir, I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe that this Bill would conserve that 
     <lb/>
     great principle. I believe that the law ex<lb break="no"/>isting today in the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     gives the minority of that country rights 
     <lb/>
     at least equal to those embodied in the 
     <lb/>
     Bill. I fear that there will be retaliation 
     <lb/>
     against the enactment of this measure. and 
     <lb/>
     I believe that if this Bill were never enacted 
     <lb/>
     the legislatures in the new provinces would 
     <lb/>
     at once have a revision and consolidation of 
     <lb/>
     their law,. and in that revision and con<lb break="no"/>solidation they would have inserted the re<lb break="no"/>enactment of these school ordinances, which, 
     <lb/>
     after all, is all that this measure provides 
     <lb/>
     for. I believe that for all time to come the 
     <lb/>
     minority would be under the protection of 
     <lb/>
     section 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act; and I believe, Sir, that the minority in 
     <lb/>
     these provinces would in future stand a 
     <lb/>
     better chance of obtaining concessions from 
     <lb/>
     the majority, and that there would be great<lb break="no"/>er amity and greater harmony among the 
     <lb/>
     people of that country if they were left to 
     <lb/>
     themselves to settle whatever differences 
     <lb/>
     might arise. And if these Bills should ul<lb break="no"/>timately be held to be ultra vires, what a 
     <lb/>
     spectacle will be witnessed. The feeling 
     <lb/>
     that prevails here to-day, if it has not al<lb break="no"/>ready extended to that country, will certain<lb break="no"/>ly spread there, and mutual distrust and 
     <lb/>
     mutual ill-will may arise. Taking it all in 
     <lb/>
     all. I believe that it is best that the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces should be left to themselves to legis<lb break="no"/>late on the subjects mentioned in the amend<lb break="no"/>ment proposed by the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion. It is my opinion that the Cathollcs in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest, will in the end be granted 
     <lb/>
     greater rights and more extended privileges 
     <lb/>
     if that amendment is acted upon. The 
     <lb/>
     minority in Canada do not want to wrest 
     <lb/>
     from the majority anything more than they 
     <lb/>
     are by law entitled to obtain, and the law 
     <lb/>
     is there for the protection of minorities and 
     <lb/>
     majorities alike. There is no church ; there 
     <lb/>
     is no organization. civil or religious, ex<lb break="no"/>

isting in the world today which obeys the 
     <lb/>
     laws of the various countries in which it 
     <lb/>
     is established than does the Catholic church. 
     <lb/>
     Throughout the civilized world the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     church is planted and is flourishing, and I 
     <lb/>
     challenge a denial of my statement, that no 
     <lb/>
     matter what the law may be, no organized 
     <lb/>
     body is more obedient to that law than is 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic church. I believe that the 
     <lb/>
     minority in Canada will be willing to take 
     <lb/>
     what the law gives them and what the con<lb break="no"/>stitution guarantees them, and that is what 
     <lb/>
     they will get under the amendment of the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition. Just one word in 
     <lb/>
     conclusion. It is not a question of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools or no separate schools; it is first 
     <lb/>
     of all a constitutional question, and, for the 
     <lb/>
     reasons I have given, I believe that the con<lb break="no"/>stitution as it stands today must in the end 
     <lb/>
     be applied to these new provinces. When I 
     <lb/>
     say it is not a question of separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     or no separate schools I say so for this 
     <lb/>
     additional reason: that the establishment 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools is a matter that is al<lb break="no"/>ready concluded, because the history of the 
     <lb/>
     question in the United States, in Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain and elsewhere is that if the minority 
     <lb/>
     wants separate schools they Will have them, 
     <lb/>
     and the question is simply a matter of whe<lb break="no"/>ther the minority are going to pay taxes for 
     <lb/>
     their own schools and taxes for the public 
     <lb/>
     schools, or whether they will have their 
     <lb/>
     schools separate and apart, as we have 
     <lb/>
     them in the province of Ontario, and as we 
     <lb/>
     would have them in the new provinces of 
     <lb/>
     the west for all time to come if the amend<lb break="no"/>ment of the leader of the opposition is

     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that this ques<lb break="no"/>tion is being debated in rather a peculiar 
     <lb/>
     manner. As I understand, on the second 
     <lb/>
     reading of a Bill the main principle of the 
     <lb/>
     measure is discussed: but in this case we 
     <lb/>
     have been discussing one clause almost al<lb break="no"/>together. However, I suppose that must be 
     <lb/>
     right, for we have heard no objections made 
     <lb/>
     to it so far. Before I go any further, I 
     <lb/>
     want to define my position personally with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the educational clauses of this 
     <lb/>
     Bill, around which the whole debate has 
     <lb/>
     centred. Personally, I have no use for sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools. As I understand it, our pub<lb break="no"/>lic school system exists for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of training our young people for the bat<lb break="no"/>tle of life—preparing them to do busi<lb break="no"/>ness, not only with those of their own 
     <lb/>
     religious persuasion, but with all comers. 
     <lb/>
     Now, fancy a young farmer coming to mar<lb break="no"/>ket with his first load of produce, and say<lb break="no"/>ing to his first customer, 'Before I do any 
     <lb/>
     business with you, I want to know what 
     <lb/>
     church you belong to.' Or imagine a young 
     <lb/>
     merchant opening up his shop. and seeing 


            <pb n="5257" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5257.jpg"/>

     5257 MAY 2, 1905 5258 
     <lb/>
            </fw>
         

     what seems to be a good customer coming 
     <lb/>
     along, saying to him, 'Excuse me, but have 
     <lb/>
     you the same religious belief as I have ?' 
     <lb/>
     Even the young lawyer who has just hung 
     <lb/>
     out his shingle would be in rather a pecu<lb break="no"/>liar predicament if he were to ask his first 
     <lb/>
     client about his religious belief before he 
     <lb/>
     would do anything for him. As we expect 
     <lb/>
     all our young people who go out in the world 
     <lb/>
     to fight the battle of life, to deal with all 
     <lb/>
     they come across, no matter what their reli<lb break="no"/>gious belief is, surely, in preparing them 
     <lb/>
     for this fight, we ought to prepare them all 
     <lb/>
     together. In fact, I go so far as to say 
     <lb/>
     that I think even the sexes should not be 
     <lb/>
     kept apart in school. When I went to school 
     <lb/>
     down here on Le Breton Flats—for I was 
     <lb/>
     born in this town, then called Bytown—there 
     <lb/>
     were no separate schools here, except one 
     <lb/>
     somewhere in lower town. The boys and 
     <lb/>
     girls all went to school together, and friend<lb break="no"/>ships were formed then which have lasted 
     <lb/>
     through life. Those who went to that school 
     <lb/>
     have to-day all a warm feeling for each 
     <lb/>
     other; but those who went to the separate 
     <lb/>
     school in lower town—and there were very 
     <lb/>
     few were to us as aliens and foreigners. 
     <lb/>
     On my return to this city after twenty years 
     <lb/>
     absence. I could not receive a warmer wel<lb break="no"/>come from any of my own relatives than I 
     <lb/>
     have received from some of the Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholics with whom I went to that school; 
     <lb/>
     and I felt almost as warmly towards them 
     <lb/>
     as in my own kin. I could name a number 
     <lb/>
     of men who went to that school, and I do 
     <lb/>
     not think one of them is a worse Catholic 
     <lb/>
     or a worse Protestant from having been 
     <lb/>
     educated side by side in the same room. 
     <lb/>
     Although this is my personal belief, I am a 
     <lb/>
     Liberal—a Liberal in more ways than in 
     <lb/>
     name—and I wish every person to enjoy 
     <lb/>
     his own opinion. I know that a great many 
     <lb/>
     of my fellow men do not believe as I do 
     <lb/>
     on this question, and I am quite willing 
     <lb/>
     that they should enjoy their belief and act 
     <lb/>
     accordingly. There are a great many Pro<lb break="no"/>testant clergymen nowadays who are cla<lb break="no"/>mouring for more religious education in the 
     <lb/>
     public schools. We hear of it every year 
     <lb/>
     at all their public gatherings. At their sy<lb break="no"/>nods, their general assemblies and their con<lb break="no"/>ferences, there is nearly always some deli<lb break="no"/>verance made on this question, demanding 
     <lb/>
     more religious teaching in the schools; but 
     <lb/>
     it has been a question to me how we could 
     <lb/>
     accomplish anything of this kind and please 
     <lb/>
     all these bodies and at the same time please 
     <lb/>
     our Catholic brethren. I am sorry to say 
     <lb/>
     that the Roman Catholics can get on more 
     <lb/>
     easily in that respect than the Protestants 
     <lb/>
     can. It is a hard thing to say. but it is 
     <lb/>
     true all the same. Now, I think the educa<lb break="no"/>tional clauses of these Autonomy Bills solve 
     <lb/>
     this problem to a great extent. The half 
     <lb/>
     hour of religious teaching every day after 
     <lb/>
     half-past three o'clock can be conducted ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the wishes of the trustees. which 
     <lb/>
     will depend a great deal on the wishes of 
     <lb/>
     the people themselves. That is one way to

     <fw type="num">5256</fw>
        

     have more religious teaching in the public 
     <lb/>
     schools. I am sorry to say that these Bills 
     <lb/>
     have been misconstrued, and in a great 
     <lb/>
     many instances I believe purposely miscon<lb break="no"/>strued. Many petitions have come in here 
     <lb/>
     professing to be in favour of provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights ; but it is a peculiar thing that in not 
     <lb/>
     one of these petitions, so far as I have seen 
     <lb/>
     them, was any reference made to anything 
     <lb/>
     in regard to which provincial rights were 
     <lb/>
     being invaded except the schools—not a 
     <lb/>
     word about the public lands, although any 
     <lb/>
     one who has read the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act knows that the public lands belong to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces as exclusively as education. 
     <lb/>
     The people have also been allowed to go on 
     <lb/>
     the idea that it is the old separate schools 
     <lb/>
     such as we have in Ontario and Quebec that 
     <lb/>
     are being established by these Bills. I do 
     <lb/>
     not think that is the right thing to do. I 
     <lb/>
     think the members of this House who sent 
     <lb/>
     out the headings for these petitions should 
     <lb/>
     have seen to it that the people understood 
     <lb/>
     what they were signing. I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     that outside of the Orange body one man in 
     <lb/>
     twenty who signed those petitions would 
     <lb/>
     have signed them had he understood what 
     <lb/>
     the Bills were meant to do. I have had let<lb break="no"/>ters from some of my constituents, and I 
     <lb/>
     have seen sonle curious scraps in the papers; 
     <lb/>
     and just to let you see what peculiar ideas 
     <lb/>
     some people have on this question, I am go<lb break="no"/>ing to read one or two things which are al<lb break="no"/>most too good to keep. The following, from 
     <lb/>
     the Grand Master of the Orangemen in Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Columbia, appeared in the Orange 'Sen<lb break="no"/>tinel :'

     In reply to your request for my views upon 
     <lb/>
     the Autonomy Bill as it affects the educational 
     <lb/>
     standing of the new provinces, I would denounce 
     <lb/>
     it in the strongest terms possible. I believe 
     <lb/>
     it to be the most serious retograde movement 
     <lb/>
     that has arisen within this fair Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     ours for many decades. Now at least the critics 
     <lb/>
     will cease to cry that we Orangemen have no 
     <lb/>
     work to do. I can see just one possible bless<lb break="no"/>ing arising out of this unworthy attempt to 
     <lb/>
     force separate schools upon the district con<lb break="no"/>cerned, and that is, that Orangemen from ocean 
     <lb/>
     to ocean should be so roused that the order 
     <lb/>
     will receive an impetus such as it needs, and 
     <lb/>
     after the conflict enter upon a period of growth 
     <lb/>
     hitherto unapproached. This is not a question 
     <lb/>
     of party politics, nor yet of anti-papery; it is 
     <lb/>
     a direct assault at the foundation of our liberty 
     <lb/>
     and rights. It is very evident that Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>frid Laurier has sold himself and his country 
     <lb/>
     to the Roman Catholic church, and in return 
     <lb/>
     has received his return to power with such an 
     <lb/>
     overwhelming majority. There is no denying 
     <lb/>
     the fact that we have been deceived ; the time 
     <lb/>
     is short; we must fight like men, with the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of our noble ancestors. The victory may 
     <lb/>
     long be delayed, but we shall win. In the 
     <lb/>
     name of the God of battles have We unfurled 
     <lb/>
     our banners; this is His fight, and with a prayer 
     <lb/>
     upon our lips let us face the foe, fight honour<lb break="no"/>ably and doubt not; we shall win such a vic<lb break="no"/>tory as shall make history and wonderfully 
     <lb/>
     advance the cause of religious liberty. Let us 
     <lb/>
     remember Sir Richard Grenville and his little

     some of the observations I have heard from

     some of the other speakers. Our hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Leeds (Mr. Taylor) must be a mind 
     <lb/>
     reader or a prophet or he must have some 
     <lb/>
     secret spies in his pay among the cabinet 
     <lb/>
     ministers. In what other way could he 
     <lb/>
     have secured all the information which he 
     <lb/>
     gave us the other day? He seemed to be 
     <lb/>
     able to tell us everything that was said and 
     <lb/>
     done in the secret cabinet councils and in 
     <lb/>
     the interviews between cabinet ministers

     and outsiders on this question. How he got 
     <lb/>
     all this information I leave him to explain. 
     <lb/>
     It is indeed difficult for us to understand 
     <lb/>
     how he secured it, if it be true. Of course 
     <lb/>
     it is well to put in that proviso. No doubt 
     <lb/>
     in 1894 he was just as prophetic about what 
     <lb/>
     was then going to happen at the next elec<lb break="no"/>tion as he was the other day; and I sup<lb break="no"/>pose his prophecies concerning the. result 
     <lb/>
     of the next election will be just about as true 
     <lb/>
     as they were concerning the last.

            <p>
     My hon. friend from Haldimand (Mr.

     <lb/>
     about. But, really, as an older man. I can<lb break="no"/>not refrain from giving him a little advice. 
     <lb/>
     I cannot refrain from telling him that I 
     <lb/>
     think, and a great many other members 
     <lb/>
     think the same, that a young member, just 
     <lb/>
     come to the House. should not speak in 
     <lb/>
     quite so flippant a manner about men on the 
     <lb/>
     other side whom our late Queen thought 
     <lb/>
     worthy of honour. Now, he made some, as 
     <lb/>
     I thought, very insulting remarks about the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier), and 
     <lb/>
     about the Postmaster General (Sir William 
     <lb/>
     Mulock). I would be very sorry to hear any 
     <lb/>
     one on the government sidemake any such 
     <lb/>
     remarks about the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. R. L. Borden), and I have never heard 
     <lb/>
     anything of that kind yet. I would advise 
     <lb/>
     the young gentleman. a budding politician. 
     <lb/>
     that if he evér expects to occupy such a 
     <lb/>
     position as these gentlemen occupy, he will 
     <lb/>
     have to learn to he a little more courteous, 
     <lb/>

     Just one other matter and I am done. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend from East Middlesex (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bison) spoke of the danger which would 
     <lb/>
     arise through Mormons being able, under 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, to use the schools for the advocacy 
     <lb/>
     of their tenets amongst the children. He 
     <lb/>
     drew us a very startling picture of a family 
     <lb/>
     who happened to be in a Mormon settle<lb break="no"/>ment and whose children would be obliged 
     <lb/>
     to attend the school controlled by the Mor<lb break="no"/>mons. And he read the clause from the 
     <lb/>
     Act, which I will read you again, as the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Mr. Elson) did not read far 
     <lb/>
     enough. Here it is : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     (1) No religious instruction, except as herein<lb break="no"/>after provided, shall be permitted in the school 
     <lb/>
     of any district on the opening of any such 
     <lb/>
     school until one-half hour previous to its clos<lb break="no"/>ing in the afternoon, after which time any such 
     <lb/>
     instruction permitted or desired by the board 
     <lb/>
     may be given. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (2) It shall, however, be permissible for the 
     <lb/>
     board of any district to direct that the school 
     <lb/>
     he opened by the recitation of the Lord's 
     <lb/>
     prayer. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Now, the hon. gentleman went that far 
     <lb/>
     and then stopped, leaving his hearers who 
     <lb/>
     were not familiar with this provision of 
     <lb/>
     the law, I am sure, under a wholly wrong 
     <lb/>
     impression. I can hardly believe that this 
     <lb/>
     was intentional, because I liked the tenor of 
     <lb/>
     his remarks, and I do not think he is a 
     <lb/>
     man who would intentionally mislead. But 
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5261</fw>
     <fw type="num">5262</fw>
          

     the omission of the next clause certainly 
     <lb/>
     would leave a wrong impression upon the 
     <lb/>
    minds of those not familiar with the law. 
     <lb/>The next clause says: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Any child shall have the privilege of leaving 
     <lb/>
     the school room at the time at which religious 
     <lb/>
     instruction is commenced, as provided for in 
     <lb/>
     the next preceding section, or of remaining 
     <lb/>
     without taking part in any religious instruction 
     <lb/>
     that need be given, if the parents or guardians 
     <lb/>
     so desire. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     I think that alters the case. The parent, 
     <lb/>
     by simply telling his child to leave school 
     <lb/>
     at half-past three, can prevent the child 
     <lb/>
     receiving any religious instruction of which 
     <lb/>
     he does not approve. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There has been so much said on this 
     <lb/>
     question that I am not going to take up 
     <lb/>
     the time of the House longer. I close by 
     <lb/>
     asking all my friends in the House, and all 
     <lb/>
     Protestants everywhere, in this case as in 
     <lb/>
     all cases, to be charitable, generous and 
     <lb/>
     just. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. W. H. BENNETT</persName> (East Simcoe). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I have no apology to make for 
     <lb/>
     entering upon this debate, though it has 
     <lb/>
     continued now for upwards of a month. 
     <lb/>
     for a large majority in the constituency I 
     <lb/>
     have the honour to represent, irrespective 
     <lb/>
     of politics, will expect not only that I should 
     <lb/>
     vote, but that also that -I should give utter<lb break="no"/>ance to the views that they hold, which, I 
     <lb/>
     am glad to say are the views I hold my<lb break="no"/>self. No question in Canadian politics for 
     <lb/>
     many years has attracted so much atten<lb break="no"/>tion as this. In 1896 the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion was directed to what was known 
     <lb/>
     as the Remedial Bill, relating to the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba. But that public atten<lb break="no"/>tion was as nothing compared to the at<lb break="no"/>tention that has been aroused in the present 
     <lb/>
     instance. This is due primarily to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the Dominion regarded 
     <lb/>
     the boundaries of the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     as settled and that province as pretty well 
     <lb/>
     populated, so that, even if there were a 
     <lb/>
     principle embodied in the school laws by 
     <lb/>
     which a system of separate schools was 
     <lb/>
     foisted upon the people of Manitoba only 
     <lb/>
     a comparatively small number of people 
     <lb/>
     would be affected. But the development of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest, which has gone on so rapid<lb break="no"/>ly, and which we hope to see increase even 
     <lb/>
     more rapidly, means that there will be there 
     <lb/>
     no limited population, but a population of 
     <lb/>
     millions upon millions. In view of the 
     <lb/>
     number of people to be affected, the whole 
     <lb/>
     population of the Dominion are interested 
     <lb/>
     in the question whether there is to be rivet<lb break="no"/>ed upon that country for all time a system 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, this question has been dealt with by 
     <lb/>
     this government in a most peculiar fashion. 
     <lb/>
     Up almost to the very day of the general 
     <lb/>
     elections last fall. not a single word was 
     <lb/>
     heard as to proposed legislation of the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion parliament for the establishment of 
     <lb/>
     provincial government in these Territor<lb break="no"/>
        

            <pb n="5263" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5263.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5263</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 


     ies. In fact. Sir, this idea had rather been 
     <lb/>
     opposed by hon. gentlemen opposite when, 
     <lb/>
     on more than one occasion, legislation of 
     <lb/>
     that kind had been proposed on this side of 
     <lb/>
     the House. And it ls a notorious fact that 
     <lb/>
     the proposal that there should be provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy with a system of separate schools 
     <lb/>
     fixed upon the province was practically un<lb break="no"/>heard of up to the last campaign. Hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite have on different occasions 
     <lb/>
     seen fit to shirk responsibility for import<lb break="no"/>ant legislation by resorting to plebiscites. 
     <lb/>
     That was the case in what was known as the 
     <lb/>
     temperance legislation of the <choice><sic>Diminion</sic><corr>Dominion</corr></choice>. It 
     <lb/>
     was within the power of a strong govern<lb break="no"/>ment to bring about the enactment of so- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     called temperance legislation. And yet this 
     <lb/>
     government, when they had an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to legislate on that subject, shrank from 
     <lb/>
     the task and took refuge behind the ram<lb break="no"/>parts of a so-called plebiscite. Why did 
     <lb/>
     not they, as they had no mandate from the 
     <lb/>
     people on this school question, refer the 
     <lb/>
     matter to a plebiscite? The reason is 
     <lb/>
     manifest. These hon. gentlemen knew well 
     <lb/>
     that they had stolen a march upon the peo<lb break="no"/>ple and were anxious for a five years to 
     <lb/>
     run their course after this legislation was 
     <lb/>
     passed with the hope that the question 
     <lb/>
     might meantime be forgotten. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Prime Minister, in introducing this 
     <lb/>
     Bill on February 21st, made an address 
     <lb/>
     which certainly was not likely to conciliate 
     <lb/>
     all classes or to allay feeling. The principle 
     <lb/>
     feature of that address was a discussion of 
     <lb/>
     the utility or advantage of separate schools. 
     <lb/>
     The right hon. gentleman must have known, 
     <lb/>
     and, judging by the forced speech he made, 
     <lb/>
     he did know, that he would draw upon him<lb break="no"/>self the fire of those opposed to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in this country whether in this 
     <lb/>
     province or the new provinces. The right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman seems to have taken it in<lb break="no"/>to his head that there was only one way to 
     <lb/>
     drive this Bill through parliament, and that 
     <lb/>
     was by means of the bludgeon of force. 
     <lb/>
     Aside from the reference to separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     which was the prominent feature of his 
     <lb/>
     address, one of the startling statements 
     <lb/>
     made by him was that the government, 
     <lb/>
     in the introduction of this Bill—I refer 
     <lb/>
     particularly to the educational clauses— 
     <lb/>
     were threatened on both sides. Surely, the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman received no threats 
     <lb/>
     from the Conservative press. The fact is 
     <lb/>
     that the right hon. gentleman was threat<lb break="no"/>ened by men on his own side, and those 
     <lb/>
     threats have been carried into force in a 
     <lb/>
     very plain manner. Where is the press 
     <lb/>
     of this country on this question ? Go into 
     <lb/>
     the great province of Ontario, and I chal<lb break="no"/>lenge hon. gentlemen opposite to name one 
     <lb/>
     newspaper on the Liberal side that is not 
     <lb/>
     opposed to this Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Go into the province of Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     where does the Montreal 'Witness' stand. 
     <lb/>
     a journal that has always stood behind 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman and his party ? 
     <lb/>
     Where does the Huntingdon 'Gleaner' 
  

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5263</fw>
     <fw type="num">5264</fw>


     stand, a party organ, and has been such 
     <lb/>
     for years gone by? So I might go on and 
     <lb/>
     cite what is known as the county press, 
     <lb/>
     the weekly newspapers in Ontario, strong<lb break="no"/>est on the Liberal side in the past. These 
     <lb/>
     are the journals that to-day are denouncing 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman and his govern<lb break="no"/>ment for the course they are taking. Come 
     <lb/>
     into this House and what an astonishing 
     <lb/>
     spectacle is presented. The strongest de<lb break="no"/>nunciation of the policy of the government 
     <lb/>
     was made by the hon. member for Brandon, 
     <lb/>
     an ex-minister of the cabinet. While it is 
     <lb/>
     quite true that his course has not been 
     <lb/>
     followed by many other gentlemen, it was 
     <lb/>
     followed by the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe (Mr. L. McCarthy)—and there is not 
     <lb/>
     a more subservient follower of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment than that hon. gentleman—and by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from South Perth (Mr. McIn<lb break="no"/>tyre), who is an independent, for the fact 
     <lb/>
     is well known in the locality in which he 
     <lb/>
     resides that he is not an ofl'ice seeker. he 
     <lb/>
     is not one who is looking for favours from 
     <lb/>
     this government and the very fact that the 
     <lb/>
     government cannot hold on this occasion 
     <lb/>
     the vote of that hon. gentleman must be as 
     <lb/>
     gall and wormwood to the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral and the Minister of Customs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, a stage has been reached in 
     <lb/>
     the career of the right hon. gentleman. He 
     <lb/>
     has played fast and loose with the question 
     <lb/>
     upon which be secured a party adyantage. 
     <lb/>
     He stole a chance in the general elections 
     <lb/>
     of 1896 to ride into power on the so-called 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba school question, and pledges were 
     <lb/>
     then made by that right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     which must be redeemed, and we are being 
     <lb/>
    brought face to face with this question in 
     <lb/>the acrimonious and bitter manner in which 
     <lb/>we now have it brought up in this House, 
     <lb/>by reason of the pledges made by the right 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman in 1896 and by his follow<lb break="no"/>ers, throughout the province of Quebec. 
     <lb/>But the right hon. gentleman has been 
     <lb/>threatened, though I deny he has been threat<lb break="no"/>ened by the Conservative members or sup<lb break="no"/>porters. The public will have no diffi<lb break="no"/>culty in saying, on the day when this vote 
     <lb/>is taken, who has been threatening him. It 
     <lb/>is not the Conservative party who has 
     <lb/>threatened him, but it is the men in the 
     <lb/>Liberal ranks who will sit in judgment on 
     <lb/>the right hon. gentleman and his govern<lb break="no"/>ment for their course on this question. 
     <lb/>There have been some very striking features 
     <lb/>in connection with the introduction of this 
     <lb/>Bill. And here one may call to recollec<lb break="no"/>tion the fact that on every occasion when 
     <lb/>this government has seen fit to dragoon its 
     <lb/>supporters on any question, the same inor<lb break="no"/>dinate speed, the same inordinate haste has 
     <lb/>been resorted to. What was the action of 
     <lb/>this government on the so-called Yukon 
     <lb/>Railway Bill, on the Grand Trunk Pacific 
     <lb/>Bill. and many other matters I might men<lb break="no"/>tion? Brought down to parliament, thrown 
     <lb/>at their supporters: and it is quite true 


            <pb n="5265" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5265.jpg"/>

     that while most of them responded to the 
     <lb/>
     crack of the party lash, I am glad to be 
     <lb/>
     able to note that I see opposite me a gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who did not so respond, and I con<lb break="no"/>gratulate the Minister of the Interior who 
     <lb/>
     did not on that occasion respond to the 
     <lb/>
     crack of the party lash. The Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior is to-day in this cabinet, he 
     <lb/>
     was acclaimed with great gusto, and he 
     <lb/>
     sits in this cabinet to-night as a geographi<lb break="no"/>cal and a national freak. He sits there 
     <lb/>
     by reason of the fact that there must needs 
     <lb/>
     be a cabinet representative from the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, west of Lake Superior. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) went 
     <lb/>
     through the lobbies day after day, read the 
     <lb/>
     public prints day after day, and read with 
     <lb/>
     the greatest relish that he was to be made 
     <lb/>
     a cabinet minister, and received the con<lb break="no"/>gratulations of his friends. We remember 
     <lb/>
     when that hon. gentleman spoke in the 
     <lb/>
     House, and after he had spoken, how warm<lb break="no"/>ly he was congratulated as the next Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior. But unfortunately he 
     <lb/>
     was not nationally well placed, there were 
     <lb/>
     not enough Galicians, Roumanians, Rus<lb break="no"/>sians and hundreds of other what-nots in 
     <lb/>
     his constituency, and so perforce my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Edmonton had to be chosen. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman himself disclaimed that 
     <lb/>
     the school question was a burning question 
     <lb/>
     in 'his re-election as minister. I see in the 
     <lb/>
     public press that he has announced that to 
     <lb/>
     be the case, and everybody knows to-day 
     <lb/>
     that the great question in the riding of 
     <lb/>
     Edmonton was whether or not Calgary 
     <lb/>
     should be the seat of government, or whe<lb break="no"/>ther it should be his own town of Edmon<lb break="no"/>ton. That question, fortified by the fact 
     <lb/>
     that two-thirds of the population were for<lb break="no"/>eigners who cared little about public 
     <lb/>
     schools, and, I suppose, much less about 
     <lb/>
     separate schools, explains how it is that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman to-night has dropped 
     <lb/>
     into the office of a cabinet minister. But I 
     <lb/>
     hope and expect that those kicking pro<lb break="no"/>clivities he has evinced in the past—if he 
     <lb/>
     will allow me to say so—which have sig<lb break="no"/>nalized him on different occasions when 
     <lb/>
     he made strong protests against the action 
     <lb/>
     of this government, will, even before this 
     <lb/>
     vote is taken, once again assert themselves, 
     <lb/>
     and that he will come out even at the last 
     <lb/>
     moment as an opponent of this Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, what was the action of the 
     <lb/>
     government in reference to the introduction 
     <lb/>
     of this Bill? Here was a Bill fraught with 
     <lb/>
     the greatest moment to the western Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, and where was the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior, the minister who is specially 
     <lb/>
     charged with conducting the affairs of that 
     <lb/>
     great western country? The Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior was absent from the city, the 
     <lb/>
     reason assigned was that of ill health. He 
     <lb/>
     was absent, he was not here to defend the 
     <lb/>
     sacred principles for which he was always 
     <lb/>
     ready to lay down his life a few years ago 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Manitoba, provided al<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5265</fw>
     <fw type="num">5266</fw>

ways that the salary of a cabinet minister 
     <lb/>
     went wlth it. It was a patent fact that 
     <lb/>
     he was coming back speedily, but this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment could not delay the introduction of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill until he returned, and so forsooth 
     <lb/>
     it was forced in before that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     could even place his foot in the House. 
     <lb/>
     But worse than that. A special committee 
     <lb/>
     of this cabinet was formed to engineer the 
     <lb/>
     progress of this Bill, and the composition 
     <lb/>
     of that committee is a marvel to all men 
     <lb/>
     who will look at it. First and foremost 
     <lb/>
     was the Prime Minister, who had a place 
     <lb/>
     on it as was to be expected by virtue of 
     <lb/>
     his position. I do not presume any claim 
     <lb/>
     will be made for the premier as being in 
     <lb/>
     the past a constitutional lawyer, or even 
     <lb/>
     at the present time. But he was expected, 
     <lb/>
     by virtue of his position in his government, 
     <lb/>
     to be accorded a place on that very select 
     <lb/>
     and supreme committee. Next to him 
     <lb/>
     came, of necessity, and probably by reason 
     <lb/>
     of his legal attainments as well as of his 
     <lb/>
     olfice, the Minister of Justice, and I am 
     <lb/>
     sure nobody will complain on that score. 
     <lb/>
     But in the name of all that is good in 
     <lb/>
     this country of representative institutions, 
     <lb/>
     where the House of Commons is supposed 
     <lb/>
     to be amenable to the people, they had to 
     <lb/>
     go over to the charnel house for decayed 
     <lb/>
     politicians, as it has been described by hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite in years gone by, and 
     <lb/>
     from its long hidden recesses was drawn 
     <lb/>
     forth the Secretary of State, a gentleman 
     <lb/>
     eighty years of age. The fact goes with<lb break="no"/>out saying that the views of Senator Scott, 
     <lb/>
     the Secretary of State, on this question 
     <lb/>
     were well known. Then my own province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario was granted a seat on that com<lb break="no"/>mittee in the person of a gentleman who is 
     <lb/>
     prepared to distinguish men in this House 
     <lb/>
     on two great lines, either as statesmen or 
     <lb/>
     as lawyers—I refer to the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral. That hon. gentleman did not arro<lb break="no"/>gate to himself that he was a lawyer, but 
     <lb/>
     he does arrogate to himself that he is a 
     <lb/>
     statesman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, I fancy I see the meeting of 
     <lb/>
     that committee. The hon. Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice told us in reply to my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Halton (Mr. Henderson) the other night that 
     <lb/>
     he prepared the Bill, word for word and 
     <lb/>
     line for line, and that he was responsible 
     <lb/>
     for every portion of it. I accept that. I 
     <lb/>
     believe that statement is true, and I fancy I 
     <lb/>
     see these four gentlemen drawn up together, 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice laying down the Bill
     <lb/>
     and saying: There is the Bill; and the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General saying: So must it be. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. Postmaster General is never known 
     <lb/>
     to object, and it would not be expected that 
     <lb/>
     he would object to this Bill. Why was not 
     <lb/>
     the hon. ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton) included in that committee? The 
     <lb/>
     Bill was introduced before he could reach 
     <lb/>
     the city, and the government hoped that 
     <lb/>
     after the committee had made their finding 
     <lb/>
     and after they had brought down their Bill, 
     <lb/>
     the right hon, Prime Minister's speech would 
   

            <pb n="5267" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5267.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5267</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
       

     bring about such terrific results as to fairly 
     <lb/>
     drive everybody on both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     House into acquiescence. Then the hon. ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior turned up, and if 
     <lb/>
     ever there was a panic stricken crew it was 
     <lb/>
     this government and their supporters for 
     <lb/>
     the next thirty days. There was another 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who was not consulted, although 
     <lb/>
     that gentleman was here at the time. I re<lb break="no"/>fer to the premier of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. Mr. Haultain was here, not in his 
     <lb/>
     personal capacity, but in the capacity of the 
     <lb/>
     premier of these Territories, and the state<lb break="no"/>ment has been made in the public press, and 
     <lb/>
     it has not been denied, that this Bill was 
     <lb/>
     only handed to Mr. Haultain an hour before 
     <lb/>
     it was ready to be presented to the House, 
     <lb/>
     and no time was allowed for him to proper<lb break="no"/>ly digest it, to discuss it with his colleague 
     <lb/>
     who was here with him, or to give an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity for proper consideration or reflection 
     <lb/>
     in regard to its provisions. This lack of 
     <lb/>
     consideration is on a par with the treat<lb break="no"/>ment that was accorded him afterwards by 
     <lb/>
     the government, because, when the second 
     <lb/>
     Bill was brought down, the right hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the government stated in a cavalier way 
     <lb/>
     that he did not allow Mr. Haultain to see 
     <lb/>
     the Bill at all. That statement is on record. 
     <lb/>
     Did the right hon. gentleman think that the 
     <lb/>
     proper way to reconcile people, to conciliate 
     <lb/>
     the people, was to tell their premier who 
     <lb/>
     came here as the accredited representative 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest Territories that he would 
     <lb/>
     not condescend to show him the legislation 
     <lb/>
     that the government proposed to submit? 
     <lb/>
     Well, then we had these terrible thirty days 
     <lb/>
     of suspense and agony. We saw the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment marching and counter-marching, 
     <lb/>
     we saw hon. members lobbying around the 
     <lb/>
     corridors wondering what was to be the 
     <lb/>
     next move, and then we heard the state<lb break="no"/>ment made by the hon. member for Bran<lb break="no"/>don as to the stand he took. That hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman came back, and within three or 
     <lb/>
     four days after his entrance into the city 
     <lb/>
     we know what happened. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister rose up in his place and 
     <lb/>
     announced that he had received the resigna<lb break="no"/>tion of the Minister of the Interior, and the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior made a speech on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion which showed a determina<lb break="no"/>tion upon his part to oppose this Bill and 
     <lb/>
     to oppose any legislation to this end, if the 
     <lb/>
     English language meant anything. But, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     no sooner had the hon. ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior announced his intention to defeat 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, if it were possible, than all the 
     <lb/>
     force and power of government press were 
     <lb/>
     turned upon the hon. member for Brandon. 
     <lb/>
     Insinuations were made as to his conduct 
     <lb/>
     while in the discharge of his duties as Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior. One of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     papers, and a strong supporter of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, came out with a cartoon. Did 
     <lb/>
     they depict the hon. ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior as dying for principle ? Did they de<lb break="no"/>pict him as a man who could not support 
     <lb/>
     the government by reason of the strong 
     <lb/>
     views which he held? No, Sir; they de<lb break="no"/>
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5267</fw>
     <fw type="num">5268</fw>

picted the hon. ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     as a man who was fleeing from the wrath, 
     <lb/>
     from the exposures which were to be made. 
     <lb/>
     There had been scandals in his department, 
     <lb/>
     and the pistol was put at his head by 
     <lb/>
     the other ministers through the press, and 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Brandon was simply 
     <lb/>
     and solely told if he did not acquiesce in 
     <lb/>
     legislation that would be acceptable to hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite he must expect what 
     <lb/>
     would follow—exposure and disgrace by 
     <lb/>
     reason of scandals connected with his de<lb break="no"/>partment. Hon. gentlemen opposite cannot 
     <lb/>
     gainsay this. It was in the public press, 
     <lb/>
     and no member of the government has risen 
     <lb/>
     in his place to express a word of dissent in 
     <lb/>
     connection with these ideas which have 
     <lb/>
     been disseminated by the press friendly to 
     <lb/>
     the government. But if this legislation is 
     <lb/>
     along lines that are compatible with the 
     <lb/>
     principles and views of the hon. ex—Mlnister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior, why did not the hon. ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior come back into the 
     <lb/>
     House and take his place ? That is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion that must suggest itself to the people. 
     <lb/>
     If the legislation was to his mind, he should 
     <lb/>
     have come back as a hero and have said 
     <lb/>
     that he had stemmed the whole tide of this 
     <lb/>
     policy, and forced them to come into accord 
     <lb/>
     with his views on this question ; but this 
     <lb/>
     has not been done, and the public must draw 
     <lb/>
     their own deductions that the threats held 
     <lb/>
     out by the ministerial press and the insinu<lb break="no"/>ations made against that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     were the influences that brought him back. 
     <lb/>
     Now, we have heard a great deal about the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional triumph of the hon. ex-Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior. But we have not heard 
     <lb/>
     a word about the terrible downfall that his 
     <lb/>
     party got in. Manitoba the other day—not 
     <lb/>
     a word. Hon. gentlemen opposite went to a 
     <lb/>
     riding of their own selection and they won. 
     <lb/>
     But there was the riding of Mountain in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and the hon. gentleman who re<lb break="no"/>presents Lisgar (Mr. Greenway) was dele<lb break="no"/>gated to go up there. He was accompanied 
     <lb/>
     by a number of hon. gentlemen from the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba ; but, Sir, there is no 
     <lb/>
     acclaim for them, there is no applause. 
     <lb/>
     These hon. gentlemen have found that in 
     <lb/>
     the west, in any riding of strong Liberal 
     <lb/>
     proclivities, where the population is not 
     <lb/>
     strongly foreign, they can only court one 
     <lb/>
     thing, and that is disaster, such as they met 
     <lb/>
     with in Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, this question has been discussed 
     <lb/>
     from both sides. I shall not repeat the 
     <lb/>
     words of the hon. Postmaster General— 
     <lb/>
     from the lawyer's standpoint and from the 
     <lb/>
     statesman's standpoint. I shall use the 
     <lb/>
     words that are commonly used—from the 
     <lb/>
     legal point of view and from what may be 
     <lb/>
     termed the sentimental point of view. What 
     <lb/>
     is the legal point of view ? First and fore<lb break="no"/>most. lt is a matter of comment, and it must 
     <lb/>
     be a matter of comment, that although this 
     <lb/>
     debate has gone on week after week, no hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, until today, in the person of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of Inland Revenue (Mr. Bro<lb break="no"/>deur), has risen to give an official legal 
   

            <pb n="5269" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5269.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5269</fw> <fw type="dateline">MAY 2, 1905</fw> 
  

     opinion on this question. Why did not the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) 
     <lb/>
     rise in the first instance and give an opinion, 
     <lb/>
     more particularly in view of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     weeks have elapsed since the hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) spoke on 
     <lb/>
     this question and gave a legal opinion which 
     <lb/>
     stands to-day unshattered, and has not had 
     <lb/>
     one particle stricken from it or from any of 
     <lb/>
     the strong arguments that were adduced in 
     <lb/>
     it? We have two Bills, and it is hardly 
     <lb/>
     worth while going into the merits of the 
     <lb/>
     two owing to the fact that on the question 
     <lb/>
     of principle the two are almost the same. 
     <lb/>
     The whole question is involved in this school 
     <lb/>
     matter, whether or not there shall be two 
     <lb/>
     systems of schools in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. Two grounds have been taken, and 
     <lb/>
     I propose shortly to speak on this question, 
     <lb/>
     because the ground has been well traversed. 
     <lb/>
     The first ground taken by the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter was, as I understood it, that in the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal Act which gave power to these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories a system of separate schools was con<lb break="no"/>ferred upon the people there. But, as the 
     <lb/>
     law that gave these people the system of 
     <lb/>
     schools which there prevails was a law 
     <lb/>
     framed by this parliament, it is an admitted 
     <lb/>
     fact, and it has not been contradicted, that 
     <lb/>
     this parliament had exactly the same right 
     <lb/>
     to take away as it had the right to give. 
     <lb/>
     The people of these Territories had, in ad<lb break="no"/>dition to their separate school system of 
     <lb/>
     education, under the Acts, the right to the 
     <lb/>
     official use of the French language in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories, and yet, although that right was 
     <lb/>
     similarly given to them, it was taken away 
     <lb/>
     by this parliament. So, on the same line 
     <lb/>
     of argument, and on the same line of rea<lb break="no"/>soning, as they had the right to remove the 
     <lb/>
     privilege of the official use of the French 
     <lb/>
     language in the Northwest Territories, they 
     <lb/>
     had the right to divorce these people from 
     <lb/>
     the system of separate schools. I do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to give my opinion on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, because my opinion, as I expect the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of many legal gentlemen in this 
     <lb/>
     House, will have very little weight. I can 
     <lb/>
     rely upon the opinions of admittedly great 
     <lb/>
     constitutional lawyers: I will cite the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of Sir John Thompson, who, when 
     <lb/>
     the question arose as to doing away with 
     <lb/>
     French as an official language in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, said:

     That opinion has been quoted in this 
     <lb/>
     House before, and no gentleman opposite 
     <lb/>
     has attempted to controvert the dictum of 
     <lb/>
     Sir John Thompson. The Hon. David Mills 
     <lb/>
     was the acknowledged constitutional autho<lb break="no"/>rity of the Liberal party when in opposition, 
     <lb/>
     and on account of his legal attainments he 
     <lb/>
     afterwards was elevated to the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court bench, and Mr. Mills said:

     The vast territory west of Manitoba through

     at the time uninhabited by white men. The

     I might quote the opinions of other jurists 
     <lb/>
     of repute, all laying down the principle 
     <lb/>
     that this parliament had no right to inter<lb break="no"/>fere with these new provinces in their edu<lb break="no"/>cational legislation. We have heard the ar<lb break="no"/>gument advanced on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House, that these provinces stand in exactly 
     <lb/>
     the same position under the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act that the provinces of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     and Ontario did at the time of the union. 
     <lb/>
     That contention has been to some extent 
     <lb/>
     abandoned by the government, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe the Minister of Justice will attempt 
     <lb/>
     to justify it. The fact of the matter is that 
     <lb/>
     so far as the law on the question is con<lb break="no"/>cerned the government has not a ghost of 
     <lb/>
     a case and the House awaits with expect<lb break="no"/>ancy to hear what arguments the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice will advance to buttress up the 
     <lb/>
     position of the government. If the position 
     <lb/>
     of the government is weak in its legal aspect 
     <lb/>
     that weakness is in the main due to the ut<lb break="no"/>terances of certain cabinet ministers. When 
     <lb/>
     they saw their weakness and when they 
     <lb/>
     saw that men like the member for South 
     <lb/>
     Perth (Mr. McIntyre) could not be convinced 
     <lb/>
     by the so-called legal argument, they endea<lb break="no"/>voured to arrest the stampede by dwelling 
     <lb/>
     on the political expediency of the case. The 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance in an impassioned ad<lb break="no"/>dress turned to his followers and told them : 
     <lb/>
     If you don't support this Bill the govern<lb break="no"/>ment goes out and the Tories will come into 
     <lb/>
     power. The Minister of Finance evidently 
     <lb/>
     thought that it is not a question of principle 
     <lb/>
     or a question of the legal rights of the mino<lb break="no"/>rity, but that the whole question at issue 
     <lb/>
     was one of practical politics. I want to be 
     <lb/>
     fair to the Minister of Finance who did 
     <lb/>
     offer one argument in favour of the Bill, 
     <lb/>
     and were he in the House to-night I would 
     <lb/>
     ask him a question. He pointed to the fact 
   

            <pb n="5271" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5271.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5271</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
      

     that out of the ten members from the North<lb break="no"/>west seven were supporting the Bill, and for 
     <lb/>
     that reason he held that there should be no 
     <lb/>
     complaint against it. But, if the members 
     <lb/>
     from the Northwest stood five for and five 
     <lb/>
     against, then the argument of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance would go for nothing. I would 
     <lb/>
     ask those gentlemen who applauded the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance to remember, that when 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba Remedial Bill was before the 
     <lb/>
     House every member from Manitoba with 
     <lb/>
     the exception of Mr. Joseph Martin was in 
     <lb/>
     favour of that Bill, and using the argument 
     <lb/>
     of the Minister of Finance then the Remedial 
     <lb/>
     Bill should have been adopted by parliament. 
     <lb/>
     The Minister of Finance threatened his fol<lb break="no"/>lowers into supporting this Bill, and for 
     <lb/>
     fear that they still might be fleeing away 
     <lb/>
     from the government my genial friend from 
     <lb/>
     Brockville (Mr. Derbyshire) came to the res<lb break="no"/>cue and he offered a wager that the Bill 
     <lb/>
     would be supported by the people at the next 
     <lb/>
     election. What have we descended to ? An 
     <lb/>
     important Bill, a Bill that is fastening a 
     <lb/>
     system of schools for all time upon millions 
     <lb/>
     of people who are not yet in the Territories; 
     <lb/>
     such a Bill is to be driven through the 
     <lb/>
     House by the impassioned appeals of the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, by the threats of the Fin<lb break="no"/>ance Minister and by the persuasive elo<lb break="no"/>quence of my hon. friend from Brockville 
     <lb/>
     who tries to stiffen the backs of gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite by wagering dollars on the result 
     <lb/>
     of the next election. Shades of George 
     <lb/>
     Brown ; if Edward Blake or Alexander Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie came into this House of Commons, 
     <lb/>
     how they would sigh for these degenerate 
     <lb/>
     days when Liberal leaders can make such 
     <lb/>
     appeals for the support of a great constitu<lb break="no"/>tional measure. And if this were not enough, 
     <lb/>
     my benevolent friend the Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms rises and he cries for, peace, perfect 
     <lb/>
     peace. There was no argument in his speech 
     <lb/>
     which all through was pervaded with the 
     <lb/>
     one sentence : brethren there should be per<lb break="no"/>fect peace, and he ended by saying that he 
     <lb/>
     loved the premier and by the love he bore 
     <lb/>
     him he could not possibly oppose his will. 
     <lb/>
     Is that the serious way in which important 
     <lb/>
     legislation should be treated. The Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Customs excelled himself that night in 
     <lb/>
     his eulogy of the Prime Minister ; he had 
     <lb/>
     only to go one better to equal the member 
     <lb/>
     for Centre York (Mr. Campbell) who in a 
     <lb/>
     spontaneous outburst of enthusiasm de<lb break="no"/>clared that Sir Wilfrid Laurier was the 
     <lb/>
     greatest man that ever lived. Napoleon 
     <lb/>
     may have been a great general, but he was 
     <lb/>
     nothing to Laurier ; Vanderbilt may have 
     <lb/>
     been a Napoleon of finance, but he was not 
     <lb/>
     in it with Laurier. Hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     seem to be inoculated with the idea that 
     <lb/>
     whenever they address parliament they must 
     <lb/>
     raise a paen of idol worship to the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister. I had not the honour of being 
     <lb/>
     in the House when Sir John A. Macdonald 
     <lb/>
     was Prime Minister. but I have read a great 
     <lb/>
     many of the speeches delivered then, and it 
     <lb/>
     may have been that Sir John Macdonald 
  

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5271</fw>
     <fw type="num">5272</fw>
        

     stood so prominent in this country that his 
     <lb/>
     followers did not feel it necessary to adver<lb break="no"/>tise him as a great man. But the debate 
     <lb/>
     proceeds, and now and then we have a gen<lb break="no"/>tleman like my hon. friend from West<lb break="no"/>minster (Mr. Kennedy) who gets up and 
     <lb/>
     does the acrobatic feat. He balances on 
     <lb/>
     both sides ; he starts out by denouncing 
     <lb/>
     separate schools as the curse of the country 
     <lb/>
     and he winds up by saying that for the sake 
     <lb/>
     of perfect peace he will vote for the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. And then last but not least we have 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Agriculture who gave to us 
     <lb/>
     bigots from Ontario a lesson in peace and 
     <lb/>
     conciliation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was rather surprised that the Post<lb break="no"/>master General did not take up the cudgels 
     <lb/>
     as an Ontario representative, and deal the 
     <lb/>
     city of Toronto a body-blow too, and de<lb break="no"/>nounce that city as a hot-bed of bigotry 
     <lb/>
     and intolerance. But, Sir, if the Postmas<lb break="no"/>ter General did not do it, his understudy 
     <lb/>
     from North Ontario did it to his heart's 
     <lb/>
     content. I do not wonder that these hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen have no feeling of kindness to<lb break="no"/>wards the city of Toronto, in which they al<lb break="no"/>ways thought they had such magnificent 
     <lb/>
     voting chances, where in 1896 Mr. Lount 
     <lb/>
     was elected by a handsome majority in the 
     <lb/>
     same riding which Mr. Bertram a year 
     <lb/>
     or two afterwards succeeded in carrying by 
     <lb/>
     a considerable majority. The fact of the 
     <lb/>
     matter is that the Ontario representation 
     <lb/>
     in this cabinet is so weak and this policy 
     <lb/>
     of the government is so weak that they 
     <lb/>
     dare not make any attempt to carry a 
     <lb/>
     Toronto constituency. But my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Customs says: Peace, per<lb break="no"/>fect peace. Does the hon. gentleman believe 
     <lb/>
     that majorities have no rights in this coun<lb break="no"/>try—that we are always to yield to the 
     <lb/>
     will of the minority ? Does he not know 
     <lb/>
     that the old rule must prevail, that the 
     <lb/>
     majority should rule ? How does he expect 
     <lb/>
     that there is going to be peace in this coun<lb break="no"/>try if, when the majority have the law 
     <lb/>
     and the constitution behind them, they are 
     <lb/>
     expected to pander to the wishes of some 
     <lb/>
     politicians who want to retain their posi<lb break="no"/>tions as Cabinet ministers, with the accom<lb break="no"/>panying salaries, and in return are to have 
     <lb/>
     the support of a lot of hon. gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     are to seek seclusion in a few years in fat 
     <lb/>
     government offices ? I need not go into 
     <lb/>
     the question of who are to be rewarded. 
     <lb/>
     An object lesson has been presented in the 
     <lb/>
     person of the Minister of the Interior who 
     <lb/>
     could go out and revile and denounce this 
     <lb/>
     government in every possible manner for 
     <lb/>
     the Yukon Bill and other measures, exactly 
     <lb/>
     as the ex-Minister of Railways and Canals 
     <lb/>
     denounced the government, and then, by 
     <lb/>
     reason of certain qualifications of a geo<lb break="no"/>graphical and national kind, secure an ap<lb break="no"/>pointment to office. I am not saying this 
     <lb/>
     in a belittling way of the hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior, because I think he is far 
     <lb/>
     above the average in point of intelligence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But, Sir, we are told that there are rea<lb break="no"/>
         

            <pb n="5273" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5273.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5273</fw> <fw type="dateline">MAY 2, 1905</fw> 
            

     sons why this government and this House 
     <lb/>
     must accept this policy of granting allow<lb break="no"/>ances to the minority in the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
     We are told that even if the law is against 
     <lb/>
     them, as a matter of sentiment we must 
     <lb/>
     pander to the minority. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men should remember that that was the 
     <lb/>
     question in Manitoba in 1896, when they 
     <lb/>
     were quite willing to take advantage of 
     <lb/>
     party exigencies and flaunt into power at 
     <lb/>
     the sacrifice of the will and the wishes of 
     <lb/>
     the minority. The Minister of Finance, in 
     <lb/>
     his impassioned appeal to his supporters 
     <lb/>
     the other night, begging and pleading with 
     <lb/>
     them to vote for the government for fear 
     <lb/>
     the Conservatives should come into power, 
     <lb/>
     said this : It is quite true, I am against 
     <lb/>
     separate schools; it is quite true, we have 
     <lb/>
     none of them in the province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia from which I come ; but there is in 
     <lb/>
     that province a feeling of conciliation and 
     <lb/>
     ainity, and for that reason we allow certain 
     <lb/>
     innovations in the school laws which suit 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholic part of the population. 
     <lb/>
     And yet the Minister of Finance is not will<lb break="no"/>ing to allow the majority in the provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta and Saskatchewan to extend 
     <lb/>
     to the Roman Catholic minority there, that 
     <lb/>
     same spirit of conciliation that is extended 
     <lb/>
     to the minority in the province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are told by the hon. member for La<lb break="no"/>belle (Mr. Bourassa) that there is a risk 
     <lb/>
     to be feared in that country, as a reason 
     <lb/>
     why the power of educating the people 
     <lb/>
     should not be given to the provinces. He 
     <lb/>
     pointed out that there was likely to be 
     <lb/>
     a large influx of Americans into those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. If there is to be, I for one as a 
     <lb/>
     Canadian am glad of that fact, I believe 
     <lb/>
     American citizens are preferable to the for<lb break="no"/>eigners we are importing into that coun<lb break="no"/>try ; I believe they will make better citi<lb break="no"/>zens. And it is not to be expected that 
     <lb/>
     men coming from a country where they 
     <lb/>
     have not enjoyed separate schools, but 
     <lb/>
     where they have a system of national 
     <lb/>
     schools, will be the men to accept this whip 
     <lb/>
     of coercion which this governemnt propose 
     <lb/>
     to lash them with when the time comes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But we are told in extenuation by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Centre York (Mr. A. Camp<lb break="no"/>bell) and others : After all, these are 
     <lb/>
     separate schools only in name ; they will 
     <lb/>
     be so handled and regulated as to text<lb break="no"/>books, certificates for teachers, and equip<lb break="no"/>ment, that they will be practically nulli<lb break="no"/>fied as to any religious instruction. All 
     <lb/>I have to say is that I do not accept these 
     <lb/>schools for that reason. If there is to be 
     <lb/>a separate school system in the Northwest 
     <lb/>Territories, I think my Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>friends are intelligent enough to know how 
     <lb/>to conduct their own schools ; and I do not 
     <lb/>think they will thank the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Centre York and other hon. gentlemen who 
     <lb/>are taking refuge for voting for this Bill 
     <lb/>in the plea that these schools are going to 
     <lb/>be controlled by the state. and that for 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5273</fw>
     <fw type="num">5274</fw>
          

     that reason they will not be church schools 
     <lb/>
     as they are commonly known. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP3">Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>. Do you deny that 
     <lb/>
     they are controlled by the state? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. BENNETT</persName>. No, I no not deny that 
     <lb/>
     they are controlled by the state. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP3">Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey (Mr. Sproule) did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. BENNETT</persName>. I care not what the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Grey says. He is perfect<lb break="no"/>ly free to have his own opinion as I am 
     <lb/>
     free to have mine, and I am going to take 
     <lb/>
     a stand different from that of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Centre York. I am not going 
     <lb/>
     into a constituency in Ontario to tell the 
     <lb/>
     people that I supported these school be<lb break="no"/>cause I knew that they were useless schools 
     <lb/>
     for the Roman Catholics. I am going to 
     <lb/>
     the riding of East Simcoe, which has 1,600 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic votes, and I am going to 
     <lb/>
     argue, just as I did when I voted against 
     <lb/>
     the Remedial Bill in 1896, that I believe that 
     <lb/>
     in this country, in every province, it would 
     <lb/>
     be better for all parties concerned that 
     <lb/>
     there should be no separate schools, but 
     <lb/>
     one system of national schools. That is 
     <lb/>
     the ground I am going to take, and I will 
     <lb/>
     be bound to say that when the time comes 
     <lb/>
     for my hon. friend to go back to the con<lb break="no"/>stituency of Centre York, the whole burden 
     <lb/>
     of his song will be: True, I voted for the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, but what does it amount to ? The 
     <lb/>
     schools are controlled by the state; the 
     <lb/>
     law gives no special rights to Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholics, and, to use words which I saw 
     <lb/>
     quoted in the public press a short time ago, 
     <lb/>
     they will be of so little good for their own 
     <lb/>
     purposes that they will soon all die out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, what are we going to do in these 
     <lb/>
     two new provinces ? we are going in there, 
     <lb/>
     with their sparse population as it is to-day, 
     <lb/>
     and we are going to fetter these provinces 
     <lb/>
     with a system of schools that will be irre<lb break="no"/>movable, that cannot be eradicated, that 
     <lb/>
     under the constitution of this country must 
     <lb/>
     continue for all time to come. We are 
     <lb/>
     to saddle on these provinces, before the po<lb break="no"/>pulation that is to be in there will have 
     <lb/>
     anything to say on the question at all in 
     <lb/>
     the years that are to come, what we have 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Ontario. I am here to 
     <lb/>
     say—and I believe I have the confidence 
     <lb/>
     and I have the confidence and good will of 
     <lb/>
     many Roman Catholics—that the same op<lb break="no"/>inion prevails throughout the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario that prevails in the town in which 
     <lb/>
     I live, where there have been French Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholic priests and Irish Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic priests, and where there is a large 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic population. In that town 
     <lb/>
     they want no separate school at all. What 
     <lb/>
     do the returns show as to the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in the province of Ontario to-day? 
     <lb/>
     Let any hon. gentleman consult the returns, 
     <lb/>
     and he will find that town after town of 
     <lb/>
     2.000. 3,000, 4,000 and 5,000 population in 
  

            <pb n="5275" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5275.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5275</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
          

     the province of Ontario have no separate 
     <lb/>
     school at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They have the right under the law of the 
     <lb/>
     province to establish those schools if they 
     <lb/>
     wish, but they do not desire them or care 
     <lb/>
     for them. Let me give a list of the towns 
     <lb/>
     in and near the county of Simcoe where 
     <lb/>
     there are no separate schools. There are 
     <lb/>
     none in the following towns: Uxbridge, 
     <lb/>
     Aurora, Bradford, Gravenhurst, Midland, 
     <lb/>
     Staynor, Collingwood; and when I go out<lb break="no"/>side of the county I find such towns as 
     <lb/>
     these: Simcoe, Port Hope, Brampton, 
     <lb/>
     Bracebridge, Orangeville, Meaford, Wing<lb break="no"/>ham, Clinton, Brussels, Exeter and Aylmer. 
     <lb/>
     I could go on through every county in On<lb break="no"/>tario and show that the separate school 
     <lb/>
     system is not making headway in that pro<lb break="no"/>vince, but the Roman Catholics, as well as 
     <lb/>
     Protestants, are realizing the benefit and 
     <lb/>
     better effect of not having separate schools. 
     <lb/>
     In Ontario we have no such schools as 
     <lb/>
     separate high schools. Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     and Protestants, boys and girls, alike, go 
     <lb/>
     to the same high school, and the best of 
     <lb/>
     fellowships are engendered there, and yet 
     <lb/>
     these hon. gentlemen opposite are to-day 
     <lb/>
     going to force on this western country— 
     <lb/>
     a country that does not know its own 
     <lb/>
     requirements or the class of people that are 
     <lb/>
     going to populate it—a system that will have 
     <lb/>
     the effect of weakening the efficiency of the 
     <lb/>
     schools in every section. If the ordinance 
     <lb/>
     goes into effect. should there be four famil<lb break="no"/>ies in any neighbourhood and twelve child<lb break="no"/>ren, they will be entitled to establish a sepa<lb break="no"/>rate school in that district. What do we 
     <lb/>
     find regarding the number of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in Ontario? I have here a list 
     <lb/>
     given in the report of the education depart<lb break="no"/>ment for the year of 1904. It shows that 
     <lb/>
     in that province, outside the incorporated 
     <lb/>
     towns and cities. there are 254 separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. 70 of which are in the French 
     <lb/>
     county of Prescott and Russell alone. Nearly 
     <lb/>
     one-third of the whole number of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in the townships are in one county. 
     <lb/>
     Go down to Essex, where there is a large 
     <lb/>
     French population, and you will there find 
     <lb/>
     23 separate schools. In Renfrew, where 
     <lb/>
     there is a large Catholic population. there 
     <lb/>
     are also 12 schools: and in the district of 
     <lb/>
     Nipissing there are 16. so that in the prov: 
     <lb/>
     ince of Ontario to-day this system of sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools in not being looked on favour<lb break="no"/>ably. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I propose to vote for the amendment pro<lb break="no"/>posed by the hon. member for Carleton (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Borden) for several reasons. First. because 
     <lb/>
     this government has no mandate from the 
     <lb/>
     people to bring in this legislation. It was 
     <lb/>
     not an issue in the last election and ought 
     <lb/>
     to be made an issue before being adopted. 
     <lb/>
     because it is a matter of great import. I 
     <lb/>
     propose to vote against it. in the second 
     <lb/>
     place, because it will be injurious to the 
     <lb/>
     well-being of the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
     which to-day are only in their infancy, the 
     <lb/>
     future population of which is unknown, and 
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5275</fw>
     <fw type="num">5276</fw>
          

     I believe that we should not fasten on that 
     <lb/>
     country any such system. I am further 
     <lb/>
     going to vote for the amendment, principally 
     <lb/>
     and primarily, because I do not believe in 
     <lb/>
     the separate school system in Ontario or 
     <lb/>
     any other province. I do not wish to be 
     <lb/>
     understood as saying that I am in favour 
     <lb/>
     of doing away with the separate schools in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario. They are here as a matter of right, 
     <lb/>
     under the constitution, and are here to stay. 
     <lb/>
     But I for one shall protest by my vote 
     <lb/>
     against passing any legislation which will 
     <lb/>
     place in the great Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
     among the millions who must inhabit them 
     <lb/>
     in the years to come. a school system which 
     <lb/>
     will be a matter of regret to those people 
     <lb/>
     and of reproach to those who fastened it 
     <lb/>
     upon them, if the vote of this House should 
     <lb/>
     be in favour of this Bill, as I fear and regret 
     <lb/>
     it will be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     M. A. K. MACLEAN (Lunenburg). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, in rising to address this House I 
     <lb/>
     must express my diffidence because of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that this measure has been discussed 
     <lb/>
     so long and by so many hon. members. But 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless I desire to express my views 
     <lb/>
     concerning it before casting my vote. But 
     <lb/>
     before proceeding with my argument. I Wish 
     <lb/>
     to refer for a moment or two to the remarks 
     <lb/>
     that fell from the hon. gentleman who has 
     <lb/>
     just sat down (Mr. Bennett). I hardly know 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman well enough to under<lb break="no"/>stand why he should waste so much time 
     <lb/>
     in commiserating with the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
     over what he deems to be their troubles. 
     <lb/>
     Surely if commiseration is needed by any 
     <lb/>
     party it is required by the party he is fol<lb break="no"/>lowing to-day. I suppose that in the history 
     <lb/>
     of party government in this country or any 
     <lb/>
     English-speaking country, there never was 
     <lb/>
     an instance of such a lack of discipline, such 
     <lb/>
     a violation of the theory of party govern<lb break="no"/>ment, as is evidenced here today. That 
     <lb/>
     party stands without a leader, without a 
     <lb/>
     policy, with every one of its supporters 
     <lb/>
     going whichever way he chooses. Yet still 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend wastes time pointing out 
     <lb/>
     the weaknesses which he sees in the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment supporters. I am sure we do not 
     <lb/>
     resent the good feeling and the interest 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bennett) evinces towards us, but I would 
     <lb/>
     like to console him by the assurance that the 
     <lb/>
     friends and supporters of the government 
     <lb/>
     are quite capable of taking care of them<lb break="no"/>selves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My hon. friend is rather exercised over 
     <lb/>
     the fact that several newspapers in Ontario 
     <lb/>
     are not favourable to the administration 
     <lb/>
     on this issue. Well, no doubt the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party, as a party would be better 
     <lb/>
     pleased if every newspaper in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion were supporting it ; but we 
     <lb/>
     cannot get everything; and if it does 
     <lb/>
     happen that a newspaper here and 
     <lb/>
     there does oppose this measure, we must 
     <lb/>
     accept the situation. But if my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
    is so much agitated over the want of sup<lb break="no"/>
         

            <pb n="5277" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5277.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5277</fw> <fw type="dateline">MAY 2, 1905</fw> 
 

     port shown by certain newspapers towards 
     <lb/>
     the administration. I am sure he could 
     <lb/>
     render good service to his party if he 
     <lb/>
     would go down to the city of Montreal 
     <lb/>
     and get the Montreal 'Gazette' and the 
     <lb/>
     'Montreal Star' to mend their ways and 
     <lb/>
     back up the policy of the opposition. Per<lb break="no"/>haps, however, the attitude of the news<lb break="no"/>papers is not so very important; and if my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend desires to promote party unity, 
     <lb/>
     surely he will find in his own party ample 
     <lb/>
     room for missionary work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. gentleman referred to the recent 
     <lb/>
     election of the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Oliver). A short time ago our friends to 
     <lb/>
     your left, Mr. Speaker, were challenging the 
     <lb/>
     government to open a constituency in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest. The leader of the opposition— 
     <lb/>
     or rather I should say the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who usually leads it, but who does not in 
     <lb/>
     this matter—expressed upon the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House his approval of the selection of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman who is now Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior. He publicly stated that he would 
     <lb/>
     make a good Minister of the Interior, and 
     <lb/>
     while my hon. friend has just spoken (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bennett) attributes the election of that min<lb break="no"/>ister to the fact that the electors of the 
     <lb/>
     district of Edmonton are largely composed 
     <lb/>
     of Galicians and Russians and other fore<lb break="no"/>igners who came into this country from the 
     <lb/>
     continent, we have it upon the authority of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
     <lb/>
     that the Galicans and the Doukhobors 
     <lb/>
     were all oppposed to separate schools. 
     <lb/>
     Speaking in this House on the 23rd March. 
     <lb/>
     he said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I have letters stating that if petitions had 
     <lb/>
     been sent to the Doukhobors, translated into 
     <lb/>
     their language, seventy-five per cent of them 
     <lb/>
     would sign those petitions. So would the Gali<lb break="no"/>cians and so would the Roman Catholics of 
     <lb/>
     this country.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The hon. gentleman is 
     <lb/>
     not justified in saying that I said all of them 
     <lb/>
     were oppposed to separate schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL2">Mr. A. K. MACLEAN</persName>. I was not aware 
     <lb/>
     that I said all, and if I did so I was cer<lb break="no"/>tainly mistaken, but the hon. member said 
     <lb/>
     seventy-five per cent of them would sign 
     <lb/>
     those petitions and that so would the Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholics. He went on to say : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The Galicians say we left one country be<lb break="no"/>cause of the tyranny of the church and we were

     <lb/>and we do not want it in Canada.

            </p></quote>


            <p>Surely that constituency is just the sort 
     <lb/>of one that our hon. friends desired. Surely 
     <lb/>it is one after my hon. friend's heart. My 
     <lb/>hon. friend the leader of the opposition made 
     <lb/>the statement that the present Minister of 
     <lb/>the Interior would make a very capable min<lb break="no"/>ister, that he was a personal friend of his 
     <lb/>and would like to see the First Minister 
     <lb/>select him. My hon. friend from East Grey 
     <lb/>(Mr. Sproule) said that the people generally 
     <lb/>of the constituency of Edmonton were op<lb break="no"/>posed to the idea of separate schools.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey (Mr. Sproule) did not mention 
     <lb/>
     that .

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL2">Mr. A. K. MACLEAN</persName>. I submit that if 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman's words have any mean<lb break="no"/>ing, the interpretation I have placed upon 
     <lb/>
     them is a fair one. Now the hon, member 
     <lb/>
     for East Simcoe (Mr. Bennett) also complains 
     <lb/>
     that the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) 
     <lb/>
     has not made his address, I presume, upon 
     <lb/>
     the legal aspect of the measure. The argu<lb break="no"/>ment of the Minister of Justice is in the Bill; 
     <lb/>
     where everybody can read it. But the hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
     <lb/>
     has given no legal opinion on this measure— 
     <lb/>
     absolutely none. And I submit that there are 
     <lb/>
     very few hon. members on the opposition 
     <lb/>
     side who have given such an opinion. The 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition has stated that he 
     <lb/>
     stands by the constitution, but he has not 
     <lb/>
     endeavoured to explain what the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion is, he has not uttered a single word 
     <lb/>
     which would make clear what the effect of 
     <lb/>
     this Bill would be legally or what would be 
     <lb/>
     the effect if the constitution were applied. 
     <lb/>
     So, upon that score, I think my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     has not very much reason to complain con<lb break="no"/>cerning the delay of the speech of the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Justice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The attitude assumed by the opposition 
     <lb/>
     on this question is a strange one. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve it is not a fair one. For instance, the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Simcoe stated that 
     <lb/>
     he would support the amendment of the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition on several grounds. 
     <lb/>
     There is only one ground upon which a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this House can intelligently support 
     <lb/>
     that amendment, and that is upon the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional ground. The leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition stated that the educational clauses 
     <lb/>
     constitutionally were ultra vires. Therefore 
     <lb/>
     he moved the amendment. He deliberately 
     <lb/>
     stated in this House, and stated more than 
     <lb/>
     once, that it was not a question of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools or national schools. But the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Simcoe declared a moment 
     <lb/>
     ago that he was going to support the amend<lb break="no"/>ment because he was opposed to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. The same remarks might be made 
     <lb/>
     regarding the speeches of all those hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite who have spoken on the 
     <lb/>
     measure. And what has been the result ? I 
     <lb/>
     submit that the result has been the creation 
     <lb/>
     of an agitation in the country that is most 
     <lb/>
     undesirable. I say that this agitation is 
     <lb/>
     largely due to the fact that the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party as represented in this House to-day 
     <lb/>
     has no policy and the members have been 
     <lb/>
     permitted to go here, there and everywhere. 
     <lb/>
     One hon. member was allowed to make 
     <lb/>
     one statement, and another hon. member a 
     <lb/>
     different statement. There were just two 
     <lb/>
     ways to deal with this issue. It could pos<lb break="no"/>sibly be argued fairly on constitutional 
     <lb/>
     grounds, or it could be dealt with as a 
     <lb/>
     matter of public policy. And the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, I contend should have taken one or 
     <lb/>
     other of these grounds. But they agreed 
     <lb/>
     to go every man for himself, upon the 


            <pb n="5279" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5279.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5279</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
         

     theory that that was the best method 
     <lb/>
     to create an agitation the best method 
     <lb/>
     to secure some political advantage at the 
     <lb/>
     next general election. And I contend. that 
     <lb/>
     there is ample evidence that the opposition 
     <lb/>
     seek to play upon the quickly responsive 
     <lb/>
     cord of religious and racial prejudice for 
     <lb/>
     political effect and nothing else. They talk 
     <lb/>
     about provincial rights and about the con<lb break="no"/>stitution. They talk against separate schools 
     <lb/>
     and some of them talk against national 
     <lb/>
     schools. I submit that all this is simply a 
     <lb/>
     patch work of fig-leaves to hide the naked 
     <lb/>
     fact of political expediency. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me refer to one or two matters which 
     <lb/>
     afford evidence that this is the policy of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition. Take the land clause of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill. Now. the speech of the hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition on that clause of the Bill oc<lb break="no"/>cupies a very small space in 'Hansard.' Sure<lb break="no"/>ly it was a very important matter. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion of provincial tights might have been 
     <lb/>
     as easily raised in reference to the land 
     <lb/>
     clause as to the educational clauses. And 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country, I can quite un<lb break="no"/>derstand, were very much interested in the 
     <lb/>
     way parliament should deal with the public 
     <lb/>
     lands. The reason. I suppose. why we had 
     <lb/>
     no petitions in reference to the land clause 
     <lb/>
     was that it did not afford so responsive a 
     <lb/>
     cord to play upon as the eduaational clauses. 
     <lb/>
     I have a word or two to say about the con<lb break="no"/>duct of the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule) in reference to this measure. I am 
     <lb/>
     not going to say that the hon. gentleman is 
     <lb/>
     not conscientious in the position he takes 
     <lb/>
     on the educational clauses of the Bill. His 
     <lb/>
     conduct in 1896 lends strength to the posi<lb break="no"/>tion he takes upon this occasion But I 
     <lb/>
     think he has had his weather eye open for 
     <lb/>
     his party. Now, I very seldom tell a story, 
     <lb/>
     and a story is never improved by my telling 
     <lb/>
     it. But the conduct of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey on this occasion reminds me of 
     <lb/>
     a story of Max O'Rell's designed to illu<lb break="no"/>strate a phase of the Scotch character. He 
     <lb/>
     was seeking to show how close the minis<lb break="no"/>ters of the old school regarded themselves 
     <lb/>
     in their relations to the deity. An old Pres<lb break="no"/>byterian minister desiring on a certain day 
     <lb/>
     that the wind should blow got down upon 
     <lb/>
     his knees and prayed 'Oh Lord, give us 
     <lb/>
     a wind ; not a rantin' tantin,' tearin' wind, 
     <lb/>
     but a nice, gentle winnin' wind.' It hap<lb break="no"/>pened that at that moment a breeze came 
     <lb/>
     up, which blew the parsons manuscript off 
     <lb/>
     the table and scattered the leaves over the 
     <lb/>
     room, whereat he said: 'Now, Lord, this 
     <lb/>
     is ridiculous.' I think the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey was playing for an agitation not 
     <lb/>
     a 'nice, gentle agitation' but a 'real rantin 
     <lb/>
     tantin,' tearin' agitation. And when the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) blew 
     <lb/>
     in here to-day. the hon. member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey must have said 'Brethren this is 
     <lb/>
     ridiculous.' The hon member (Mr Sproule) 
     <lb/>
     is at the head of an organization. Con<lb break="no"/>cerning that organization of course I have 
     <lb/>
     nothing to say. But I would say this 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5279</fw>
     <fw type="num">5280</fw>
      

     that when a gentleman is elected to par<lb break="no"/>liament his palamount duty is to the state. 
     <lb/>
     and, as issues arise he should be in a 
     <lb/>
     position to give his untrammelled judgment 
     <lb/>
     to them, and that judgment should not be 
     <lb/>
     affected by any alliance or connection with 
     <lb/>
     any fraternal organization. The action of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member in sending out his letter 
     <lb/>
     before this measure was introduced, I sub<lb break="no"/>mit, was not quite the proper thing. He 
     <lb/>
     was. of course, within his legal rights in 
     <lb/>
     so doing, and one cannot very well complain 
     <lb/>
     of it on that ground. But still I think it is 
     <lb/>
     open to the contention that the purpose and 
     <lb/>
     intention of his circular letter addressed, 
     <lb/>
     ' Dear Sir and Brother ' was largely for poll- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     tical effect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My contention in this respect is con<lb break="no"/>firmed, I think, by the fact that down in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec we find a Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive political club known as the Jacques 
     <lb/>
     Cartier Club, issuing a letter to a different 
     <lb/>
     class of people altogether, asking them to 
     <lb/>
     oppose the administration for the reason 
     <lb/>
     that the educational clauses of the Bill do 
     <lb/>
     not go far enough. Now I say that the 
     <lb/>
     effect of these petitions was bad for this 
     <lb/>
     country. They created an agitation. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place, the hon. member for Victoria 
     <lb/>
     and Haliburton (Mr. Sam. Hughes) became 
     <lb/>
     agitated, and he was going to shoulder his 
     <lb/>
     musket and fight for provincial rights. Of 
     <lb/>
     course, nothing happened. It affected many 
     <lb/>
     newspapers in this country. For instance. 
     <lb/>
     the Hamilton 'Spectator' of a recent date 
     <lb/>
     used the following language: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     This was one of the results of that agita<lb break="no"/>tion. I am sure that very' few hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who sit with the opposition will ap<lb break="no"/>prove of these remarks of the Hamilton 
     <lb/>
     'Spectator.' But unfortunately that paper 
     <lb/>
     and many others are daily using similar 
     <lb/>
     remarks. they are all bringing grist to the 
     <lb/>
     mill of the Conservative party, and unless 
     <lb/>
     the leaders of that party exercise their 
     <lb/>
     influence and have these papers desist from 
     <lb/>
     such a low tone of discussion of a public 
     <lb/>
     issue. they must bear responsibility for 
     <lb/>
     what they say. Now that extract from 
     <lb/>
     the Hamilton 'Spectator' was read in this 
     <lb/>
     House by the Minister of Customs some 
     <lb/>
     two or three weeks ago. The leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition and the hon. member for West 
     <lb/>
     Toronto (Mr. Osler) atempted to apologize 
     <lb/>
     for this statement of the Hamilton 'Spec<lb break="no"/>tator.' But we find immediately a Toronto 
     <lb/>
     paper coming to the support of the Hamil<lb break="no"/>ton 'Spectator.' I wish to read something 
     <lb/>
     from the Toronto 'Telegram' in reference

     The Hamilton 'Spectator' does not lead the

     could not be worse led.

            <p>
     Ontario is just about tired of having the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party led from. the Montreal 'Star'

            </p>

            <p>
     The Hamilton 'Spectator ' may have erred in

     saying what everybody thinks, but if Mr. Bor<lb break="no"/>den and Mr. Osler apologize for their own

            <p>
     It is, unfortunately, true that Mr. Borden and

     Now, Mr. Speaker, I say that does not 
     <lb/>
     speak well for the press of this country, it 
     <lb/>
     does not speak well for the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party. to have its leading organs uttering 
     <lb/>
     such unworthy sentiments as that, and it 
     <lb/>
     will be a sad day in the history of this 
     <lb/>
     country if the time should ever come, and 
     <lb/>
     I believe it will not come, when the highest 
     <lb/>
     position in this land, that of Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister, is not open to any Canadian. what<lb break="no"/>ever be his religion or whatever be his 
     <lb/>
     race. I could give many other illustra<lb break="no"/>tions to show how public feeling has been 
     <lb/>
     aroused in this country, a result largely 
     <lb/>
     due I think to the course pursued by the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party. I have recently seen 
     <lb/>
     two letters addressed to hon. members of 
     <lb/>
     this House both from residents of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario. The writer of one letter 
     <lb/>
     inquired if it were not true that the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics of Canada serving in our militia 
     <lb/>
     got bigger pay per day than the Protes<lb break="no"/>tants. I saw another letter inquiring as to 
     <lb/>
     whether it was not true that all through 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec there were being 
     <lb/>
     stored rifles and ammunition in the base<lb break="no"/>ments of the Catholic churches. These gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen scented danger, and they may have 
     <lb/>
     been quite honest in their fear: but I say 
     <lb/>
     they were aroused to this particular form of 
     <lb/>
     excitement largely by the position taken by 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I wish to refer for a moment to the 
     <lb/>
     remarks of the hon. member for North To<lb break="no"/>ronto (Mr. Foster). He made the famous 
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5281</fw>
     <fw type="num">5282</fw>
      

     declaration in discussing this Bill that he 
     <lb/>
     felt himself quite free to reverse the posi<lb break="no"/>tion Which he took in 1896 by reason of 
     <lb/>
     the fact that the Conservative party was 
     <lb/>
     defeated in that year, and had been de<lb break="no"/>feated twice since. Now, Sir. no declar<lb break="no"/>ation has been quoted more frequently in 
     <lb/>
     the United States than that of Henry Clay. 
     <lb/>
     who said that he would rather be right 
     <lb/>
     than be president. But the declaration 
     <lb/>
     made by the hon. member for North To<lb break="no"/>ronto is that he will follow the people, 
     <lb/>
     whether they are right or whether they 
     <lb/>
     are wrong. He is like the immortal. Flan<lb break="no"/>nigan from Texas, who, in closing a 
     <lb/>
     speech, addressed his audience saying: 
     <lb/>
     ' Gentlemen, them's my sentiments, and if 
     <lb/>
     they don't suit you they can be changed.' 
     <lb/>
     Now certainly these are not high ideals to 
     <lb/>
     put before the youth of this country. There 
     <lb/>
     is a distinction between right and wrong, 
     <lb/>
     and there is surely no reason in this coun<lb break="no"/>try why a person should desert what he 
     <lb/>
     considers to be the true position merely 
     <lb/>
     because his party meets with a political re<lb break="no"/>verse, and possibly upon some other issue 
     <lb/>
     altogether. But I do not for a moment 
     <lb/>
     admit that the Conservative party were de<lb break="no"/>feated in 1896 upon the school question. I 
     <lb/>
     may not agree with some of my own politi<lb break="no"/>cal friends on that point. The Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive party about that time were in rather 
     <lb/>
     a bad state, they could not get along With 
     <lb/>
     themselves, and certainly they could not 
     <lb/>
     get along with the country. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who leads the opposition in the 
     <lb/>
     other chamber said that on New Year's 
     <lb/>
     Day, 1896, that day when the whole world 
     <lb/>
     breathes forth hosannas of peace on earth 
     <lb/>
     and good will towards man, he made a call 
     <lb/>
     upon one of the ministers, and he tells us 
     <lb/>
     that while he was paying his respects to 
     <lb/>
     the ladies, this minister was trying to 
     <lb/>
     seduce one of his other ministers away 
     <lb/>
     from the cabinet. Now if such conduct 
     <lb/>
     prevailed on New Year's Day among cabinet 
     <lb/>
     ministers. surely we could expect almost 
     <lb/>
     anything to occur in the ranks of the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party. But I notice that the prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of the hon. member for North Toronto. 
     <lb/>
     his political ethics, were not of a much 
     <lb/>
     higher standard in the past than they are 
     <lb/>
     to-day. He addressed this parliament in 
     <lb/>
     1896 upon the Manitoba school question and 
     <lb/>
     I think he was the last speaker on the 
     <lb/>
     government side. I must admit that he made 
     <lb/>
     a speech which was an exceedingly able 
     <lb/>
     and admirable one, notwithstanding that 
     <lb/>
     there are portions of it with which I do 
     <lb/>
     not agree. I wish to read just a short 
     <lb/>
     quotation from that speech to show what 
     <lb/>
     was the standard of political ethics of that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman then and when I read that 
     <lb/>
     I am sure hon. gentlemen will not be sur<lb break="no"/>prised at the position taken by him the 
     <lb/>
     other day. He was then addressmg the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party. He knew that there 
     <lb/>
     were to be many desertions from the ranks

     with a slight transposition these words

     We have cards up our sleeves, cards in our

     Quebec, a provincial rights pack of cards 
     <lb/>
     in Ontario, and Mr. Rogers is making cards 
     <lb/>
     for Manitoba. The premier of the Northwest

     the very same speech which I wish to read

     to show also what the political ethics of

     it also in the complimentary sense, because

     What answer is it to the country's best in<lb break="no"/>terests, if we go back to them with a defeated 
     <lb/>
     policy and a defeated government, putting into 
     <lb/>
     power a policy and a government in which we 
     <lb/>
     do not believe, but which we do believe will 
     <lb/>
     not be for the best interests of Canada. If 
     <lb/>
     we have nothing to place against such action 
     <lb/>
     but this one question, upon which we hold 
     <lb/>
     honest beliefs, maybe, can we not to some ex<lb break="no"/>tent subordinate one opinion, strong though it 
     <lb/>
     be, for the greater good, the larger policy, the 
     <lb/>
     more valuable and the more precious interest 
     <lb/>
     of the whole. What will it have profited us, 
     <lb/>
     even it we gain a point of sentiment or of 
     <lb/>
     principle in one respect; what will it have 
     <lb/>
     profited us if we lose the soul of a progressive 
     <lb/>
     policy anl a wise administration of affairs.

     In other words the hon. Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance in 1896 said: Sacrifice principle to 
     <lb/>
     keep our party in power and there can be 
     <lb/>
     little wonder, of course, that to-day he has 
     <lb/>
     stated that so long as water runs and grass 
     <lb/>
     grows he will not bind himself to adhere 
     <lb/>
     to that which he thinks is right.

            <p>
     There is one thing about this speech 
     <lb/>
     which claims the admiration even of the 
     <lb/>
     friends of the present administration, and 
     <lb/>
     it is, that the hon. member for North Tor<lb break="no"/>onto was making a splendid effort to in<lb break="no"/>duce his party to stand together. He did 
     <lb/>
     it cleverly; I give him all possible credit 
     <lb/>
     for it, but I say the position taken by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition stands in 
     <lb/>
     sorry contrast with the position then taken 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for North Toronto. 
     <lb/>
     Before I proceed let me first refer to one or 
     <lb/>
     two things. When this measure was first 
 

            <pb n="5285" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5285.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5285</fw> <fw type="dateline">MAY 2, 1905</fw> 
          

     introduced to the House the cry and prayer 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. leader of the opposition was : 
     <lb/>
     Don't rush the Bill. Then there were many 
     <lb/>
     requests from the hon. leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position, day after day, to bring the Bill 
     <lb/>
     down immediately and one would imagine 
     <lb/>
     that the whole Conservative party were 
     <lb/>
     united, that there were no dissentients in 
     <lb/>
     their ranks, that they had settled upon a 
     <lb/>
     sound and fixed policy. They were practi<lb break="no"/>cally saying : Bring forth the beast of sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools so that we may get our hands 
     <lb/>
     on it right now and here. That was not 
     <lb/>
     the fact when the second reading of this 
     <lb/>
     Bill was moved. The position which the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition took upon 
     <lb/>
     that occasion was, I say, not creditable to 
     <lb/>
     himself or to his party. It was not fair to 
     <lb/>
     the country and I submit it is open to criti<lb break="no"/>cism. The hon. gentleman made a legal 
     <lb/>
     argument and it was, I concede, a very able 
     <lb/>
     one. He seemed very sure about the cor<lb break="no"/>rectness of his argument, because he postu<lb break="no"/>lated everything from his premises to his 
     <lb/>
     conclusion andin effect he said that this was 
     <lb/>
     the straight and narrow path to sound poli<lb break="no"/>tical principle and statesmanship. He said 
     <lb/>
     the administration had no more right to pass 
     <lb/>
     the educational clauses of this Bill than they 
     <lb/>
     would have to amend Mahomet's Koran. 
     <lb/>
     He says it is not open to argument, and 
     <lb/>
     then he turns to his followers, but he does 
     <lb/>
     not exhort them to stand together in his 
     <lb/>
     support as did the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto (Mr. Foster) in 1896, but he tells 
     <lb/>
     them that he does not expect them to follow 
     <lb/>
     his lead if for reasons of conscience they 
     <lb/>
     cannot see their way to do so. I would 
     <lb/>
     like to know what conscience has to do with 
     <lb/>
     the consideration of a question of constitu<lb break="no"/>tional law ? I never saw in any text-book 
     <lb/>
     upon the interpretation of statutes, that 
     <lb/>
     conscience was a canon of construction. I 
     <lb/>
     have heard that at one time in England, 
     <lb/>
     law was measured by the length of the 
     <lb/>
     chancellor's foot, but I never heard of 
     <lb/>
     legal principles being aflirmed on the rule 
     <lb/>
     of conscience. I never saw in Holman vs. 
     <lb/>
     the Crown. or in the Queen vs. Robinson, or 
     <lb/>
     in any other constitutional case any refer<lb break="no"/>ence to conscience. Nevertheless, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Mr. R. L. Borden) for some rea<lb break="no"/>son or other turns to his followers and says : 
     <lb/>
     While I am absolutely sound in my opinion, 
     <lb/>
     and while the legislation is clearly ultra 
     <lb/>
     vii-es. still for conscience sake you are at 
     <lb/>
     liberty to oppose it. This brand of <choice><sic>consci<lb break="no"/>enec</sic><corr>conscience</corr></choice> seems a very peculiar thing to me— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. Hear, hear.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL2">Mr. A. K. MACLEAN</persName>. I am referring to 
     <lb/>
     the particular kind of conscience which the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition was speaking of. 
     <lb/>
     If you try to define it, or measure it, or size 
     <lb/>
     it up in any way, you are puzzled. It does 
     <lb/>
     not seem to be governed by latitude, or by 
     <lb/>
     longitude, or by altitude. From the island 
     <lb/>
     of Montreal there are three Conservative 
     <lb/>
     members, and they have expressed their

     willingness to support the government mea<lb break="no"/>sure. While an hon. member from Toronto 
     <lb/>
     told us this afternoon that he was going 
     <lb/>
     to support the amendment—I suppose on 
     <lb/>
     conscientious grounds. I am curious to 
     <lb/>
     know what effects this change of conscience 
     <lb/>
     within an area of a few hundred miles. 
     <lb/>
     Does the atmosphere of the St. Lawrence 
     <lb/>
     in the neighbourhood of Montreal generate a 
     <lb/>
     different form of conscience from that which 
     <lb/>
     the atmosphere of Lake Ontario does ? The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Cornwall and Stormont 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Pringle) has expressed his intention of 
     <lb/>
     supporting this measure, and I wonder if 
     <lb/>
     the climatic conditions in his neighbour<lb break="no"/>hood produces another kind of conscience. 
     <lb/>
     This conscientious argument submitted by 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition does not appear 
     <lb/>
     to me to be fair. I look upon it as an inti<lb break="no"/>mation to his followers to pursue whatever 
     <lb/>
     course might suit their constituents. It is 
     <lb/>
     possible, of course, that some members of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition may not have any conscience 
     <lb/>
     at all on this question, but possibly their 
     <lb/>
     constituents have a conscience, and it might 
     <lb/>
     be right to respect the conscience of your 
     <lb/>
     constituents. I sympathize with any mem<lb break="no"/>ber supporting the opposition who represents 
     <lb/>
     a constituency where there is perhaps a fair 
     <lb/>
     division of conscience, for it may be very 
     <lb/>
     difficult for him to decide which form of 
     <lb/>
     conscience he will be guided by, as to 
     <lb/>
     whether he will vote for the Bill or support 
     <lb/>
     the amendment. I am reminded of another 
     <lb/>
     story which will illustrate this, though per<lb break="no"/>haps I am breaking my record for story<lb break="no"/>telling. During the days of the American 
     <lb/>
     civil war a settler lived upon the Mason 
     <lb/>
     and Dixon line, in the state of Missouri, and 
     <lb/>
     he was very careful whenever he was ques<lb break="no"/>tioned by a sentry of the northern army to 
     <lb/>
     declare that he was against slavery, and to 
     <lb/>
     a confederate sentry he was as careful to 
     <lb/>
     state that he was in favour of secession. 
     <lb/>
     But one day both sentries met together, and 
     <lb/>
     his declaration then was: I am nothing at 
     <lb/>
     all, and not much of that. I fear that some 
     <lb/>
     members of the opposition will find them<lb break="no"/>selves in that very predicament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Possibly it may be good party tactics, and 
     <lb/>
     possibly these manoeuvers are not at all 
     <lb/>
     discreditable to the intellect of the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition, for it may be that these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who have been given leave to 
     <lb/>
     vote as they like under the conscience 
     <lb/>
     rule, are the doves which the Noah of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party is sending out to carry 
     <lb/>
     some message of good-will to hierarchies 
     <lb/>
     and to minorities, so that possibly during 
     <lb/>
     the next election they may come back to the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative ark hearing from here and 
     <lb/>
     there an olive branch. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I submit that the position taken by the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition was not fair to this 
     <lb/>
     country ; I submit that it was not fair even 
     <lb/>
     to his own political friends. The people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada are not agitated about provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights or about the constitutional question. 
     <lb/>
     Possibly not one per cent of Canadian elec<lb break="no"/>
     

            <pb n="5287" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5287.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5287</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>
            
         

     tors have ever read the speech delivered by 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition, and possibly not 
     <lb/>
     one-hundredth of one per cent of them would 
     <lb/>
     understand it if they did read it. There 
     <lb/>
     is no disguising the fact that the issue in 
     <lb/>
     the country in reference to this measure is 
     <lb/>
     on the abstract question of separate versus 
     <lb/>
     national schools. It is a condition that con<lb break="no"/>fronts us and not a legal proposition, and I 
     <lb/>
     submit that the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     should have adopted the course which most 
     <lb/>
     of his followers have pursued, and discussed 
     <lb/>
     the question on its merits. It is said that 
     <lb/>
     this matter should be left to the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. and that in any case the provincial 
     <lb/>
     governments will treat the minority fairly. 
     <lb/>
     Well, there are some things upon which one 
     <lb/>
     man will not trust another, one race will 
     <lb/>
     not trust another, one religion will not trust 
     <lb/>
     another. In ordinary business transactions 
     <lb/>
     it is not considered shrewd to enter into a 
     <lb/>
     contract without reducing it to writing. and 
     <lb/>
     where religious or racial prejudices may 
     <lb/>
     surround a bargain, I submit that it is only 
     <lb/>
     right that people who are asking for protec<lb break="no"/>tion Should have protection guaranteed to 
     <lb/>
     them in some form or another. Many good 
     <lb/>
     reasons have developed why the minority in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories should not trust 
     <lb/>
     the provincial governments to do them jus<lb break="no"/>tice. If the legal argument made by the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition means anything. it 
     <lb/>
     means that the Territories came into con<lb break="no"/>federation in 1870. He quoted the Barrett 
     <lb/>
     case, and from that he concluded that there 
     <lb/>
     was no system of separate schools in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, and he therefore sub<lb break="no"/>mits that section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act could not possibly apply to 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces. and that the minority 
     <lb/>
     there would have no legal standing what<lb break="no"/>ever. We have some hon. gentlemen stating 
     <lb/>
     that the provinces, when established. would. 
     <lb/>
     if they had the opportunity, legislate against 
     <lb/>
     these separate schools. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Algoma (Mr. Boyce), a few nights ago. 
     <lb/>
     criticising the administration for submitting 
     <lb/>
     this measure to a new parliament, said:

     moment that majority is obtained. it is used

            <p>
     I gather that this is an attack on the 
     <lb/>
     system of schools which the minority desire 
     <lb/>
     to establish there, and it is sufficient to 
     <lb/>
     lead the minority to think that there would 
     <lb/>
     be no protection or guarantee of their 
     <lb/>
     rights. I say further that the tone of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative press in this country to-day, 
     <lb/>
     particularly in some of the provinces. jus<lb break="no"/>tifies the minority in believing that their 
     <lb/>
     rights cannot be protected in any other way 
     <lb/>
     than by providing for them in this Act. 
     <lb/>
     Now. there is nothing unreasonable in the 
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5287</fw>
     <fw type="num">5288</fw>
   

     minority of a new province asking to have 
     <lb/>
     these rights provided for in the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. The province of Nova Scotia, when 
     <lb/>
     it entered confederation, was not satisfied 
     <lb/>
     to take the word of the fathers of confed<lb break="no"/>eration that the Intercolonial Railway 
     <lb/>
     would be built; it was provided for in the 
     <lb/>
     constitution. The province of British Col<lb break="no"/>umbia in the same way would not take 
     <lb/>
     the word of the Dominion government that 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway-would be 
     <lb/>
     built. The construction of that road was 
     <lb/>
     one of the conditions on which that pro<lb break="no"/>vince agreed to enter the confederation. 
     <lb/>
     and that condition was placed in the Order 
     <lb/>
     in Council bringing in that province. And 
     <lb/>
     there does seem to me, Mr. Speaker, no 
     <lb/>
     reason why there should be any agitation 
     <lb/>
     in this country over this issue, or why 
     <lb/>
     there should be any opposition to this mea<lb break="no"/>sure. In fact, very few members who 
     <lb/>
     have spoken in this House have expressed 
     <lb/>
     any aversion to the separate schools as 
     <lb/>
     they exist in the Northwest. Not one 
     <lb/>
     single member coming from the Territories 
     <lb/>
     has spoken a word against them. In fact, 
     <lb/>
     I doubt if more than two members of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition altogether have spoken against 
     <lb/>
     the system of schools which they have. 
     <lb/>
     That being the case. there is not in my 
     <lb/>
     judgment any ground whatever for the ap<lb break="no"/>parent disturbance of public opinion which 
     <lb/>
     has recently existed upon this question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I submit, Mr. Speaker, that this is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of policy; and, if we read the history 
     <lb/>
     of this country, it will aid us in no small 
     <lb/>
     degree in reaching a proper conclusion in 
     <lb/>
     this case. The history of Canada is a his<lb break="no"/>tory of compacts from the very beginning 
     <lb/>
     up to the present time. The beginning of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian history dates from the Treaty of 
     <lb/>
     Paris. when this country passed from 
     <lb/>
     French to British control. By that treaty 
     <lb/>
     the rights of the French and the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the Catholics were protected. The next 
     <lb/>
     compact was the Confederation Act, in 
     <lb/>
     which special provision was made for the 
     <lb/>
     protection of the minorities in the provin<lb break="no"/>ces of Ontario and Quebec, and particu<lb break="no"/>larly for the continuation and perpetuation 
     <lb/>
     of the school systems as they existed in 
     <lb/>
     those provinces. Provision was also made 
     <lb/>
     for the continuation of minority schools 
     <lb/>
     which might be established in any other 
     <lb/>
     province coming into the union, and for 
     <lb/>
     granting a remedy in case any provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislature interfered with any system of 
     <lb/>
     separate, schools that had been established. 
     <lb/>
     In 1875. when the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     were given a form of constitution, it was 
     <lb/>
     specially provided that the minority might 
     <lb/>
     under certain conditions establish separate 
     <lb/>
    schools. That proposition received the 
     <lb/>support at that time of men like George 
     <lb/>Brown. Alexander Mackenzie. Edward 
     <lb/>Blake and Sir John Macdonald: and I have 
     <lb/>not the slightest doubt that when these 
  

            <pb n="5289" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5289.jpg"/>

            <fw type="dateline">MAY 2, 1905</fw>
            
         

     men expressed their assent to the estab<lb break="no"/>lishment of that system of schools, it was 
     <lb/>
     with the idea that it once established it 
     <lb/>
     was to be continued. Therefore I submit 
     <lb/>
     that there rests on this country a moral 
     <lb/>
     obligation to give to the minorities in those 
     <lb/>
     two provinces that system of schools un<lb break="no"/>der which they have existed in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories for the past thirty years, 
     <lb/>
     and it would be an unwarrantable repudia<lb break="no"/>tion for us not to grant that which they 
     <lb/>
     have had for the past thirty years, and for 
     <lb/>
     which they now ask. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The task of building up a nation in Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America is no easy task. The 
     <lb/>
     diversity of race brought to us other diver<lb break="no"/>sities. To mould the constitution and our 
     <lb/>
     public policy along lines that will receive 
     <lb/>
     the recognition of these diversities is the 
     <lb/>
     task of every Canadian. The fathers of 
     <lb/>
     confederation recognized this difliculty, and 
     <lb/>
     the education issue was perhaps the gravest 
     <lb/>
     that-confronted them. Their mode of set<lb break="no"/>tlement as applied to the provinces at that 
     <lb/>
     date is the method sought to be applied 
     <lb/>
     to-day to the new provinces. I have 
     <lb/>
     not the slightest doubt that it was the 
     <lb/>
     intention of the framers of the consti<lb break="no"/>tution that when these Territories should 
     <lb/>
     enter the confederation, the educational 
     <lb/>
     rights of the minorities should be protected 
     <lb/>
     just as the educational rights of the mi<lb break="no"/>norities in the other provinces were pro<lb break="no"/>tected by section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act; and any attempt to disturb 
     <lb/>
     this policy which has been lived up to 
     <lb/>
     in the past would, I believe, he disas<lb break="no"/>trous to the country. This is the only way 
     <lb/>
     in which we can secure national content<lb break="no"/>ment and national unity. Canada to-day 
     <lb/>
     is making such progress as to satisfy 
     <lb/>
     the aspirations of the most ambitious 
     <lb/>
     of us; and, as an hon. gentleman said the 
     <lb/>
     other day, we. are simply at the morning 
     <lb/>
     star, at the cock-crowing, of our national 
     <lb/>
     existence, but any interference with those 
     <lb/>
     rights which have been established, and 
     <lb/>
     which are so dear to certain classes of our 
     <lb/>
     population would, I fear, seriously injure 
     <lb/>
     the country. To maintain our present posi<lb break="no"/>tion and develop further with the years 
     <lb/>
     to come internal calm is necessary. It 
     <lb/>
     would take little to disturb the unity of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian spirit, and perhaps threaten 
     <lb/>
     the compact of confederation. It is our 
     <lb/>
     duty to face our conditions and build up 
     <lb/>
     our growing country on lines that will 
     <lb/>
     meet our conditions. It is due to our 
     <lb/>
     national integrity that we religiously ad<lb break="no"/>here to the compacts a-nd compromises made 
     <lb/>
     by the fathers of confederation—that we 
     <lb/>
     adhere to the legislative compact made with 
     <lb/>
     the Territories in 1875; and I believe, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     that the people of this country will approve 
     <lb/>
     of the clauses of the measure now before 
     <lb/>
     the House, which seek to preserve the 
     <lb/>
     rights granted to the minority in the Ter<lb break="no"/>

riorities in 1875. For these reasons, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I Purpose giving to the measure 
     <lb/>
     my support. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WORT1">Mr. A. N. WORTHINGTON</persName> (Sherbrooke). 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, smce the commencement of 
     <lb/>
     the debate on the Bill which the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     the First Minster has brought before the 
     <lb/>
     House, I have listened to the speeches de<lb break="no"/>livered on both sides, and have endeavoured 
     <lb/>
     to form an independent and unbiased opin<lb break="no"/>ion that would guide me in registering my 
     <lb/>
     vote when the time came for a division on 
     <lb/>
     this important question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Notwithstanding the fact that the Bill 
     <lb/>
     contains many clauses relating to the distri<lb break="no"/>bution of lands, public moneys and educa<lb break="no"/>tional matters, only one clause seems to 
     <lb/>
     have occupied the time of the House to 
     <lb/>
     any extent, and that is the educational clause. 
     <lb/>
     Whether due to a religious zeal or for other 
     <lb/>
     reasons. all other questions seem to pale 
     <lb/>
     before this one, and to such an extent that 
     <lb/>
     the man on the street speaks not of the 
     <lb/>
     Autonomy Bill but of the Separate School 
     <lb/>
     Bill. So many and so varied are the argu<lb break="no"/>ments brought forward by hon. members 
     <lb/>
     on either side of the House and so diamet<lb break="no"/>rically opposed are the views expressed 
     <lb/>
     that a layman, of non-legal mind and at<lb break="no"/>tainments might well pause and wonder 
     <lb/>
     where we are at. For that reason, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I think it would have been wiser 
     <lb/>
     and more in the interest of peace and har<lb break="no"/>mony if the government had submitted this 
     <lb/>
     Bill to the highest legal authorities before 
     <lb/>
     presenting it to the House. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition, in his amend<lb break="no"/>ment to the second reading of the Bill, laid 
     <lb/>
     down the principle that upon the creation 
     <lb/>
     of a province in the Northwest: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The legislature of each province, subject to 
     <lb/>
     and in accordance with the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Acts of 1867 and 1886, 
     <lb/>
     is entitled to and should enjoy full powers of 
     <lb/>
     self-government, including the power to 
     <lb/>
     exclusively make laws in relation to edu<lb break="no"/>tion.

            <p>
     By this amendment the question in issue 
     <lb/>
     is simply whether or not by an Act of the 
     <lb/>
     federal parliament   the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Saskatchewan and Alberta shall be 
     <lb/>
     restricted in their freedom to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the question of education as they 
     <lb/>
     see fit. The amendment is in no sense an 
     <lb/>
     attack on separate schools, nor is it neces<lb break="no"/>sary, in order to oppose it, to defend sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools; if the issue raised in the 
     <lb/>
     amendment was rigidly adhered to, the 
     <lb/>
     advantages or disadvantages of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools need not be mentioned. The issue 
     <lb/>
     raised is simply a constitutional one and not 
     <lb/>
     a sectarian one. The limitation in power in 
     <lb/>
     What the British North America Act says is 
     <lb/>
     a matter exclusively within provincial con<lb break="no"/>trol, is what the amendment condemns, and 
     <lb/>
     a strict regard for the constitution should

     <lb/>
     new provinces shall have the same control                 
     <lb/>
     of education as is enjoyed by the provinces         
     <lb/>
    of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, British Columbia, and since the                 
     <lb/>defeat of the Remedial Bill, by the then

     When the debate began, the rock of the      
     <lb/>
     constitution stood out in bold relief with a             
     <lb/>
     danger signal on its summit, but the ex-                   
     <lb break="yes"/>
    Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) was the                       
     <lb/>first to see that danger signal and strike                   
     <lb/>for term firma, and the waves of discord and                   
     <lb/>dissention were loosed in deference to the             
     <lb/>man on the street. The rock has been sub-                   
     <lb/>merged and nought remains save the danger                 
     <lb/>signal; and a government with convictions             
     <lb/>which change with dates, are as strongly             
     <lb/>opposed to provincial rights to-day as they               
     <lb/>were ardent in favour of them 1896. My               
     <lb/>hon. friend from Marquette (Mr. Roche)                   
     <lb/>quoted the speech of the ex-Minister of the                 
     <lb/>Interior (Mr. Sifton) which was delivered                     
     <lb/>at Caledonia Springs in April, 1895. In that                 
     <lb/>speech the ex-Minister of the Interior was                   
     <lb/>very warm in his denunciation of separate                 
     <lb/>schools, but as this speech has been fully                 
     <lb/>quoted by my hon. friend from Marquette,               
     <lb/>I will content myself with citing only one                 
     <lb/>item which deals more especially with pro-             
     <lb/>vincial rights The hon. gentleman (Mr.

            <p>As a junior member of the House, I shall<lb/>not presume for a moment to discuss the <lb/>question of the constitution, and for ex<lb break="no"/>cellent reasons, the most important of which <lb/>is, not that it does not appeal to the man <lb/>on the street, but because the con<lb break="no"/>stitution seems, in the latter stages<lb/>of the debate, to have been lost sight<lb/>of. What I will have to say in defense of<lb/>the action I may take will be drawn from <lb/>the records of British fair play and from the<lb/>traditions of the Conservative party; from<lb/>that sense of equity and justice which pre<lb break="no"/>vails wherever the flag of the motherland <lb/>floats to-day— that sense of justice which<lb/>gave equal rights to Frnench and English<lb/>Catholics and Protestants in Quebec, and <lb/>which, after an arduous struggle of three<lb/>years in south Africa, entailing the loss of <lb/>thousands of her sons and the expenditure<lb/>of many millions, has given to a valiant foe<lb/>equal rights of language, religion, and educa<lb break="no"/>tion; from the traditions of a party that<lb/>has always been true to the principles of<lb/>equality and justice to the minority, Pro<lb break="no"/>estants or Catholics. Personally I would<lb/>be in favour of national schools, but repre<lb break="no"/>senting a constituency composed of all<lb/>classes, creeds, and nationalities which go to <lb/>make up our great Canadian nationality, I<lb/>consider that I am not here to advance my <lb/>

     personal ideas at the expense of my consti<lb break="no"/>tuents, that I am not here to express the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of Catholics or the opinions of 
     <lb/>
     Protestants, but to endeavour to arrive 
     <lb/>
     at a conclusion which will be satis<lb break="no"/>factory to all. and to make my views 
     <lb/>
     subservient to those of the great ma<lb break="no"/>jority of the people I have the honour

     to represent.

            <p>
     I do not intend to make more than a pass<lb break="no"/>ing reference to the school ordinances of 
     <lb/>
     1891. I would like to include them in my 
     <lb/>
     I remarks, but they have been fully explained 
     <lb/>
     by hon. members on both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     House. In these ordinances there is no<lb break="no"/>thing that can give offence to anybody. 
     <lb/>
     Under these, the regulating of the duties 
     <lb/>
     of teachers and the control of the schools 
     <lb/>
     is given to the commissioners appointed by 
     <lb/>
     the Territorial goveriinlent and will be with<lb break="no"/>in the jurisdictiOn of the new provinces un<lb break="no"/>der the Bills creating them, subject to the 
     <lb/>
     religious instruction provided for under 
     <lb/>
     clause 137, and this should commend itself 
     <lb/>
     to all loyal and God-fearing people. As I 
     <lb/>
     have said, this part of the question has 
     <lb/>
     been referred to frequently and at length, 
     <lb/>
     and I shall not continue the discussion. 
     <lb/>
     In the first public school I attended 
     <lb/>
     in-my native town there were two teachers 
     <lb/>
     a Protestant and a Catholic. One or the 
     <lb/>
     other opened the daily exercises with the 
     <lb/>
     Lord's prayer. And this was acceptable 
     <lb/>
     to every one. Since then some of my warm<lb break="no"/>est friends professional, socially and politic<lb break="no"/>

     ally have been people of diflferent faith to my 
     <lb/>
     own. I believe the educational clauses as 
     <lb/>
     amended are generally acceptable to them 
     <lb/>
     and if adhered to, as we are told by members 
     <lb/>
     of the government they will be, they cannot 
     <lb/>
     but be satisfactory to people of my own 
     <lb/>
     faith. On the other hand, many contend 
     <lb/>
     that they do not go far enough. There are 
     <lb/>
     certain members of the church in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec and members of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment who are dissatisfied with the 
     <lb/>
     amended clauses of the Bill. The follow<lb break="no"/>ing article giving an account of a sermon 
     <lb/>
     by the bishop of Three Rivers shows that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is dissatisfied : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Monseigneur Clouthier, bishop of Three 
     <lb/>
     Rivers, in a sermon preached last week in the 
     <lb/>
     cathedral of that city, referred to the school 
     <lb/>
     clauses of the Autonomy Bills as follows : The 
     <lb/>
     original Bill was far from assuring to Catholic 
     <lb/>
     children that Christian teaching to which they 
     <lb/>
     are entitled. The amended Bill now before the 
     <lb/>
     House gives, it is true, separate schools, but 
     <lb/>
     teaching submitted to the will of the state will 
     <lb/>
     be almost neutral in practice. The teaching, as 
     <lb/>
     a matter of fact, will only be given in English, 
     <lb/>
     and the half-hour of catechism after school is 
     <lb/>
     only a decoy and can in no way satisfy the pro<lb break="no"/>per formation of Catholic children. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The confederation pact centainly assures us 
     <lb/>
     more than that, or Catholics would never have 
     <lb/>
     consented to form a part of it. We may ask 
     <lb/>
     what will become of the confederation should 
     <lb/>
     such a measure become law. The amended Bill, 
     <lb/>
     which hands over to the new provinces the ab<lb break="no"/>solute control of their schools, is not accept<lb break="no"/>able to Catholics. We must have federal legis<lb break="no"/>lation that will guarantee to the minority the 
     <lb/>
     right to have schools of their choosing, both as 
     <lb/>
     regards religion and language. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The object which a certain number of people 
     <lb/>
     have in view, of establishing so-called national 
     <lb/>
     schools, tends to stamp with the same imprint 
     <lb/>
     every citizen of this country. Now, this fusion 
     <lb/>
     of races, as far as the French Canadians are 
     <lb/>
     concerned, is a dream, a utopia, for it would 
     <lb/>
     mean the renouncing of their providential mis<lb break="no"/>sion, and we have every reason to hope that 
     <lb/>
     they will be faithful to that mission. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our duty for the moment is to live alongside 
     <lb/>
     our English fellow citizens, respecting their 
     <lb/>
     rights, but forcing them, as the occasion may 
     <lb/>
     require, to respect ours. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is, therefore, the imperious duty of all 
     <lb/>
     Catholics to work courageously to obtain con<lb break="no"/>fessional schools for the two new provinces and 
     <lb/>
     not to let up till we have obtained full and 
     <lb/>
     ample justice.

     This gentleman and others to whom the

     First Minister and the members of his gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Had they adopted a different

     <lb/>
     what can be expected ? In connection with 
     <lb/>
     this sermon, I would like to say that his Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency Earl Grey is reported to have said, 
     <lb/>
     in the course of a speech delivered during 
     <lb/>
     his recent visit to Toronto, that in the 
     <lb/>
     union of our two great races lies the secret 
     <lb/>
     and strength of our future. But as I read 
 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5293</fw>
     <fw type="num">5294</fw>
       

     the words or the reverend gentleman from 
     <lb/>
     Three Rivers, I am forced to hope that there 
     <lb/>
     are other secrets and other sources of 
     <lb/>
     strength available, otherwise our future, 
     <lb/>
     this dream, this utopia about which the 
     <lb/>
     reverend gentleman seems not over san<lb break="no"/>guine, may be indefinitely postponed. And 
     <lb/>
     who is responsible for this postponement? 
     <lb/>
     I do not venture to suggest that the rever<lb break="no"/>end gentleman is responsible. I do not 
     <lb/>
     venture to suggest that the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the government is responsible. 
     <lb/>
     I would rather on the floor of this House 
     <lb/>
     assume the responsibility for our fathers who 
     <lb/>
     instead of making for union at the be<lb break="no"/>ginning in their wisdom, made provision for 
     <lb/>
     separation, not only on race lines, but for 
     <lb/>
     separation between people of the same race 
     <lb/>
     and with each succeeding government for 
     <lb/>
     political reason, aye, and through honesty 
     <lb/>
     of purpose, there has been a tendency to 
     <lb/>
     accentuate rather than minimize this mis<lb break="no"/>taken wisdom of our fathers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Even the views of the Liberal organs 
     <lb/>
     have changed within the last few years. I 
     <lb/>
     will read from the Montreal 'Herald' of 
     <lb/>
     May, 1896, which after discussing the tariff, 
     <lb/>
     goes on to say : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Can Montreal attord to have Canada rent and 
     <lb/>
     torn for the next decade—perhaps for the next 
     <lb/>
     generation—with racial wars, with sectional 
     <lb/>
     enmities, with religious conflicts ? This is the 
     <lb/>
     question which every voter in Montreal who 
     <lb/>
     has a real stake in the country should seriously 
     <lb/>
     ask himself. A triumph for Sir Charles Tupper 
     <lb/>
     means such lamentable divisions. It means an 
     <lb/>
     attempt to pass at Ottawa, in July, a Remedial 
     <lb/>
     Bill, against which will be arrayed a strong 
     <lb/>
     contingent of members from every other pro<lb break="no"/>vince. If by the use of means now threatened, 
     <lb/>
     which will be repugnant to the enlightened 
     <lb/>
     sentiment of Canada, the support of Quebec to 
     <lb/>
     such a measure is solidified, the hostillity to it 
     <lb/>
     of the other provinces will be all the more in<lb break="no"/>tensified and we shall have in parliament a 
     <lb/>
     lamentable division, in the main between Que<lb break="no"/>bec and the other provinces. The measure may 
     <lb/>
     not pass, in which case the agitation in its 
     <lb/>
     favour will be continued. Nor will the question 
     <lb/>
     he removed from parliament it it should pass, 
     <lb/>
     as so many people affect to believe. That would 
     <lb/>
     mean the opening of the second stage of the 
     <lb/>
     struggle, the preaching of a Protestant crusade 
     <lb/>
     through the length and breadth of Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     appeals to prejudice and passions, which if 
     <lb/>
     aroused will run their course untempered by 
     <lb/>
     cooler considerations; and the inevitable po<lb break="no"/>litical cleavage of our people not into Liberal 
     <lb/>
     and Conservatives, but into Protestant and 
     <lb/>
     Catholic camps. The possibilities of such a 
     <lb/>
     crusade are of the gravest ; they may involve 
     <lb/>
     (we speak in all seriousness) the breaking up 
     <lb/>
     of confederation and the shedding of blood.

            <p>To be candid Mr. Speaker, and I wish to be 
     <lb/>candid, I regret that separate schools exist 
     <lb/>in Canada to-day, I regret that they exist in 
     <lb/>the province of Quebec, and for this reason ; 
     <lb/>that Protestant and Catholic boys meet for 
     <lb/>the first time in the struggle of life only 
     <lb/>after their education has been completed, 
     <lb/>and after having been kept apart during the 
     <lb/>best years of their life. I regret it also for 
     <lb/>the reason that I do not think that two 
     <lb/>languages are too much for any child to ac<lb break="no"/>quire, especially if those languages are the 
     <lb/>tongues of our two national mothers. Eng<lb break="no"/>land and La Bule France. In almost every 
     <lb/>  county of Quebec there are teachers With a 
     <lb/>salary ranging from $60 to $120 a year, 
     <lb/>teaching a school year of 10 months. What 
     <lb/>qualifications can you expect in a teacher 
     <lb/>receiving such a miserable pittance as that ? 
     <lb/>I noticed an article in a Township paper 
     <lb/>some time ago describing a very happy 
     <lb/>state of affairs that is to come into force in 
     <lb/>parts of the counties of Drummond and 
     <lb/>Athabasca, and this will be of interest to 
     <lb/>the First Minister, as that was his old 
     <lb/>constituency before he found the air of 
     <lb/>Quebec more bracing and salubrious. Here 
     <lb/>Catholics and Protestants, unable to support, 
     <lb/>two systems of schools. are united in a com<lb break="no"/>mon school. I have extracts from two pa<lb break="no"/>pers in the eastern townships giving a des<lb break="no"/>cription of the meetings which were held 
     <lb/>at Kingsey village in one of those counties 
     <lb/>on that subject. At one, Mr. Parmelee, sec<lb break="no"/>retary of the Protestant committee: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Gave a most interesting account of the work<lb break="no"/>ing of consolidated schools in Massachusetts 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     and pointed out the notable fact that although 
     <lb/>
     in nearly ever case provision had been made 
     <lb/>
     for reversal to the old way, it the new way 
     <lb/>
     proved impracticable, there had not been a 
     <lb/>
     single case of going back. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     This, Mr. Speaker, I think is a consum<lb break="no"/>mation devoutly to be wished, a school sys<lb break="no"/>tem under which all creeds and races would 
     <lb/>
     grow up together, forgetting the prejudices 
     <lb/>
     which have kept their fathers apart, if not 
     <lb/>
     at enmity with one another, and which 
     <lb/>
     would enable them to meet on a common 
     <lb/>
     ground of union and Canadian citizenship. 
     <lb/>
     My reason for objecting to separate schools 
     <lb/>
     lies in the fact that the differences do not 
     <lb/>
     stop at separate schools, but that the lines 
     <lb/>
     drawn by these divisions extend to all walks 
     <lb/>
     of business and social life and strike at the 
     <lb/>
     root of that great national spirit which it 
     <lb/>
     should be the true aim of every loyal Cana<lb break="no"/>dian to foster and maintain. It means the 
     <lb/>
     perpetuation of national societies and bene<lb break="no"/>volent organizations on religious lines; it 
     <lb/>
     means fête days, street parades of one sect<lb break="no"/>ion or society equally objectionable to the 
     <lb/>
     susceptible imagination of one party as the 
     <lb/>
     other. National schools do not mean Pro<lb break="no"/>testant schools and should, in my opinion, 
     <lb/>
     be conducted by the laity. Therefore I 

<cb/>
     <fw type="num">5295</fw>
     <fw type="num">5296</fw>
         

     say in the working out of the des<lb break="no"/>tiny of this great country, of this nation, 
     <lb/>
     and I believe I have the highest authority 
     <lb/>
     in this House when I speak of Canada as a 
     <lb/>
     nation. For the Prime Minister has des<lb break="no"/>cribed how when in the mother land, some 
     <lb/>
     years ago he was presented one bright morn<lb break="no"/>ing with a babe in swaddling clothes, which 
     <lb/>
     proved to be young Canada destined to 
     <lb/>
     be known henceforth among the peoples 
     <lb/>
     of the world as a nation, whereas the happy 
     <lb/>
     parent. on the evening preceding this mom<lb break="no"/>entous event, in utter ignorance of his 
     <lb/>
     condition, (immaculate, I trust) had 'drawn 
     <lb/>
     the drapery of his couch about him 
     <lb/>
     and lain down to pleasant dreams.' There<lb break="no"/>fore, I say, in working out the destiny of 
     <lb/>
     this young nation we should endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     forget our different origins. I know it is 
     <lb/>
     hard to forget one's origin, but I believe 
     <lb/>
     that in so far as it is possible these ties and 
     <lb/>
     traditions should be forgotten and relegated 
     <lb/>
     to oblivion. We should endeavour to forget 
     <lb/>
     the distinctions which have divided us in 
     <lb/>
     the past, and should strive to be known only 
     <lb/>
     as Canadians. For my part I would be 
     <lb/>
     sorry to see the 17th of March go by With<lb break="no"/>out wearing a sprig of shamrock in honour 
     <lb/>
     of the patron saint of Emerald Isle, but be<lb break="no"/>yond these annual tokens of respect, we 
     <lb/>
     should endeavour to forget our different ori<lb break="no"/>gins. The Minister of Finance, with won<lb break="no"/>derful descriptive power. has painted the 
     <lb/>
     picture of a visit he made to a school in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia conducted by a reverend sister 
     <lb/>
     of some holy order, on whose bosom there 
     <lb/>
     hung a crucifix. In the course of his speech 
     <lb/>
     he said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The Prime Minister once when in Halifax 
     <lb/>
     visited one of these schools and he alluded 
     <lb/>
     to it as a separate school, and one of the 
     <lb/>
     sisters interrupted him and said: No, Sir, it 
     <lb/>
     is a public. school of the province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. And so it was, but it was a school 
     <lb/>
     which was recognized as a Roman Catholic

     Evidently the Minister of Finance thinks

     the Roman Catholic minority of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince has no rights, evidently he was much 
     <lb/>
     struck with what happened on that visist.

     where Protestant girls attend Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic convents and where Roman Catholic boys

 <p>
     As the hon. gentleman has seen fit to give 
     <lb/>
     us this description of his visit to this Catholic 
     <lb/>
     school, I will endeavour to go him one better, 
     <lb/>
     and to say that in far-off Africa I have seen 
     <lb/>
     a reverend father of the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     Church and a chaplain of the English Church 
     <lb/>
     standing side by side by the grave of a 
     <lb/>
     Canadian who had laid down his life for the 
     <lb/>
     empire, one or other of the reverend gentle<lb break="no"/>men conducting the service, while the other 
     <lb/>
     stood with bared head in silent prayer. Here 
     <lb/>
     was the union of hearts diametrically op<lb break="no"/>posed on the question of creed and dogma 
     <lb/>
     uniting in the sacred ceremony of wafting 
     <lb/>
     to its heaven of rest in the arms of the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the universe the soul of a de<lb break="no"/>parted brother— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I may say, en passant, that I have frequ<lb break="no"/>ently remarked to a friend of mine, that if 
     <lb/>
     at any time I should need the services of a 
     <lb/>
     clergyman, and if my own chaplain were 
     <lb/>
     not available, I should be very glad if this 
     <lb/>
     reverend padre. whom we had all grown to 
     <lb/>
     love and respect. would come to me. These, 
     <lb/>
     I may tell you. hon. gentlemen, are scenes 
     <lb/>
     which bring men together, which make us 
     <lb/>
     feel that we should see more of one another 
     <lb/>
     and mingle more together, English and 
     <lb/>
     French, Catholic and Protestant, particular<lb break="no"/>ly in boyhood's earliest days, and not wait 
     <lb/>
     until our education has been completed be<lb break="no"/>fore mingling in the strife of life. Experi<lb break="no"/>ences of this kind would also dispel the idea 
     <lb/>
     from the minds of honest men that in the 
     <lb/>
     formation of a government the personnel 
     <lb/>
     thereof need be all Protestant because some 
     <lb/>
     of its members are in favour of provinciail 
     <lb/>
     rights or opposed to separate schools. One 
     <lb/>
     of the epochs in the life of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for North Wellington (Mr. T. Martin) seems 
     <lb/>
     also to have been in connection with a visit 
     <lb/>
     to a Romana Catholic establishment. This 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman, after treading the heather 
     <lb/>
     of his native heath for some hours and 
     <lb/>
     quoting the biography or autobiography—I 
     <lb/>
     do not know which—of one Dr. Robertson, 
     <lb/>
     goes on to tell how he got over the priest's 
     <lb/>
     fence in his town. I think that the good— 
     <lb/>
     will which this hon. gentleman bears to the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic Church rests on the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the reverend gentleman did not catch 
     <lb/>
     him on this occasion, and if the facts were 
     <lb/>
     known we would find that the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man probably got under the fence and that 
     <lb/>
     it was the garden or orchard fence. This 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman has been pleased to accuse 
     <lb/>
     the opposition of bigotry and prejudice. 
     <lb/>
     Personally, I deny the allegation, and I ven<lb break="no"/>ture to say that if he reads ' Hansard ' since 
     <lb/>
     the commencement of this debate, he will 
     <lb/>
     find that over ninety-five per cent of what 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. First Minister was pleased 
     <lb/>
     to describe as the exaggeration of that noble 
     <lb/>
     sentiment as passion, has emanated from the

     government benches.

     his appreciation of his leader's sentiments

     <lb/>
     of wisdom emanate from the opposition 
     <lb/>
     benches or a pearl of thought fall from the 
     <lb/>
     scrap book of the opposition leader ? How<lb break="no"/>ever, with my hon. friend from Huntingdon 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Walsh), I thank the paper for the time<lb break="no"/>ly warning, and, for myself, I promise to 
     <lb/>
     be more careful in future. Its advice I re<lb break="no"/>gret being unable to follow, as, constitution<lb break="no"/>ally, I firmly believe that this country will 
     <lb/>
     pronounce my hon. friend the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition to be right, and I believe that 
     <lb/>
     this country is of the opinion that should 
     <lb/>
     his amendment carry the minority of the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces would receive equally as 
     <lb/>
     great. if not greater, consideration than it 
     <lb/>
     would at the hands of the right hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the government. I believe that this coun<lb break="no"/>try will pronounce my hon. friend the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition to be constitutionally right 
     <lb/>
     when we read that such an eminent man as 
     <lb/>
     Christopher Robinson, K.C., has expressed 
     <lb/>
     an opinion adverse to the legal and constitu<lb break="no"/>tional basis of this separate school legisla<lb break="no"/>tion, and that Dr. Goldwin Smith attacks it 
     <lb/>
     on its political side. Dr. Goldwin Smith, so 
     <lb/>
     a Toronto paper says, writes to his friend 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) 
     <lb/>

     Some of our French Canadian friends on

     eloquent, poetic and tragic language, of the

     advance of education and civilization in the

     Northwest, and of how the French mission<lb break="no"/>aries were the pioneers of religion and civili<lb break="no"/>zation. What they say of their countrymen 
     <lb/>
     I firmly believe is true. We all know that 
     <lb/>
     they were the pioneers of civilization and 
     <lb/>
     Christianity in the great west. We have,

     with these gentlemen, followed the advance 
     <lb/>
     of civilization up the mighty rivers, across 
     <lb/>
     the great lakes and boundless prairies, not 
     <lb/>
     only to the foot of the gigantic Rockies, but 
     <lb/>
     to the very summits thereof. What these 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen say of these missionaries is 
     <lb/>
     no doubt true, and let us hope, Mr. Speaker,

     thoroughly discussed with the representat<lb break="no"/>ives of British North America. At this

     He would now endeavour to speak somewhat

     perhaps the most important—that could be

     confided to the legislature—the question of 
     <lb/>
     education. This was a question in which in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada they must all feel the greatest 
     <lb/>
     interest, and in respect to which more appre<lb break="no"/>hension might be supposed to exist in the minds 
     <lb/>
     at any rate of the Protestant population than 
     <lb/>
     in regard to anything else connected with the 
     <lb/>
     whole scheme of federation. It must be clear 
     <lb/>
     that a measure would not be favourably en<lb break="no"/>tertained by the minority of Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     which would place the education of their child<lb break="no"/>ren and the provision for their schools wholly 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of a majority of a different faith. 
     <lb/>
     It was clear that in confiding the general-sub<lb break="no"/>ject of education to the local legislature it 
     <lb/>
     was absolutely necessary it should be accom<lb break="no"/>panied with such restrictions as would prevent 
     <lb/>
     injustice in any respect from being done to the

     equal force to Upper Canada and the other <choice><sic>pro<lb break="no"/>inces</sic><corr>provinces</corr></choice>; for in Lower Canada there was a Pro<lb break="no"/>testant minority and in the other provinces a

     Roman Catholic minority. The same privileges

     belonged to the one of right here as belonged 
     <lb/>
     to the other of right elsewhere. There could 
     <lb/>
     be no greater injustice to a population than

     Does the hon. member for Lunenburg re<lb break="no"/>member that when the Prime Minister first 
     <lb/>
     introduced this Bill with so much gusto, he 
     <lb/>
     declared he would stand or fall by the mea<lb break="no"/>sure, and does he not see that the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister has since then experienced a com<lb break="no"/>plete change of front. What was the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of the party at the back of the premier 
     <lb/>
     after he introduced that Bill? Was there 
     <lb/>
     discipline and unity in the party ? Is it 
     <lb/>
     not a fact that the first man to fall out 
     <lb/>
     of line was the ex-Minister of Interior (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton). So serious was the matter that he 
     <lb/>
     resigned his portfolio. Then, what about 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding)? 
     <lb/>
     Was he not following immediately in the 
     <lb/>
     footsteps of the ex-Minister of the Interior ? 
     <lb/>
     Is it not a fact that for several days he 
     <lb/>
     was, as it were, walking the plank, or in<lb break="no"/>tending to follow the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior? Then, what about the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa)? Does it 
     <lb/>
     not appear from the remarks he is making 
     <lb/>
     in different parts of the country at the 
     <lb/>
     present time that that hon. member does 
     <lb/>
     not agree with the Prime Minister ? If the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister had given the members on 
     <lb/>
     his side of the House the same latitude 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. leader of the opposition gave 
     <lb/>
     to members on this side, and allowed every 
     <lb/>
     man to vote and act as his conscience 
     <lb/>
     dictated, this Bill would not go through 
     <lb/>
     the House in the form that I suppose 
     <lb/>
     it is now going. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Lunenburg also referred to the position 
     <lb/>
     of the Montreal 'Star' and the Montreal 
     <lb/>
     ' Gazette,' and said that we should get them 
     <lb/>
     into line. He referred to Conservative 
     <lb/>
     newspapers as not being in accord with the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the Conservative party on this 
     <lb/>
     question. At the same time, I thought he 
     <lb/>
     would have been kind enough to have re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the Toronto ' Globe,' and explain<lb break="no"/>ed to us why it was not in unity with the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party. I mention these facts to 
     <lb/>
     show that the Liberal party are not at all 
     <lb/>
     in unity on this Bill. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     also stated that the Conservative party were 
     <lb/>
     without a leader or a policy. I have been 
     <lb/>
     in this House since the year 1891, and have 
     <lb/>
     sat here with several leaders of the differ<lb break="no"/>ent parties since that time, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe that we have ever had a leader of 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party with greater ability 
     <lb/>
     or more respected throughout this country 
     <lb/>
     than the present leader of the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party. I believe that the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party under the leadership of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Carleton would have been in 
     <lb/>
     power to-day had it not been for the way 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal party stuffed the lists in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, the Northwest and other provinces, 
     <lb/>
     stuffed the ballot boxes, used bogus ballot 
     <lb/>
     boxes, used a large amount of money 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     Pacific, and promised or pledged contracts 
     <lb/>
     under the Grand Trunk Pacific previous to 
     <lb/>
     the last general election. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber also said that the hon. leader of the

     <lb/>
     hon. member for Cape Breton,, because he 
     <lb/>
     usually asks a question merely to show his 
     <lb/>
     ignorance. through not having heard or read 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOHN2">Mr. ALEX. JOHNSTON</persName>. Mr. Speaker. 
     <lb/>
     if my hon. friend will permit me for a mo<lb break="no"/>ment, I can assure him that I am just as 
     <lb/>
     anxious as he or any other member of this 
     <lb/>
     House is to ascertain exactly where the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition stands on this 
     <lb/>
     question. He has not informed us him<lb break="no"/>self, and I am quite sure that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Grenville, before he sits down, 
     <lb/>
     will tell us. I expect him to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REID2">Mr. J. D. REID</persName>. If the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Cape Breton will kindly read the speech 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. leader of the opposition, I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that he has equal intelligence to 
     <lb/>
     the rest of the members of this House, and 
     <lb/>
     he will Lnoroughly understand his opinion 
     <lb/>
     on the question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOHN2">Mr. ALEX. JOHNSTON</persName>. I have read it.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REID2">Mr. J. D. REID</persName>. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Lunenburg referred to the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey (Mr. Sproule), and did it in such 
     <lb/>
     a way as to cast slights on the Orangemen 
     <lb/>
     of this Dominion. I am not an Orange<lb break="no"/>man, but I think it ill-becomes any hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman of this House to cast a slur upon 
     <lb/>
     or to speak lightly of that body. They are 
     <lb/>
     an honourable body, a body who I believe 
     <lb/>
     wish to do what is right. fair and just to 
     <lb/>
     every party and every religion in this coun<lb break="no"/>try. The hon. gentleman referred to the 
     <lb/>
     Jacques Cartier Club in Montreal speaking 
     <lb/>
     in one way and to the Orangemen in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario speaking in the other 
     <lb/>
     way, saying that this was done for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of stirring up political strife. What 
     <lb/>
     about the Liberal members of this House 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec and the Liber<lb break="no"/>al members in the province of Ontario? 
     <lb/>
     You see members in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario going to their different consti<lb break="no"/>tuents and making speeches entirely op<lb break="no"/>posite to those made by other members 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec; they are 
     <lb/>
     doing that for the purpose of creating 
     <lb/>
     strife or truoble. I believe that every hon. 
     <lb/>
     member in this House will agree with me 
     <lb/>
     when I say that the hon. leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition made his speech with the greatest 
     <lb/>
     care not to cause any religious strife 
     <lb/>
     throughout this Dominion. I believe he 
     <lb/>
    wished to do what was fair, and the fact 
     <lb/>that in winding up his speech he left every

     member of the opposition free to act on 
     <lb/>
     this measure as he conscientiously believed 
     <lb/>
     to be right, showed that he was acting 
     <lb/>
     fairly. I thought the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment should also have left the members on 
     <lb/>
     his side-free to do what they thought right 
     <lb/>
     in the matter. If he had done so, I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that there would not have been any 
     <lb/>
     strife in this country on this question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So far as I am personally concerned, I 
     <lb/>
     agree that the time has arrived when au<lb break="no"/>tonomy should be granted to the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. I believe that the population of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories has reached such 
     <lb/>
     numbers that they are entitled to provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy. I also believe it, for the reason 
     <lb/>
     that they have practically had provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy for a great many years. I also 
     <lb/>
     believe that there should be two provincial 
     <lb/>
     parliaments, as the country seems to me to 
     <lb/>
     be too large for only one parliament. There<lb break="no"/>fore, in so far as that is concerned, I am 
     <lb/>
     fully in accord with the granting of provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy to the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     But in doing so, I consider that we should 
     <lb/>
     be entirely governed by the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act and do nothing inconsistent 
     <lb/>
     with it. The other provinces were formed in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with that Act, and I have 
     <lb/>
     yet to hear where there has been any trouble 
     <lb/>
     in any of them, namely, Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Que<lb break="no"/>bec or Ontario, or even I might add <choice><sic>Man<lb break="no"/>toba</sic><corr>Manitoba</corr></choice>, in so far as the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act is concerned. Even in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, where there was supposed to be 
     <lb/>
     a great deal of trouble, they have been get<lb break="no"/>ting along nicely and quietly, and the maj<lb break="no"/>ority there have been treating the minority 
     <lb/>
     fair and right, at least as far as I can judge 
     <lb/>
     from reading the newspapers, according to
     <lb/>
     the newspapers there has been very little 
     <lb/>
     trouble in that province since the advent of 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party into power in its 
     <lb/>
     legislature. In my opinion, the amendment 
     <lb/>
     moved by my hon. friend the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     oposition is in accordance with the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act and is consequently fair 
     <lb/>
     and just. I believe further that if this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment persists in attaching the educa<lb break="no"/>tional clauses to these Bills, that will have 
     <lb/>
     the effect of retarding immigration. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that people intending to come and 
     <lb/>
     settle in this country, when they see this 
     <lb/>
     agitation raised and this quarrel going on 
     <lb/>
     probably in the provincial government of 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces, many of them. both Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic and Protestant, who may feel strongly 
     <lb/>
     on this question, will not emigrate to this 
     <lb/>
     country. Therefore, I think that if the 
     <lb/>
     schools were left entirely in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government, there will not be 
     <lb/>
     any strife or trouble, but these governments 
     <lb/>
     will meet the wants of the people as these 
     <lb/>
     wants manifest themselves from time to 
     <lb/>
     time. In my opinion, these educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses are tacked on to these Bills on ac<lb break="no"/>count of a pledge made by the First Minis<lb break="no"/>ter in the year 1896 In that year when all 
  

            <pb n="5305" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5305.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5305</fw> <fw type="dateline">MAY 2, 1905</fw> 
       

     the strife and trouble was created by the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman over the Remedial Bill 
     <lb/>
     in order to defeat the Conservative party, I 
     <lb/>
     believe he then made a secret pledge that if 
     <lb/>
     he should be returned to power he would 
     <lb/>
     :see that certain rights were granted to the 
     <lb/>
     minority. That pledge he was not able to 
     <lb/>
     carry out, and I believe that it is in per<lb break="no"/>suance of that pledge that these educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses are added to these Bills. I have yet 
     <lb/>
     to see any great agitation in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories in favour of these school clauses. 
     <lb/>
     In reading over the speech of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brockville (Mr. Derbyshire) I see 
     <lb/>
     that he stated that these school clauses 
     <lb/>
     have been endorsed by public opinion in 
     <lb/>
     the west, and he cited the reception given 
     <lb/>
     to the newly appointed Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior by the most important constituency 
     <lb/>
     between Winnipeg and the Rocky Mountains 
     <lb/>
     as a most significant evidence of that feel<lb break="no"/>ing. I was just looking over the Calgary 
     <lb/>
     papers in order to see what kind of a re<lb break="no"/>ception was given the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior at the banquet in Calgary. I have 
     <lb/>
     read the address which was presented him 
     <lb/>
     by Mayor Emmerson. I shall not weary 
     <lb/>
     the House by reading it at this late hour, 
     <lb/>
     but I do not find one word in it referring 
     <lb/>
     to the school question. But if the people of 
     <lb/>
     that constituency are satisfied with the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of the school question out there, why did 
     <lb/>
     they not refer to it ?

     and the Hon. Mr. Greenway, a member of

     used. I did not say that all the electors of

     <lb/>
     I read a statement from the papers showing

     <persName ref="pers:REID2">Mr. J. D. REID</persName>. No, ' Hansard ' will

     show what I stated. Now, I feel that, for 
     <lb/>
     this country at least, church and state 
     <lb/>
     should be kept entirely separated. I do 
     <lb/>
     not believe it is right that the church and 
     <lb/>
     the state should have any connection what<lb break="no"/>ever with each other. The country should 
     <lb/>
     be run entirely independent of the church, 
     <lb/>
     and the church should be allowed to man<lb break="no"/>age its own affairs. And in thus speaking 
     <lb/>
     I do not refer to any particular church. As 
     <lb/>
     far as my constituency is concerned, we 
     <lb/>
     had no trouble with the separate school 
     <lb/>
     question. Mine is an Ontario constituency, 
     <lb/>
     and in the province of Ontario the school 
     <lb/>
     question has been settled since confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and we have had no trouble. Con<lb break="no"/>cessions have been made in the Separate 
     <lb/>
     School Act by the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     from time to time, though the government 
     <lb/>
     always has a majority of Protestants. I 
     <lb/>
     believe they have always done what is 
     <lb/>
     fair to the minority, and I believe that in 
     <lb/>
     the great province of Ontario, where the 
     <lb/>
     majority is Protestant, they will al<lb break="no"/>ways do what is fair and right to the min<lb break="no"/>ority. And I have the same faith in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories and the new govern<lb break="no"/>ments to be established. Even if there is a 
     <lb/>
     Protestant majority, they will do what is 
     <lb/>
     fair and right to the minority. Should there 
     <lb/>
     be a Roman Catholic majority in the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces, I should have the same faith in 
     <lb/>
     their willingness to do justice to the minor<lb break="no"/>ity. I believe that if the matter is left 
     <lb/>
     entirely in the hands of provincial authority 
     <lb/>
     the minority can trust them without fear.

     <persName ref="pers:HUGH1">Mr. J. J. HUGHES</persName>. Is not the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Manitoba or some of its members, 
     <lb/>
     at the present moment making statements

     to the effect that the privileges now en<lb break="no"/>joyed by the minority may be withdrawn.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REID2">Mr. J. D. REID</persName>. I have not seen that 
     <lb/>
     statement published as having been made
     <lb/>
     by any member of the Manitoba govern<lb break="no"/>ment, though I have read in the newspapers 
     <lb/>
     that such a thing might be done. This, how<lb break="no"/>ever, may be mere newspaper agitation. 
     <lb/>
     On the other hand, I believe the present 
     <lb/>
     government of Manitoba have been doing 
     <lb/>
     their best to make things satisfactory for 
     <lb/>
     the minority. And I believe that from time 
     <lb/>
     to time they will help the minority if they 
     <lb/>
     find it necessary. And I also believe that 
     <lb/>
     so far as any provincial government through<lb break="no"/>out the Dominion is concerned, be it Pro<lb break="no"/>testant or Catholic, the same thing is true. 
     <lb/>
     So believing, and also believing that this 
     <lb/>
     measure will be injurious to immigration 
     <lb/>
     and that will still create an agitation that

     would not be in the best interest of the 
     <lb/>
     country, and believing that we should stand 
     <lb/>
     by the British North America Act as it is, 
     <lb/>
    I shall vote for the amendment of the lead<lb break="no"/>er of the opposition and shall hope and trust 
     <lb/>that it will be carried and that we may 
     <lb/>have peace and prosperity from this time 
     <lb/>forth.

     <persName ref="pers:WILM2">Mr. R. D. WILMOT</persName> (Sunbury and Queens, 
     <lb/>
     N.B). Mr. Speaker, though an old member 
     <lb/>
     of this House, both in years and in service 
     <lb/>
     here I have never accustomed myself to ad<lb break="no"/>dressing the House. Therefore, I claim from 
     <lb/>
     my confreres here an unusual degree of le<lb break="no"/>niency and kindness. I ask them to overlook 
     <lb/>
     any mistakes I may make, assuring them 
     <lb/>
     that those mistakes will be of the head not 
     <lb/>
     of the heart. Before I go further, I appeal to 
     <lb/>
     hon. members for consideration especially 
     <lb/>
     upon one point. I would ask an avoidance 
     <lb/>
     of interruptions such as we have just heard. 
     <lb/>
     If any statements I make are such as hon. 
     <lb/>
     members cannot agree with, they will have 
     <lb/>
     their opportunity to reply. I would ask, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that I be spared interruption of 
     <lb/>
     the few remarks I am to make and I know 
     <lb/>
     that my friends on both sides will treat 
     <lb/>
     me in accordance with my desire. Even in 
     <lb/>
     so important a question as the one now be<lb break="no"/>fore us, were I left to my own choice, I 
     <lb/>would not speak. But I feel that I have 
     <lb/>behind me a constituency that should be 
     <lb/>heard on the floor of this House on this 
     <lb/>momentous question. But, it against my 
     <lb/>own will, I occupy the time of the House, 
     <lb/>I can assure hon. members that it will not 
     <lb/>be for long. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The question before us has been discussed 
     <lb/>
     threadbare. A man would need to be heaven- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     born, or at least heaven-inspired, to find 
     <lb/>
     anything new to say upon this subject. 
     <lb/>
     Everything that can be thought of by the 
     <lb/>
     human mind has been thought of already, 
     <lb/>
     and everything that can be said has been 
     <lb/>
     said. I shall not even attempt anything 
     <lb/>
     of an original nature. Among the draw<lb break="no"/>backs to parliamentary life is the fact that 
     <lb/>
     we are called upon to hear again and again 
     <lb/>
     the same things said until they grow weari<lb break="no"/>some and make one look back to private 
     <lb/>
     life with longing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I said that I am here to speak, not in my 
     <lb/>
     individual capacity. but as representing the 
     <lb/>
     sentiments of the people in my constituency. 
     <lb/>
     The whole Dominion of Canada, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     is in favour of the establishment of the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces in the Northwest. I think there 
     <lb/>
     is no difference of opinion on that matter. 
     <lb/>
     But I think the government should have 
     <lb/>
     taken the people into their confidence before 
     <lb/>
     taking a step of such grave import. Had they 
     <lb/>
     done so we would not have seen so much 
     <lb/>
     difference as has been in evidence on the 
     <lb/>
     part of our hon. friends of the Liberal party. 
     <lb/>
     The premier, when he brought in this mea<lb break="no"/>sure, said that he would stand or fall by 
     <lb/>
     it. Well, we all know that he took four or 
     <lb/>
     five weeks to amend his measure, owing to 
  

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5309</fw>
     <fw type="num">5310</fw>
          

     the difference of opinion that existed in the 
     <lb/>
     ranks of his own party. I think that time 
     <lb/>
     was not lost. I think every moment of those 
     <lb/>
     four or five weeks could have been used to 
     <lb/>
     the great profit of the country. I think it 
     <lb/>
     was a great mistake to introduce legislation 
     <lb/>
     so important as this after a general election 
     <lb/>
     in which the subject of such legislation had 
     <lb/>
     scarcely been mentioned. The government 
     <lb/>
     should have given the people an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of expressing their opinion on this legisla<lb break="no"/>tion before it was introduced. But the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment did not see fit to do so, and conse<lb break="no"/>quently this legislation has been brought be<lb break="no"/>fore a House elected, in my humble judg<lb break="no"/>ment, without any warrant to deal with the 
     <lb/>
     question. Had the boundaries of the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces been known to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest, I think the result of the election 
     <lb/>
     would have been very different in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. Had the proposed bound<lb break="no"/>aries been known, would Manitoba have 
     <lb/>
     given this government one supporter? Would 
     <lb/>
     the men from the Territories have sent the 
     <lb/>
     same contingent had it been known that the 
     <lb/>
     control of the lands was to be wrested from 
     <lb/>
     their possession ? I pause for a reply. 
     <lb/>
     Would they have been satisfied ? I say 
     <lb/>
     unhesitatingly that defeat would have over<lb break="no"/>taken the government had this Bill been in 
     <lb/>
     question at the last general election. I 
     <lb/>
     think that Manitoba has been treated with 
     <lb/>
     extreme injustice in leaving that province 
     <lb/>
     with an area only one-third that of each of 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces. There must be a mys<lb break="no"/>tery attached to such an apportionment. Can 
     <lb/>
     the government defy or set aside the will 
     <lb/>
     of an entire province ? A new province 
     <lb/>
     bereft of the control of its lands is little 
     <lb/>
     more independent than the Indian reserve. 
     <lb/>
     I think that the local government is in a 
     <lb/>
     better position to deal with the lands of the 
     <lb/>
     province than is the federal government. 
     <lb/>
     They are on the spot, they are more directly 
     <lb/>
     in touch with everything concerning those 
     <lb/>
     lands than is the federal government situ<lb break="no"/>ated at Ottawa. Another objection I have 
     <lb/>
     to federal control of these lands is the 
     <lb/>
     temptation to spoliation offered to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government. I do not refer to this 
     <lb/>
     government any more than to any other 
     <lb/>
     government that might be in power at Otta<lb break="no"/>wa. I think there is less liability to act 
     <lb/>
     unfairly in regard to the disposition of those 
     <lb/>
     lands when they are left to the local author<lb break="no"/>ities than when they are left to the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     authorities. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, in regard to the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion of the educational clauses, I think 
     <lb/>
     this House is to be congratulated upon the 
     <lb/>
     fairness and upon the freedom from dis<lb break="no"/>agreeable language with which the discus<lb break="no"/>sion has been conducted. There has been 
     <lb/>
     little or no acrimony. I have not attended the 
     <lb/>
     House all the time, but I have been here a 
     <lb/>
     good deal, I have heard a great many of the 
     <lb/>
     speeches, but I have heard none of an acri<lb break="no"/>monious nature. It may have occurred 


            <pb n="5311" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5311.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5311</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
       

     without my being present to hear it. I 
     <lb/>
     think it is very much to the credit of this 
     <lb/>
     parliament that such should be the case. 
     <lb/>
     I think that the new provinces should be 
     <lb/>
     free to choose their own educational system. 
     <lb/>
     The Protestant majorities will give, I feel 
     <lb/>
     confident, their Roman Catholic fellow 
     <lb/>
     citizens even-handed justice. No reasonable 
     <lb/>
     argument can be presented by any member 
     <lb/>
     in this House to lead us to believe that such 
     <lb/>
     will not be the case. I come from a prov<lb break="no"/>ince where we have free schools, where the 
     <lb/>
     people, Roman Catholic and Protestant, get 
     <lb/>
     on in perfect harmony. There is no jar. 
     <lb/>
     The Catholic people of that country educate 
     <lb/>
     their children according to their own reli<lb break="no"/>gious beliefs, especially in the large centres 
     <lb/>
     of population. I recollect when what is 
     <lb/>
     called the free non-sectarian school was 
     <lb/>
     first established there was a little friction 
     <lb/>
     but it soon became a lnatter of compromise. 
     <lb/>
     There was a desire on the part of the people 
     <lb/>
     to get on harmoniously with their neighbours 
     <lb/>
     and everything went on as our best citizens 
     <lb/>
     could desire. So. it has continued.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, I will refer in a few 
     <lb/>
     words to my position, and also to my posi<lb break="no"/>tion on the Remedial Bill when it was before 
     <lb/>
     the House. I happened to be a member at 
     <lb/>
     that time, and I voted in favour of the Bill. 
     <lb/>
     I voted in support of the government. I was 
     <lb/>
     nine years younger in age then, and I had 
     <lb/>
     nine years less experience than I have now. 
     <lb/>
     I voted largely from party exigencies. I am 
     <lb/>
     frank in saying so, and I think I will have 
     <lb/>
     many sympathizers amongst my friends who 
     <lb/>
     are supporting this measure on this occasion. 
     <lb/>
     I acknowledge that I made a mistake. I 
     <lb/>
     now, before this House and the country. 
     <lb/>
     disavow my action at that time. And why ? 
     <lb/>
     I found that when I went to my people, 
     <lb/>
     when I went to my Roman Catholic citizens 
     <lb/>
     and supporters, after voting in favour of the 
     <lb/>
     Remedial Bill, in the interest of that church 
     <lb/>
     and in the interest of the minority of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, they would have none of it. I found 
     <lb/>
     that they were frank, honest, open and 
     <lb/>
     above-board. When I went to them I told 
     <lb/>
     them, and they knew as well as I could tell 
     <lb/>
     them, the position that I occupied. They 
     <lb/>
     were frank, open and square, and they told 
     <lb/>
     me they would not vote for me, that they 
     <lb/>
     were supporters of the Liberal party, and 
     <lb/>
     although they did not tell me so, I inferred 
     <lb/>
     that, inasmuch as the Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier was the leader of that party, it 
     <lb/>
     was particularly attractive to them. They 
     <lb/>
     received me in the most hospitable manner 
     <lb/>
     and spoke to me in pleasant terms, but vote 
     <lb/>
     for me they would not. Of course, this is 
     <lb/>
     a personal matter, but it has some bearing 
     <lb/>
     on my action on the Remedial Bill. At the 
     <lb/>
     close of the poll in the election of 1896, in 
     <lb/>
     one of the most populous Irish Catholic dis<lb break="no"/>tricts, it was reported to me by a very in<lb break="no"/>telligent supporter of mine. an active man 
     <lb/>
     engaged in the election, that out of 98 votes 
     <lb/>
     in that section I had received 3. That legis<lb break="no"/>lation was in the interest of the minority in 
  

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5311</fw>
     <fw type="num">5312</fw>
       

     Manitoba, and it would naturally be sup<lb break="no"/>posed that Sir Wilfrid, being a co-religion<lb break="no"/>ist of the minority, would have stood by 
     <lb/>
     them. Did he do so? No. Had he done 
     <lb/>
     so the Conservative party would have re<lb break="no"/>mained in power. Had he done so the Lib<lb break="no"/>eral party would have continued to remain 
     <lb/>
     in opposition, and therefore I was led, as 
     <lb/>
     any reasonable man would have been led, to 
     <lb/>
     the natural conclusion that the course adopt<lb break="no"/>ed by the Liberal party at that time was 
     <lb/>
     adopted for party reasons and party reasons 
     <lb/>
     alone. Because of the manner in which my 
     <lb/>
     Catholic constituents, my fellow-citizens, 
     <lb/>
     treated me, and because of the manner in 
     <lb/>
     which the people of the Dominion of Canada 
     <lb/>
     treated Sir Charles Tupper, I felt absolved 
     <lb/>
     from any obligation to continue my support 
     <lb/>
     to any such legislation. Therefore, I say 
     <lb/>
     now before you, Mr. Speaker. and this 
     <lb/>
     House, that I took the course I did, and that 
     <lb/>
     I regret the vote I gave on that occasion. 
     <lb/>
     Had I voted against the government at that 
     <lb/>
     time it was a moral certainty that I would 
     <lb/>
     have been successful in my appeal to my 
     <lb/>
     constituents. I was defeated only by a com<lb break="no"/>paratively small majority. My Protestant 
     <lb/>
     friends I found were very much dissatisfied 
     <lb/>
     with the course I had taken. However. 
     <lb/>
     that is all past and gone. But my position 
     <lb/>
     I feel in duty bound to clearly define. I 
     <lb/>
     know that my fellow-members will bear 
     <lb/>
    with me, for I do not pretend to be a speak<lb break="no"/>er. I wish a few minutes more, and then 
     <lb/>I will give them relief. I remember, Mr. 
     <lb/>Speaker, it was stated at the time of the 
     <lb/>Manitoba agitation that certain agreements 
     <lb/>had been arrived at and put in shape. At 
     <lb/>that time, as you all know, there was a 
     <lb/>territorial government established to rule 
     <lb/>that country. Certain agreements had been 
     <lb/>entered into regarding schools by a few 
     <lb/>scattered people in that vast country in 
     <lb/>conjunction with the good Christian mission<lb break="no"/>aries of the Catholic Church, and all praise 
     <lb/>and credit should be given to these pioneers 
     <lb/>of religion and morals in that great country. 
     <lb/>Certain agreements were entered into 
     <lb/>with these people at that time, and the ques<lb break="no"/>tion arises whether it is reasonable to sup<lb break="no"/>pose that such agreements should be car<lb break="no"/>ried out for all time. These good people, 
     <lb/>on one part poor ignorant half-breeds, honest 
     <lb/>and good as they were, in conjunction with 
     <lb/>these worthy pioneers of the Catholic Church 
     <lb/>were then the only people living in that 
     <lb/>country, and I ask in all fairness and sin<lb break="no"/>cerity whether it can be considered reason<lb break="no"/>able that the future generations in that 
     <lb/>country which will be populated by mil<lb break="no"/>lions, should be restricted in their social and 
     <lb/>political and educational life by such an 
     <lb/>agreement. Personally I do not think so ; 
     <lb/>I cannot make myself believe any such pro<lb break="no"/>position as that would be reasonable. It 
     <lb/>has been said that this is not a question of 
     <lb/>sectarian against national schools, but that 
     <lb/>it is a constitutional question. Well, the 
     <lb/>good God in Heaven if he heard this dis<lb break="no"/>
        

            <pb n="5313" facs="final/image/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-02_Page_5313.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">5313</fw> <fw type="dateline">MAY 2, 1905</fw> 
        

     cussion, and no doubt he did, would doubt<lb break="no"/>less be able to decide from it what the 
     <lb/>
     constitution is, but I am forced to say that 
     <lb/>
     so far as I am concerned, the more talk I 
     <lb/>
     have heard as to what the constitution 
     <lb/>
     really is the worse I am confounded. I 
     <lb/>
     have had no legal training, and I am not 
     <lb/>
     in a position to form a legal opinion, but 
     <lb/>
     I am able to exercise whatever intelligence 
     <lb/>
     is given to me. My constituents represent a 
     <lb/>
     fair average of the intelligence of this Dom<lb break="no"/>inion, and I do not claim any greater in<lb break="no"/>telligence than the average elector in my 
     <lb/>
     constituency, and if I cannot form an op<lb break="no"/>inion as to what is constitutional and what 
     <lb/>
     is not, then the majority of my constituents 
     <lb/>
     must be in the same predicament. This all 
     <lb/>
     tends to show that there is such division of 
     <lb/>
     opinion on this important question, the 
     <lb/>
     results of which may be likely to cause un<lb break="no"/>rest and friction between different religions 
     <lb/>
     that it would have been far better in the 
     <lb/>
     interests of Canada had the government 
     <lb/>
     before proceeding so hastily, taken the peo<lb break="no"/>ple into their confidence and submitted this 
     <lb/>
     measure to them. We hear that the voice 
     <lb/>
     of the people is the voice of God, and that 
     <lb/>
     being so the government would have made 
     <lb/>
     no mistake had they submitted this measure 
     <lb/>
     to the electorate. I may say frankly, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that had the government consulted 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada, I do not believe the 
     <lb/>
     people would have approved of this meas<lb break="no"/>ure. There is a good old proverb which 
     <lb/>
     says: It is never too late to mend, and I 
     <lb/>
     do not think it is yet too late for the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to take the people into their con<lb break="no"/>fidence. I know that hon. gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     the opposite side of the House would feel 
     <lb/>
     more comfortable individually and collect<lb break="no"/>ively, if they knew that they had the ap<lb break="no"/>proval of their constituents in this matter, 
     <lb/>
     so that the government in the interests of 
     <lb/>
     their own friends should have taken the 
     <lb/>
     course which I now suggest. Just fancy 
     <lb/>
     that great Northwest country, comprising 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of millions of acres, being dispos<lb break="no"/>ed of and divided and re-arranged without 
     <lb/>
     consulting the people. We should transact 
     <lb/>
     the public business as we manage our own 
     <lb/>
     private affairs, but in this case a most im<lb break="no"/>portant Bill has been launched on the coun<lb break="no"/>try without consulting the people directly 
     <lb/>
     interested, and that Bill will no doubt be 
     <lb/>
     passed by a great majority in this House. 
     <lb/>
     Of course it will remain to be seen whe<lb break="no"/>ther in the end it will be approved by the 
     <lb/>
     people. We are told by hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the other side that when the Bill passes 
     <lb/>
     the House, the whole question will be set<lb break="no"/>tled. I am afraid that the government 
     <lb/>
     and its supporters are living in a fool's 
     <lb/>
     paradise if they believe that. It is said, 
     <lb/>
     and I believe correctly said, that the schools 
     <lb/>
     at present existing in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories are second to none in this broad 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. If so, why does not this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment leave the school system alone;

     why do they not let that school system

     <lb/>
     after such a fashion. I cannot understand 
     <lb/>
     why the people of the Northwest were not 
     <lb/>
     consulted by the government on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Why had not the government suffi<lb break="no"/>cient confidence in the people of the west 
     <lb/>
     to say to them: You are intelligent people, 
     <lb/>
     you are fit to manage you own affairs and 
     <lb/>
     we want your opinion on this measure. If 
     <lb/>
     that had been done by the government, it 
     <lb/>
     would have been the best course to adopt,

            <p>
     I find further that Quebec sent to the 
     <lb/>
     penitentiary an average for the ten years 
     <lb/>
     of one in 10,120, Ontario one in 10,251 and 
     <lb/>
     the maritime provinces one in 12,667. I 
     <lb/>
     give these figures to show that in the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces which have non-sectarian schools the 
     <lb/>
     average of morality is quite equal to and 
     <lb/>
     even surpasses that of the provinces which 
     <lb/>
     have separate schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I will not occupy any more of the

     time of the House. The government can 
     <lb/>
     by force of numbers enact the Bill before

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     1. Is it the intention of the government or of 
     <lb/>
     the Department of Militia to abolish or to re<lb break="no"/>duce the staffs of ofiicers in the militia (cadres 
     <lb/>
     de milice) established by His Excellency the 
     <lb/>
     Governor General in Council, on the 23rd Feb<lb break="no"/>ruary, 1904 ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. It so, why and when will that change be 
     <lb/>
     effected ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. What will be done with the officers and 
     <lb/>
     non-commissioned ofiicers appointed to com<lb break="no"/>plete the staffs that were established on the 
     <lb/>
     22rd February, 1904 ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. Is it the intention of the government or of 
     <lb/>
     the Department of Militia to create a reserve 
     <lb/>
     for each militia corps ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     5. If so. what regulations will govern such re<lb break="no"/>serve ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir FREDERICK BORDEN (Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Militia and Defence) : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. It is not the intention to reduce the 
     <lb/>
     cadres of officers of the militia, but it is the 
     <lb/>
     intention to separate into two lists officers 
     <lb/>
     and non-commissioned oflicers actively em<lb break="no"/>ployed and those whom it is proposed should, 
     <lb/>
     in the event of field operations, be detailed 
     <lb/>
     for work at the base or in raising reserve 
     <lb/>
     units. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. WILMOT. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     2. The change is being made in the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of the service, and will take im<lb break="no"/>mediate effect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. They will constitute the corps of re<lb break="no"/>serves, and will be borne upon a separate 
     <lb/>
     list to those actively employed. It is hoped 
     <lb/>
     that when the central camp of instruction 
     <lb/>
     has been established facilities will be given 
     <lb/>
     for the instruction of all officers and non<lb break="no"/>commissioned oflicers in this list in their 
     <lb/>
     military duties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4 and 5. Yes. The regulations are now 
     <lb/>
     under consideration.

     DEATH OF HON. JAMES SUTHERLAND, 
     <lb/>
     M.P. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Rt. Hon. Sir WI-LFRID LAURIER (Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister). I have to inform the House, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that I have just received a tele<lb break="no"/>gram informing me of the death of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sutherland, Minister of Public Works. I 
     <lb/>
     have to say to the House that personally in 
     <lb/>
     losing Mr. Sutherland I lose one of the truest 
     <lb/>
     friends I ever had, and I know that the 
     <lb/>
     House loses one of its most valued mem<lb break="no"/>bers. I will meet, I am sure, the feelings 
     <lb/>
     of the House if I endeavour to say that the 
     <lb/>
     House should express its sympathy in its 
     <lb/>
     bereavement in some suitable manner, and 
     <lb/>
     I do not know that that can be done in any 
     <lb/>
     other way than by the House adjourning to 
     <lb/>
     attend his funeral. Therefore, I will move 
     <lb/>
     that when this House adjourns to-morrow 
     <lb/>
     it stands adjourned until Monday next, so 
     <lb/>
     as to permit members to attend the funeral 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Sutherland. 
     <lb/>
