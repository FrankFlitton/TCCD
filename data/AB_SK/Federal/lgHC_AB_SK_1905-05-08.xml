                 VACANCY IN THE CABINET. 
   
            </head>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName> (South York). Be<lb break="no"/>fore the Orders of the Day are called, I in<lb break="no"/>tend to draw the attention of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and of the House to a matter of very 
     <lb/>
     great importance, and, in order to put my<lb break="no"/>self within the rules of the House, I intend 
     <lb/>
     to conclude with a motion. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister is no doubt aware of a 
     <lb/>
     vacancy in his cabinet; he is also no doubt 
     <lb/>
     aware that there is a vacancy in North 
     <lb/>
     Oxford, and if he is loyal and true to an 
     <lb/>
     old and trusted colleague, there will be in a 
     <lb/>
     very short time, or there may already be, 
     <lb/>
     for aught I know, a vacancy in the city of 
     <lb/>
     London. At the same time the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is endeavouring to put through 
     <lb/>
     this House a constitutional Bill, a Bill 
     <lb/>
     which, it once passed, can't be revoked. In 
     <lb/>
     a country where there is a constitution as 
     <lb/>
     we have in Canada, my idea is that any con<lb break="no"/>stitutional amendment of the gravity of the 
     <lb/>
     one for autonomy in the west now before 
     <lb/>
     the House ought to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people in a general election. In the United 
     <lb/>
     States, if a great constitutional change is 
     <lb/>
     proposed, it must be submitted to all the 
     <lb/>
     states for consideration before it can become 
     <lb/>
     law; and in countries organized under a 
     <lb/>
     constitution such as Switzerland, before a 
     <lb/>
     constitutional change can take place, there 
     <lb/>
     must be a referendum; and the same cus<lb break="no"/>tom prevails in a number of other countries 
     <lb/>
     where they have written constitutions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5472</fw>
         
<p>
     Now, in Canada, this Bill proposing great 
     <lb/>
     constitutional issues, was brought down to 
     <lb/>
     parliament without any intimation to the 
     <lb/>
     people at the last general election that such 
     <lb/>
     a change was contemplated. In fact, the 
     <lb/>
     people were led to believe that no constitu<lb break="no"/>tional change was to take place ; but imme<lb break="no"/>diately the session was opened this Bill 
     <lb/>
     was introduced, a Bill that involves a great 
     <lb/>
     constitutional issue that to-day is disquiet<lb break="no"/>ing the country from one end to the other. 
     <lb/>
     \Vhile I take the broad ground that this 
     <lb/>
     question ought first to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the whole country, I certainly say, 
     <lb/>
     in view of the vacancy that has occurred in 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet, the vacancy that has occurred 
     <lb/>
     in North Oxford, and the vacancy that I 
     <lb/>
     think ought to occur in the House, if the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman has confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman who has filled that office 
     <lb/>
     now for nearly two years—there ought to 
     <lb/>
     be a vacancy in London. In view, then, of 
     <lb/>
     these two vacancies, or one vacancy, which<lb break="no"/>ever it may be, I say it is the duty of the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman to cause writs to be 
     <lb/>
     issued immediately for that election, or 
     <lb/>
     those two elections, in Ontario, and to give 
     <lb/>
     the people of Ontario, that province which 
     <lb/>
     has been charged by some hon. gentlemen in 
     <lb/>
     this House with being an intolerant pro<lb break="no"/>vince a bigoted province, a narrow-minded 
     <lb/>
     province—to give the people of that province 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity to answer the contention. 
     <lb/>
     which, I believe, is held by the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister, that he has Ontario at his back in 
     <lb/>
     this matter ; and certainly to give the Post<lb break="no"/>master General, the acting Minister of Pub<lb break="no"/>lic Works and the Minister of Customs an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to justify before the people of 
     <lb/>
     their province the policy which they are 
     <lb/>
     now advocating in this House. Until that 
     <lb/>
     is done, I say the hon. gentleman cannot ask 
     <lb/>
     that any progress be made in connection 
     <lb/>
     with this constitutional Bill now before the 
     <lb/>
     House; in fact, I do not think this House 
     <lb/>
     will be justified in making any progress 
     <lb/>
     whatever, or progress of the most secondary 
     <lb/>
     character in a Bill of this kind. But, on the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, these vacancies ought to be filled. 
     <lb/>
     the writs ought to be issued for the elections, 
     <lb/>
     and an appeal ought to be made to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Ontario, and then we will know 
     <lb/>
     whether those hon. gentlemen are right, or 
     <lb/>
     whether their principal organ, the Toronto 
     <lb/>
     'Globe,' is correct in the view which they 
     <lb/>
     take of this great constitutional changes 
     <lb/>
     which is involved in the school laws of the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces. The ' Globe' says it is con<lb break="no"/>stitutionally wrong, that it is wrong as a 
     <lb/>
     matter of policy, whereas the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men say their policy is right and that they 
     <lb/>
     are prepared to justify it in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario. Then they must justify it under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances in these constituencies 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario, and they must justify it now. 
     <lb/>
     If they hold back these elections. the in<lb break="no"/>ference will be that they are afraid to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss their policy in that province. Surely 
     <lb/>
     there is no lack of men. I imagine that the 
     <lb/>

     acting Minister of Public Works is ready to 
     <lb/>
     fight the cause in the city of London ; I am 
     <lb/>
     even told that the chief whip of the party 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Calvert) for Ontario is ready to fight 
     <lb/>
     for the cause in his own constituency; and 
     <lb/>
     we all know that the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has a minister on tap in the city of Toronto, 
     <lb/>
     in the person of Mr. A. B. Aylesworth, who, 
     <lb/>
     it was some time ago reported, had joined, 
     <lb/>
     or was ready to join, the government, and 
     <lb/>
     he is ready, I believe, to replace either the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Public Works or the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice when the Prime Minister asks 
     <lb/>
     him to join the cabinet. In view of all these 
     <lb/>
     things, then, I say, and I say it after full 
     <lb/>
     consideration, after visiting the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, where I have tried to ascertain the 
     <lb/>
     opinion prevalent among the people, and 
     <lb/>
     after all that has been said in this House 
     <lb/>
     about opening seats, that it is the duty of 
     <lb/>
     the government, to themselves, to the coun<lb break="no"/>try, to the Bill and to the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     principles which they have enunciated in 
     <lb/>
     connection with this Bill, to hold these 
     <lb/>
     elections in the immediate future, to con<lb break="no"/>sult public opinion, and in some way to 
     <lb/>
     obtain the views of the people of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     in regard to this great constitutional ques<lb break="no"/>tion; and if they do not do so, it will be 
     <lb/>
     taken as an evidence of cowardice on their 
     <lb/>
     part. Now, let us have it out, let us have 
     <lb/>
     it out in Ontario, and let us have it out now ; 
     <lb/>
     and I make the challenge on behalf of my 
     <lb/>
     province—I am only speaking for myself— 
     <lb/>
     I make the challenge on behalf of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario to submit that question 
     <lb/>
     before the people in two of its most en<lb break="no"/>lightened constituencies, the constituency re<lb break="no"/>presented by the late Minister of Public 
     <lb/>
     Works, which is a country constituency, 
     <lb/>
     and in the city constituency of London, re<lb break="no"/>presented by the acting Minister of Public 
     <lb/>
     Works. Let them follow the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     practice of consulting the people on a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of this kind. Let the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man ascertain what view the people of On<lb break="no"/>tario take on this question, the people of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, who, as I pointed out the other 
     <lb/>
     day in this House, have as much interest as 
     <lb/>
     those of any other section of the country in 
     <lb/>
     the great west. As I pointed out here the 
     <lb/>
     other night, the great west has been largely 
     <lb/>
     settled by people from Ontario, who have 
     <lb/>
     taken Ontario institutions up there. while 
     <lb/>
     Ontario capital has been poured lavishly 
     <lb/>
     into that western country; and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, it is that the people of this 
     <lb/>
     benighted province of Ontario, this in<lb break="no"/>tolerant province, have at heart the 
     <lb/>
     welfare of the west, and they claim that 
     <lb/>
     the people of the west should be given the 
     <lb/>
     same opportunity of deciding this school 
     <lb/>
     question for themselves as was given to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the older provinces prior to con<lb break="no"/>federation. All the provinces that entered 
     <lb/>
     the confederation had an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     passing on the school question and of saying 
     <lb/>
     in what way they were to restrict them<lb break="no"/>selves in regard to education. and the peo<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5474</fw>
      

     ple of Ontario say that the same opportun<lb break="no"/>ity should be given to the people of those 
     <lb/>
     western provinces, that they should be con<lb break="no"/>sulted, and especially that they should be 
     <lb/>
     consulted on a constitutional amendment or 
     <lb/>
     a constitutional law which cannot be revoked. 
     <lb/>
     Surely we are to have in this country gov<lb break="no"/>ernment by the people and for the people; 
     <lb/>
     surely we are to have consultations with the 
     <lb/>
     people, and here is an opportunity for one. 
     <lb/>
     If hon. gentlemen get the endorsation of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario, they may have con<lb break="no"/>siderable reason for going on with this Bill ; 
     <lb/>
     but, in the meantime, after all that has 
     <lb/>
     taken place, after what the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral has said and the Minister of Customs 
     <lb/>
     has said, and the confidence they have ex<lb break="no"/>pressed in their policy, surely there ought 
     <lb/>
     to be no hesitation in filling these vacan<lb break="no"/>cies. or at least in filling one vacancy and 
     <lb/>
     in making another vacancy, and of having 
     <lb/>
     this question threshed out before the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. I beg to move that the House do now 
     <lb/>
     adjourn.

     <lb/>
     at this moment I have to say to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend (Mr. W. F. Maclean) that in my es<lb break="no"/>timation and judgment his remarks are in

     on Wednesday that our friend and colleague

     attended his funeral. The government will 
     <lb/>
     have to choose a successor, and we will 
     <lb/>
     have, at an early date, to make an an<lb break="no"/>nouncement to the House, but when the

     hon. gentleman expects that we should be 
     <lb/>
     prepared to give an answer to his question 
     <lb/>
     today, I think it betrays a want of con<lb break="no"/>sideration on his part and that he asks 
     <lb/>
     a question to which he does not expect me 
     <lb/>
     to respond. I shall give him his answer in

     with the draft of the schedules which he 
     <lb/>
     was good enough to send me last Friday, 
     <lb/>
     whether or not the schedules for Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan have yet been completed and if not 
     <lb/>
     when we may expect to receive them. There 
     <lb/>
     was a map sent of the constituencies in 
     <lb/>
     both provinces with the delimitations of one 
     <lb/>
     only. We only received the one. Do I 
     <lb/>
     understand that we may rely on that map ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I may say to my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend, that I trust that before bring<lb break="no"/>ing these schedules down and asking the 
     <lb/>
     House to pass them he will go carefully 
     <lb/>
     into the question himself. I am inclined 
     <lb/>
     to think he cannot have had correct infor<lb break="no"/>mation in relation to these schedules or he 
     <lb/>
     would not have presented them to the 
     <lb/>
     House. I do not pretend to know any<lb break="no"/>thing about them myself, but my hon. friends 
     <lb/>
     on this side of the House who came from 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest have looked into them pretty 
     <lb/>
     carefully and I am very much astonished 
     <lb/>
     indeed that my right hon. friend should 
     <lb/>
     seek to pass through the House these sche<lb break="no"/>dules if they are of the character which 
     <lb/>
     these hon. gentlemen have described to me. 
     <lb/>
     I have every confidence they are telling me 
     <lb/>
     exactly what they believe, and also that 
     <lb/>
     their belief is founded on a very careful 
     <lb/>
     investigation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to ask my hon. friend an<lb break="no"/>other question and it is this: It was sug<lb break="no"/>gested by the hon. Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Oliver) when going to the west for 
     <lb/>
     re-election, that amendments, other than 
     <lb/>
     that which has been announced to the House 
     <lb/>
     by the government, might be made. I do 
     <lb/>
     not yet know whether or not we are to 
     <lb/>
     regard that as an informal notice that other 
     <lb/>
     important amendments are in contemplation 
     <lb/>
     by the government, but we have had some 
     <lb/>
     remarks in which there may be something 
     <lb/>
     or in which there may be nothing in the 
     <lb/>
     past few days that indicate that the re<lb break="no"/>marks of the hon. Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     were intended to have a certain signifi<lb break="no"/>cance. I would like to ask my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend whether there are any other impor<lb break="no"/>tant amendments now in contemplation by 
     <lb/>
     the government. I do not wish him to tell 
     <lb/>
     me that the Bills may be amended. I 
     <lb/>
     know that, but what I ask is whether there 
     <lb/>
     are other amendments now in contemplation 
     <lb/>
     by the government in respect to these mea<lb break="no"/>sures which are before the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Rt. Hon. Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName> (Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister). In regard to the first of the 
     <lb/>
     two questions which have been put to me 
     <lb/>
     by my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden). I 
     <lb/>
     have to say that my information in regard 
     <lb/>
     to the schedules is the same as his own. I 
     <lb/>
     got my information from my friends the 
     <lb/>
     same as he got his information from his 
     <lb/>
     friends. My information is very different 
     <lb/>
     from the information which he has re<lb break="no"/>ceived, and either his friends are astray, 
     <lb/>
     or my friends are astray, because they do 
     <lb/>
     not appear to agree. The constituencies 
     <lb/>
     have been marked on the map, and the 
     <lb/>
     work of describing them is merely clerical. 
     <lb/>
     The constituencies themselves which have 
     <lb/>
     been carved out seem to be fair as far as 
     <lb/>
     my information goes. In these matters, 
     <lb/>
     as in all matters, the government will al<lb break="no"/>ways be prepared to receive suggestions 
     <lb/>
     which will tend to improve the Bill. I do 
     <lb/>
     not say that these suggestions will be ac<lb break="no"/>
 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5476</fw>
          

     cepted, but   the government will be pre<lb break="no"/>pared to accept all fair suggestions made 
     <lb/>
     from one side or the other. I am aware 
     <lb/>
     that nothing is so delicate perhaps as to 
     <lb/>
     carve out new constituencies such as these 
     <lb/>
     in a new part of the country, and even in 
     <lb/>
     the older parts of the country in such a 
     <lb/>
     way as to give absolute satisfaction. This 
     <lb/>
     is a task, which, in our past experience, 
     <lb/>
     has not been found to be practicable, but 
     <lb/>
     I believe it is the intention of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment to do substantial justice to all par<lb break="no"/>ties concerned. In regard to the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     Bill, if that were to be a precedent, the 
     <lb/>
     policy adopted was to leave the constituen<lb break="no"/>cies practically to the new provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. We thought this would be per<lb break="no"/>haps liable to very serious abuse, that it 
     <lb/>
     would not be acceptable, and we could not 
     <lb/>
     see that there was any other policy than 
     <lb/>
     to have the schedules prepared here and 
     <lb/>
     to have the constituencies marked out. In 
     <lb/>
     regard to the other question of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, I may say that up to the present 
     <lb/>
     time the government have not considered 
     <lb/>
     any amendment to the Bill. I do not say 
     <lb/>
     that we may not offer any. but no amend<lb break="no"/>ment has yet been considered. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Do I understand that 
     <lb/>
     these schedules will be printed ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Yes. 
     <lb/>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">MR. FOSTER</persName>.  The Bills, I suppose, will 
     <lb/>
      not be pressed until they are in the hands 
     <lb/>of the members? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I will not 
     <lb/>
     say that. The schedules will not give 
     <lb/>
     much information of themselves unless 
     <lb/>
     they are accompanied by maps. Maps 
     <lb/>
     are being prepared and the schedules will 
     <lb/>
     be printed very shortly. They could be 
     <lb/>
     printed by to-morrow if necessary.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. And the maps will be 
     <lb/>
     placed in the hands of hon. members ?

            <p>

     one to niy'hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
     <lb/>
     and we can have a few more for hon. 
     <lb/>
     members. Without a map the schedules 
     <lb/>
     would not show anything at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     ask the right hon. leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) whether, when 
     <lb/>
     he says he has no amendments, he intends 
     <lb/>
     to amend the present franchise Act in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the way in which the voters' list is 
     <lb/>
     prepared in this country or whether he in<lb break="no"/>tends to continue the present system in 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces ? There is enough 
     <lb/>
     experience of our present Franchise Act, 
     <lb/>
     of the way in which the names of voters 
     <lb/>
     are put on, and of the way in which the 
     <lb/>
     lists are prepared to call for a large mea<lb break="no"/>sure of reform. This is an essential part 
     <lb/>
     of this Bill. When we are talking about 
     <lb/>
     constituencies we must take into consider<lb break="no"/>

     ation the manner in which the voters' lists 
     <lb/>
     are prepared. That is a very important

     <lb/>
     my right hon. friend said respecting the 
     <lb/>
     information which will be placed on the 
     <lb/>
     table of the House, I did not observe his 
     <lb/>
     words, but I am informed that he spoke 
     <lb/>
     of having only three or four maps prepared 
     <lb/>
     to lay on the table of the House.

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I think it would

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. It is impos<lb break="no"/>sible to have new maps printed or prepared. 
     <lb/>
     The only thing we could do was this: We

     have taken maps of the constituencies in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest as they exist now, and upon 
     <lb/>
     these we have carved out and indicated the 
     <lb/>
     new constituencies. The thing can be un<lb break="no"/>derstood at a glance. We will have as 
     <lb/>
     many of these maps prepared as we can 
     <lb/>
     but I cannot say as to the number.

     presented an amendment by way of substi<lb break="no"/>tution for the third clause of the resolution

     granting an allowance in lieu of the lands. 
     <lb/>
     I desire to call attention to the fact that in 
     <lb/>
     preparing that amendment it was neglected 
     <lb/>
     to provide that the allowance should be paid 
     <lb/>
     half-yearly to the province. I wish to in<lb break="no"/>sert the words to make it clear that that 
     <lb/>
     allowance as well as other allowances to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces will be paid half-yearly in 
     <lb/>
     advance. The following is the amendment

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The sum paid to On<lb break="no"/>tario last year as set forth in the Auditor 
     <lb/>
     General's report is: allowance for govern<lb break="no"/>ment, $80,000; subsidy per head, $1,116, 
     <lb/>
     872.80: interest on the amount standing to 
     <lb/>
     credit of province, $142,414.48, making a 
     <lb/>
     total payment to the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     last year of $1.339.287.28. These payments 
     <lb/>
     are usually grouped together under the head 
     <lb/>
     of subsidies to provinces, though in reality 
     <lb/>
     some of the payments are derived from 
     <lb/>
     interest on capital account. The payment 
     <lb/>
     to Quebec, including precisely the same

     class of items, amounted to $1,086,713.48.

            <p>

     the question was to make a comparison be<lb break="no"/>tween the amounts paid to the two largest

     provinces, and the amount that will be paid 
     <lb/>
     eventually to the new provinces.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">MR. FIELDING</persName>. We have to bear in mind 
     <lb/>
     that the land subsidy to the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     is a very considerable item which does not 
     <lb/>
     go to the other provinces because they poss<lb break="no"/>ess the land. The clause we are now dis<lb break="no"/>cussing is the allowance in lieu of the land.

     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. Certainly, that is al<lb break="no"/>ready done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Mr. HAGGART</persName>. The minister promised 
     <lb/>
     to bring down a statement of the lands in 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces which are at the dis<lb break="no"/>posal of the government other than those 
     <lb/>
     lands which were intended for actual set<lb break="no"/>tlers, free gift lands and homestead lands, 
     <lb/>
     and the value of them. A motion was sub<lb break="no"/>mitted some time ago and pressed a num<lb break="no"/>ber of times by the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto (Mr. Foster) and the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Marquette (Mr. W. J. Roche) for infor<lb break="no"/>mation as to the location, area and value of 
     <lb/>
     these lands, and the amount of these lands 
     <lb/>
     at the disposal of the government. We 
     <lb/>
     were promised a statement in regard to 
     <lb/>
     these matters. We have only the estimated 
     <lb/>
     value in regard to an estimated area of 
     <lb/>
     25,000,000 acres without any information at 
     <lb/>
     all upon the subject, and even in taking the 
     <lb/>
     value of these lands, in making an allow<lb break="no"/>ance to the province for them, surely the 
     <lb/>
     cost of the management of that land ought 
     <lb/>
     to be deducted from the amount in making 
     <lb/>
     an allowance for each province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. In reference to the re<lb break="no"/>quest for information to which my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend referred. I was under the impression 
     <lb/>
     that we had brought down all the papers 
     <lb/>
     sought for. If there is a request for a re<lb break="no"/>turn of the kind mentioned that has not 
     <lb/>
     been brought down I do not remember it. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend may be correct, but I have 
     <lb/>
     no recollection of such a request. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Is it not suitable 
     <lb/>
     that such a statement should be made, that 
     <lb/>
     we should take stock at the present time of 
     <lb/>
     the public lands at the disposal of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment for the carrying out of this arran<lb break="no"/>gement with the provinces ? Surely the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior could give us a 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5482</fw>
          

     statement or he could easily obtain one, 
     <lb/>
     setting forth how many millions of acres 
     <lb/>
     are at the disposal of the government for 
     <lb/>
     this purpose, say in the province of Al<lb break="no"/>berta. We ought to know this. and also 
     <lb/>
     should have a statement showing what 
     <lb/>
     public lands are still not alienated in any 
     <lb/>
     way in the other adjoining provinces, which 
     <lb/>
     will be available for the payment of the 
     <lb/>
     money proposed in these resolutions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The value of these 
     <lb/>
     lands is always a problematical question, and 
     <lb/>
     it may not be easy for any of us to put a 
     <lb/>
     value on them. In the early stage of the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion a request was made for information 
     <lb/>
     and information was brought down which I 
     <lb/>
     think covers most of what my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     seeks. If hon. members will look at ses<lb break="no"/>sional paper No. 97, they will find that in<lb break="no"/>formation therein given respecting the areas 
     <lb/>
     of the provisional districts of Alberta, As<lb break="no"/>siniboia and Saskatchewan. All the infor<lb break="no"/>mation he desires, I think, he will find 
     <lb/>
     there except that as to the value. That is 
     <lb/>
     a question as to which each of us is free 
     <lb/>
     to form his own opinion, and in the amend<lb break="no"/>ment which we have put before the commit<lb break="no"/>tee we have eliminated the estimate of the 
     <lb/>
     area and the value and have put in a specific . 
     <lb/>
     sum. We avoid a discussion, for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of the Act, of the value and area of the 
     <lb/>
     land . 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Mr. HAGGART</persName>. The cost of management 
     <lb/>
     should be deducted in allowing the interest 
     <lb/>
     on the value of the land. The minister too 
     <lb/>
     will remember that we had a promise from 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior when the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk Pacific was under discussion, that a 
     <lb/>
     large quantity of these lands would be 
     <lb/>
     available for sale, and would realize to the 
     <lb/>
     government of this country nearly the cost 
     <lb/>
     of construction of the line across the conti<lb break="no"/>nent. Has any provision been made for 
     <lb/>
     keeping apart lands for the fulfilment of 
     <lb/>
     the promise of the Minister of the Interior, 
     <lb/>
     that they could be used for the payment of 
     <lb/>
     the transcontinental railway ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. It seems to me that pro<lb break="no"/>vision is made. We keep the whole of the 
     <lb/>
     lands, not a part, we keep them all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. Over a year ago, I made 
     <lb/>
     an estimate of the amount of section lands 
     <lb/>
     that would be available after all the land 
     <lb/>
     grants which railways had earned or would 
     <lb/>
     earn had been applied for, and I estimated 
     <lb/>
     that there would be probably 50,000,000 
     <lb/>
     acres of odd sections available. It would 
     <lb/>
     however be impossible, I think, for any one 
     <lb/>
     to put a value on that land, simply be<lb break="no"/>cause a great deal of it is not surveyed, and 
     <lb/>
     we do not know of what character it is. 
     <lb/>
     In reference to what the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior said about selling lands for the 
     <lb/>
     building of the Grand Trunk Pacific he did 
     <lb/>
     not make a statement of the kind attributed 
     <lb/>
     to him. He said that the building of that 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="5483" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-08_Page_5483.jpg"/>
          
<fw type="num">5483</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
       


     road would open up the country and the 
     <lb/>
     value of the land would be enhanced. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Mr. HAGGART</persName>. Does the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     deny the statement I made that the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior made that statement? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. He said noth<lb break="no"/>ing of the kind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. I did not deny any state<lb break="no"/>ment; I simply said that the statement made 
     <lb/>
     by the Minister of the Interior was that 
     <lb/>
     the building of the Grand Trunk Pacific 
     <lb/>
     would open up the country and that the en<lb break="no"/>hanced value of the land opened up would 
     <lb/>
     be equal to what the road would cost. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Mr. HAGGART</persName>. He made a direct pro<lb break="no"/>mise to the House that the land there could 
     <lb/>
     be disposed of for the purpose of recouping 
     <lb/>
     the country for the building of that road. 
     <lb/>
     However, while I am on my feet, let me 
     <lb/>
     draw attention to the return brought down 
     <lb/>
     by the Finance Minister. It simply gives 
     <lb/>
     the joint area of undisposed lands in the 
     <lb/>
     provisional district of Alberta as 38,190,964 
     <lb/>
     acres, and of Saskatchewan at 51,832,246 
     <lb/>
     acres. These lands may be included in the 
     <lb/>
     free lands and homesteads and when these 
     <lb/>
     are taken up there may be no land at all 
     <lb/>
     at the disposal of the government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I think the return which was 
     <lb/>
     brought down to which the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance referred does give a considerable 
     <lb/>
     amount of information on this question 
     <lb/>
     which has been raised, although the return 
     <lb/>
     is couched in such a way that it is very 
     <lb/>
     difficult to get the information that it con<lb break="no"/>tains clearly into one's mind. What I would 
     <lb/>
     like to suggest is that although it is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     true that the basis of calculation is elimi<lb break="no"/>nated from the resolutions, still I think the 
     <lb/>
     only way in which we can arrive at a right 
     <lb/>
     understanding of what the calculation 
     <lb/>
     should be is by making a calculation 
     <lb/>
     based on a definite area of land and a defi<lb break="no"/>nite value to be given to that area. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that is the only way in which 
     <lb/>
     we can arrive at anything like a safe cal<lb break="no"/>culation, and therefore I would like the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance to give us some such 
     <lb/>
     calculation as that or to say whether he 
     <lb/>
     considers we ought to abide by the calcula<lb break="no"/>tion which was made in the original resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. I find that in this report which was 
     <lb/>
     brought down it is stated that there is a 
     <lb/>
     total of 277,931,790 acres of land still undis<lb break="no"/>posed of in both provinces. I suppose for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of rough calculation we may 
     <lb/>
     divide that into half, attributing one half 
     <lb/>
     to each province. That would mean nearly 
     <lb/>
     139.000,000 acres of land in each province 
     <lb/>
     still undisposed of. Of course, I am quite 
     <lb/>
     willing to admit that it would be very diffi<lb break="no"/>cult to make a close calculation as to the 
     <lb/>
     value of the whole of that land ; but in that 
     <lb/>
     return we have the statement showing an 
     <lb/>
     estimate given by the Surveyor General as 
     <lb/>
     to the condition of these lands. He has 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Take the case of Saskatchewan; and I 
     <lb/>
     presume there will be no objection to our 
     <lb/>
     discussing either one province or the other. 
     <lb/>
     Take Saskatchewan, there has been, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to this return, about 22,235,385 acres of 
     <lb/>
     land disposed of. Supposing the whole of 
     <lb/>
     this were wheat land, that would still leave 
     <lb/>
     34,804,615 acres of wheat lands at the dis<lb break="no"/>posal of the government, and in addition a 
     <lb/>
     very large amount of land which would re<lb break="no"/>quire irrigation, and an enormous tract fit 
     <lb/>
     for ranching, according to the estimate of 
     <lb/>
     the Surveyor General. I would like to have 
     <lb/>
     some calculation made of the value which 
     <lb/>
     should be put upon these lands. How have 
     <lb/>
     the government arrived at this capital sum 
     <lb/>
     of $37,500,000, upon which they are going 
     <lb/>
     to distribute interest to the new provinces, 
     <lb/>
     according to population? What was the 
     <lb/>
     basis of that calculation? We find that 
     <lb/>
     wheat lands in the Northwest are selling at 
     <lb/>
     a far greater value than $1.50 per acre. 
     <lb/>
     Take the sales by the Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway in January this year, the average 
     <lb/>
     price obtained for the land was $4.10 per 
     <lb/>
     acre. I have looked through the report of 
     <lb/>
     the Department of the Interior for the years 
     <lb/>
     1903, and 1904, and find there a statement 
     <lb/>
     of the lands disposed of by the various land 
     <lb/>
     companies in the Northwest—the Hudson 
     <lb/>
     Bay Company, the Canadian Pacific Rail 
     <lb/>
     way and other companies—and I find that 
     <lb/>
     the average price obtained by the Hudson 
     <lb/>
     Bay Company for their lands was $5.50 per 
     <lb/>
     acre, by the Canadian Pacific Railway $3.50 
     <lb/>
     per acre, and that the average price for the 
     <lb/>
     lands sold during the previous eleven years 
     <lb/>
     was about $3.50 per acre. It turns out, on 
     <lb/>
     totalling up these figures, that the grand 
     <lb/>
     total of the lands sold by the land compa<lb break="no"/>nies during those previous eleven years 
     <lb/>
     amounted to 10,512,349 acres. and that the 
     <lb/>
     sum for which they were sold totalled just 
     <lb/>
     about the sum which is to be allowed each 
     <lb/>
     of the new provinces as compensation for 
     <lb/>
     25 million acres of land. That is to say, 
     <lb/>
     the amount received by the companies 
     <lb/>
 

            <pb n="5485" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-08_Page_5485.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5485</fw>                       <fw type="dateline">MAY 8, 1905</fw>             
   
     

     amounted to $36,992,482. Thus the land com<lb break="no"/>panies, during the eleven years previous to 
     <lb/>
     the 30th June, 1904, sold something under 
     <lb/>
     eleven million acres of land for nearly $37,<lb break="no"/>000,000. Those are the returns given in the 
     <lb/>
     report of the Department of the Interior. 
     <lb/>
     What I want to get is a definite idea of the 
     <lb/>
     basis of the calculation which was made by 
     <lb/>
     the government in arriving at this sum to 
     <lb/>
     be allowed the new provinces as compen<lb break="no"/>sation for their lands.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. If the hon. gentleman will 
     <lb/>
     say just what information he wants in order 
     <lb/>
     to arrive at a basis for his arguments, I 
     <lb/>
     shall be very glad to order it to be prepared. 
     <lb/>
     I thought that the information submitted 
     <lb/>
     would be sufficient; but if it be not, and I 
     <lb/>
     am definitely informed what will be suffi<lb break="no"/>cient, certainly such a statement will be 
     <lb/>
     prepared. I may say that the question is 
     <lb/>
     not so much what a certain quantity of 
     <lb/>
     land in the Northwest Territory could be 
     <lb/>
     sold for as a question of how much money 
     <lb/>
     is required to carry on the government of 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces in comparison with the 
     <lb/>
     amounts which are available for the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces to carry on their provincial busi<lb break="no"/>ness. As stated in the resolution, it is not 
     <lb/>
     a matter of buying and selling lands, but of 
     <lb/>
     providing for the support of the provincial 
     <lb/>
     governments in proportion to that given the 
     <lb/>
     governments of other provinces from Dom<lb break="no"/>inion subsidies and the sales of land. We 
     <lb/>
     wish to place these new provinces in at 
     <lb/>
     least as good a position as the older ones. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. If that be the case, 
     <lb/>
     what is the use of any recital respecting 
     <lb/>
     the lands ? I do not see the force of it, yet 
     <lb/>
     the resolution was based altogether, in the 
     <lb/>
     first instance, on the amount of land and 
     <lb/>
     a certain value per acre. That has since been 
     <lb/>
     modified by the amendment introduced by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the Minister of Finance for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of getting rid of the difficulty 
     <lb/>
     suggested by the ex-Minister of the Inte<lb break="no"/>rior (Mr. Sifton), who said that these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces, having their right to the lands 
     <lb/>
     recognized by the terms of the proposed 
     <lb/>
     statute, would continually come back upon 
     <lb/>
     the government with the plea that the lands 
     <lb/>
     had much improved in value, and 
     <lb/>
     there would consequently be constant fric<lb break="no"/>tion between the Dominion government and 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces. But my hon. friend has 
     <lb/>
     put the matter in a new aspect; and I do 
     <lb/>
     not see why, if he is speaking with the con<lb break="no"/>currence of his colleagues, the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance should have introduced the amend<lb break="no"/>ment in its present form, and why he should 
     <lb/>
     not simply eliminate all reference to the 
     <lb/>
     lands and put the matter in the form of a 
     <lb/>
     subsidy for the reason suggested by the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior, namely, that it is 
     <lb/>
     necessary for the carrying on of the govern<lb break="no"/>ments of the new provinces, to make a cer<lb break="no"/>tain additional grant to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. That is exactly what is 
     <lb/>
     being done by the amendment, as I under<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5486</fw>
        
stand it. This is a special allowance in view 
     <lb/>
     of the lands. There must be some reason 
     <lb/>
     given for making such an allowance differ<lb break="no"/>ent from what is given the other provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and that is the reason ; and the question of 
     <lb/>
     the value of the lands is not the main 
     <lb/>
     question to be considered, as the amend<lb break="no"/>ment introduced indicates. I was going to 
     <lb/>
     allude to a remark made by my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) as to the value 
     <lb/>
     which has been received for lands sold by the 
     <lb/>
     land companies. On that value he proposed to 
     <lb/>
     base a comparison with the value of other 
     <lb/>
     lands in the Territories. I point out that 
     <lb/>
     the lands sold at that value were lands 
     <lb/>
     specially selected by the railway company, 
     <lb/>
     lands that, in many cases had been specially 
     <lb/>
     advantaged by the construction of the rail<lb break="no"/>way. The value of these lands. of course, 
     <lb/>
     is no fair basis of comparison in estimating 
     <lb/>
     the value of the lands remaining. The fact 
     <lb/>
     that these lands have been selected and 
     <lb/>
     taken out of the possibility of revenue for 
     <lb/>
     either this government or the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government absolutely reduces the value of 
     <lb/>
     the remaining part of the lands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I would suggest that the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) has for<lb break="no"/>gotten that I included the lands of the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson Bay Company which were not speci<lb break="no"/>ally selected. And the price received for 
     <lb/>
     them was $5.50, as against $3.50 per acre, 
     <lb/>
     which was obtained for the lands of the rail<lb break="no"/>way company which the minister says were 
     <lb/>
     specially selected. I might mention a further 
     <lb/>
     basis of calculation in the school lands which 
     <lb/>
     have been sold recently in the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
     These are not specially selected either. 
     <lb/>
     The school lands are simply two sections 
     <lb/>
     in each township. And the average price 
     <lb/>
    for which they sold was about $9 per acre. 
     <lb/>The average price for school lands in As<lb break="no"/>siniboia was $9.69 and the average of all, 
     <lb/>I think I am correct in stating was over 
     <lb/>$9 per acre. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. In the case of the school 
     <lb/>
     lands it is only the best lands that have 
     <lb/>
     been sold, in most cases. A high valuation 
     <lb/>
     is placed on the school lands, and if they do 
     <lb/>
     not bring that price they are not sold at all. 
     <lb/>
     In the last sale of school lands in Assiniboia, 
     <lb/>
     the lowest price was $7, and anything that 
     <lb/>
     purchasers did not think worth that was not 
     <lb/>
     sold, but still remains the property of the 
     <lb/>
     government. The same thing applies, to a 
     <lb/>
     large extent, to the Hudson Bay Company's 
     <lb/>
     lands. The company put a high price per 
     <lb/>
     acre and hold these lands until the particular 
     <lb/>
     part of the country in which they are be<lb break="no"/>comes well settled, and so they get a high 
     <lb/>
     price. This policy is carried out even when 
     <lb/>
     it is necessary to hold the lands for many 
     <lb/>
     years. And, in case of the school lands, the 
     <lb/>
     government still hold the lands which Will 
     <lb/>
     not bring a good price.

     placed on the lands that are already held

     I find that the province of Ontario, with a

     two and a quarter millions for their lands

     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Some explanation may 
     <lb/>
     have been given when I was not in the 
     <lb/>
     House. and if so I would not like to call 
     <lb/>
     upon the Finance Minister (Mr. Fielding) to 
     <lb/>
     give it again. But I do not remember having 
     <lb/>
     read it. There must have been some method 
     <lb/>
     by which these figures. as to either the 
     <lb/>
     quantity of land or the valuation of the 
     <lb/>
     lands, were arrived at. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     know from the Finance Minister what that 
     <lb/>
     method was. Take, for instance one pro<lb break="no"/>vince. Would the Minister of Finance tell 
     <lb/>
     us by what method he and the government 
     <lb/>
     arrived at the quantity of lands that would 
     <lb/>
     be fair to allow in comparison with the total 
     <lb/>
     area of the province. And then I would like 
     <lb/>
     to know by what method he and they arrived 
     <lb/>
     at the conclusion that a fair valuation of the 
     <lb/>
     land would be $1.50 per acre. I do not 
     <lb/>
     imagine for a moment that the government 
     <lb/>
     assembled around the Council Board would 
     <lb/>
     arrive at a conclusion as to the quantity 
     <lb/>
     without first going into the quantity of lands 
     <lb/>
     in the province. Nor would they reach a con<lb break="no"/>clusion as to the value to be allowed with<lb break="no"/>out taking the different grades of lands and 
     <lb/>
     values of those different grades. Having 
     <lb/>
     done this, I should think they would come 
     <lb/>
     to the conclusion that, if they did not give 
     <lb/>
     the lands in toto to the province, they ought 
     <lb/>
     to make a compensation of a certain number 
     <lb/>
     of acres. Then they would make an esti<lb break="no"/>mate, based upon the best data possible, of 
     <lb/>
     the average value of these lands. Now, if 
     <lb/>
     we had the method by which the govern<lb break="no"/>ment arrived at these figures, we should 
     <lb/>
     be in a position to reach our own con<lb break="no"/>clusions as to the justness of the grant and 
     <lb/>
     the fairness of the valuation. If something 
     <lb/>
     like that was not done, if the government 
     <lb/>
     made no investigation and took no trouble 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the matter ; if they simply came 
     <lb/>
     to the conclusion, as the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior hinted, that a certain amount was 
     <lb/>
     necessary for a revenue for these provinces

     in lieu of these lands, and, without calcula<lb break="no"/>tion of any kind. put it at a round figure 
     <lb/>
     25,000,000 acres and, without estimating the 
     <lb/>
     value of the different kinds of lands, wheat 
     <lb/>
     lands, grazing lands and the rest and averag<lb break="no"/>ing the whole simply jumped at a valu<lb break="no"/>ation, of course that is a wholly different 
     <lb/>
     case. If they simply said : We want to give 
     <lb/>
     them $37,500,000, and we will play at valu<lb break="no"/>ation and play at estimates of area, and will 
     <lb/>
     put a formula before parliament very digni<lb break="no"/>fied and very satisfying to the eye, but 
     <lb/>
     merely an excuse——and under that will give 
     <lb/>
     $37,500,000 in lieu of lands, then why all 
     <lb/>
     this pother and bother about the quantities 
     <lb/>
     of lands or valuation per acre ? If all they 
     <lb/>
     wished to do—and it is the only thing the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior intimates they 
     <lb/>
     sought to do—was to give $37,500,000, what 
     <lb/>
     is the use of this arrangement of $1.50 upon 
     <lb/>
     25,000,000 acres of land ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the province of Saskatchewan has 
     <lb/>
     either a right to all these lands or it has 
     <lb/>
     a right in compensation to a certain pro<lb break="no"/>portion of its lands at a fair valuation; 
     <lb/>
     or if you are not going to take the lands 
     <lb/>
     into account at all, it has a right to ask 
     <lb/>
     you to say what amount of money you will 
     <lb/>
     give it per year, simply that and nothing 
     <lb/>
     more. What is the. use of going to Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan or to the other province and 
     <lb/>
     telling the people: We have given you 
     <lb/>
     25,000,000 acres of your land, which is a 
     <lb/>
     certain proportion of all the lands in Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan, at a good average valuation of 
     <lb/>
     $1.50 per acre, if you are doing nothing 
     <lb/>
     of the kind ? If 25,000,000 acres is a fair 
     <lb/>
     proportion of all the lands in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Saskatchewan, that is to he, get at the 
     <lb/>
     proper valuation of them, not a rule-of- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     thumb valuation, and give the province 
     <lb/>
     which is to be, the value of those lands 
     <lb/>
     on what is a fair valuation. Now is $1.50 
     <lb/>
     a fair valuation of the average lands in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Saskatchewan? That is 
     <lb/>
     what I think the Minister of Finance is 
     <lb/>
     bound to ascertain, unless he admits what 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior intimated— 
     <lb/>
     but of course the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     was not there at the time, and he may 
     <lb/>
     just have thought that that would be the 
     <lb/>
     easiest way by which a minister could ac<lb break="no"/>complish such an object, and therefore there
     <lb/>
     is nothing in it but the idea of giving so 
     <lb/>
     much money and making an arbitrary basis 
     <lb/>
     upon which it was to be given. But I do 
     <lb/>
     not like to think that the government has 
     <lb/>
     come down to this parliament, under show 
     <lb/>
     of making an elaborate calculation, and 
     <lb/>
     given the proper proportion of lands in 
     <lb/>
     the province to the province, and given them 
     <lb/>
     without a valuation which is fair and just 
     <lb/>
     in commutation. I would like to hear from 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Finance as to whether he 
     <lb/>
     is right in this respect, or as to whether 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior is right, as to 
     <lb/>
     whether my first supposition is right, or as 
     <lb/>
     to whether the supposition that one would

     ior has said, is correct. Are we saying 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces: You have so many mil<lb break="no"/>lions of acres of land in all, an average pro<lb break="no"/>portion of these we are giving to you as 
     <lb/>
     compensation, and we are putting a fair 
     <lb/>
     valuation upon the average proportion that 
     <lb/>
     we are giving you? That is what any 
     <lb/>
     gentleman from one of those provinces 
     <lb/>
     would think was being done, by virtue of 
     <lb/>
     the long detailed resolutions which, if they 
     <lb/>
     infer anything at all, infer an absolute and 
     <lb/>
     well proportioned classification as to the 
     <lb/>
     quantity of the lands, the proper valuation, 
     <lb/>
     and the proportion which should be given

     out of that quantity.

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend is aware that in the preparation of 
     <lb/>
     this Bill we took the position that the 
     <lb/>
     government of the new provinces was not 
     <lb/>
     entitled of right to the lands. We took the 
     <lb/>
     position that the lands fairly belonged to 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion. At the same time we had 
     <lb/>
     to take into consideration the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the lands which were given to the older 
     <lb/>
     provinces, not to Manitoba, were to them 
     <lb/>
     a valuable asset which enabled them to 
     <lb/>
     carry on their business. We thought there<lb break="no"/>fore, since we retailed the lands, we should 
     <lb/>
     do as was done in Manitoba, we should 
     <lb/>
     give something in money in lieu of the 
     <lb/>
     lands. But my hon. friend knows better 
     <lb/>
     than I do, because he was long connected 
     <lb/>
     with the government which dealt with 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, that Manitoba was not dealt with 
     <lb/>
     upon any rule which is known, at least, to 
     <lb/>
     the average mind. From time to time 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba was given some advantage, but 
     <lb/>
     they were always given in the absence of 
     <lb/>
     any principle which could be properly ex<lb break="no"/>plained, which, so far as I know, has 
     <lb/>
     never been understood. When we came to 
     <lb/>
     discuss what would be a fair compensation 
     <lb/>
     —I do not like to use the word compensation 
     <lb/>
     in regard to this matter— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>.  That is the word you 
     <lb/>
     have used.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I know it, 
     <lb/>
     still we sometimes use words when we 
     <lb/>
     think we might use better ones. The 
     <lb/>
     word " compensation' is [not a word I 
     <lb/>
     would like to use. At all events, what I 
     <lb/>
     have in my mind was this, that when we 
     <lb/>
     came to consider what we should give to 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces as an equivalent in 
     <lb/>
     money if we retained the lands, we had 
     <lb/>
     to find a basis for a calculation as to the 
     <lb/>
     value of the lands. As to the number of 
     <lb/>
     acres, we have had calculations made more 
     <lb/>
     than once, my former colleague, the pre<lb break="no"/>sent member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) has 
     <lb/>
     stated to the House that there were 50,<lb break="no"/>000,000 acres of land available in the two 
     <lb/>
     provinces, that is to say, between the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba and the Rocky moun<lb break="no"/>tains. We did not imagine that we had 
     <lb/>
     50.000000 acres immediately available for 
     <lb/>
     settlement, but that is the quantity which 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5490</fw>
         

     could be disposed of apart from the home<lb break="no"/>stead lands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Mr. HAGGART</persName>. Is that apart from the 
     <lb/>
     homestead lands ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. That is out<lb break="no"/>side the homestead lands. We calculate 
     <lb/>
     we have 50,000,000 outside the homestead 
     <lb/>
     lands which can be disposed of; at all 
     <lb/>
     events, that is the way I understood the 
     <lb/>
     calculation. With regard to the price of 
     <lb/>
     these lands, I think it is not possible to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain a fair average value by what 
     <lb/>
     has been realized by railway companies in 
     <lb/>
     the disposal of their lands, and what has 
     <lb/>
     been realized by the disposal of. school 
     <lb/>
     lands by auction, or what has been 
     <lb/>
     realized by the Hudson Bay Company 
     <lb/>
     for their lands. The Hudson Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany chose its own time to sell its lands, 
     <lb/>
     at a time when it thought the best price 
     <lb/>
     could be obtained. The school lands are all 
     <lb/>
     disposed of at auction, they are not dis<lb break="no"/>posed of indiscriminately, they are put up 
     <lb/>
     at auction always with a view of realizing 
     <lb/>
     the best possible price. Then with regard 
     <lb/>
     to lands disposed of by the railway com<lb break="no"/>pany, we know that they always dispose 
     <lb/>
     of them with a view of getting the best 
     <lb/>
     price, and they dispose of only such lands as 
     <lb/>
     have increased in value by railway facil<lb break="no"/>ities. The hon. member for Qu'Appelle 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Lake) will admit that we could not 
     <lb/>
     take the prices obtained for'their lands 
     <lb/>
     by these various companies, as a fair aver<lb break="no"/>age price for the whole 50,000.000 acres. 
     <lb/>
     That would be no fair basis of compari<lb break="no"/>son. But we thought we would have a 
     <lb/>
     fair basis of comparism in the transaction 
     <lb/>
     that took place some years ago between 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway Company 
     <lb/>
     and the government when, if I remember 
     <lb/>
     right, the government redeemed 6,000,000 
     <lb/>
     acres of their land at a price, I think, of 
     <lb/>
     $1.50. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. They realized $10,000,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. That was the 
     <lb/>
     basis of our calculation. There were some 
     <lb/>
     6,000,000 odd acres of land disposed of by 
     <lb/>
     the company to the government, and the 
     <lb/>
     price realized I think was $1.50 an acre. 
     <lb/>
     It is possible that to-day the lands in ques<lb break="no"/>tion might be sold for a little higher, or 
     <lb/>
     possibly they would not bring as much. 
     <lb/>
     But since that time we have undertaken 
     <lb/>
     national obligations, and we count upon 
     <lb/>
     this land as an asset to help us meet those 
     <lb/>
     obligations. I do not pretend to say that 
     <lb/>
     we could dispose of all the lands we have 
     <lb/>
     to-day at $1.50, I think we ought to realize 
     <lb/>
     more. The government will not dispose of 
     <lb/>
     them immediately, they will be sold from 
     <lb/>
     time to time as the country develops, and 
     <lb/>
     I daresay they will bring to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment enough revenue to enable us to meet 
     <lb/>
 

     the liabilities we have undertaken. But, 
     <lb/>
     I believe that if you put it as a fair business, 
     <lb/>

     transaction between government. and gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, the price which we have given is 
     <lb/>
     a fair one, the basis is a reasonable one 
     <lb/>
     and one which is perfectly intelligible and 
     <lb/>
     will meet with the approbation of the 
     <lb/>
     House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. In reference to what the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman said, I should be per<lb break="no"/>fectly willing to admit that you could not 
     <lb/>
     put fifty million of acres on the market at 
     <lb/>
     this moment and obtain for them the price of 
     <lb/>
     $1.50 per acre, but I do firmly believe that 
     <lb/>
     if these lands are husbanded carefully we 
     <lb/>
     shall in the long run get fully the price 
     <lb/>
     which has been realized by the land compa<lb break="no"/>nies for their lands and fully the price of 
     <lb/>
    school lands and even more than that 
     <lb/>price. He has taken the estimate of 
     <lb/>the late Minister of the Interior that 
     <lb/>50,000,000 acres would be about the amount 
     <lb/>of land comprised in the odd numbered 
     <lb/>-sections which will be available for dis<lb break="no"/>:posal by the government. I would suggest 
     <lb/>to the right hon. gentleman that it would 
     <lb/>be only right to take also the estimate 
     <lb/>'which the late Minister of the Interior put 
     <lb/>upon the value of this land in his remarks 
     <lb/>on the occasion of the Grand Trunk Pacific 
     <lb/>Railway debate. He stated that within 
     <lb/>ten years from the completion of this rail<lb break="no"/>way these 50,000,000 acres of land would be 
     <lb/>available, and I think he must only have 
     <lb/>referred to the lands which would be opened 
     <lb/>up by the railway. He further said that 
     <lb/>within ten years from the completion of the 
     <lb/>railway—I am only speaking from memory, 
     <lb/>but I think I am perfectly correct; if I am 
     <lb/>not some gentleman may put me right—20<lb break="no"/>000,000 acres would have an accrued value 
     <lb/>of $3 per acre. That is the basis that we 
     <lb/>ought to go upon. If these lands are not 
     <lb/>going to be thrown on the market in one 
     <lb/>block at once the value which they will 
     <lb/>have in the future should be given. to them. 
     <lb/>Further than that I may quote from a 
     <lb/>remark which was also made by the late 
     <lb/>Minister of the Interior during the debate 
     <lb/>on the second reading of this Bill. When, 
     <lb/>speaking in reference to the value of the 
     <lb/>school lands fund, he stated that that was 
     <lb/>a fund which would be worth $50,000,000. 
     <lb/>I may point out that the school lands are 
     <lb/>something less than one-seventeenth part of 
     <lb/>the whole of the lands included in these two 
     <lb/>provinces. I cannot suppose that the late 
     <lb/>Minister of the Interior would make a state<lb break="no"/>ment of that sort unless he had some ground 
     <lb/>for believing that at some day in the future 
     <lb/>the amount to be received for these lands 
     <lb/>would reach that sum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. I think, if I can Judge 
     <lb/>
     from what the right hon. Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     stated, that the inference, if not the state<lb break="no"/>ment, of the hon. Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Oliver) is the correct one. It does not 
     <lb/>
     seem to me that there was any calculation 
     <lb/>
     made at all, and that all the specious putting 
     <lb/>out of quantities of land and the estimating <lb/>
 
<cb/>
     <fw type="num">5492</fw>
          

     of prices simply have no significance at all 
     <lb/>
     except that you want to have a sufficient 
     <lb/>
     number of acres of land to multiply by $1.50 
     <lb/>
     to make up the sum that you have come to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion you would give to each of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces for its government—$37,500,000. If 
     <lb/>
     so, why should you bring in the land at all ? 
     <lb/>
     The land evidently had nothing in the world 
     <lb/>
     to do with it. What the government were 
     <lb/>
     evidently looking at was this : What is the 
     <lb/>
     amount that we should reasonably give to 
     <lb/>
     each of these provinces to enable it to carry 
     <lb/>
     on its financial affairs; $37,500,000. You 
     <lb/>
     gave that. You have denied that they should 
     <lb/>
     have their lands. You say the lands should 
     <lb/>
     belong to the Dominion government. They 
     <lb/>
     do anyway. You say that the provinces as 
     <lb/>
     formed shall not have any rights at all over 
     <lb/>
     their lands: You deny any right or title 
     <lb/>
     at the present time to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest in these lands which may be all 
     <lb/>
     right and you deny any right to their lands 
     <lb/>
     after they are formed into provinces, when 
     <lb/>
     as provinces they, I think, ought to have 
     <lb/>
     their lands and the management thereof, 
     <lb/>
     for various reasons. But, you deny both 
     <lb/>
     of these premises. Then. why do you make 
     <lb/>
     the specious pretense of having anything to 
     <lb/>
     do with lands at all? Why do you not 
     <lb/>
     simply make your resolution read in this 
     <lb/>
     way: That the Dominion government does 
     <lb/>
     not propose to give over to these provinces 
     <lb/>
     their lands, and yet, recognizing that they 
     <lb/>
     must have money to carry on their public 
     <lb/>
     works, you give them the amount of $37,500,<lb break="no"/>000 to be paid in a certain way. That would 
     <lb/>
     be a fair, open, clear exposition of the real 
     <lb/>
     facts which the hon. Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Oliver) has inadvertently let out. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of the Interior, being young, 
     <lb/>
     is less wily and less skilled in the arts of 
     <lb/>
     concealment than his older colleagues. I 
     <lb/>
     sincerely trust that his virgin modesty and 
     <lb/>
     openness will always remain the same, and 
     <lb/>
     that he will be a shining example of a min<lb break="no"/>ister who is frank and outspoken, who will 
     <lb/>
     call a spade a spade, and who, when he 
     <lb/>
     makes a resolution to give money for any 
     <lb/>
     purpose, will not attribute it to some re<lb break="no"/>fined method of calculation as to the quan<lb break="no"/>tity of land and the present and prospective 
     <lb/>
     value of land, but will just simply say in his 
     <lb/>
     resolution, as he says before the committee, 
     <lb/>
     that he proposes to give these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     $37,500,000 each. This other is all subter<lb break="no"/>fuge and a specious application of the wily 
     <lb/>
     arts of the politician to lull the sentiments 
     <lb/>
     and probably the rightful sentiments of the 
     <lb/>
     people in the Northwest. The hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior has been good enough to say 
     <lb/>
     that we should have the information. I 
     <lb/>
     would like to know the quantity of lands 
     <lb/>
     there is in each of these provinces that are 
     <lb/>
     considered to be arable lands, the acreage 
     <lb/>
     that is considered to be grazing lands and 
     <lb/>
     the area that is put in the category of 
     <lb/>
     mineral lands. I suppose there are certain 
     <lb/>
     portions of these lands, of which you already 
     <lb/>
                    have made surveys and in regard to which 
    

            <pb n="5493" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-08_Page_5493.jpg"/>
        

     <fw type="num">5493</fw>                     <fw type="dateline">MAY 8, 1905</fw>        


     you have information, that are put down 
     <lb/>
     as mineral areas and which are more or less 
     <lb/>
     large. Then there will be outside of that 
     <lb/>
     some timber areas, and I would like to 
     <lb/>
     know what amount there will be out<lb break="no"/>side of the agricultural, grazing, min<lb break="no"/>eral, and timber areas which would 
     <lb/>
     probably go as waste lands which could not 
     <lb/>
     be counted on at the present time and may 
     <lb/>
     not be counted upon as much in the future. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. Minister of the Interior must have 
     <lb/>
     that information, of course, and if we had 
     <lb/>
     these areas we would be able to tell a little 
     <lb/>
     better in reference to this resolution, so 
     <lb/>
     long as it has been put upon the ground of 
     <lb/>
     compensation for these lands, if a fair divi<lb break="no"/>sion has been made with the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     I dare say the hon. Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     has that information now. If he has I 
     <lb/>
     would be very much obliged if he would give 
     <lb/>
     us that information before we take up the 
     <lb/>
     clauses of the Bill. We will get as much 
     <lb/>
     as we can while we are going through the 
     <lb/>
     resolution, and I have no doubt that will 
     <lb/>
     leave a large surplus of information to be 
     <lb/>
     brought down when we come to take up the 
     <lb/>
    clauses after the resolutions have been 
     <lb/>passed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I think perhaps the hon. 
     <lb/>member (Mr. Foster) might have saved him<lb break="no"/>self a good deal of argument if he had been 
     <lb/>in a little sooner. There is no question be<lb break="no"/>fore the committee of calculation in regard 
     <lb/>to the land at all. The clause to which the 
     <lb/>hon. member objects my hon. friend the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance has proposed to amend so 
     <lb/>that that question does not arise. I do not 
     <lb/>know whether the purpose was to avoid such 
     <lb/>trouble as that which has come to the mind 
     <lb/>of the hon. member, but whatever trouble 
     <lb/>there may be attaching to the Bill, it does not 
     <lb/>attach in any way such as he suggests after 
     <lb/>the amendment proposed by my hon. friend 
     <lb/>the Minister of Finance has been made. In 
     <lb/>regard to the specific question the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber has asked as to the amount of grazing, 
     <lb/>timber. mineral, agricultural and waste land. 
     <lb/>1 do not know exactly the basis upon which 
     <lb/>he asks that question. If the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>were very well acquainted with the condi<lb break="no"/>tions in the Northwest Territories, he would 
     <lb/>know that it is entirely a matter of opinion 
     <lb/>as to whether land is purely grazing land, or 
     <lb/>purely grain growing land. or purely timber 
     <lb/>land, or purely mineral land. These are all 
     <lb/>questions which are decided ultimately by 
     <lb/>experience, and in the meantime they can he 
     <lb/>only matters of opinion. No white man has 
     <lb/>ever explored a great part of that country, 
     <lb/>and so it would be impossible to give the 
     <lb/>definite information which the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man asks. As to the part of the country 
     <lb/>which has been explored I can bring ten dif<lb break="no"/>ferent men to give ten different opinions as 
     <lb/>to whether a certain piece of land is purely 
     <lb/>grazing land or purely agricultural land. 
     <lb/>Some of the timber speculators in this city 
     <lb/>and vicinity can bear testimony to the fact 
     <lb/>that land which they paid their good money 
  

      
<cb/>
     <fw type="num">5494</fw>

     for as timber land is not timber land at all, 
     <lb/>
     and the same may be said with regard to 
     <lb/>
     mineral speculators. If the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     means that he will prevent the Bill passing 
     <lb/>
     until definite information is given him on 
     <lb/>
     this point, it simply means that the Bill will 
     <lb/>
     not be permitted to pass at all, because it 
     <lb/>
     would be impossible to give such informa<lb break="no"/>tion. If he will be satisfied with a fair esti<lb break="no"/>mate made by the officers of the department 
     <lb/>
     he can have that estimate at the earliest pos<lb break="no"/>sible date. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. We all know that until a 
     <lb/>
     man has exploited a certain area of land he 
     <lb/>
     does not know what it is best suited for, 
     <lb/>
     and that no information with regard to such 
     <lb/>
     a matter can be absolutely accurate. What 
     <lb/>
     I wanted was an approximate estimate, and 
     <lb/>
     in looking through the papers I find that the 
     <lb/>
     Surveyor General has given an estimate of 
     <lb/>
     the lands suitable for grain growing, the 
     <lb/>
     lands suitable for grain growing after irri<lb break="no"/>gation, and the lands suitable for ranches 
     <lb/>
     or other description of farming, so that in 
     <lb/>
     reality there is a pretty fair idea given as to 
     <lb/>
     the information I wanted. The only thing 
     <lb/>
     that is not given is the area of waste lands, 
     <lb/>
     and that I suppose can be ascertained by 
     <lb/>
     deducting the areas mentioned here and the 
     <lb/>
     area of water from the total area.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Does that estimate include 
     <lb/>
     the organized districts of Alberta, Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan and Assiniboia, or does it also include 
     <lb/>
     the district of Athabaska which is now in<lb break="no"/>cluded in the provinces of Saskatchewan

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. This discussion 
     <lb/>
    indicates that the time has come for a better 
     <lb/>system of book-keeping in reference to the 
     <lb/>public lands of the Dominion. When one 
     <lb/>comes into a rich heritage the first thing he 
     <lb/>does is to take stock, and it is high time that 
     <lb/>the Dominion of Canada should take 
     <lb/>stock of the actual land it has in the 
     <lb/>Northwest, with its possibility value 
     <lb/>and its possibility for utilitarian pur<lb break="no"/>poses. In that way we will gradually collect 
     <lb/>a lot of useful information, and the time has 
     <lb/>come when no alienation of public land 
     <lb/>should take place and no grant should be 
     <lb/>made to any one without our knowing what 
     <lb/>we are giving away. The province of On<lb break="no"/>tario has alienated its Crown timber lands 
     <lb/>without keeping any account, so that now 
     <lb/>they do not know what the residuum is, 
     <lb/>they speak of it as wilderness and all that, 
     <lb/>but they should have an exact account kept 
     <lb/>of it in the provincial legislatures just as 
     <lb/>the Dominion legislatures should have an 
     <lb/>accurate account of the lands we own in the 
     <lb/>Northwest. I would suggest to the new Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior that he should take steps 
     <lb/>to have a reliable system of book-keeping 
     <lb/>instituted in this respect. I would like to 
     <lb/>ask the hon. gentleman, whether all the 
     <lb/>patents have yet been issued to the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Pacific Railway for their land grant ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I have been only a day or 
     <lb/>
     two in the department but I have made in<lb break="no"/>quiries on this matter, and I will be able to 
     <lb/>
     answer the question in a few days. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. The patents have not all 
     <lb/>
     been issued. There is a large amount of 
     <lb/>
     the land that has been selected by the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Pacific Railway scheduled to them, 
     <lb/>
     but the land is not yet surveyed and the 
     <lb/>
     patents are issued just as quickly as the 
     <lb/>
     land is surveyed and the patents approved. 
     <lb/>
     In the meantime they have selected the land. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. McCARTHY</persName>. It is unnecessary 
     <lb/>
     to say at this stage of the discussion that 
     <lb/>
     we on this side of the House are very much 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the Dominion government ob<lb break="no"/>taining the lands in the new provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     wish to point out that the returns do not 
     <lb/>
     appear to have been brought down in such 
     <lb/>
     shape that one can possibly arrive at a con<lb break="no"/>clusion as to the basis on which the govern<lb break="no"/>ment have proceeded. In the returns that 
     <lb/>
     were brought down the respective areas 
     <lb/>
     were given of the districts of Saskatchewan, 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia and Alberta. but nothing was 
     <lb/>
     said of Athabasca, which is to be taken into 
     <lb/>
     the new province. It is almost impossible 
     <lb/>
     to figure from these returns just what the 
     <lb/>
     area is of the respective provinces. I have 
     <lb/>
     been attempting to do that, and I arrive at 
     <lb/>
     these figures, that there are in the proposed 
     <lb/>
     province of Alberta 249,000 square miles, 
     <lb/>
     and in the proposed province of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5496</fw>
         

     wan, 258,400 square miles. In the province 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta we practically have 159,000,000 
     <lb/>
     or 160,000,000 acres. Why, then, are these 
     <lb/>
     calculations to be made on the basis of only 
     <lb/>
     25,000,000 acres ? No reasonable explana<lb break="no"/>tion has. I think, been given of that, and yet 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. the First Minister tells us 
     <lb/>
     that there is no waste land in Alberta or, 
     <lb/>
     practically speaking, in Saskatchewan either. 
     <lb/>
     Why, then, should the estimate be made on 
     <lb/>
    only 25,000,000 acres, when we have in 
     <lb/>Alberta alone, practically speaking, 100,<lb break="no"/>000,000 acres? From the return it is im<lb break="no"/>possible for us to find out how much land 
     <lb/>has been alienated from the province of 
     <lb/>Alberta. This return shows the number of 
     <lb/>acres alienated within the districts of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan and Assiniboia, but it does not 
     <lb/>tell us what proportion of this has been 
     <lb/>taken out of the province of Alberta or the 
     <lb/>province of Saskatchewan, and it is practi<lb break="no"/>cally impossible for any man to work out 
     <lb/>any calculation without having this infor<lb break="no"/>mation before the House. With regard to 
     <lb/>the question asked by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>North Toronto (Mr. Foster), a number of 
     <lb/>reports have been made as to that country 
     <lb/>by different surveyors, which would furnish 
     <lb/>very valuable information to have before 
     <lb/>the House while this discussion is in pro<lb break="no"/>gress. But what I object to particularly is 
     <lb/>the attempt to withhold these lands from the 
     <lb/>new provinces ; and then, if they are to be 
     <lb/>withheld, we desire to know what compen<lb break="no"/>sation is to be given to the new provinces 
     <lb/>for them. I have been endeavouring to 
     <lb/>figure out just what was allowed to the 
     <lb/>province of British Columbia for the 20-mile 
     <lb/>strip on either side of the Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>Railway track, which was alienated for 
     <lb/>railway purposes by the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and, according to my figures, I find 
     <lb/>that there is annually paid to the province 
     <lb/>of British Columbia the sum of $100,000 for 
     <lb/>lands that were handed over to the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Pacific Railway. Estimating the area 
     <lb/>of that 20-mile strip on either side of the 
     <lb/>Canadian Pacific Railway track, we find that 
     <lb/>this $100,000 is paid to the province of Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Columbia for practically only 13,000,000 
     <lb/>acres, whereas, in the new provinces, we are 
     <lb/>not getting one-quarter the compensation, 
     <lb/>and even when our population is doubled 
     <lb/>we do not get one-half. What I desire to point 
     <lb/>out is that the land in the province of Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Columbia is land taken along the rail<lb break="no"/>way track, a great part of it in country 
     <lb/>which is practically worthless, and yet a 
     <lb/>much more liberal allowance is made to the 
     <lb/>province of British Columbia for that land 
     <lb/>which was taken away from it than is being 
     <lb/>made by the present administration for 
     <lb/>land that is just as much taken away from 
     <lb/>the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. 
     <lb/>I find that these figures for the area of this 
     <lb/>land in British Columbia work out as fol<lb break="no"/>lows. taking the line as straight between 
     <lb/>  the different points: Stephen to Beaver foot. 
     <lb/>22 miles; Beaver foot to Beaver mouth, 42

     <lb/>
     Lytton to. Hope, 62 miles; Hope to Port 
     <lb/>
     Moody, 62 miles; total, 437 miles. The 
     <lb/>
     railway mileage from Stephen to Port 
     <lb/>
     Moody is 508 miles. It will be seen that an 
     <lb/>
     error would be incorporated if the railway 
     <lb/>
     mileage was taken to calculate area of belt. 
     <lb/>
     the difference is' owing to crooks in line—
     <lb/>
     71  miles. 437 X 40=17,480 square miles. 
     <lb/>
     When near coast, for 30 miles from Port 
     <lb/>
     Moody, only 10 miles in width can be ob<lb break="no"/>tained to south of line owing to interna<lb break="no"/>tional boundary, a deduction of 300 miles. 
     <lb/>
     Another deduction of 10 per cent must be 
     <lb/>
     made for lands alienated—and it is to be 
     <lb/>
     borne in mind that such alienated lands re<lb break="no"/>present the best of the lot. Making these two 
     <lb/>
     deductions from the total of 17,480, we got 
     <lb/>
     15,462 square miles, and multiplying this by 
     <lb/>
     640 (the number of acres to a square mile) 
     <lb/>
     we get an acreage of 9,895,680, to which we 
     <lb/>
     must add 3,000,000 acres given in Peace 
     <lb/>
     River, making a total of 12,895,680 acres, 
     <lb/>
     or, for convenience, say 13,000,000 acres. 
     <lb/>
     It will be noticed that no deductions are 
     <lb/>
     made for water areas, nor have any been 
     <lb/>
     taken out of area of Alberta, which is 100,<lb break="no"/>000,000 acres. For this 13,000,000 acres in 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia $100,000 was paid annual<lb break="no"/>ly to the provincial government, and this 
     <lb/>
     land is in the Rocky mountain belt. There 
     <lb/>
     is no comparison of the treatment and 
     <lb/>
     there is discrimination against the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Thus, I desire some information 
     <lb/>
     as to why the government should only esti<lb break="no"/>mate the lands in that country at 25,000,000 
     <lb/>
     acres if there are no waste lands, and no 
     <lb/>
     explanation has been given as to that. Un<lb break="no"/>til these figures are brought down and some 
     <lb/>
     information or knowledge given the House 
     <lb/>
     as to how the government arrived at the 
     <lb/>
     amount, it is practically impossible for us 
     <lb/>
     to discuss the matter on an intelligent basis.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY</persName>. In my opinion 
     <lb/>
     it is insufficient. It is not, however, a 
     <lb/>
     question of sufficiency or insufficiency. I 
     <lb/>
     have stated my position in regard to these 
     <lb/>
     lands before in this House. It is not only 
     <lb/>
     the allowance we are getting for the lands: 
     <lb/>
     there are other inconveniences to which we 
     <lb/>
     are subjected by reason of the determin<lb break="no"/>ation of the Dominion administration to 
     <lb/>
     retain the lands. I have, however. gone 
     <lb/>
     over that ground fully before and I do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to do so again. But I will say 
     <lb/>
     that the chief of these inconveniences is 
     <lb/>
     the distance which we are from the seat of 
     <lb/>

     government. The hon. gentleman may
     <lb/>
     not know it, but we cannot amend even 
     <lb/>
     our Mechanics Lien Act or any Act dealing 
     <lb/>
     with lands at all without coming down to 
     <lb/>
     this parliament. Another objection is the 
     <lb/>
     small representation we have in parliament 
     <lb/>
     at present. We have only ten members 
     <lb/>
     here from that country to-day, whereas if 
     <lb/>
     the lands were left in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     local administration we would have fifty 
     <lb/>
     members looking after the administration 
     <lb/>
     of those lands for the benefit of the people. 
     <lb/>
     Another objection is we may have, by the 
     <lb/>
     retention of these lands here, a check on 
     <lb/>
     local enterprises. What is there to be 
     <lb/>
     gained by these provinces in assisting the 
     <lb/>
     developing of coal mines for instance, 
     <lb/>
     which is only one instance. There is no in<lb break="no"/>ducement for them to assist or encourage 
     <lb/>
     any local development. But as I have al<lb break="no"/>ready fully stated my views, I do not pro<lb break="no"/>pose to detain the House discussing them 
     <lb/>
     again. Let me say that the action by this 
     <lb/>
     government is contrary to the principles 
     <lb/>
     they have hitherto preached. It is contrary 
     <lb/>
     to their policy of decentralization. As Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Blake says, it is overturning the principles 
     <lb/>
     of the union; and as Mr. Mackenzie said, 
     <lb/>
     the very year the release was taken from 
     <lb/>
     the Hudson Bay Company, no person will 
     <lb/>
     pretend that after we have a government 
     <lb/>
     in these Territories, we will continue to 
     <lb/>
     administer these lands from Ottawa. That 
     <lb/>
     is the position I take.

     any suggestion to my hon. friend as to the

     line of argument he should take; but it 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that if he thinks the sums al<lb break="no"/>lowed are not sufficient for the requirements 
     <lb/>
     of the new provincial governments, he should 
     <lb/>
     confine his argument along that line, be<lb break="no"/>cause the amendment eliminates the whole

     question of acres and dollars and so forth 
     <lb/>

     provincial governments.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I presume that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. M. S. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) is looking at the basis on which 
     <lb/>
     this legislation was introduced in the first 
     <lb/>
     instance. That basis is this. Inasmuch as 
     <lb/>
     the public lands in the said provinces are 
     <lb/>
     to remain the property of Canada, there 
     <lb/>
     shall be paid by Canada to the said pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, by way of compensation therefor, 
     <lb/>
     a sum based on the estimated value of such 
     <lb/>
     lands. That is very simple and plain. 
     <lb/>
     Then it goes on to state what that sum 
     <lb/>
     is. My hon. friend from Calgary is argu<lb break="no"/>ing that that sum is not a fair value, if 
     <lb/>
     you take the lands as a basis; and not<lb break="no"/>withstanding the statement of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior (Mr. Oliver), I have not yet 
     <lb/>
     heard from the Prime Minister any annun<lb break="no"/>ciation of policy different from that con<lb break="no"/>

     tained in the resolution as at first intro<lb break="no"/>duced. It is true that the wording of the 
     <lb/>
     resolution has been amended in order to 
     <lb/>
     meet the difficulty suggested by the ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton). But the 
     <lb/>
     basis upon which the government proposes 
     <lb/>
     to proceed has not yet been departed from, 
     <lb/>
     so far as I understand. Well, then we might 
     <lb/>
     look at the condition. as outlined by a very 
     <lb/>
     important member of the government at 
     <lb/>
     that time, the ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton), in 1903. What is the basis 
     <lb/>
     the government has laid down? The 
     <lb/>
     basis is that we are to pay to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces annually, by way of compensation 
     <lb/>
     therefor, a sum based upon the estimated 
     <lb/>
     value of the lands. I suppose that that is in 
     <lb/>
     line with the position taken by members 
     <lb/>
     from the Northwest, for example, my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott), who 
     <lb/>
     no doubt has urged on the government the 
     <lb/>
     view he announced some two years ago in 
     <lb/>
     these words : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The people of the Northwest Territories con<lb break="no"/>tend that the public lands of those Territories 
     <lb/>
     are now simply held in trust by parliament

     friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) 
     <lb/>
     would not be supporting it. Therefore we

     must get at the value of the lands for

     which we are proposing to compensate 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces, in the words of the

     <lb/>
     was important to show that these lands 
     <lb/>
     were so valuable that the country had a 
     <lb/>
     very great means of revenue in them. the 
     <lb/>
     government, through its then Minister of

     <lb/>
     settled. I am pleased to say that as a result of 
     <lb/>
     this, an enormous quantity of odd numbered 
     <lb/>
     sections will come back to the government and 
     <lb/>
     be available for disposition in any way which 
     <lb/>
     the government may be authorized by parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to adopt. We shall no doubt have in the 
     <lb/>
     neighbourhood of fifty million acres of odd 
     <lb/>
     numbered sections to dispose of in such man<lb break="no"/>ner as parliament may authorize.

     That is to say, we will hold in trust for 
     <lb/>
     the people of the new provinces, as my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Scott) put it. not only fifty million acres 
     <lb/>
     of odd numbered sections. but also fifty 
     <lb/>
     million acres of even numbered sections 
     <lb/>
     which must be reserved for homestead in<lb break="no"/>terests. The ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton) then continued:

     Of these fifty million of acres of odd numbered

     twenty-five million at present so far removed

     Well, if the government is holding these 
     <lb/>
     lands as trustees for the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, even if they do not 
     <lb/>
     hand them over to those for whom they 
     <lb/>
     are holding them in trust. what is the posi<lb break="no"/>tion? They themselves admit by the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the first resolution, that they are making. 
     <lb/>
     compensation by this provision to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Territories. Do they base that 
     <lb/>
     compensation on the valuation of $60,000,000 
     <lb/>
     or $75,000,000? The ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior (Mr. Sifton) desired to keep within 
     <lb/>
     bounds, and according to one of his esti<lb break="no"/>mates it would be $60.000.000. and accord<lb break="no"/>ing to another estimate, which 1 have just 
     <lb/>
     it would be $75,000,000 which these
     <lb/>
     lands will be worth in ten years. Upon 
     <lb/>
     what basis do the government propose com<lb break="no"/>pensation? Upon the basis of twenty-five 
     <lb/>
     million acres? The ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior (Mr. Sifton) said those lands would 
     <lb/>
     be worth $3 per acre in ten years or $75,<lb break="no"/>000,000. But the government propose to 
     <lb/>
     compensate the Territories, not on the basis 
     <lb/>
     of $3 per acre. but $1.50 per acre. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And I venture to think that there is every 
     <lb/>
     reason indeed for the criticism of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) and my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. M. S. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy). What is the position of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment? Do they recognize that they 
     <lb/>
     stand in any way in the position of trustee 
     <lb/>
     for the people of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     in respect of these lands ? My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Western Assiniboia cannot support 
     <lb/>
     them unless they take that view. That 
     <lb/>
     was his solemn declaration, made, I am 
     <lb/>
     sure not once, but many times, and 
     <lb/>
     certainly made in parliament. Well, they 
     <lb/>
     apparently carry out that view by provid<lb break="no"/>ing that there shall be compensation. But 
     <lb/>
     when they compensate the provinces for 
     <lb/>
     the lands, they compensate them on the 
     <lb/>
     basis of fifty cents on the dollar. What 
     <lb/>
     justification has the government for that ? 
     <lb/>
     It does not make any difference Whether 
     <lb/>
     it is enough for the requirements of the

     Northwest Territories or not, it the basis 
     <lb/>
     which I have just suggested, is the one 
     <lb/>
     on which the government is proceeding. 
     <lb/>
     And, if the government is proceeding on 
     <lb/>
     any other basis, we would like to know it. 
     <lb/>
     They have not suggested any other basis, 
     <lb/>
     except that my hon. friend the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) declares that it 
     <lb/>
     is only a question of what the Territories 
     <lb/>
     require. But the government, by their reso<lb break="no"/>lution, declare that it is only a question of 
     <lb/>
     doing justice to the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     in respect of lands which we hold as trustees 
     <lb/>
     for them. And, notwithstanding the declar<lb break="no"/>ation of the Minister of the Interior, we 
     <lb/>
     shall hold them to that until we have some 
     <lb/>
     announcement from the Prime Minister (Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid Laurier) to the contrary. Here 
     <lb/>
     is a declaration on the part of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment that we should compensate them for 
     <lb/>
     these lands on the basis of $37,500,000 
     <lb/>
     for each province, or $75,000,000 in all. 
     <lb/>
     What possible justification is there for de<lb break="no"/>parting from the figures that were given 
     <lb/>
     by the Minister of the Interior, when as 
     <lb/>
     we must suppose; he was endeavouring 
     <lb/>
     to place before the House and the country 
     <lb/>
     the fair value of these lands, a fair estimate 
     <lb/>
     of the number of acres and also a fair 
     <lb/>
     statement of the resources this country as 
     <lb/>
     a whole possessed for the purpose men<lb break="no"/>tioned in these lands ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I think that the argu<lb break="no"/>ment of the hon. leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. R. L. Borden) is somewhat defective 
     <lb/>
     so far as touching the particular point he 
     <lb/>
     speaks of is concerned. He spoke of the 
     <lb/>
     value of these lands ten years hence. If 
     <lb/>
     they become more valuable than now, it 
     <lb/>
     will largely be because of the large expen<lb break="no"/>diture by this government, and it would 
     <lb/>
     not be right to compensate the provinces— 
     <lb/>
     it compensate is the word to be used, though 
     <lb/>
     I do not admit that it is in view of this 
     <lb/>
     amendment—that compensation should not 
     <lb/>
     be on the value ten years hence, when 
     <lb/>
     that value will be to a large extent the 
     <lb/>
     result of the expenditure of money by the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Dominion. I think the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman will see that his argument does 
     <lb/>
     not reach the conclusion to which he has 
     <lb/>
     pointed.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. To what expen<lb break="no"/>diture does the hon. minister refer?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. Expenditure in the con<lb break="no"/>struction of railways, for instance; and 
     <lb/>
     the vast sums of money which we are

     expending, and will continue to expend, 
     <lb/>
     on immigration; and all the various ex<lb break="no"/>penditures which will flow from the nation<lb break="no"/>al treasury to the benefit of that Terri<lb break="no"/>tory, and which, owing to the nature of 
     <lb/>
     the country, must be on a liberal scale. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I have never un<lb break="no"/>derstood that the National Transcontinental 
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5502</fw>
         

     Railway was to be built solely for the 
     <lb/>
     purposes of the Northwest Territories. On. 
     <lb/>
     the contrary I have understood the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of the government and its support<lb break="no"/>ers to be that this railway was to promote 
     <lb/>
     the general interest of Canada, the eastern 
     <lb/>
     provinces as well as the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. Therefore, I cannot see any very 
     <lb/>
     good reason for charging the whole of 
     <lb/>
     that expenditure against the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. That does not seem to me 
     <lb/>
     a fair basis. So far as the value of the 
     <lb/>
     land is concerned, it is true that the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior says that in ten 
     <lb/>
     years these lands will be worth $3 per 
     <lb/>
     acre. But he does not venture to say that 
     <lb/>
     they are not worth more than $1.50 per 
     <lb/>
     acre at present. And the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Fielding) will notice by the terms of 
     <lb/>
     the resolution that the value upon which 
     <lb/>
     we are to pay the Territories in ten years 
     <lb/>
     from this time is not raised to $3 per acre, 
     <lb/>
     but remains for all time at $1.50 per acre 
     <lb/>
     on 25,000,000 acres. According to the for<lb break="no"/>mer view of my hon. friend from Western 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia—and it seems very much borne 
     <lb/>
     out by the terms of the resolution—it is not 
     <lb/>
     so much a matter of compensating the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest for the lands as en<lb break="no"/>deavouring to do simple justice to them in 
     <lb/>
     giving the entire benefit of their lands. At 
     <lb/>
     least, that position ought to be adopted 
     <lb/>
     if the government accedes to the view 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. gentleman put forward 
     <lb/>
     at the time. It might be provided 
     <lb/>
     that, for the first ten years, an advance 
     <lb/>
     would be made to those for whom we 
     <lb/>
     hold these lands in trust. But the mere 
     <lb/>
     fact that you are only making an advance 
     <lb/>
     for ten years is no reason, in my judg<lb break="no"/>ment why you should not do full justice to 
     <lb/>
     them at some future time. With their in<lb break="no"/>creased population and their increased nec<lb break="no"/>essities we should certainly bring the value 
     <lb/>
     of the land up to the figure which the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior himself has sug<lb break="no"/>gested. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. It is my opinion that the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions before the House do substantially 
     <lb/>
     meet the views I expressed four years ago, 
     <lb/>
     and three years, and two years ago. Even 
     <lb/>
     if that were not the case, even if the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman's interpretation were the one to 
     <lb/>
     be accepted, in his statement that it must 
     <lb/>
     then be impossible for me to accept the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions, he is setting up a standard for 
     <lb/>
     me which he does not allow to govern him<lb break="no"/>self on all occasions. If I recollect aright, 
     <lb/>
     on the 22nd of March last, he put on the 
     <lb/>
     record in parliament in the form of a re<lb break="no"/>solution, his view that full autonomy should 
     <lb/>
     be granted to the Northwest Territories— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>- full autonomy with regard 
     <lb/>
     to scllools and also with regard to lands.

     But in less than an hour from that time,   
     <lb/>
     he suggested that the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories should be asked to relin<lb break="no"/>quish a measure of autonomy with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the lands, that they should accept the 
     <lb/>
     lands with a string to them, the string 
     <lb/>
     suggested being that they should accept 
     <lb/>
     responsibility for the administration of the 
     <lb/>
     lands, but they were to give away the even 
     <lb/>
     numbered sections as free homesteads, and 
     <lb/>
     to continue to sell the odd numbered sec<lb break="no"/>tions according to the policy which is in 
     <lb/>
     force at the present time or that which 
     <lb/>
     was foreshadowed by the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior in his speech on the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
     Pacific Bill a couple of years ago. Let me 
     <lb/>
     say to my hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     M. S. McCarthy) who made a comparison 
     <lb/>
     with British Columbia, that if we allow 
     <lb/>
     ourselves to drift into comparisons of de<lb break="no"/>tails with respect to the several provinces, 
     <lb/>
     we shall find between every province in 
     <lb/>
     Canada just as acute differences as he 
     <lb/>
     finds between the way British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     was treated with regard to a strip along 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway and the way 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces are being treated in 
     <lb/>
     regard to their lands. In fact, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman overlooked the most striking case 
     <lb/>
     of all, that of Prince Edward Island. That 
     <lb/>
     province is allowed $45,000 a year, as I 
     <lb/>
     understand, not exactly in lieu of lands, 
     <lb/>
     but on account of the fact that she had not 
     <lb/>
     any lands. Now see what scope there is in 
     <lb/>
     that citation for the purpose of comparison. 
     <lb/>
     Take the case of Manitoba. I recollect read<lb break="no"/>ing a statement made by the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Manitoba a couple of weeks ago, in 
     <lb/>
     which he pointed out that the maximum 
     <lb/>
     revenue provided under the arrangement 
     <lb/>
     made by a Conservative government of 
     <lb/>
     this Dominion with that province, would be 
     <lb/>
     $648,000, that would be the maximum re<lb break="no"/>venue they would receive under the existing 
     <lb/>
     arrangement when that province reached 
     <lb/>
     the maximum population provided for. He 
     <lb/>
     then pointed out, with every appearance of 
     <lb/>
     a deep sense of grievance, that these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces will have a maximum revenue of 
     <lb/>
     $2,207,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Foster), to whom I listened with much inter<lb break="no"/>est this afternoon, was much mistaken in 
     <lb/>
     thinking that these resolutions were agreed 
     <lb/>
     to without serious consideration of the 
     <lb/>
     matter of the lands. The revenues derived 
     <lb/>
     by the other provinces come from the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion treasury in the form of cash subsidies, 
     <lb/>
    and from the amounts which they are able 
     <lb/>to derive by administering, selling and other<lb break="no"/>wise disposing of their public domain. In 
     <lb/>considering the provisions for these new 
     <lb/>provinces, attention was naturally given to 
     <lb/>these two aspects of the case, we en<lb break="no"/>deavoured to reach the proper amounts 
     <lb/>of ordinary cash subsidies by looking at 
     <lb/>the amounts the other provinces receive. 
     <lb/>Then we endeavoured to arrive at what 
     <lb/>would be a proper amount to allow the<lb/>
      

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5504</fw>
         

     new provinces in consideration of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that they are not going to have in their 
     <lb/>
     actual possession the source of revenue 
     <lb/>
     which the other provinces except Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     have in their possession, that is to say, the 
     <lb/>
     public domain. Of course there were two 
     <lb/>
     points of view, there was the federal point 
     <lb/>
     of view and the point of view of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the new provinces. Now let me say to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Toronto and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Lanark (Mr. Haggart), or 
     <lb/>
     to any one else who may think that too much 
     <lb/>
     money is being granted by these resolutions 
     <lb/>
     to the new provinces, that they may set their 
     <lb/>
     minds at rest in that regard. While we have 
     <lb/>
     not perhaps the actual measurement in acres 
     <lb/>
     of the quantity of land, while perhaps we 
     <lb/>
     are not able to arrive at an absolute esti<lb break="no"/>mate of the value of these lands, I think no 
     <lb/>
     person has any doubt about the fact that we 
     <lb/>
     have an enormous public domain out there, 
     <lb/>
     and that if a private corporation had that 
     <lb/>
     domain in its possession and treated it en<lb break="no"/>tirely from the point of view of revenue, 
     <lb/>
     they would consider it worth a great deal 
     <lb/>
     more than the $75.000,000 which is specified 
     <lb/>
     in these resolutions for both provinces. If 
     <lb/>
     this government decided to treat that public 
     <lb/>
     domain strictly from the point of view of 
     <lb/>
     revenue, I venture to think they would be 
     <lb/>
     able to dispose of it for a considerably larger 
     <lb/>
     amount than $75,000,000. Even if we knew 
     <lb/>
     the exact number of acres of wheat lands, 
     <lb/>
     the exact number of acres of grazing lands, 
     <lb/>
     the exact area of timber lands, and of 
     <lb/>
     mineral lands, we could not be much 
     <lb/>
     further ahead than we are at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time. I do not suppose there are 
     <lb/>
     any two individuals who would agree 
     <lb/>
     as to the value to be put upon this enormous 
     <lb/>
     public domain. I might say, as the ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior said with regard to these 
     <lb/>
     50,000,000 acres, that in a short time they 
     <lb/>
     may bring $3 an acre. Probably he was 
     <lb/>
     right. Or I might be disposed to think 
     <lb/>
     that they may be worth even $5 an acre; 
     <lb/>
     and by stretching the time a little, that in 
     <lb/>
     twenty-five or thirty years hence, if some of 
     <lb/>
     these lands still remain in possession of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government, they may be worth 
     <lb/>
     $30, $40 or $50 an acre. As I say, it is im<lb break="no"/>possible to agree upon an estimate with re<lb break="no"/>gard to their value. When we were in con<lb break="no"/>sultation about this matter we had the ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of the presence with us of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman from East Assiniboia (Mr. Tur<lb break="no"/>riff) who until recently was the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Dominion Lands; and I suppose 
     <lb/>
     he has as much information about that 
     <lb/>
     public domain as any one else in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     He told his colleagues, and the members of 
     <lb/>
     the government who were in consultation, 
     <lb/>
     that there were, to the best of his knowledge, 
     <lb/>
     or that there would be, available from time 
     <lb/>
     to time, in addition to the even numbered 
     <lb/>
     sections which are set apart for free home<lb break="no"/>steads, in the neighbourhood of 50,000,000 
     <lb/>
     acres of odd numbered sections available [or 
     <lb/>
     sale. Some members of the government 


            <pb n="5505" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-08_Page_5505.jpg"/>
          

     <fw type="num">5505</fw>               <fw type="dateline">MAY 8, 1905</fw>          
  

    pointed out that against that calculation it 
     <lb/>must be remembered that the homestead 
     <lb/>lands had to be administered, and that their 
     <lb/>administration cost a considerable amount 
     <lb/>from year to year, and that even if $3 an 
     <lb/>acre was considered a fair value for the 
     <lb/>50,000,000 acres, the cost of administration 
     <lb/>of those lands also ought to be deducted. It 
     <lb/>may be pointed out too,—I think it was 
     <lb/>pointed out once or twice, that there was 
     <lb/>a tacit understanding that the Dominion 
     <lb/>government was going to continue the 
     <lb/>mounted police force in those two new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, which at present means an expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of some hundreds of thousands of dol<lb break="no"/>lars per year. There were occasional allu<lb break="no"/>sions to the fact that it was the intention 
     <lb/>of the government to continue the immigra<lb break="no"/>tion policy, which last year I think cost in 
     <lb/>the neighbourhood of $600,000 or $700,000. 
     <lb/>0n the other hand, we had to remember that 
     <lb/>in addition to these odd numbered sections 
     <lb/>amounting to 50,000,000 acres, there were 
     <lb/>considerable areas of timber lands, consider<lb break="no"/>able areas of valuable coal lands, and per<lb break="no"/>haps some other mineral lands. It was not 
     <lb/>in the mind of any person taking part in 
     <lb/>these consultations that we could arrive at 
     <lb/>any hard and fast understanding of the 
     <lb/>actual value. The idea was to reach an 
     <lb/>approximate value by comparing the con<lb break="no"/>ditions in the other provinces, and keeping 
     <lb/>in mind the revenues derived from the public 
     <lb/>domain by those provinces, and in that way 
     <lb/>arriving at what would be fair amounts in 
     <lb/>the way of land subsidies to pay out to these 
     <lb/> new provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Alluding to the question of values, and 
     <lb/>
     having regard to the statement made this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon by the hon. member for Calgary 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. M. S. McCarthy) end the hon. member

     <fw type="num">5506</fw>
          

     of place for me to recall what I said in 
     <lb/>
     speaking on the second reading of the Bill, 
     <lb/>
     that up to the present time the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada has not reaped any net revenue from 
     <lb/>
     the administration of the public domain in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     Some time ago I asked the Deputy Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior to have a statement prepared 
     <lb/>
     for me in that regard. In my speech of a 
     <lb/>
     few weeks ago I gave a resume of this state<lb break="no"/>ment and if the committee has no objection 
     <lb/>
     I would like the privilege of handing it in 
     <lb/>
     full to the 'Hansard,' as it is long, and 
     <lb/>
     would take me a considerable time to read. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. That is all right.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. I requested a 
     <lb/>
     similar privilege some time ago, and the 
     <lb/>

     figures which he has compelled me to take

     ask the hon. member if he did not advo<lb break="no"/>cate up there for years the retention of

     claim for years that the land belonged to

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Yes, I did in common with

     a very large number of people in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, in common with practi<lb break="no"/>cally all the members of the legislative

     assembly, and I venture to say that to<lb break="no"/>day a very large majority of the members 
     <lb/>
     of the legislative assembly—I speak from 
     <lb/>
     knowledge; I have seen them and they 
     <lb/>
     have told me so themselves, in fact mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the legislative assembly told me 
     <lb/>
     so before last New Year's, before these ne<lb break="no"/>gotiations commenced—hold the same opin<lb break="no"/>ion now that I hold now. Together with 
     <lb/>
     them I have to some extent changed 
     <lb/>
     my mind in that regard, but if my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend will read the statement that I made 
     <lb/>
     in the House three or four years ago he 
     <lb/>
     will find that what I laid particular stress 
     <lb/>
     upon was not so much the plea that the 
     <lb/>
     land should be turned over to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     as the plea that the government should put 
     <lb/>
     these provinces on an even financial plane 
     <lb/>
     with the other provincial governments in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Let me ask my hon. friend where 
     <lb/>
     he thinks the local governments will get 
     <lb/>
     their revenue if they are not given the 
     <lb/>
     amounts that are provided for in lieu 
     <lb/>
     of lands ? If the lands were turned over 
     <lb/>
     to them with the string attached that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. 
     <lb/>
     Borden) proposed in this House, how would 
     <lb/>
     the governments of the provinces get the 
     <lb/>
     moneys necessary to carry on their business?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) has made 
     <lb/>
     that statement three or four times. Surely 
     <lb/>
     he understands the proposal I made. I 
     <lb/>
     have pointed out to him before two or three 
     <lb/>
     times what I said, but still he persists in 
     <lb/>
     repeating what he has twice repeated to<lb break="no"/>day. He has distinctly twice today said 
     <lb/>
     that the only proposal 1 made in regard to 
     <lb/>
     these lands was that they should be handed 
     <lb/>
     over with certain restrictions. Is that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's statement ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I certainly understood the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman to suggest that.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Will the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman answer me fairly? Does he under<lb break="no"/>stand that to be the only proposal or the 
     <lb/>
     first proposal I made ?

     <lb/>on a previous occasion he has sinned in 
     <lb/>common with other members from the 
     <lb/>Northwest in this respect. Why does he 
     <lb/>endeavour to quote me as only making that 
     <lb/>proposal and no other proposal in the first 
     <lb/>instance? It does not seem to me a very 
     <lb/>high type of discussion to degenerate into 
     <lb/>that. I will read to the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>what I said, and I stand by it to-day. I 
     <lb/>said this and I will not go back to the de<lb break="no"/>bate in February; I will only go back as 
     <lb/>far as the debate in March :

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     So far as the control of the lands is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     I adhere to the opinion I before expressed in 
     <lb/>
     this House, that the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, when they are granted provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights, are fully capable of dealing with these 
     <lb/>
     lands, and that they are entitled to the control 
     <lb/>
     of these lands just as much as the people of the 
     <lb/>
     eastern provinces of Canada are entitled to the 
     <lb/>
     control of their provincial domain. I see no
     <lb/>
     distinction. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That is the proposal I made, not only 
     <lb/>
     then, but in February. I went on further; 
     <lb/>
     it had been suggested in the Liberal press 
     <lb/>
     that these lands would be open to land 
     <lb/>
     grabbers in the Territories to a greater ex<lb break="no"/>tent than they would be open to the at<lb break="no"/>tacks of land grabbers here, and I said I 
     <lb/>
     did not think that would be the case. I re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the fact that the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     stated that if these lands were given to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces there might be interference with 
     <lb/>
     the free homesteads and with the present 
     <lb/>
     low price of government lands, and I said 
     <lb/>
     I thought there ought to be no difficulty on 
     <lb/>
     that score, because the people of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories were chiefly interested in the question 
     <lb/>
     of immigration. I continued: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     May I not further suggest that if there was 
     <lb/>
     any danger, and I do not think there is, it 
     <lb/>
     would be the task of good statesmanship to 
     <lb/>
     have inserted, if necessary, a provision in this 
     <lb/>
     Bill with regard to free homesteads and the 
     <lb/>
     price of these lands. and obtain to it the con<lb break="no"/>sent of the people of the Northwest Territories.

            <p>
     I did not agree.with the position of the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, and I said that even if I 
     <lb/>
     did agree with it, then I thought it would 
     <lb/>
     be the task of good statesmanship to do as 
     <lb/>
     I proposed. My own proposition in the first 
     <lb/>
     instance was that these lands should be

     alternative proposal was to transfer the

     maintain the Mounted Police in those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. If we are going to put these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces absolutely in the position of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces, I suppose we could not maintain 
     <lb/>
     the Mounted Police which costs Parliament 
     <lb/>
     about one-half million dollars in the whole 
     <lb/>
     Territories, and which would mean an ex<lb break="no"/>penditure of about one-quarter of a million 
     <lb/>
     for each province—

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. May I interrupt my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend here? There was something said 
     <lb/>
     about the Mounted Police, and as to some 
     <lb/>
     arrangement, which did not appear on the 
     <lb/>
     face of the Bill. Has the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     any announcement to make in that regard ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. There has 
     <lb/>
     been no arrangement made.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I mean as to the 
     <lb/>
     intention of the government.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. We will come 
     <lb/>
    to that when I propose the estimates for the 
     <lb/>
   Northwest Mounted Police. I shall announce 
     <lb/>
 the policy of the government then.

            <p>
       Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I do not ask that 
     <lb/>
     anything should be discussed out of its 
     <lb/>
     turn, but the question of the maintenance 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest Mounted Police is relevant 
     <lb/>
     to the financial features of the Bill, as the 
     <lb/>
      hon. member (Mr. Scott) also seems to think. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. As the Prime Minister has 
     <lb/>
     suggested, we have the announcement with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the Northwest Mounted Police for 
     <lb/>
     the coming year in the estimates already be<lb break="no"/>fore the House. Then there is the question 
     <lb/>
     of immigration. If the lands were entirely 
     <lb/>
     turned over to the provincial governments, 
     <lb/>
     would the leader of the opposition consent to 
     <lb/>
       have this parliament vote $600,000 or $700,<lb break="no"/>000 a year for immigration ? Every one I 
     <lb/>
     have ever heard discuss this matter agreed 
     <lb/>
     that if the lands were transferred to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, the provinces would have to re<lb break="no"/>lieve this parliament to some extent from 
     <lb/>
     the expenditure on immigration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. Every session we 
     <lb/>
     vote money for immigration in the Lake St. 
     <lb/>
     John region, Quebec, and in Manitoba, and 
     <lb/>
     I never heard of any agreement with these 
     <lb/>
     provincial governments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Will the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sam. Hughes) be prepared to state that he 
     <lb/>
     will vote to hand the lands over unrestrict<lb break="no"/>edly to the people of the new provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     then continue to vote for an immigration 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of $600,000 or $700,000 a year ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. I am not in the 
     <lb/>
     witness box. My hon. friend (Mr. Scott) 
     <lb/>
     seems strangely agitated this afternoon in 
     <lb/>
     the absence of the real Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, who is not here, and who apparently 
     <lb/>
     has deputed the would-be Minister of the 
     <lb/>
      Interior to take his job. Let the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Scott) make his speech and we 
     <lb/>
     - will answer it in good time.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>, I hope I am not displaying 
     <lb/>
     any undue agitation, but I do feel, and I have 
     <lb/>
     felt for a long time past, a great interest in 
     <lb/>
     this question. As I say, it with possession 
     <lb/>
     of the lands and without these land sub<lb break="no"/>sidies the provincial governments would be 
     <lb/>
     able to carry on their business without bor<lb break="no"/>rowing money in their early years, I would 
     <lb/>
     have less objection to the land being trans<lb break="no"/>ferred. But I am satisfied, from the calcu<lb break="no"/>lation I have given, that the provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernments would be in very great difficulties, 
     <lb/>
     especially in their early years, if they had 
     <lb/>
     to accept the responsibility of the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of the lands and not have the ready 
     <lb/>
     money from the beginning that is being 
     <lb/>
     provided for in these resolutions. Deduct 
     <lb/>
     the amount that is to be given in lieu of the 
     <lb/>
     lands, place the expense of the Mounted 
     <lb/>
     Police service on these provinces, saddle 
     <lb/>
     them with a part of the expense of the im<lb break="no"/>migration service and, in place of having 
     <lb/>
     one million dollars per year to maintain 
     <lb/>
     schools and build roads and bridges, these 
     <lb/>
     provincial governments would find them<lb break="no"/>selves each with a revenue of less than a 
     <lb/>
     quarter of a million dollars per year.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. The hon. member read a 
     <lb/>
     statement of expenditure on Dominion 
     <lb/>
     lands and amongst others was the expendi<lb break="no"/>ture chargeable to capital account. I hap<lb break="no"/>pen to have the public accounts before me 
     <lb/>
     and I find that the expenditure on capital 
     <lb/>
     account is something over $6,000,000. I 
     <lb/>
     understood the hon. gentleman to state the 
     <lb/>
     amount at something like $9,000,000.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. No, the $9,000,000 will he 
     <lb/>
     the capital and the ordinary together. The 
     <lb/>
     capital expenditure was $6,870,136.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. I wish to supplement my

     list of inquiries by asking also for a state<lb break="no"/>ment of the quantity of alienated land in 
     <lb/>
     each province.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I shall have the inquiry

      made.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY</persName>. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber from Western Assiniboia has thrown 
     <lb/>
     about as much light upon the objections 
     <lb/>
     to handing over the lands to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     as we have had from hon. gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite up to the present time. He fears 
     <lb/>
     that there will be a conflict but does not 
     <lb/>
     the result of their argument lead them to 
     <lb/>
     this that there is an area set apart east of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan in regard to which the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskat<lb break="no"/>chewan are to be heard, as to their res<lb break="no"/>pective claims in that portion of country. 
     <lb/>
     Now then if these lands are given to the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario I assume that that 
     <lb/>
     province will then have the right to ad<lb break="no"/>minister that public domain, but if that 
     <lb/>
     territory goes to the province of Saskat<lb break="no"/>chewan or to the province of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     these provinces will not have the right, 
     <lb/>
     they will have saddled upon them the ad<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5514</fw>
     
ditional expenditure of the administration 
     <lb/>
     of that country, but they will derive no 
     <lb/>
     profit from these lands. If some hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman opposite will explain how there is 
     <lb/>
     going to be any greater conflict by reason 
     <lb/>
     of that land falling into the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Saskatchewan, and more than 
     <lb/>
     there will be if it falls into the hands of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, then perhaps we may place 
     <lb/>
     some faith in the objections they are 
     <lb/>
     raising to this proposition. All we have 
     <lb/>
     heard is that there will be some differences 
     <lb/>
     between the new provinces and the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     administration of the Immigration Depart<lb break="no"/>ment. Will not the same difficulty arise in 
     <lb/>
     the cases of Ontario and Quebec? Are 
     <lb/>
     there not vast areas of lands in the north<lb break="no"/>ern portions of those provinces to be open<lb break="no"/>ed up and settled? Have not statements 
     <lb/>
     been made in this House, for instance, last 
     <lb/>
     session, during the discussion on the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk Pacific Bill by hon. members from 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and from Ontario lauding the great 
     <lb/>
     value of the great asset they had in the 
     <lb/>
     Northern portion of their provinces through 
     <lb/>
     which that railway was to run, and that all 
     <lb/>
     they needed to induce settlement and fill 
     <lb/>
     that land up was the construction of a rail<lb break="no"/>way. Then I ask will there be any greater 
     <lb/>
     conflict in the administration of the Im<lb break="no"/>migration Department between the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada and the government of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and Quebec than between the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada and the new provinces in 
     <lb/>
     the west ? Further than that, from a large 
     <lb/>
     portion of the area part of which is to-day 
     <lb/>
     being created into provinces and which was 
     <lb/>
     acquired by the purchase of the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the Hudson Bay Company has been hand<lb break="no"/>ed over to the province of Quebec. Did 
     <lb/>
     it strike the Minister of the Interior then 
     <lb/>
     that in handing that land over to Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     to administer there would likely be a con<lb break="no"/>flict between the provincial and the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion authorities in carrying out the im<lb break="no"/>migration policy. I say that that objection 
     <lb/>
     does not hold, and I say further that I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe there is a member from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories sitting on that side of the 
     <lb/>
     House who in the west and until he came 
     <lb/>
     to this parliament, did not advocate that 
     <lb/>
     the lands in these provinces belong to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces absolutely and that the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government should administer them. I may 
     <lb/>
     be speaking in error, but if so I am subject 
     <lb/>
     to correction. I know that the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Western Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) has for 
     <lb/>
     years advocated not only on the public 
     <lb/>
     platform, but in his paper the Regina 'Lead<lb break="no"/>er,' that these lands belong to the pro<lb break="no"/>vince and should be administered by the 
     <lb/>
     province. That is the position he took and 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for East Assiniboia (MR. 
     <lb/>
     Turriff) has made a similar statement The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Strathcona (Mr. Talbot) 
     <lb/>
     I think has made similar statements, but 
     <lb/>
     now they come down here to this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and the only reason I have yet heard 
     <lb/>

     advanced by them or any hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     opposite why these lands should not be 
     <lb/>
     handed over is that there would be a con<lb break="no"/>flict with the Dominion Immigration De<lb break="no"/>partment in filling and settling up that 
     <lb/>
     country. I think the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie (Mr. Cash) said that he thought 
     <lb/>
     these lands should be retained by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment here for a few years and then 
     <lb/>
     handed over to the provinces. Why this 
     <lb/>
     delay? Is it because they are in power 
     <lb/>
     and anxious to maintain their power by 
     <lb/>
     means of a political machine or is it be<lb break="no"/>cause the hon. member wants to state to 
     <lb/>
     this country that the people in those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to-day are not fit to exercise the 
     <lb/>
     same measure of self-government that be<lb break="no"/>longs to all the other provinces but one in 
     <lb/>
     this. Dominion ? What were his reasons ? 
     <lb/>
     Why are these lands detained to-day ? The 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) says that 
     <lb/>
     there would likely be a conflict, but I have 
     <lb/>
     pointed out before in this House that when 
     <lb/>
     he was in opposition, when the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     administration was in power, there was no 
     <lb/>
     man in Manitoba who advocated more ef<lb break="no"/>fectually or more often, that the lands of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba should be handed over to that 
     <lb/>
     province than the hon. member for Bran<lb break="no"/>don (Mr. Sifton). Thus, I say, that I think 
     <lb/>
     the people in that country are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     some further explanation as to why these 
     <lb/>
     lands are being withheld than 
     <lb/>
     given by hon. gentlemen opposite. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. The hon. member is mis<lb break="no"/>taken in saying that I advocated handing 
     <lb/>
     over the lands to the provincial government. 
     <lb/>
     Wha t I stated on every occasion was that in 
     <lb/>
     the deal that we should make on provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy, we would either be entitled to 
     <lb/>
     the lands or to a fair compensation for 
     <lb/>
     them, and the reason I am supporting this 
     <lb/>
     Bill and this clause—and supporting it 
     <lb/>
     heartily—is because I consider that we are 
     <lb/>
     getting a compensation in lieu of lands that 
     <lb/>
     is better for the province than handing over 
     <lb/>
     the lands to the province; what we are 
     <lb/>
     getting is a net revenue paid semi-annually 
     <lb/>
     in advance, so that we know exactly what 
     <lb/>
     we get and we get it for all time, and the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government will, as has been 
     <lb/>
     pointed out if they choose to handle these 
     <lb/>
     lands from a revenue point of view, be able 
     <lb/>
     to recoup themselves for the subsidy they 
     <lb/>
     are giving in lieu of lands. I may say 
     <lb/>
     further that I have had hundreds of let<lb break="no"/>ters from my constituents since the Bills 
     <lb/>
     were introduced. and I have not had one 
     <lb/>
     letter from any gentleman in my own con<lb break="no"/>stituency objecting to the terms in lieu of 
     <lb/>
     lands or suggesting that we should have 
     <lb/>
     the lands instead of a subsidy that it is 
     <lb/>
     proposed to give.

     over these lands. I am quite sure that

     the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding), if

     he had a conference with the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of these provinces, could evolve a fin<lb break="no"/>ancial policy which allow the provinces to

     money for all their requirements. My hon.

     then doing nothing. What is it they have

     <lb/>
     the new provinces. If there was ever a 
     <lb/>
     champion of national schools in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton) was that man. He made his repu<lb break="no"/>tation on that question. He got into this 
     <lb/>
     government on it and expects to achieve 
     <lb/>
     higher honours still. But he has aban<lb break="no"/>doned all he ever said about national schools 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba and has swallowed the mix<lb break="no"/>ture prepared for him without a protest. 1 
     <lb/>
     never saw a more humiliating spectacle in 
     <lb/>
     this House than that presented the other 
     <lb/>
     day in that little duel between the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) and the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton). I do 
     <lb/>
     not know what influence was exerted, but 
     <lb/>
     the spectacle presented was not a satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory one for the country. Neither will the 
     <lb/>
     country be satisfied with the spectacle pre<lb break="no"/>sented to-day by these hon. gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite who for years have been going up 
     <lb/>
     and down the Northwest asking, arguing 
     <lb/>
     that the lands should absolutely belong to 
     <lb/>
     the people of that country. inasmuch as the 
     <lb/>
     provinces were competent to administer 
     <lb/>
     those lands and should be given the same 
     <lb/>
     status as the other provinces. But now

     these same gentlemen say that they were

     not well informed, and that after looking 
     <lb/>
     into the thing they are prepared to accept 
     <lb/>
     a compromise. If that be their view, it is 
     <lb/>
     not the view of the people of the west ; and 
     <lb/>
     when they go back to the people and try 
     <lb/>
     to explain the compromise they have agreed 
     <lb/>
     to on all these questions, they will be 
     <lb/>
     taught the lesson they richly deserve. 
     <lb/>
     Everything, they now say, can be settled 
     <lb/>
     in a spirit of compromise, and they are. 
     <lb/>
     here to make the best possible compromise. 
     <lb/>
     It was not for that purpose they were 
     <lb/>
     elected. They are prepared to do anything 
     <lb/>
     however to save their party. That is their 
     <lb/>
     sole object. But it seems to me that their 
     <lb/>
     object ought rather to be to vindicate their 
     <lb/>
     principles. Every effort they make, how<lb break="no"/>ever, is to keep the Liberal party, by some 
     <lb/>
     means or other, in office, accept the dictates 
     <lb/>
     oi the Liberal chieftain, and compromise 
     <lb/>
     those principles which they used to advo<lb break="no"/>cate so strongly, to which they pledged 
     <lb/>
     themselves on every platform in the west. 
     <lb/>
     and which the people of the west hold so 
     <lb/>
     dearly. They made a pretense of inde<lb break="no"/>pendence, but what did it amount to ? The 
     <lb/>
     ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
     <lb/>
     bolted and out went these hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     from the west behind him. They then 
     <lb/>
     held a little caucus and said: We must 
     <lb/>
     have a change in the School Act. Then 
     <lb/>
     the ex-Minister of the Interior got up and 
     <lb/>
     said he would support what he considered 
     <lb/>
     to be a substantial change.

     <lb/>
     this as an illustration to show how cheaply 
     <lb/>
     these hon. gentlemen hold their principles. 
     <lb/>
     We have never yet been told on what com<lb break="no"/>promise they came back to the fold and 
     <lb/>
     what is the difference between the original 
     <lb/>
     clause and the present one. Yet the com<lb break="no"/>promise has been accepted; and they have 
     <lb/>
     swallowed their medicine, and they are 
     <lb/>
     now striving to look pleasant over it. That 
     <lb/>
     is not a wholesome spectacle to show this 
     <lb/>
     country. Heaven only knows what other 
     <lb/>
     things they will be prepared to sacrifice 
     <lb/>
     before this debate is through. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the west want to control 
     <lb/>
     their own educational affairs and their own 
     <lb/>
     land, and I believe they are quite compe<lb break="no"/>tent to control and administer both. Hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite are on record as having 
     <lb/>
     taken that view in the old days, but it is 
     <lb/>
     not their view to-day; and I trust that the 
     <lb/>
     members from the west will give this 
     <lb/>
     country a better reason for their submission 
     <lb/>
     than any they have so far given. I trust 
     <lb/>
     they will be able to give a better reason 
     <lb/>
     for consenting to have the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     deprived of their right to administer their 
     <lb/>
     own lands than that they do not see any 
     <lb/>
     income from these lands. There is an in<lb break="no"/>come to be derived from them. and it 
     <lb/>
     would be an easy matter for the provinces 
     <lb/>
     to base a system on which they could raise 
     <lb/>
     an income from those lands. Look at our

     friends, the railway contractors. All they 
     <lb/>
     need do to finance these days is to pawn 
     <lb/>
     these lands. Men like Mann and Macken<lb break="no"/>zie can go to the Dominion government and 
     <lb/>
     get their notes endorsed for $9,000,000   
     <lb/>
     the strength of their land grant. They go 
     <lb/>
     to the province of Ontario and their note 
     <lb/>
     is endorsed for $1,000,000. They can go to 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia and raise money in the same 
     <lb/>
     way. They can go to Manitoba, where 
     <lb/>
     there is a Conservative government in 
     <lb/>
     power, and their note, with these lands as 
     <lb/>
     security, is endorsed for $1,000,000. If these 
     <lb/>
     railway promoters can have their notes 
     <lb/>
     endorsed and financed in this way, surely , 
     <lb/>
     these great provinces about to be erected 
     <lb/>
     in the west could evolve a financial policy 
     <lb/>
     based on their lands which would give 
     <lb/>
     them ready money, and they would then 
     <lb/>
     enjoy the income that would naturally 
     <lb/>
     come from those lands. Speaking from a 
     <lb/>
     Dominion point of view and as a citizen 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario, I could justify the policy of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion holding on to these lands; 
     <lb/>
     but how a member from the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     can advocate any such policy I am at a 
     <lb/>
     loss to understand. This is but another 
     <lb/>
     instance of the abandonment of provincial 
     <lb/>
     interests and provincial rights in the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of some outside concerns.

     I do not know that my hon. friend from

     South York (Mr. W.F. Maclean) can be 
     <lb/>
     entirely relieved of responsibility for that

     they can manage for themselves as well as this

     the Prime Minister as to one matter that I 
     <lb/>
     do not think has been very clearly brought 
     <lb/>
     out by any information laid before the 
     <lb/>
     House, and that is what quantity of actually 
     <lb/>
     good land there is in the Northwest in each 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces, suitable for agricultural 
     <lb/>
     purposes. The reason I ask is that a rather 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary statement was made by one 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentlemen from the Northwest, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Strathcona (Mr. Talbot).

     There is another reason why it is best for

     the federal government to administer those

     lands. It may not be considered a good reason 
     <lb/>
     by some, but I think the experience of most of 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces will give some weight to it. 
     <lb/>
     It is this. We might at some future time have 
     <lb/>
     a careless or extravagant government in one or 
     <lb/>
     both of the new provinces. If such a thing did 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     I myself would not be inclined to think 
     <lb/>
     there was any greater danger in that regard 
     <lb/>
     from entrusting the lands to provincial con<lb break="no"/>trol than from leaving them in the control of 
     <lb/>
     the gover nment of Canada. There is 
     <lb/>
     certainly no more reason to apprehend a 
     <lb/>
     reckless or extravagant government in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories than there is to apprehend such 
     <lb/>
     a government in the Dominion as a whole. 
     <lb/>
     Further than that, the direct and immediate 
     <lb/>
     interest of the people, the circumstances that 
     <lb/>
     the disposal of the lands would be a matter 
     <lb/>
     of immediate local concern. would seem to 
     <lb/>
     me to give greater security in that regard if 
     <lb/>
     they were under provincial control than that 
     <lb/>
     which might be expected to result from 
     <lb/>
     Dominion control. However, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man of course is entitled to his opinions in 
     <lb/>
     that regard. But he went on to say some<lb break="no"/>thing else :

     <lb/>
     well as in his might, and assail the hon.

     date. It is a pretty sweeping description. 
     <lb/>
     I am not inclined to agree with the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Strathcona so far as some of 
     <lb/>
     these statements are concerned, that is, from 
     <lb/>
     the information which I have been enabled 
     <lb/>
     to gather with respect to the quality of the 
     <lb/>
     land in the Northwest. I do not think that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman's observations are borne 
     <lb/>
     out by any information we have before the 
     <lb/>
     House at the present time. But when state<lb break="no"/>ments of that kind are made by hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men who come here from the Northwest, 
     <lb/>
     they would seem to me to merit some atten<lb break="no"/>tion from the government, and I think we 
     <lb/>
     should have some statement before the com<lb break="no"/>mittee as to the proportion of good land 
     <lb/>
     available for agricultural purposes in the 
     <lb/>
     two new provinces.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I am sorry 
     <lb/>
     that at this moment I cannot give my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend information as to the exact quantity 
     <lb/>
     of good land which is available for agricul<lb break="no"/>tural purposes in these two new provinces. 
     <lb/>
     I could, however, make an effort to have a 
     <lb/>
     computation made. which I will do, and 
     <lb/>
     hope to place in his hands at a very early 
     <lb/>
     date. Such information ought to be avail<lb break="no"/>able. I agree with my hon. friend that there 
     <lb/>
     is no more probability of a reckless govern<lb break="no"/>ment existing in those provinces than there 
     <lb/>
     is here at Ottawa. We remember that there 
     <lb/>
     has been a reckless government at Ottawa in 
     <lb/>
     the past, and there may be again. But if 
     <lb/>
     there is a reckless government at Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     the consequences to the people in the deple<lb break="no"/>tion of their assets would be less grave than 
     <lb/>
     would be the case if there was a reckless 
     <lb/>
     government in the Northwest Territories. If 
     <lb/>
     the lands were left under the control of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces the temptation would be very 
     <lb/>
     great to waste them, as the lands would 
     <lb/>
     afford them a ready asset to meet their lia<lb break="no"/>bilities ; whereas if there were such a thing 
     <lb/>
     as a reckless government in Ottawa, they 
     <lb/>
     would have other resources to draw upon 
     <lb/>
     besides the lands. Therefore I should think 
     <lb/>
     the observation of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Strathcona was not without some found<lb break="no"/>ation. As to the character of the lands, I 
     <lb/>
     must say that I am a little surprised at the 
     <lb/>
     description given of them by my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Strathcona. My impression at the 
     <lb/>
     present time is that, with a very small excep<lb break="no"/>tion, especially in the province of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, all the lands are available, either for 
     <lb/>
     ranching or for agriculture, by far the 
     <lb/>
     greater proportion. I do not know how 
     <lb/>
     much waste land there is. I understand 
     <lb/>
     there is very little swamp land, as there is 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba. At the same time, I cannot 
     <lb/>
     give the information to my hon. friend he 
     <lb/>
     asks for, but when we take up this question 
     <lb/>
     again I hope to be able to give him the in<lb break="no"/>formation.

     <lb/>
     letters coming all the time from our con<lb break="no"/>stituents asking us to see the land depart<lb break="no"/>ment at Ottawa and to arrange matters for 
     <lb/>
     them. A very large proportion of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest have business to do 
     <lb/>
     with the land department, and it would be 
     <lb/>
     very much more convenient for them it 
     <lb/>
     they were enabled to do their business on 
     <lb/>
     the spot. Besides, I do not consider that the 
     <lb/>
     administration of lands from Ottawa is at 
     <lb/>
     all what it should be, and is far less satis<lb break="no"/>factory than it would be on the spot. There 
     <lb/>
     are many points I might specify in which I 
     <lb/>
     think the administration at Ottawa is de<lb break="no"/>cidedly not in the interest of the country. At 
     <lb/>
     this moment I will not say any more about 
     <lb/>
     that, there will be other opportunities later 
     <lb/>
     on. But I make the assertion that I do not 
     <lb/>
     think the administration of the lands in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories is what it should be, 
     <lb/>
     or is what it would be if the administration 
     <lb/>
     was carried on from a central point in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories. It stands to reason 
     <lb/>
     that it is very much more easy to interest 
     <lb/>
     the members of a House sitting right on the 
     <lb/>
     spot and composed of gentlemen who are 
     <lb/>
     all acquainted with the circumstances of the 
     <lb/>
     country, than it is to interest a large House 
     <lb/>
     such as is assembled at Ottawa. For in<lb break="no"/>stance, we have ten members for the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, and if anything is going 
     <lb/>
     wrong in the Northwest Territories it is 
     <lb/>
     necessary for some of those ten members, 
     <lb/>
     possibly a very small number of them to 
     <lb/>
     acquaint the whole of this large House with 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances, and to get this House of 
     <lb/>
     214 members interested in the matter. That 
     <lb/>
     is especially difficult in view of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     so many other matters of vast importance 
     <lb/>
     have to be dealt with here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it might be taken for granted as 
     <lb/>
     a general principle that the administration 
     <lb/>
     will be better on the spot than it can pos<lb break="no"/>sibly be if the administration takes place 
     <lb/>
     from a centre, 1,500 miles or more away. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for West Assiniboia appa<lb break="no"/>rently thought it would be unwise to trust 
     <lb/>
     the local assembly with the administration 
     <lb/>
     of affairs up there. I think the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     First Minister has shown that human na<lb break="no"/>ture is much the same everywhere and that 
     <lb/>
     there is as likely to be as good administra<lb break="no"/>tion by the direct representatives in the 
     <lb/>
     local house of the affairs of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces as there is likely to be if they 
     <lb/>
     are administered from Ottawa. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Assiniboia, also, I think, ask<lb break="no"/>ed the question as to how it would be 
     <lb/>
     possible to carry on the local government 
     <lb/>
     at the present moment without the reve<lb break="no"/>nue which is to be granted by the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government as compensation for the 
     <lb/>
     loss of the lands. I looked at the Audit<lb break="no"/>or General's Report a few minutes ago just 
     <lb/>
     to see what the revenue derived from Dom<lb break="no"/>inion lands amounted to, and what the act<lb break="no"/>
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5522</fw>
          

     ual working expenses were on account of 
     <lb/>
     these lands and I find that the net revenue 
     <lb/>
     from lands and timber agencies, less certain 
     <lb/>
     refunds which were made, amounted to 
     <lb/>
     $890,152 last year, and that for the previous 
     <lb/>
     year it had been $113,287 greater than that. 
     <lb/>
     The expenditures on current account, Dom<lb break="no"/>inion lands offices, salaries, examination, 
     <lb/>
     and protection of timber lands and so on 
     <lb/>
     amounted to $247,282. Well, it seems to 
     <lb/>
     me that the difference between these two 
     <lb/>
     sums constituted what was really the re<lb break="no"/>venue from Dominion lands during the 
     <lb/>
     twelve months ending 30th June, 1904, a 
     <lb/>
     sum which amounts to something over 
     <lb/>
     $600,000. Of course, in addition to that 
     <lb/>
     there is a large expenditure on capital ac<lb break="no"/>count for surveys and so on, but, I think, 
     <lb/>
     the government of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories would equally be able to raise a sum 
     <lb/>
     on capital account to meet such capital ex<lb break="no"/>penses as the expenses of surveys and so 
     <lb/>
     on. So, I gather from the Auditor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral's Report that there is a very consider<lb break="no"/>able revenue coming in at the present time 
     <lb/>
     from these lands, an income which was 
     <lb/>
     very nearly as large as the compensation 
     <lb/>
     which is to be granted for the first few 
     <lb/>
     years for the loss of the public lands. I 
     <lb/>
     have no doubt in my mind whatever that it 
     <lb/>
     would be quite easy for the local govern<lb break="no"/>ment to very considerably add to that in<lb break="no"/>come, thoroughly acquainted as all the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the local house would be with the 
     <lb/>
     local conditions. A new point was intro<lb break="no"/>duced into the discussion also by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for West Assiniboia when he 
     <lb/>
     stated that the retention of the Royal North<lb break="no"/>west Mounted Police was a consideration 
     <lb/>
     which had to be looked at in connection 
     <lb/>
     with this question of public lands. For my  
     <lb/>
     part I cannot see that the question of the 
     <lb/>
     retention of the Mounted Police is affected 
     <lb/>
     one iota one way or the other by the ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to whether the Dominion or the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces have the possession of the 
     <lb/>
     public lands. If the amount of compensa<lb break="no"/>tion is being placed at this present figure 
     <lb/>
     on account of the retention of the Royal 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Mounted Police we should <choice><sic>cer<lb break="no"/>tinly</sic><corr>certainly</corr></choice> like to hear some assurance from the 
     <lb/>
     government that that body will be main<lb break="no"/>tained. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HERR2">Mr. HERRON</persName>. Before this resolution 
     <lb/>
     passes I would like to add a word to what 
     <lb/>
     has already been said in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     lands in the Northwest. I was very much 
     <lb/>
     surprised to hear the hon. member for West 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) state this afternoon 
     <lb/>
     that a great change has come over the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest lately in reference to their 
     <lb/>
     lands. In my part of the country no 
     <lb/>
     change has come over the people. They are 
     <lb/>
     just as strongly in favour of having their 
     <lb/>
     lands to-day as they were one or two years 
     <lb/>
     ago, and .I do not think anything Will be 
     <lb/>
     done or anything can be done in this House 
     <lb/>
     to compensate the people in that country 
     <lb/>

     <fw type="num">5523</fw>                 <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>               
 

     for the lands taken away from them by 
     <lb/>
     this government. A good deal has been said 
     <lb/>
     as to what the provinces would do, should 
     <lb/>
     the lands be handed over to them, for money 
     <lb/>
     to carry on the government. I may state 
     <lb/>
     that there have during the last few years 
     <lb/>
     been large sales of coal lands made. That 
     <lb/>
     is one way in which a revenue could be 
     <lb/>
     obtained by the new provinces. I under<lb break="no"/>stand that within the last two years a sale 
     <lb/>
     of coal lands amounting to about $300,000 
     <lb/>
     was made to one man. That information 
     <lb/>
     may not be correct but I saw the report in 
     <lb/>
     several papers. If that is true it applies 
     <lb/>
     to a very small portion of our coal lands. 
     <lb/>
     I understand that large sales are being 
     <lb/>
     made continually to outside corporations. 
     <lb/>
     I understand that Jim Hill has, in the 
     <lb/>
     neighbourhood of Pincher Creek where I 
     <lb/>
     live, 10,000 acres of coal lands. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know what he has paid for them; I do 
     <lb/>
     not know, in fact, whether he owns the 
     <lb/>
     lands or not, but it is generally supposed 
     <lb/>
     that he owns them, and if he paid the 
     <lb/>
     same price for these lands that other people 
     <lb/>
     are paying for similar lands the amount will 
     <lb/>
     be quite considerable. Other coal lands are 
     <lb/>
     being sold from time to time. That is one 
     <lb/>
     source from which a considerable amount 
     <lb/>
     of revenue would be received by the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another way in which, I think, it would 
     <lb/>
     be very expedient for the government to 
     <lb/>
     deal with a portion of the Northwest lands 
     <lb/>
     would be to grant a pre-emption to settlers. 
     <lb/>
     I do not know whether it is generally ac<lb break="no"/>cepted in this country or by members from 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories, but in my locali<lb break="no"/>ty it is considered that a quarter section of 
     <lb/>
     land is not sufficient for a homestead. I 
     <lb/>
     think this government should take into con<lb break="no"/>sideration the selling to homesteaders the 
     <lb/>
     odd quarter section adjoining their home<lb break="no"/>steads. As I understand the policy of 
     <lb/>
     the department at the present time there 
     <lb/>
     is no land for sale in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories to any person. I believe that 
     <lb/>
     is the present policy of the government. 
     <lb/>
     No doubt they will sell in time, and I 
     <lb/>
     do not see any reason why they should 
     <lb/>
     refrain from selling land to settlers. We 
     <lb/>
     know they have been selling it to cor<lb break="no"/>porations. I am quite sincere in what I say 
     <lb/>
     in reference to placing these odd sections 
     <lb/>
     at the disposal of homesteaders in addition 
     <lb/>
     to their homesteads. I think the govern<lb break="no"/>ment could sell this land at a good price, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not think they could sell it to any 
     <lb/>
     better people than the homesteaders, selling 
     <lb/>
     it to them at the price of railway lands, for 
     <lb/>
     instance. I say the time will come very 
     <lb/>
     soon, when, if even the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment retain these lands, they will be put<lb break="no"/>ting up the price; they will not be giving 
     <lb/>
     these lands as free homesteads. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it is justice to the pioneers who have 
     <lb/>
     gone in and settled that country, taken up 
     <lb/>
     land and advanced its value until today 
     <lb/>
     it is worth $5 to $10 an acre, in fact from 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5524</fw>
          

     $7 to $20 an acre and then to allow new 
     <lb/>
     settlers to go in and get that land for no<lb break="no"/>thing the same as the early settlers did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOLE1">Mr. BOLE</persName>. Does the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. HERRON) advocate homesteading the 
     <lb/>
     odd sections ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HERR2">Mr. HERRON</persName>. Yes, certainly for the pre<lb break="no"/>sent, but I believe it will not continue very 
     <lb/>
     long. I do not think it should continue 
     <lb/>
     very long. The point I am making is that 
     <lb/>
     the land is worth from $10 to $20 an acre. 
     <lb/>
     and I do not think the government should 
     <lb/>
     continue very long to give that away. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOLE1">Mr. BOLE</persName>. I was wondering where they 
     <lb/>
     were going to get the revenue to run the 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HERR2">Mr. HERRON</persName>. I have named one or two 
     <lb/>
     sources of revenue from which we could get 
     <lb/>
     perhaps as much money as we are getting 
     <lb/>
     under the present Bill. I believe we could 
     <lb/>
     derive a large revenue from the sale of our 
     <lb/>
     mineral lands in that country for some years 
     <lb/>
     to come, and with the revenue that will 
     <lb/>
     come to the provinces under this Bill, I do 
     <lb/>
     not see how they are going to provide for 
     <lb/>
     provincial services. The amount allotted 
     <lb/>
     for the first year under this Bill could be 
     <lb/>
     spent in my own district alone, and then it 
     <lb/>
     would not half supply the needs of the dis<lb break="no"/>trict in building roads and bridges and 
     <lb/>
     other things which are absolutely necessary. 
     <lb/>
     Hon. gentlemen on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House know that when the Territorial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was giving us $700,000 or $800,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year there were applications in for the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure of $15,000,000, which large sum 
     <lb/>
     could be very judiciously applied to meet 
     <lb/>
     the wants of the people.

     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     wondering how he could possibly make the 
     <lb/>
     views therein expressed conflict with my 
     <lb/>
     present views. I did say something about 
     <lb/>
     the recklessness of legislatures voting away 
     <lb/>
     the property of the people, but I was speak<lb break="no"/>ing of all legislatures, including the Do<lb break="no"/>minion parliament. It must be remembered 
     <lb/>
     that these legislatures, which so cheerfully 
     <lb/>
     gave away the heritage of the people, were 
     <lb/>
     nearly all under Liberal governments, but 
     <lb/>
     a change is taking place now. There has 
     <lb/>
     been a change in my own province, and two 
     <lb/>
     minutes ago I received this telegram from 
     <lb/>
     Toronto, which shows what a Conservative

<p>
     A Liberal government in Ontario gave 
     <lb/>
     away three great franchises in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the development of power, and two 
     <lb/>
     days before the election they doubled the 
     <lb/>
     capacity of water that one of these com<lb break="no"/>panies was allowed to take, and in that 
     <lb/>
     reckless way the property of the people was 
     <lb/>
     handed out to exploiters. The Conservative 
     <lb/>
     government in Ontario is trying to remedy 
     <lb/>
     this. I believe, with the member for Qu'Ap<lb break="no"/>pelle, that there would be a more satis<lb break="no"/>factory administration of the public lands 
     <lb/>
     by the local authorities than by the central 
     <lb/>
     authority at Ottawa. The new Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior has come into the House fresh 
     <lb/>
     from the west, and I would like him to tell 
     <lb/>
     us whether the opinion of the west is, as it 
     <lb/>
     was formerly, that the public domain shall 
     <lb/>
     be handed over to the new provinces. We 
     <lb/>
     are told here by one or two members from 
     <lb/>
     the west that their views have changed, 
     <lb/>
     but I am quite certain that the views of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the west in this respect have not 
     <lb/>
     changed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. All of us who come from 
     <lb/>
     the west are anxious to have this Bill pass<lb break="no"/>ed, and if we do not reply to every asser<lb break="no"/>tion that is made from the other side, it is 
     <lb/>
     rather because we wish to forward business 
     <lb/>
     than that we are particular about how gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on the other side care to represent 
     <lb/>
     or misrepresent the position. By this time 
     <lb/>
     we have fairly well arrived at a conclusion 
     <lb/>
     as to what is the position of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     in regard to this question. They appear to 
     <lb/>
     be unanimous in the view that the lands of 
     <lb/>
     the west shall be treated as a source of 
     <lb/>
     revenue, and that the west should depend 
     <lb/>
     upon its lands for its revenue. That is the 
     <lb/>
     view that prevailed when the Conservatives 
     <lb/>
     were in power, and every member on the 
     <lb/>
     other side has reiterated that principle to<lb break="no"/>day. I need not remind the House or the 
     <lb/>
     country that under that policy, not only was 
     <lb/>
     the land not a source of revenue, but it was 
     <lb/>
     a source of direct loss; it did not pay the 
     <lb/>
     cost of administration. It was not until the 
     <lb/>
     principle of the land for the people, the 
     <lb/>
     principle of free land to the settler, was 
     <lb/>
     adopted that the price of land in the North<lb break="no"/>west increased. It is because of the policy 
     <lb/>
     of the land for the settler that land in the 
     <lb/>
     west has attained its present value. Just so 
     <lb/>
     sure as the policy of the land for revenue is 
     <lb/>
     adopted again, just so sure the result will 
     <lb/>
     be as before. With the experience we have 
     <lb/>
     had, it is late in the day or us to make the 
     <lb/>
     mistake of killing the goose that lays the 
     <lb/>
     golden egg. It is the free settlement of land 
     <lb/>
     that makes the balance of it valuable, and 
     <lb/>
     just so soon as you place the burden of sup<lb break="no"/>port of provincial government upon the 
     <lb/>
     revenue derived from the sale of the land, 
     <lb/>
     just so soon you will depreciate the value 
     <lb/>
     of the land and injure the province and in<lb break="no"/>jure the country. I am fresh from the west, 
     <lb/>
     and I can tell my hon. friend (Mr. W. F. 
     <lb/>
     Maclean) that I discussed this question with 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5526</fw>
           

     the people I have the honour to represent. 
     <lb/>
     He knows the result. This subject was per<lb break="no"/>sistently placed before the people, and the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the Bill in this regard were, 
     <lb/>
     so far as I could learn, unanimously en<lb break="no"/>dorsed by the people. We do not want a 
     <lb/>
     policy of the land for revenue; we want a 
     <lb/>
     policy of the land for the people, and the 
     <lb/>
     members who parade the fact that certain 
     <lb/>
     lands in the Northwest are to-day worth 
     <lb/>
     certain money are only giving evidence of 
     <lb/>
     the desirability, of the necessity for, and of 
     <lb/>
     the success of, the policy of giving away the 
     <lb/>
     land to anybody who will take it and use 
     <lb/>
     it. The idea that you could derive from the 
     <lb/>
     whole land of the country the same value 
     <lb/>
     that you can for a small part of it when you 
     <lb/>
     are using the greater part of it for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of attracting settlers, is an idea that is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely absurd, and one which I think will 
     <lb/>
     not be approved of by even our western 
     <lb/>
     friends on the other side of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As to the ability of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest to manage their own affairs 
     <lb/>
     their land or other matters, no ques<lb break="no"/>tion is raised by any person, but there 
     <lb/>
     is a difference in point of view as I had 
     <lb/>
     occasion to remark at another time. The 
     <lb/>
     provincial government, which circumstances 
     <lb/>
     compel to derive ultimately the larger part 
     <lb/>
     of its revenue from the disposal of its 
     <lb/>
     lands, is under necessity and stress of an 
     <lb/>
     absolutely different administration of its 
     <lb/>
     lands from the Dominion government 
     <lb/>
     which makes its money out of those lands 
     <lb/>
     by their settlement. As I said on a pre<lb break="no"/>vious occasion, the Dominion government 
     <lb/>
     can afford, and well afford, not only to 
     <lb/>
     give the lands away, but to spend a mil<lb break="no"/>lion dollars a year in attracting settlement 
     <lb/>
     to those lands and still make lots of money 
     <lb/>
     for that country and for every province in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion by doing so. It need scar<lb break="no"/>cely be stated to the members of this 
     <lb/>
     House that the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     whose interest in those lands is from their 
     <lb/>
     sale and rental is not in a position to give 
     <lb/>
     them away, is not in a position to spend 
     <lb/>
     money in order to attract settlers to them, 
     <lb/>
     and give them the lands for nothing; as 
     <lb/>
     is the Dominion government which derives 
     <lb/>
     its revenues from the customs duties on 
     <lb/>
     the increased trade due to the presence of 
     <lb/>
     these settlers in Canada. There is no ques<lb break="no"/>tion about the ability of the provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment or the Dominion government; it 
     <lb/>
     is a quesiion of the circumstances under 
     <lb/>
     which each government carries on its affairs, 
     <lb/>
     and again I say in answer to the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's question, we in the west appre<lb break="no"/>ciate thoroughly the necessity from every 
     <lb/>
     point of view of those lands being adminis<lb break="no"/>tered as far as possible in the interests of 
     <lb/>
     settlement and not in the interests of re<lb break="no"/>venue; it is for that reason that we want 
     <lb/>
     those lands to remain under the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of the Dominion which is able to 
     <lb/>
     administer them and still make a profit, and 
     <lb/>
     we are glad to receive a cash allowance in 
     <lb/>

    would have to take out of those lands,

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Is it not after all

            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Why not?

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I have tried to explain.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Perhaps my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend does not understand me. The Do<lb break="no"/>minion he says pays a certain subsidy to 
     <lb/>
     the province and pays out large sums of 
     <lb/>
     money in respect of the administration of 
     <lb/>
     those lands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Well, can we not 
     <lb/>
     very well hand the lands over to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and give them that additional amount 
     <lb/>
     and still have local control? Why would 
     <lb/>
     it not be better for the Dominion to take 
     <lb/>
     that course? As far as the Dominion is 
     <lb/>
     concerned, there would be no loss of money 
     <lb/>
     according to the hon. gentleman's statement. 
     <lb/>
     That is why I said just now that after 
     <lb/>
     all it is a mere matter of control. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. If that is the suggestion 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentleman I would certainly 
     <lb/>
     advise him to put it in the form of a motion 
     <lb/>
     and place it before the House and the

     country.

            <p>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I certainly would not, for 
     <lb/>
     I believe in the principle that if we are 
     <lb/>
     paying the cost of the administration of 
     <lb/>
     these lands we should administer them.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I did not suggest 
     <lb/>
     the contrary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName> I have not followed the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I suggested that 
     <lb/>
     Canada shall make a proper allowance to 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces, having regard to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that they must take over certain items 
     <lb/>
     of expenditure which now devolve upon the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     control of these lands. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     surely does not object to the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     getting an adequate allowance to carry on 
     <lb/>
     the business which is entrusted to them. 
     <lb/>
     Coming from the west he does not take that

     position.

            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Does it not come

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Does the hon. member

     propose to give the provinces the cash al<lb break="no"/>lowance we propose in this Bill, and also to 
     <lb/>
     hand over the administration of the lands 
     <lb/>
     and also to recoup them for any possible 
     <lb/>
     loss incurred in the administration of 
     <lb/>
     those lands ?

            </p>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5528</fw>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I say that if we 
     <lb/>
     impose on them under the terms of this 
     <lb/>
     Bill a certain expenditure, it is reasonable 
     <lb/>
     and necessary that we should make pro<lb break="no"/>vision for that expenditure, and I have also 
     <lb/>
     said over and over again that I believe the 
     <lb/>
     provinces should be entrusted with the 
     <lb/>
     control of these lands. I do not think the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman (Mr. Oliver) had concluded 
     <lb/>
     his remarks so I shall not add anything 
     <lb/>
     more until after he has finished. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I have no hesitation in 
     <lb/>
     saying that the principle that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment which provides the money should 
     <lb/>
     have the control is one that I would al<lb break="no"/>ways support, and that if the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government had to provide the provinces 
     <lb/>
     with the money with which to administer 
     <lb/>
     the lands, it would be right and proper— 
     <lb/>
     and as a western man I would say it 
     <lb/>
     would be right and proper—that the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government should administer that 
     <lb/>
     for which it pays. But to repeat, if I 
     <lb/>
     can make myself clear, it would not matter 
     <lb/>
     if to-day we handed over to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     the amount of money that we are proposing 
     <lb/>
     to hand over and then handed over to 
     <lb/>
     them the land and then handed over an ad<lb break="no"/>ditional amount to repay them for possible 
     <lb/>
     loss on the administration of those lands, 
     <lb/>
     the principle would still remain that the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government could afford to give 
     <lb/>
     the lands away and still make money, and 
     <lb/>
     that the provincial government could not af<lb break="no"/>ford to give the lands away and make 
     <lb/>
     money; and that therefore those of us who 
     <lb/>
     believe in the propriety and the good 
     <lb/>
     policy of administering these lands for the 
     <lb/>
     sake of settlement rather than of revenue, 
     <lb/>
     other things being equal, certainly want to 
     <lb/>
     see that administration remain in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion government. Now in re<lb break="no"/>gard to a suggestion made by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Alberta (Mr. Herron) as to the 
     <lb/>
     revenue that is being derived from the 
     <lb/>
     sale of mineral lands—and by inference he 
     <lb/>
     suggested that a sufficient revenue might be 
     <lb/>
     derived from the sale of mineral lands 
     <lb/>
     without trespassing on agricultural lands-
     <lb/>
     I do not know what money could be de<lb break="no"/>rived from the sale of mineral lands, in 
     <lb/>
     the Territories ; I do not know what money 
     <lb/>
     has been derived in the past or can be de<lb break="no"/>rived in the future. I hope that a very 
     <lb/>
     large revenue can be derived from that 
     <lb/>
     source, but even supposing that there can 
     <lb/>
     be a considerable revenue derived from 
     <lb/>
     that source, it does not alter the principle 
     <lb/>
     I have stated, but we may judge possibly 
     <lb/>
     of this by comparison. The district of 
     <lb/>
     Alberta, as every one knows, is not what 
     <lb/>
     would be called a highly mineralized ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. There are important and valuable 
     <lb/>
     mineral coal deposits throughout the prairie 
     <lb/>
     country and in the Rocky mountains and 
     <lb/>
     these of course are of very great value, 
     <lb/>
     but certainly Alberta is not mineralized to 
     <lb/>
     anything like the extent that the adjoining 
     <lb/>
     province of British Columbia is. There is 
     <lb/>
  

            <pb n="5529" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-08_Page_5529.jpg"/>

     a province of larger area than the pro<lb break="no"/>posed province of Alberta, a province 
     <lb/>
     which is, I might almost say, entirely 
     <lb/>
     mineralized, which has coal, and gold, and 
     <lb/>
     silver, and lead, and copper, and iron, and 
     <lb/>
     every metal almost on earth, and has them 
     <lb/>
     in the greatest abundance. I suppose there 
     <lb/>
     is no other country of equal area that is 
     <lb/>
     as highly mineralized or mineralized with 
     <lb/>
     as valuable metal as British Columbia. 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia has timber and land and 
     <lb/>
     that province works all its natural re<lb break="no"/>sources for all they are worth as sources 
     <lb/>
     of revenue, yet if I have read the reports 
     <lb/>
     of the provincial government correctly, the 
     <lb/>
     total receipts from the sales of lands from 
     <lb/>
     all sources that I could gather in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of British Columbia a year or two 
     <lb/>
     ago amounted to some $615,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Did they not col<lb break="no"/>lect royalty ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Yes, this is all I could 
     <lb/>
     gather. I have here the revenue from sale 
     <lb/>
     of mineral lands, timber lands and the 
     <lb/>
     rest, and the whole thing totals $615,000. 
     <lb/>
     If that is the total which British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     derives from the sale of lands and the 
     <lb/>
     rental and working of all its natural re<lb break="no"/>sources, I submit that we in Alberta can<lb break="no"/>not reasonably expect to support our pro<lb break="no"/>vincial government from the sales of our 
     <lb/>
     mineral and timber lands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     say to the hon. gentleman that one of 
     <lb/>
     his arguments at least would lead to some 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary results. He says that what<lb break="no"/>ever the Dominion government provides 
     <lb/>
     money for, they should control. Well, the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government, under the terms of 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, provides money for the admin<lb break="no"/>istration of justice in the new provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and for other matters which are under 
     <lb/>
     control of the provinces. All I was sug<lb break="no"/>gesting was that if the lands were under 
     <lb/>
     control of the new provinces, it would be 
     <lb/>
     proper to take into consideration the ex<lb break="no"/>pense involved in the administration of 
     <lb/>
     those lands. He says you must not get 
     <lb/>
     revenue out of these lands as that would 
     <lb/>
     hear harshly on the people. But I did not 
     <lb/>
     observe him to rise here and rebuke the 
     <lb/>
     argument of his predecessor two years ago 
     <lb/>
     when he led us to believe that we would 
     <lb/>
     get from sixty to seventy-five million dol<lb break="no"/>lars out of these lands. Well, it will not 
     <lb/>
     bear less hardly on the people if that 
     <lb/>
     money be taken by the Dominion than if 
     <lb/>
     it be taken by the new provinces. I heard 
     <lb/>
     no word of repudiation from the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman when the ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton) announced that policy. On the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, he voted in support of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and in support of that argument. 
     <lb/>
     Are we to-day having a new policy an<lb break="no"/>nounced ? Has the hon. gentleman decided 
     <lb/>
     to repudiate the policy of the government 
     <lb/>
     as announced by his predecessor, because 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5530</fw>
         

     that is what his argument leads to ? Let 
     <lb/>
     me tell him that in the province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, which has an area of only 21,000 
     <lb/>
     square miles, and where a wiser policy has 
     <lb/>
     been pursued in respect of its mines than 
     <lb/>
     that which is being pursued in respect of 
     <lb/>
     its Crown lands, the amount of money 
     <lb/>
     received from mineral lands in the year 
     <lb/>
     ending 30th September, 1903, was $619,234, 
     <lb/>
     which is a very comfortable amount of 
     <lb/>
     revenue for a province with a small area, 
     <lb/>
     and which was within a few dollars of 
     <lb/>
     one half the total revenue of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince during that year. And I might add 
     <lb/>
     also that it is a province, only portions 
     <lb/>
     of which are mineralized. The Annapolis 
     <lb/>
     valley and other very large portions of 
     <lb/>
     the province, which are suitable for agri<lb break="no"/>cultural purposes, are of course not min<lb break="no"/>eralized, but there is quite a large area— 
     <lb/>
     between one-half and one-third—whlch 
     <lb/>
     might be regarded as mineralized land. 
     <lb/>
     If such lands were handed over to the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces, probably some system of 
     <lb/>
     not giving away the whole of the mineral<lb break="no"/>ized land, but reserving a certain in<lb break="no"/>terest to the people in the shape of 
     <lb/>
     royalty, might be carried out with equally 
     <lb/>
     good results. In the province of Alberta, 
     <lb/>
     such a policy would contribute largely to 
     <lb/>
     the development of the country. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     minister may see possibly that there might 
     <lb/>
     be some room for reflection in the sugges<lb break="no"/>tion that the lands, even if the present 
     <lb/>
     system were maintained, would be of some 
     <lb/>
     use to the new provinces. The Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government did not propose to make 
     <lb/>
     $60,000,000 to $75,000,000 by doing away 
     <lb/>
     with the homestead entries. The prede<lb break="no"/>cessor of my hon. friend distinctly said that 
     <lb/>
     these homesteads must be reserved for the 
     <lb/>
     poor man, but he proposed to make this 
     <lb/>
     money out of the alternate sections which 
     <lb/>
     are not reserved for homestead sections.

     <persName ref="pers:HERR2">Mr. HERRON</persName>. I might say with reference 
     <lb/>
     to the comparison which the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     drew between the lands of British Colum<lb break="no"/>bia and those of Alberta, that if we have 
     <lb/>
     no precious minerals in Alberta, still we 
     <lb/>
     have these immense coal deposits which 
     <lb/>
     are probably just as valuable as the pre<lb break="no"/>cious metals. Some of the coal mines of 
     <lb/>
     Alberta have sold for as large a sum as 
     <lb/>
     some of these silver and copper mines of 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia. One of them sold for 
     <lb/>
     no less a sum than $3,000,000. Within 
     <lb/>
     twenty-five miles of the locality where I 
     <lb/>
     live, I suppose we have fifty coal mines just 
     <lb/>
     as good as the one I referred to, which sold 
     <lb/>
     for $3,000,000. Coal mines are being developed 
     <lb/>
     all over that country. Not more than a 
     <lb/>
     month ago, an eminent engineer reported 
     <lb/>
     on a mine newly developed within the last 
     <lb/>
     year, and in his report he said that there 
     <lb/>
     were ten million tons of coal above tunnel 
     <lb/>
     levels. That is only one mine out of fifty 
     <lb/>
     within twenty-five miles of where I live. 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me that a province with natural 
     <lb/>
     resources of that kind would have no dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty in raising a fair amount of revenue. 
     <lb/>
     You might also take into consideration 
     <lb/>
     our fisheries, which may be of considerable 
     <lb/>
     importance. I think that if they were 
     <lb/>
     under the control of the Northwest gov<lb break="no"/>ernment we should not see them leased at 
     <lb/>
     $10 a year for 21 years. If they were 
     <lb/>
     handled in the proper way, they would be 
     <lb/>
     another considerable source of revenue. I 
     <lb/>
     consider the minerals of our country also 
     <lb/>
     very important. And I think we could make 
     <lb/>
     a law which would do more to promote the 
     <lb/>
     development of our mineral resources than 
     <lb/>
     can be done from here. The mining laws 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion, I consider, very unsatis<lb break="no"/>factory to the people engaged in' mining. 
     <lb/>
     And something should be done to remedy 
     <lb/>
     this difficulty.

     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. The Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior (Mr. Oliver) laid down the 
     <lb/>
     doctrine a little while ago, that not only 
     <lb/>
     should the Dominion have these lands, but it 
     <lb/>
     should also have the immense revenue from 
     <lb/>
     customs to be yielded by that country. That 
     <lb/>
     is, the Dominion is to have everything, and 
     <lb/>
     the old provincial righters have completely 
     <lb/>
     changed their doctrines. The minister spoke 
     <lb/>
     of this land being the land of the people. 
     <lb/>
     Formerly it used to be 'the land for the 
     <lb/>
     province ' but the minister covers the change 
     <lb/>
     by a general assertion of ' the land for the 
     <lb/>
     people. But the fact is he is abandoning 
     <lb/>
     the old platform on which he and his friends 
     <lb/>
     used to stand before this House and before 
     <lb/>
     the country. But I believe there is no 
     <lb/>
     change in the view that the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country take on this subject. As has just 
     <lb/>
     been stated by the hon. member for Alberta 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Herron), the mineral lands may be 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5532</fw>
        

     worth more than the agricultural lands, but 
     <lb/>
     these now are given over to the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     Why not adopt this solution of the difficulty, 
     <lb/>
     take stock of what there is there and give 
     <lb/>
     half to the people of the west and keep half 
     <lb/>
     for the Dominion ? I hold that those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces when established, should be started 
     <lb/>
     off with a large public domain of their own. 
     <lb/>
     They can give lands to the settler as well 
     <lb/>
     as the Dominion can. They can encourage 
     <lb/>
     mining by giving mineral grants. And per<lb break="no"/>haps they can do more than the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     can to develop the mineral lands by a policy 
     <lb/>
     similar to that of Nova Scotia. The province 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia, for its size, is probably the 
     <lb/>
     richest province of the Dominion, by reason 
     <lb/>
     of its immense mineral deposits, especially 
     <lb/>
     in the way of coal. If there are these great 
     <lb/>
     coal deposits in the west that they say there 
     <lb/>
     are, and if coal is essential to the west, as 
     <lb/>
     I believe it to be, it would be a good thing 
     <lb/>
     if the new provinces had this public domain. 
     <lb/>
     And, if they cannot have it all, they should 
     <lb/>
     share it. It may be the view of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite that the provinces should 
     <lb/>
     not have part of this domain. That may be 
     <lb/>
     the view of the Dominion government, but I 
     <lb/>
     do not think it is in accord with the speeches 
     <lb/>
     made in the west or with the resolutions in 
     <lb/>
     the territorial assembly, nor do I believe it 
     <lb/>
     to be in accord with the views of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the west to-day.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I believe that the consensus 
     <lb/>
     of opinion in the Northwest is in favour of 
     <lb/>
     the possession of the public domain by the 
     <lb/>
     people of the new provinces. It is curious 
     <lb/>
     to me that hon. gentlemen opposite say that 
     <lb/>
     they have not heard any dissatisfaction ex<lb break="no"/>pressed in the country with the policy they 
     <lb/>
     now propose.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I think the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott), if he has heard from any but his 
     <lb/>
     own political associates must have heard a 
     <lb/>
     good deal more on this subject than he is 
     <lb/>
     willing to admit. We have been told by 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite that they have heard 
     <lb/>
     hardly any objection to the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses of the Bill. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Western Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) nods his 
     <lb/>
     head in assent to that. I can assure him 
     <lb/>
     that both with regard to the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses, which we are not now discussmg, 
     <lb/>
     and the land clauses I have heard a great 
     <lb/>
     deal of dissatisfaction expressed, and have 
     <lb/>
     had a large number of letters on the subject. 
     <lb/>
     I can well understand that hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
    supporting the government think that the 
     <lb/>Dominion should retain the land. The idea 
     <lb/>was expressed to me by a leading Liberal of 
     <lb/>the Territories before the recent election. 
     <lb/>He said to me : 'You cannot expect the 
     <lb/>Dominion government to divest themselves 
     <lb/>of the enormous patronage involved in the 
     <lb/>the public lands of the Northwest.' But the 
     <lb/>point I wish to call attention to just now is

     that referred to by the hon. member for Cal<lb break="no"/>gary (Mr. M. S. McCarthy). That hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman asked the question which has not yet 
     <lb/>
     been answered. He wished to know if this 
     <lb/>
     territory bordering upon Hudson bay—most 
     <lb/>
     of it, I think, comprised in the district of 
     <lb/>
     Keewatin—is to be divided amongst the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, will that portion of the territory to he 
     <lb/>
     added to Ontario still remain, so far as the 
     <lb/>
     possession of the lands is concerned, in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the Dominion government, or will 
     <lb/>
     the lands be handed over to the province ? 
     <lb/>
     And, will a difference be, made in that res<lb break="no"/>pect between the part of the territory given 
     <lb/>
     to Ontario and that given to the new pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Saskatchewan ? That is a question 
     <lb/>
     to which I would very much like to hear an 
     <lb/>
     answer, because I think it has a very clear 
     <lb/>
     bearing upon the subject before us. We 
     <lb/>
     know that a few years ago a very large 
     <lb/>
     amount of territory was handed over to the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec—116,550 square miles.

     divergence of opinion between the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the government (Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier) and the local government of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, because in the Order in Council which 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec government passed, upon which 
     <lb/>
     this Act of parliament was subsequently 
     <lb/>
     founded, it was stated that the definition of 
     <lb/>
     the limits which were proposed by the Que<lb break="no"/>bec government meant an increase in area of 
     <lb/>
     116,550 square miles. There can be no ques<lb break="no"/>tion, even if the right hon. gentleman (Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid Laurier) is right, and it was merely 
     <lb/>
     a new definition of the boundary, that it cer<lb break="no"/>tainly drew the new boundary line far away 
     <lb/>
     to the north of the one which existed at that 
     <lb/>
     time. In any case, I think we should re<lb break="no"/>ceive a definite answer on this point. Be<lb break="no"/>cause only a short time ago, when the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice was speaking on the 
     <lb/>
     Autonomy Bill, he said that in order to 
     <lb/>
     place the public lands of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories in the possession of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces it would require a divesting Act by 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada. So far as I have 
     <lb/>
     been able to see, there has been no divest<lb break="no"/>ing Act in regard, at all events, to that por<lb break="no"/>tion of the lands which the government of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec believed had been added to that pro<lb break="no"/>vince in 1889.

            <p>
     When we were asking for information 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon as to the basis of the 
     <lb/>
     calculation of the money grant given 
     <lb/>
     in lieu of lands, the information which we 
     <lb/>
     got showed us pretty conclusively that it 
     <lb/>
     was based upon the idea that 50,000,000 
     <lb/>
     acres of land of the odd numbered sections 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5534</fw>
       

     are to be opened up and brought within the 
     <lb/>
     reach of civilization by the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
     Pacific. I do not think it can be said that 
     <lb/>
     any portion of the present district of Atha<lb break="no"/>baska would come within that scope. I think 
     <lb/>
     the whole of the district of Athabaska is 
     <lb/>
     really considered by the government to be 
     <lb/>
     of little value at the present moment. Would 
     <lb/>
     it not be good policy, if the government de<lb break="no"/>termines to retain possession of the land in 
     <lb/>
     the present provisional districts of Alberta, 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan and Assiniboia, to hand over 
     <lb/>
     the district of Athabaska, at any rate. into 
     <lb/>
     the complete possession of the new pro« 
     <lb/>
     vinces ? I think that would furnish a great 
     <lb/>
     incentive to the new provinces to try and 
     <lb/>
     open up this district. It seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     if a remote district of that sort is placed 
     <lb/>
     under the administration of a local govern<lb break="no"/>ment who have no beneficiary interest in 
     <lb/>
     the land, it would he a source of expenditure 
     <lb/>
     without affording any revenue. The provin<lb break="no"/>cial government might find a considerable 
     <lb/>
     amount of immigration going into the dis<lb break="no"/>trict of Athabaska, 300 or 400 miles away. 
     <lb/>
     These settlers would call loudly for 
     <lb/>
     the opening up of new roads and the 
     <lb/>
     building of bridges over some of the big 
     <lb/>
     rivers, and that would mean taking away a 
     <lb/>
     certain amount of money which would other<lb break="no"/>wise be spent in .the more thickly settled 
     <lb/>
     districts nearer home. Therefore, it seems 
     <lb/>
     to me that the local government would not 
     <lb/>
     be very anxious to encourage settlement in 
     <lb/>
     the remote districts ; whereas, if the lands 
     <lb/>
     in those remote districts formed part of the 
     <lb/>
     province, the local government would do 
     <lb/>
     their utmost to encourage settlement there. 
     <lb/>
     because they would be enhancing the value of 
     <lb/>
     their own property. For instance if the min<lb break="no"/>erals are in the possession of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government. the opening up of a new coal 
     <lb/>
     mine would bring some money to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government in the shape of royalty, but 
     <lb/>
     it brings no revenue to the local government; 
     <lb/>
     in fact, it is a source of expenditure, be<lb break="no"/>cause the local government has to provide 
     <lb/>
     for the inspection of the mine and for the 
     <lb/>
     safety of the miners. Therefore, the open<lb break="no"/>ing up of an undertaking of that sort is a 
     <lb/>
     loss to the local government, although it is 
     <lb/>
     a gain to the Dominion government. But 
     <lb/>
     if the mines and minerals belonged to the 
     <lb/>
     province it would be quite a different pro<lb break="no"/>position for then the local government 
     <lb/>
     would be anxious to develop its resources 
     <lb/>
     and make a revenue in order to repay for 
     <lb/>
     the extra expenditure they Would have to 
     <lb/>
     make in providing for the inspection of the 
     <lb/>
     mine and safeguarding the lives of the 
     <lb/>
     miners.

     <persName ref="pers:MORI2">Mr. MORIN</persName>. In regard to this question 
     <lb/>
     of lands in the new provinces, I cannot 
     <lb/>
     understand why the government do not an<lb break="no"/>nex those provinces and then give them the 
     <lb/>
     milk and the cream, and let them go. What 
     <lb/>
     is the use of this government acting as a 
     <lb/>
     clerk of the new provinces? Here is the 
     <lb/>
     federal government proposing to collect the 
     <lb/>

     money for the sale of the land and hand it 
     <lb/>
     back to the provinces. Why don't you give 
     <lb/>
     them a quit claim to the land, and let the 
     <lb/>
     provinces take care of themselves ? If they 
     <lb/>
     can take care of themselves, they can take 
     <lb/>
     care of their own land. This is a childish 
     <lb/>
     policy; it is as plain as A, B, C. Now, 
     <lb/>
     what will take place ? I may not live to 
     <lb/>
     see the day, but the day will come when 
     <lb/>
     this government will receive no revenue 
     <lb/>
     from those lands, and then the government 
     <lb/>
     will say to the provinces: We cannot pay 
     <lb/>
     you any more, because we get nothing from 
     <lb/>
     you. Then they will say to this govern<lb break="no"/>ment: Why didn't you let us alone in the 
     <lb/>
     first place ? Why did you rob us when we 
     <lb/>
     had something ? Isn't it as broad as it is 
     <lb/>
     long? That is the way I understand it, 
     <lb/>
     anyway.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I think the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     has put his finger on the weak spot of our 
     <lb/>
     opponents' argument. He suggests that the 
     <lb/>
     time will come when the revenues from the 
     <lb/>
     lands will not be equal to the subsidy in 
     <lb/>
     lieu of the land. However, he is mistaken 
     <lb/>
     when he suggests that at that time, if it 
     <lb/>
     arrives, this government will be able to say 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces : We don't get the money, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore we cannot give it to you. That 
     <lb/>
     is the advantage of this agreement to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest, that, whether that 
     <lb/>
     time arrives or not, if it ever does arrive, 
     <lb/>
     it will not be the privilege of this govern<lb break="no"/>ment to say that it will not pay that money, 
     <lb/>
     because it will have to pay that money 
     <lb/>
     whether it derives any revenue or not. That 
     <lb/>
     is why we are supporting this provision. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MORI2">Mr. MORIN</persName>. Very well. Will the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman tell me whether the government 
     <lb/>
     proposes to act as a broker in this matter ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. The government is not 
     <lb/>
     acting as a broker at all—

            <p>

     please.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>—because it is merely con<lb break="no"/>tinuing to transact the business that it has 
     <lb/>
     always transacted, and the transaction of 
     <lb/>
     which has been successful and satisfactory ; 
     <lb/>
     and the local government is going to con<lb break="no"/>tinue to transact its business, in which its 
     <lb/>
     administration has been successful, but its 
     <lb/>
     revenues will be on a somewhat different 
     <lb/>
     basis from what they were before, and that 
     <lb/>
     is all the difference. I just want to make 
     <lb/>
     reference to a point mentioned by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Alberta (Mr. Herron) and also 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for Carleton (Mr. R. 
     <lb/>
     L. Borden), in reference to the revenue to 
     <lb/>
     be derived by the provinces, or that might 
     <lb/>
     be derived by the provinces in one instance, 
     <lb/>
     from the sale of coal lands, or royalties on 
     <lb/>
     coal and, in the other case, from the sale of 
     <lb/>
     the odd numbered sections of land. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Carleton read an extract 
     <lb/>
     from a speech of the late Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior, in which he suggested the idea 
     <lb/>
     that certain lands might be sold at the price, 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5536</fw>
        

     as I understand the extract, of $3 per acre. 
     <lb/>
     I am not able to say how far the late min<lb break="no"/>ister was laying down the policy for the 
     <lb/>
     future conduct of the government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. He said that a 
     <lb/>
     measure would be introduced. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I will only say that the 
     <lb/>
     principle still remains the same, that this 
     <lb/>
     government can afford to give the lands 
     <lb/>
     away, and if it does not see fit to give 
     <lb/>
     the lands away it can afford to sell the lands 
     <lb/>
     to settlers better than the provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment can afford to sell them if it has 
     <lb/>
     to sell them. He places the figures at $3 
     <lb/>
     an acre of the land to be sold when land 
     <lb/>
     today is being sold at $6 per acre by rail<lb break="no"/>way companies. I submit that the provin<lb break="no"/>cial government under stress for revenue, 
     <lb/>
     as the government of every province in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion is at the present time and as 
     <lb/>
     the governments of these provinces might 
     <lb/>
     very well he expected to be, would in the 
     <lb/>
     natural course of events, be apt to charge 
     <lb/>
     exactly what hon. members on the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the House have been suggesting 
     <lb/>
     during the whole of this day—the last 
     <lb/>
     cent the land was worth and wring the last 
     <lb/>
     cent they could get out of it for the pur<lb break="no"/>poses of revenue. That is the principle that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite have laid down. 
     <lb/>
     That was not the principle laid down by 
     <lb/>
     the late Minister of the Interior. The 
     <lb/>
     principle was that there was a possibility 
     <lb/>
     of deriving a certain amount of money 
     <lb/>
     from the sale of land, but the price he 
     <lb/>
     suggested was under the present condi<lb break="no"/>tions, a low price, a price such as might 
     <lb/>
     be supposed not to be a bar to successful 
     <lb/>
     settlement. The same in regard to the sale 
     <lb/>
     of coal lands or royalties on coal. In their 
     <lb/>
     comparison between the existence of coal in 
     <lb/>
     Alberta and the existence of coal in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia our hon. friends on the other side 
     <lb/>
     of the House do not seem to appreciate the 
     <lb/>
     source from which the value comes. Coal 
     <lb/>
     and land in themselves have no value. The 
     <lb/>
     value in the coal is in the market that may 
     <lb/>
     be got for the coal, and the value of the 
     <lb/>
     land is in the demand that exists for the 
     <lb/>
     land. If nobody wants the coal or the 
     <lb/>
     land the coal and the land are worth no<lb break="no"/>thing. In Alberta we have hundreds of 
     <lb/>
     square miles of coal practically worth no<lb break="no"/>thing, because there is no market for it. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, a comparison between the re<lb break="no"/>venue that may be derived from coal in 
     <lb/>
     Alberta and the revenue that is derived 
     <lb/>
     from coal in Nova Scotia is not a proper 
     <lb/>
     comparison. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Why is there not 
     <lb/>
     a market? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Because there is no great 
     <lb/>
     population dependent upon that source of 
     <lb/>
     supply. There will be, we hope, but there 
     <lb/>
     is not at the present time. To-day prac<lb break="no"/>tically the area of coal land in the Edmon<lb break="no"/>ton districts is worth no more than ordin<lb break="no"/>

     ary farm land because there is so much of 
     <lb/>
     it and because there is no outside market 
     <lb/>
     for it. The market is not large enough. 
     <lb/>
     What I want to say in regard to coal is 
     <lb/>
     the same as I said in regard to land, that 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government under stress for 
     <lb/>
     the raising of a revenue might very well 
     <lb/>
     place a royalty on coal that would be a 
     <lb/>
     bar to the development of the industry in 
     <lb/>
     the stages through which it must pass while 
     <lb/>
     awaiting the development of the market. 
     <lb/>
     At the present time there is a royalty charg<lb break="no"/>ed on coal by this government. This royal<lb break="no"/>ty of ten cents a ton is levied on coal min<lb break="no"/>ed under land granted on certain conditions. 
     <lb/>
     Other and adjoining land granted under 
     <lb/>
     different circumstances produces coal, but 
     <lb/>
     pays no royalty and I am credibly in<lb break="no"/>formed, that the circumstances belng as 
     <lb/>
     they are, the difference of ten cents a ton is 
     <lb/>
     sufficient to put out of business the coal 
     <lb/>
     mine—it is local mines that I am speak<lb break="no"/>ing of—that has to pay that royalty as 
     <lb/>
     compared with the one that does not pay 
     <lb/>
     royalty. I submit we cannot afford to have 
     <lb/>
     our coal industry any more than our 
     <lb/>
     land settlement placed in jeopardy by plac<lb break="no"/>ing it in the danger of provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment which might very well be in financial 
     <lb/>
     stress as is the government of every pro<lb break="no"/>vince of the Dominion at the present time— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD1">Mr. BRODER</persName>. Would they not likely be 
     <lb/>
     as anxious for development as the federal 
     <lb/>
     government ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Surely, they might be an<lb break="no"/>xious, but if they had not the means, they 
     <lb/>
     could not do what they might desire to do 
     <lb/>
     and the experience of every government 
     <lb/>
     of every province of this Dominion is that 
     <lb/>
     they are under financial difficulties. Their 
     <lb/>
     provincial revenues are not equal to their 
     <lb/>
     provincial expenditures in scarcely any 
     <lb/>
     instance, they are continually looking for 
     <lb/>
     other sources of revenue and under the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances it certainly seems very plain 
     <lb/>
     that the danger to the development of the 
     <lb/>
     natural resources of the country is too 
     <lb/>
     great. We cannot afford to take the risk. 
     <lb/>
     We have heard of the great province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario. It is a great province and it has a 
     <lb/>
     great people. It has a great undeveloped 
     <lb/>
     area and in that great undeveloped area 
     <lb/>
     is a vast clay belt, we are told—a clay 
     <lb/>
     belt suitable for settlement, awaiting set<lb break="no"/>tlement and we have a vigorous government 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Ontario. We have had 
     <lb/>
     one for many years and we have one now, 
     <lb/>
     we suppose. Has the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     at any time, or under any circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     or in any way successfully placed one 
     <lb/>
     single settler upon that great clay belt 
     <lb/>
     of Northern Ontario? Where has been 
     <lb/>
     the immigrant policy of the government 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario ? Where has been their policy 
     <lb/>
     of development of their great northern 
     <lb/>

     plain facts and it is open to any hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the House to correct me it I am in<lb break="no"/>correct. I am laying down the principle 
     <lb/>
     that no provincial government is circum<lb break="no"/>stanced to undertake the work of the de<lb break="no"/>velopement of a new country as is the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government, because it derives its 
     <lb/>
     revenue from a different source and where

     the Dominion government has good and 
     <lb/>
     sufficient reasons for inducing free settle<lb break="no"/>ment by the expenditure of large amounts 
     <lb/>
     of money, no provincial government has any 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     a day for provincial rights in the House 
     <lb/>
     of its old friends. Apparently the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces can do nothing. They are not able 
     <lb/>
     to administer public lands or public trusts, 
     <lb/>
     and if they were given charge of their 
     <lb/>
     estate they would only squander it. That 
     <lb/>
     apparently is the view of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. That is the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's statement.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. No, it is the

     statement of hon. gentlemen opposite, and 
     <lb/>
     especially of the hon. Minister of the In 
     <lb/>
     terior (Mr. Oliver). Later on in this dis<lb break="no"/>cussion I intend to move a resolution some<lb break="no"/>thing on these lines: that this clause be 
     <lb/>
     amended by the substitution of terms giv<lb break="no"/>ing at least half the coal areas in each 
     <lb/>
     of the new provinces to the respective gov<lb break="no"/>ernments of those provinces. If there is 
     <lb/>
     any thing that the west is rich in it is in 
     <lb/>
     coal, and if there is anything the future, of 
     <lb/>
     the west depends on it is coal. Unless 
     <lb/>
     these settlers are assured for all time of 
     <lb/>
     the control of a cheap supply of coal, they 
     <lb/>
     run the risk of passing under a coal mon<lb break="no"/>opoly, as in the United States, where all 
     <lb/>
     the great cold areas, especially the Anth<lb break="no"/>racite coal regions in Pennsylvania, have 
     <lb/>
     passed into the hands of barons, so that

     in our western country ? The members 
     <lb/>
     from the west should insist that at least 
     <lb/>
     one-half of the coal areas should pass to the

     least make provision now for one half of

     it. Just as sure as there is a sun in heaven, 
     <lb/>
     that coal will be given away in grants of

     that, but if we have two trustees like the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government and the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government it might be better protected 
     <lb/>
     than if we had only one trustee. There 
     <lb/>
     should be an arrangement between the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government and the local govern<lb break="no"/>ment; that this coal land will be kept for 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. If Saskatchewan

     has no coal fields, then I am willing that 
     <lb/>
     she should have an interest in these coal 
     <lb/>
     areas. I preach the new doctrine in this 
     <lb/>
     House; that the people of the west should 
     <lb/>
     be partners of the Dominion government 
     <lb/>
     in the ownership and control of this public 
     <lb/>
     domain, and I challenge any man here from 
     <lb/>
     the west to deny that that is a sound pro<lb break="no"/>position. Later on I intend to make a pro<lb break="no"/>posal that these new provinces should have 
     <lb/>
     at least one-half interest in the coal depo<lb break="no"/>sits of that new country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HERR2">Mr. HERRON</persName>. The Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior suggested that the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment would sell the lands cheaply for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of developing the country, but I 
     <lb/>
     can point out to him that the sales they 
     <lb/>
     have made along the foothills have not had 
     <lb/>
     that effect. There was a sale made six or 
     <lb/>
     seven years ago of 10,000 acres to a foreign 
     <lb/>
     company, another sale of 15,000 acres to an<lb break="no"/>other company a few years ago, and not one 
     <lb/>
     shovel full of earth has been turned since. 
     <lb/>
     That land will be valuable in time to come, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not believe it is a good policy for 
     <lb/>
     the country that the government should sell 
     <lb/>
     it now at a nominal figure and allow it to 
     <lb/>
     remain there undeveloped. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. That proves that what we 
     <lb/>
     need in Alberta is a market for the coal in 
     <lb/>
     order to give it value, and that in the pro<lb break="no"/>cess of development we must be careful 
     <lb/>
     how the business is handled or it will check 
     <lb/>
     that development. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I would not look 
     <lb/>
     at it in that way. I would think that the 
     <lb/>
     people who take up these coal lands should 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5540</fw>
           

     either develop them or pay a rental until 
     <lb/>
     the market does come. Why should they 
     <lb/>
     be permitted, without contributing one dol<lb break="no"/>lar to the revenue of the country, to hold 
     <lb/>
     for thirty or forty years, coal lands that 
     <lb/>
     will be worth millions of dollars and per<lb break="no"/>haps tens of millions of dollars at that time 
     <lb/>
     if the country is well settled ? I cannot un<lb break="no"/>derstand why in the name of common sense 
     <lb/>
     such a policy should be adopted. In most 
     <lb/>
     countries where these matters are well 
     <lb/>
     thought out the coal areas are leased and 
     <lb/>
     not sold out right. If they are not worked 
     <lb/>
     so as to produce a royalty, the people who 
     <lb/>
     hold these lands must pay an annual rental, 
     <lb/>
     so that they shall contribute something from 
     <lb/>
     year to year in respect to the increased value 
     <lb/>
     that these coal lands acquire through their 
     <lb/>
     being held. Both the Prime Minister and 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior stated this af<lb break="no"/>ternoon that these lands are of great im<lb break="no"/>portance to the people of the west, and 
     <lb/>
     that if they were handed over to them they 
     <lb/>
     would have to depend very largely upon 
     <lb/>
     these lands for revenue. They argued that 
     <lb/>
     the provinces would be less likely to take 
     <lb/>
     good care of them than would the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion government to whom these lands are of 
     <lb/>
     much less moment. I should think that ar<lb break="no"/>gument would work the other way. These 
     <lb/>
     lands are of direct local concern to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the province, and in my view 
     <lb/>
     the province is more likely to take good 
     <lb/>
     care of them than is the Dominion. I do 
     <lb/>
     not know why we should suppose that the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest are any more reck<lb break="no"/>less, any less capable or any less honest 
     <lb/>
     than the people of Canada as a whole, or 
     <lb/>
     why the representatives of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     west assembled in their legislature would 
     <lb/>
     be any less capable, any less prudent or any 
     <lb/>
     less provident than the people of Canada as 
     <lb/>
     a whole. If they are not less capable, less 
     <lb/>
     provident, or less honest, surely they would 
     <lb/>
     be likely to take better and not worse care 
     <lb/>
     of these lands than the federal legislature.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I do not know exactly 
     <lb/>
     what the suggestion of charging an annual 
     <lb/>
     rental on coal property has to do with the 
     <lb/>
     subject under discussion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I will tell you. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman, (Mr. Oliver) said that these 
     <lb/>
     lands could not be developed because there 
     <lb/>
     is no market for the coal, and therefore, to 
     <lb/>
     follow out his argument to its logical re<lb break="no"/>sult; it is a wise policy to sell these lands 
     <lb/>
     to speculators who will hold them until 
     <lb/>
     there is a market, and pay nothing to the 
     <lb/>
     public revenue while the increment of 
     <lb/>
     value is being added. I say that is not 
     <lb/>
     good policy, I say that in the meantime 
     <lb/>
     these speculators should pay an annual 
     <lb/>
     rental to the public treasury in order to give 
     <lb/>
     at least some compensation for the enorm<lb break="no"/>ous profits which they in the end will make 
     <lb/>
     out of these coal lands.

            <p>

     in regard to these lands, but 1 do not see 
     <lb/>
     what it has to do with the question as to 
     <lb/>
     whether the Dominion or the province 
     <lb/>
     should carry out such a policy.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I will endeavour 
     <lb/>
     to make it plain. I say that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories are just as honest, just as 
     <lb/>
     capable and just as provident as the people 
     <lb/>
     of the rest of Canada ; and seeing this thing 
     <lb/>
     occurring under their own eyes they would 
     <lb/>
     be much more likely to stop it than we 
     <lb/>
     seem to have been during the past ten, or 
     <lb/>
     fifteen, or twenty years.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I do not dis<lb break="no"/>pute and nobody will dispute that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Territories whether they are 
     <lb/>
     represented in this House or in their legis<lb break="no"/>lative assemblies are the same, but my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend will agree with me that the 
     <lb/>
     argument I gave him this afternoon is un<lb break="no"/>answerable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I think it is, but 
     <lb/>
     in the very opposite direction. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. My hon. 
     <lb/>friend does not apprehend the argument; 
     <lb/>it is this, that if a government, whether 
     <lb/>it be a local or a federal government, gets 
     <lb/>in trouble financially, the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment has more resources to fall back 
     <lb/>upon than a local government; the local 
     <lb/>government has no resources other than it 
     <lb/>own lands, and therefore they are more 
     <lb/>liable to sacrifice these lands to meet an 
     <lb/>immediate contingency than the Dominion 
     <lb/>government will be. Let us look at the 
     <lb/>experience of the past. There is no deny<lb break="no"/>ing that most of the provincial governments 
     <lb/>are not at the present time in a very flourish<lb break="no"/>ing condition financially; most of them are 
     <lb/>more or less embarrassed, and moreover I 
     <lb/>do not think, judging from the past, that 
     <lb/>my hon. friend has a bright example as to 
     <lb/>the administration of public lands by the 
     <lb/>several provinces. Take the neighbouring 
     <lb/>province of British Columbia. They gave 
     <lb/>away their domain, they gave away the 
     <lb/>richest mineral lands they had, the coal 
     <lb/>lands for a mere song, and when in 1897 
     <lb/>the Canadian Pacific Railway came here 
     <lb/>for a subsidy to assist them to build the 
     <lb/>Crow's Ness Pass line they already had 
     <lb/>an enormous subsidy in lands from the 
     <lb/>British Columbia legislature, an enormous 
     <lb/>subsidy, so large indeed that before we 
     <lb/>gave any assistance to the company to 
     <lb/>build that line, we compelled it to surren<lb break="no"/>der to us 50,000 acres of their best coal 
     <lb/>lands which we keep as a reserve, so that 
     <lb/>the people will have under all circumstan<lb break="no"/>ces the benefit of the coal that is there. 
     <lb/>"We were not satisfied with the reservation 
     <lb/>of 50,000 acres of coal lands, but, it I re<lb break="no"/>member aright, we also compelled the com<lb break="no"/>pany to sell their coal at a stated price, 
     <lb/>which we were sure would prevent any 
     <lb/>monopoly of those lands, and would have 
     <lb/>the effect of preventing the very thing

     which terrifies my hon. friend from South 
     <lb/>
     York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) in his new zeal 
     <lb/>
     for provincial rights. That zeal altogether 
     <lb/>
     new and only of short duration because I 
     <lb/>
     remember only last year he was deprecat<lb break="no"/>ing the mistake made by Sir John Mac<lb break="no"/>donald in permitting a federal government 
     <lb/>
     and in not having a legislative union.

     my hon. friend from South York (Mr. W. F. 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     but a feeble glimmer to that which has 
     <lb/>
     come to the right hon. gentleman and those 
     <lb/>
     on that side of the House. I still do not 
     <lb/>
     agree—

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I did not ex<lb break="no"/>pect the hon. gentleman would.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>—with the premier's 
     <lb/>
     argument. I did not suppose in his heart 
     <lb/>
     that he expected that any one would agree 
     <lb/>
     with him because after all his argument 
     <lb/>
     does not rest on much. He says that these 
     <lb/>
     provinces are likely to be in great stress 
     <lb/>
     fnancially while the Dominion government 
     <lb/>
     is always likely to have plenty of money. 
     <lb/>
     That may or may not be; we cannot al<lb break="no"/>ways foretell. I still base my faith 
     <lb/>
     upon this that if those lands are of 
     <lb/>
     more importance to the province than they 
     <lb/>
     are to the Dominion as a whole, and if 
     <lb/>
     their people are equally honest and cap<lb break="no"/>able, we may expect them to take better 
     <lb/>
     care of the public domain than we could 
     <lb/>
     possibly do. We surely should not attri<lb break="no"/>bute to the people of those provinces so 
     <lb/>
     extremely reckless a disposition as to be<lb break="no"/>lieve that they will sell their birthright for 
     <lb/>
     a mess of pottage, simply because of a 
     <lb/>
     temporary stringency. That is all the pre<lb break="no"/>mier's argument amounts to. Some pro<lb break="no"/>vinces may not have administered their 
     <lb/>
     public domain wisely; I am not contend<lb break="no"/>ing that they always have done so, but 
     <lb/>
     has it not been the argument of my right 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend and his followers that this Do<lb break="no"/>minion has not always administered the 
     <lb/>
     public domain wisely? How often have 
     <lb/>
     I heard the changes rung upon that as one 
     <lb/>
     of the misdeeds of the Conservatives in 
     <lb/>
     the past, and yet my right hon. friend and 
     <lb/>
     his colleagues were willing in 1875 to give 
     <lb/>
     twice as much land to have the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Pacific Railway built as was eventually 
     <lb/>
     given by Sir John Macdonald, so that both 
     <lb/>
     political parties in the Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, have not according to the argument 
     <lb/>
     made on the other side of the House been

     gard. I do not know enough about the 
     <lb/>
     history of the province of British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     to be prepared to offer an opinion upon the 
     <lb/>
     wisdom of the administration of the pub<lb break="no"/>lic domain of that province. I know that 
     <lb/>
     in my own province I do not approve of 
     <lb/>
     the way the Crown lands have been admin<lb break="no"/>istered; they have been sold instead of 
     <lb/>
     being leased under proper control as to 
     <lb/>
     cutting upon them. In Quebec, as I un<lb break="no"/>derstand, there is a system of leasing 
     <lb/>
     which perhaps may not always have been 
     <lb/>
     carried out very wisely, and in Ontario 
     <lb/>
     there is also a system of leasing and I be<lb break="no"/>lieve in respect to the Crown lands, in res<lb break="no"/>pect to minerals, in respect to the public 
     <lb/>
     domain generally, it would be wise for 
     <lb/>
     the province to retain the ownership and 
     <lb/>
     lease subject to annual rentals as far as 
     <lb/>
     that policy is reasonably practicable. It 
     <lb/>
     has been followed with great success in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia with respect to minerals and 
     <lb/>
     if it were not for the revenue derived from 
     <lb/>
     minerals, Nova Scotia would have an an<lb break="no"/>nual deficit of a large amount or the public 
     <lb/>
     services would have to be provided for 
     <lb/>
     much less liberally than they are at pre<lb break="no"/>sent.

     <lb/>
     of the opinion that the lands ought to be 
     <lb/>
     handed over to the management of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest. I submit that they could 
     <lb/>
     manage them much more economically than 
     <lb/>
     they can be managed from Ottawa no mat<lb break="no"/>ter what party may be in power. They 
     <lb/>
     are the people on the ground. We have in 
     <lb/>
     this House ten representatives for the 
     <lb/>
     whole Northwest to voice the views of the 
     <lb/>
     people there, but in the two legislatures 
     <lb/>
     that will be formed there will I think be 
     <lb/>
     fifty representatives, there will be repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from every section of that coun<lb break="no"/>try. I submit that they are much more 
     <lb/>
     interested than we can possibly be in the 
     <lb/>
     development of that country. I have dif<lb break="no"/>ferent reasons why I would like to see the 
     <lb/>
     land in the hands of the people there. I
     <lb/>
     do not think the right policy is being fol<lb break="no"/>lowed now in regard to the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of these Northwest lands. Under the 
     <lb/>
     immigration arrangements that were intro<lb break="no"/>duced by the Interior Department, the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were I believe giving each alter<lb break="no"/>nate quarter section to prospective settlers, 
     <lb/>
     and I think selling the next quarter section 
     <lb/>
     in order to raise a revenue sufficient to carry 
     <lb/>
     on the management of the lands. Now it 
     <lb/>
     is proposed to hold these lands as a source 
     <lb/>
     of revenue. If this policy is carried out, 
     <lb/>
     we might ask ourselves how much revenue 
     <lb/>
     we are to get from it. If we have lost 
     <lb/>
     more than $1,000,000 in the past, will we 
     <lb/>
     not lose a million in the future if this 
     <lb/>
     policy is continued, so that ultimately these 
     <lb/>
     lands will be all gone and nobody will have 
     <lb/>
     been benefited, because I submit that in 
     <lb/>
     giving a quarter section to each settler 
     <lb/>
     we are not fulfilling all our duties in re<lb break="no"/>
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5544</fw>
         

     gard to settlement, because as any one who 
     <lb/>
     is familiar with that country knows, a 
     <lb/>
     quarter section is not sufficient to establish 
     <lb/>
     a settler in the west. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Provision should be made for at least 
     <lb/>
     another quarter section to every prospective 
     <lb/>
     settler ; and I think that the ex-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior (Mr. Sifton) when he proposed 
     <lb/>
     putting a motion of that kind some time ago, 
     <lb/>
     intended to allow the settler to have the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of buying the quarter section 
     <lb/>
     alongside of him. That, I think, would be a 
     <lb/>
     move in the right direction. It would be an 
     <lb/>
     improvement on the present policy of giving 
     <lb/>
     the quarter section at a nominal rate to 
     <lb/>
     some company or partnership or individual 
     <lb/>
     who will hold the land for speculation. To 
     <lb/>
     allow such lands to be held for speculative 
     <lb/>
     purposes is a natural hinderance to the 
     <lb/>
     settlement of the Northwest, because it aug<lb break="no"/>ments the price which the settler will eventu<lb break="no"/>ally have to pay ; and every dollar added to 
     <lb/>
     the price of the land is so much in the way 
     <lb/>
     of the settlement of that country. The 
     <lb/>
     proper policy would be to extend the present 
     <lb/>
     condition of giving a quarter section by pro<lb break="no"/>viding that the actual settler, who cultivates 
     <lb/>
     the ground, will have the opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     buying another quarter section at a reason<lb break="no"/>able price. To-day, after he gets the first 
     <lb/>
     quarter section for nothing, he finds himself 
     <lb/>
     against the land of some speculator, and is 
     <lb/>
     forced to pay from $6 to $15 an acre before 
     <lb/>
     he can get the next quarter section. Two 
     <lb/>
     or three days ago I had a conversation with 
     <lb/>
     a man who tried to get land out there and 
     <lb/>
     found the diffculty so great that he actually 
     <lb/>
     came back in disgust and refused to settle 
     <lb/>
     under the present conditions. These people 
     <lb/>
     say that if proper conditions were imposed, 
     <lb/>
     they would move out there this spring and 
     <lb/>
     become settlers, but of course greater in<lb break="no"/>ducements are given to Doukhobors and 
     <lb/>
     Galicians and so on than to the young men 
     <lb/>
     from other parts of Canada. One gentleman 
     <lb/>
     that I saw said that he went up there to a 
     <lb/>
     land oflice and was pointed out a certain 
     <lb/>
     number of quarter sections upon which he 
     <lb/>
     might locate. After going out at consider<lb break="no"/>able expense and selecting one, when he 
     <lb/>
     came back and tried to enter for location he 
     <lb/>
     was coolly told that they promised to hold 
     <lb/>
     it six months for some man in Ottawa, and 
     <lb/>
     that if he would wait until the spring and 
     <lb/>
     this man did not want the land, he could 
     <lb/>
     have it. After two or three similar experi<lb break="no"/>ences he came away in disgust, and has 
     <lb/>
     probably given up any notion of locating in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest. If the present policy be con<lb break="no"/>tinued, it will materially affect the settle<lb break="no"/>ment of that country. I do submit that if 
     <lb/>
     the people there had the management of the 
     <lb/>
     lands, they would administer it economically, 
     <lb/>
     promote settlement to a larger exent than is 
     <lb/>
     being done to-day, and save a large sum of 
     <lb/>
     money to this government. Even looking 
     <lb/>
     at the question from the standpoint only of 
     <lb/>
     economy, we would be making money for 
     <lb/>
     this Dominion and the Northwest by allow<lb break="no"/>

<fw type="num">5545</fw> <fw type="dateline">MAY 8, 1905</fw> 

     ing these new provinces to handle the lands 
     <lb/>
     themselves. They are more interested in 
     <lb/>
     getting good settlers than we can possibly 
     <lb/>
     be, because it is they who will suffer if 
     <lb/>
     settlement is retarded. Looking at it from 
     <lb/>
     every standpoint, I do not see what we have 
     <lb/>
     to gain by administering the lands from here. 
     <lb/>
     After all the money is gone, which we will 
     <lb/>
     get from the sales of lands in the future, we 
     <lb/>
     will have to dip into the Dominion treasury 
     <lb/>
     to pay the running expenses in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the management of lands in the North 
     <lb/>
     west, so that to continue the present policy 
     <lb/>
     would be suicidal, if only from a financial 
     <lb/>
     standpoint. There are many other consider<lb break="no"/>ations I might dwell upon, such as the 
     <lb/>
     giving away of vast coal lands. Last 
     <lb/>
     fall a large area was given away at 
     <lb/>
     $1.25 an acre and other large areas 
     <lb/>
     handed over to companies at insignificant 
     <lb/>
     sums. That is a policy which ought to be 
     <lb/>
     stopped. If these coal lands are not of any 
     <lb/>
     value we might as well hand them over to 
     <lb/>
     the Territories. We might as well do that in 
     <lb/>
     any event for all that we are getting for 
     <lb/>
     them. To say that the new provinces would 
     <lb/>
     squander and mismanage the lands is an in<lb break="no"/>sult to the people. The only good reason ad<lb break="no"/>vanced so far is that advanced by the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister, that the provinces might be in dis<lb break="no"/>tress for money; but I do not think that 
     <lb/>
     these local goverments, which will have the 
     <lb/>
     same ability to borrow as other local gov<lb break="no"/>ernments, need be in any want of money, 
     <lb/>
     and we can as well afford to give them a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable monetary annual payment as we 
     <lb/>
     can to the other provinces. The other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces have their lands and yet get an 
     <lb/>
     annual subsidy of so much per head. Why 
     <lb/>
     not treat the Territories in like manner ? 
     <lb/>
     They should be given the same rights as the 
     <lb/>
     older provinces and be treated with as much 
     <lb/>
     fairness and consideration, and I have not 
     <lb/>
     yet heard any good reason why this should 
     <lb/>
     not be done.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. The right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman should 'have been a Chancery lawyer, 
     <lb/>
     for once he gets a ward in Chancery, he 
     <lb/>
     wants to keep it there all his life. Evidently 
     <lb/>
     that is his intention in the case of these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. He wishes to keep them as wards 
     <lb/>
     in Chancery and to manage their affairs for 
     <lb/>
     all time. He did tell us, when he introduced 
     <lb/>
     these Bills, that he was putting on the 
     <lb/>
     coping stone, that he was completing the 
     <lb/>
     emancipation of that country, but evidently 
     <lb/>
     his intention is to keep the west in the condi<lb break="no"/>tion of wards for all time. The new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are not to be free to administer their 
     <lb/>
     own public lands but are to be treated as 
     <lb/>
     wards and the Dominion is to be their per<lb break="no"/>petual trustee. Perhaps the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman is more anxious about the patronage 
     <lb/>
     than anything else and thinks that his sunny 
     <lb/>
     measures will be promoted by having this 
     <lb/>
     large patronage at his disposal. I am sur<lb break="no"/>prised at the moderation of my own views 
     <lb/>
     in the matter of paternal government when 
     <lb/>
     I see this governments <choice><sic>poposition</sic><corr>proposition</corr></choice>, which is

     <fw type="num">5546</fw>
         

     paternalism in its rankest form. There is to 
     <lb/>
     be no emancipation of the provinces, no pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights, no trusting the people of the 
     <lb/>
     west to manage their own affairs. They are 
     <lb/>
     instead to be managed by the Dominion and 
     <lb/>
     the control of their own financial heritage is 
     <lb/>
     to be taken out of their hands. Again I 
     <lb/>
     would ask the right hon. gentleman to 
     <lb/>
     answer the question proposed by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake), with re<lb break="no"/>gard to this new territory in Keewatin. If 
     <lb/>
     it is to be divided up among the provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario, is On<lb break="no"/>tario to be given a deed to the Crown lands 
     <lb/>
     it takes over and are the other provinces to 
     <lb/>
     be still in the position of wards and not to 
     <lb/>
     be given control of these lands ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I intended to 
     <lb/>
     answer the question of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
    Qu'Appelle, but did not understand exactly 
     <lb/>what it was. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. The question I put is this. 
     <lb/>
     If the lands of Keewatin are to be divided 
     <lb/>
     among the provinces of Ontario and Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and the new province of Saskatchewan, 
     <lb/>
     will the lands, which are to be included in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario, be placed absolutely 
     <lb/>
     in the possesion of that province ? If that 
     <lb/>
     be the intention, will the same treatment he 
     <lb/>
     meted out to Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 
     <lb/>
     and will they enter into full possession of 
     <lb/>
     those lands ? It seems to me that unless 
     <lb/>
     Ontario were placed in full possession of her 
     <lb/>
     slice of territory, the government might find 
     <lb/>
     that the precedent they are now setting 
     <lb/>
     would create a demand on the part of On<lb break="no"/>tario for a subsidy in lieu of these lands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I must say to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend that I had not considered 
     <lb/>
     this aspect of the question. There was 
     <lb/>
     no necessity, I believe, for the government 
     <lb/>
     to come to any decision upon this point, 
     <lb/>
     especially in view of the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     the subject was brought up. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend is aware that when we brought down 
     <lb/>
     this Bill we did not include in Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan the whole of the area included in that 
     <lb/>
     territory. The territory in Keewatin is 
     <lb/>
     also claimed by the province of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     And I have no doubt, from the representa<lb break="no"/>tions made to me that the province of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan will also claim that portion of 
     <lb/>
     the territory. The province of Ontario has 
     <lb/>
     signified its intention to claim that its 
     <lb/>
     boundaries should be extended to the shores 
     <lb/>
     of Hudson bay. Under these circumstances 
     <lb/>
     the government decided not to dispose of 
     <lb/>
     the territory, but to wait and have a con<lb break="no"/>ference with the representatives of Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and Saskatchewan, with a view 
     <lb/>
     to disposing of this territory. I am not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to say, at the present time, what 
     <lb/>
     the government should do. The only thing 
     <lb/>
     I can say, speaking for the government, is 
     <lb/>
     that we think it fair and just that the re<lb break="no"/>presentations of these several  provinces 
     <lb/>
     should be heard before a decision is come to.

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Oh, in due time. 
     <lb/>
     I did not know but that the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman had a preference for a summer ses<lb break="no"/>sion. The Prime Minister has already 
     <lb/>
     practically admitted that a statement made 
     <lb/>
     by a member of this House in the constitu<lb break="no"/>ency of Mountain, in the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, embodied a decision which would be 
     <lb/>
     accepted by the government. And that 
     <lb/>
     statement, speaking from recollection, was 
     <lb/>
     that a portion of the territory not yet ap<lb break="no"/>propriated would be divided in this way; 
     <lb/>
     the line would run, I think from the north<lb break="no"/>east boundary of Manitoba, or some point 
     <lb/>
     near there, up Churchill river to Fort 
     <lb/>
     Churchill, then down the coast of Hudson 
     <lb/>
     bay to Weenisk river to Weenisk lake, then 
     <lb/>
     to Fishing lake at the boundary of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario and thence south to the 
     <lb/>
     49th parallel. This was to be the new 
     <lb/>
     boundary of the province of Manitoba. The 
     <lb/>
     portion of the land to the north and west 
     <lb/>
     would go to Saskatchewan and the portion 
     <lb/>
     to the east would go to Ontario. That 
     <lb/>
     division, as not only one but two hon. 
     <lb/>
     members of the House stated, and as 
     <lb/>
     practically the Prime Minister has said 
     <lb/>
     would be adopted. The question that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Qu'Appelle asks is this: 
     <lb/>
     Having decided upon that course, you must 
     <lb/>
     have come to some conclusion whether you 
     <lb/>
     will or will not, in that portion of the ter<lb break="no"/>ritory to be handed over to Ontario, carry 
     <lb/>
     out exactly the same policy which you 
     <lb/>
     are carrying out with respect to these 
     <lb/>
     new provinces. In other words: You 
     <lb/>
     will add to the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     30,000 or 40,000 square miles of terri<lb break="no"/>tory. Will you reserve the public domain, 
     <lb/>
     in these lands to this government, or 
     <lb/>
     will that domain pass over to be admi<lb break="no"/>nistered by the province of Ontario as other 
     <lb/>
     provincial lands of Ontario are administer<lb break="no"/>ed ? If you do hand this public domain over 
     <lb/>
     to Ontario, will or will you not adopt the 
     <lb/>
     same principle with regard to Manitoba? 
     <lb/>
     And, if you carry out the policy of trans<lb break="no"/>ferring the public domain to these two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, how shall you make any exception 
     <lb/>
     in the case of the province of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan ? And, if you carry out that policy in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Saskatchewan in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the added territory, what reason can pos<lb break="no"/>sibly be given for withholding the lands in 
     <lb/>
     the remainder of the province? It seems a 
     <lb/>
     very logical sequence, and I should think 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5548</fw>
           

     it could afford some room for reflection by 
     <lb/>
     the government. I assume that practically 
     <lb/>
     the government will get out of it by not 
     <lb/>
     handing over any land to Ontario. And 
     <lb/>
     thus that fine province may find itself di<lb break="no"/>vested of a certain amount of territory be<lb break="no"/>cause a difficulty arises through the incon<lb break="no"/>sistent conduct of the government.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, there is one matter I wish to bring 
     <lb/>
     to the attention of the member for West 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia (Mr. Scott). It relates to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's attitude toward provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy. I have a little reference to some 
     <lb/>
     remarks of his. He referred to a certain 
     <lb/>
     proposal I made which was mentioned this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon. I said, in the first place, that I 
     <lb/>
     thought the lands ought to be handed over 
     <lb/>
     to the control and administration of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, I adverted to the arguments of 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister that that would be dan<lb break="no"/>gerous to the immigration policy of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. I thought there should be no 
     <lb/>
     such danger, but I suggested that if the 
     <lb/>
     government were of opinion that there was 
     <lb/>
     such a danger, they might hand over the 
     <lb/>
     land of the province on certain stipula<lb break="no"/>tions with regard to free homesteads, to 
     <lb/>
     which the consent of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories would be obtained. 
     <lb/>
     On this point the hon. member for Western 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia said :

     I repeat, Mr. Speaker, that I am amazed that

            <p>
     As I understand him, in his opinion it is   
     <lb/>
     an invasion of provincial autonomy to hand 
     <lb/>
     these lands over to the province under any 
     <lb/>
     restriction whatever even though the con<lb break="no"/>sent of the people of the Territories, through 
     <lb/>
     their representatives, were obtained-<lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Certainly.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>—but he regards it 
     <lb/>
     not as an invasion of provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     to refuse to hand over any portion of the 
     <lb/>
     lands, but to retain them all in the posses<lb break="no"/>sion of the Dominion government. That 
     <lb/>
     would seem to me a little inconsistent.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I may be permitted to say 
     <lb/>
     that when I made that reference to the sug<lb break="no"/>gestion of my hon. friend I was taking for 
     <lb/>
     the moment his point of view with regard 
     <lb/>
     to autonomy. He was taking the view 
     <lb/>
     that we must lay out the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     upon exactly the same basis as that on 
     <lb/>
     which the four original provinces entered 
     <lb/>
     confederation. For instance, they must be 
     <lb/>
     dealt with in a certain way with regard to 
     <lb/>
     education. He had a particular view 
     <lb/>
     in that matter. They must be dealt with 
     <lb/>
     so and so with regard to the lands, and in 
     <lb/>
     every particular, if I understood my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend aright, it was his view that this par<lb break="no"/>liament was not free to deal as it chose, 
     <lb/>
     but it must follow strictly certain lines 
     <lb/>
     which are laid down in the British North 
     <lb/>

     America Acts from 1867 to 1886 inclusive. 
     <lb/>
     Taking that point of view, I endeavoured 
     <lb/>
     to point out to the hon. gentleman that his 
     <lb/>
     own suggestion involved the most violent 
     <lb/>
     invasion of provincial autonomy I had ever 
     <lb/>
     heard any body give voice to.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Where does the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman find any provision in the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act that substanti<lb break="no"/>ates anything he has said just now ? He 
     <lb/>
     says that my proposal involves some inva<lb break="no"/>sion of provincial autonomy ; what section 
     <lb/>
     or subsection of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act is he referring to ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. It is clear to every person 
     <lb/>
     that the provinces of Nova Scotia, New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario own their 
     <lb/>
     public domain, they are entirely unrestricted 
     <lb/>
     in the usage of their public domain, it is 
     <lb/>
     their chief source of revenue. The province 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia gets much more from its 
     <lb/>
     public domain than it does from the federal 
     <lb/>
     subsidy, so with the province of Ontario, so 
     <lb/>
     with the province of Quebec. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's suggestion was, if I understood him 
     <lb/>
     right, that we were not free to deal with 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     lands in any other way than thosa four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces were dealt with; but then, he said, if 
     <lb/>
     there is a reasonable objection against that, 
     <lb/>
     why not put in this restriction ? Would 
     <lb/>
     it not be the statesmanlike thing to find a 
     <lb/>
     way of adopting the power of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     in their disposal of these lands,' he suggest<lb break="no"/>ed. As I pointed out in my speech on the 
     <lb/>
     second reading, it would he a restriction 
     <lb/>
     that would amount to scores of millions of 
     <lb/>
     dollars to come.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. If he regards that 
     <lb/>
     as an invasion of provincial autonomy, does 
     <lb/>
     he regard it as a greater invasion of provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy to retain the lands altogether 
     <lb/>
     by the Dominion ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. My hon. friend knows my 
     <lb/>
     view with regard to the proposals which are 
     <lb/>
     before the House. My view is that this 
     <lb/>
     parliament has the discretion to give such 
     <lb/>
     constitution to these new provinces as it 
     <lb/>
     chooses to give. We are proposing to pay 
     <lb/>
     a certain amount of money to them in lieu 
     <lb/>
     of their public domain. I have been out in 
     <lb/>
     that country recently and have conversed 
     <lb/>
     with scores of men who take an interest 
     <lb/>
     in this question, and they all agree with 
     <lb/>
     me that this proposal is far better for the 
     <lb/>
     provinces even than the proposal to trans<lb break="no"/>fer the land unrestrictedly to the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces, and that as between the projosal 
     <lb/>
     that is being put into effect and the sugges<lb break="no"/>tion to turn over the public domain with 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend's restriction, there is 
     <lb/>
     no comparison at all. With respect to the 
     <lb/>
     remarks which have been made by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Qu'Appelle going to show that 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest are not satis<lb break="no"/>fied with these land proposals, I asked him 
     <lb/>
     a moment ago. I ask him again now, and I

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5550</fw>
           

     ask the member for South York, if they are 
     <lb/>
     in earnest in what they say about these land 
     <lb/>
     proposals, why did they not take the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to go into the district of Edmonton 
     <lb/>
     and place their policy before the people of 
     <lb/>
     that district ? Surely they had a fine oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of placing their views with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the land question as well as the school 
     <lb/>
     question before the people of Edmonton ? 
     <lb/>
     But I understand they hold that it was no 
     <lb/>
     use to go, because there are a number of 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholics in the district of Edmon<lb break="no"/>ton, and Roman Catholics forsooth, have 
     <lb/>
     no right to express an opinion upon the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional questions involved in this Au<lb break="no"/>tonomy Bill. But whatever reasons may 
     <lb/>
     underlie their contentions as to Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics and schools, surely as regards 
     <lb/>
     lands the interests of the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     and Protestant citizens of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     must be identical. And let me say here 
     <lb/>
     that this land proposition, in the judg<lb break="no"/>ment of the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, is a much more serious, a much 
     <lb/>
     more momentous question than is the ques<lb break="no"/>tion that divides my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Carleton and myself with regard to separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools. There is a certain question 
     <lb/>
     between him and myself as to whether 
     <lb/>
     the settler out there shall have the pri<lb break="no"/>vilege to send his child to a school-house 
     <lb/>
     on section 11 or to a school-house on 
     <lb/>
     section 14. But the settler in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories is more concerned to know 
     <lb/>
     whether he is going to have money enough 
     <lb/>
     to educate his child either in the school<lb break="no"/>house on, section 14 or in the school<lb break="no"/>house on section 11, than in the minor ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to which section his child shall travel 
     <lb/>
     to in going to the school-house. Very 
     <lb/>
     recently, in company with some of my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friends from the Territories and the 
     <lb/>
     new Minister of the Interior, I spent three 
     <lb/>
     weeks in the Northwest Territories, I was 
     <lb/>
     up in the constituency of Edmonton, passed 
     <lb/>
     through the constituency of Strathcona, 
     <lb/>
     spent four or five days in the district of 
     <lb/>
     Calgary, came through my own district, and 
     <lb/>
     put two days in at Regina. During that 
     <lb/>
     time I conversed with scores, if not with 
     <lb/>
     hundreds, of gentlemen, perhaps most of 
     <lb/>
     them Liberals, as would naturally be the 
     <lb/>
     case, but with a great many Conservatives 
     <lb/>
     also, and not a single man of them raised 
     <lb/>
     any objection against the land proposition 
     <lb/>
     of these measures. Many of the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     I spoke to, Liberals, independents and Con<lb break="no"/>servatives, some of them Conservative mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the legislature, spoke to me in strong 
     <lb/>
     terms of approval of the measures before 
     <lb/>
     the House at the present time in particular 
     <lb/>
     relation to the lands.

     <persName ref="pers:COCK3">Mr. COCKSHUTT</persName>. When the Bill was 
     <lb/>
     up for the second reading, I took the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of opposing this particular clause re<lb break="no"/>lating to the financial terms. I think there   
     <lb/>
     are very good reasons why these clauses 
     <lb/>
     should be opposed. I have listened during 
     <lb/>
     the afternoon and evening to hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>

     <fw type="num">5551</fw>                     <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>           
     
     opposite, and I have not been able to gather 
     <lb/>any good reason for changing my views 
     <lb/>on this question. In the first place, the 
     <lb/>financial grant is a large one, it has to 
     <lb/>be paid by the Dominion, therefore every 
     <lb/>province becomes a party to the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment, and it is for every province to de<lb break="no"/>cide whether this grant is too large or 
     <lb/>not. We have been told by the new Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior that we have lots of 
     <lb/>money. That is a very pleasant thing, but 
     <lb/>that may not always be the case, and the 
     <lb/>time will come when taxation will bear 
     <lb/>heavily on this country. Therefore, I think 
     <lb/>these financial terms should be watched very 
     <lb/>closely. I have not heard the Finance Min<lb break="no"/>ister deal with that part of the subject. 
     <lb/>Perhaps he has ways and means of raising 
     <lb/>money that will not embarrass us much in 
     <lb/>the near future. But this is a large question. 
     <lb/>The other provinces, I think, are getting 80 
     <lb/>cents per head as a subsidy from the Do<lb break="no"/>minion treasury. That is perhaps sufficient 
     <lb/>in Ontario, it may be sufficient for the North<lb break="no"/>west, providing they get their land. To 
     <lb/>my mind, this course would be the better 
     <lb/>one to give them a smaller financial grant, 
     <lb/>but to give them possession of the lands, or 
     <lb/>a large portion of the lands. It appears to 
     <lb/>me that in so doing you would place where 
     <lb/>it properly belongs the responsibility for 
     <lb/>the administration of the lands. I listened 
     <lb/>to the Minister of the Interior just now, and 
     <lb/>I must say, if I followed him correctly, that 
     <lb/>he advanced a strange line of argument 
     <lb/>with regard to the land values. I under<lb break="no"/>stood him to make this argument, that the 
     <lb/>more lands we gave away so much more the 
     <lb/>remaining lands increase in value. That is 
     <lb/>a very strange proposition, the more of your 
     <lb/>assets you give away the more you will 
     <lb/>prize what are left—that is what his argu<lb break="no"/>ment amounts to. The more land we give 
     <lb/>away the more we will value those that are 
     <lb/>left. Then, if we continue to give away our 
     <lb/>lands, the time will come when what we 
     <lb/>have left will be worth $100 an acre. But 
     <lb/>would that be in the best interest of settle<lb break="no"/>ment? I think not. We want the lands, 
     <lb/>not only for settlers, but we want them 
     <lb/>especially for the right kind of settlers. 
     <lb/>We want them for good settlers. I 
     <lb/>believe it is very much better that we 
     <lb/>should grow solidly than that we should 
     <lb/>grow rapidly. I do not know whether 
     <lb/>the hon. Minister of the Interior admires 
     <lb/>the class of settlers that is going in there 
     <lb/>now to a very great extent or not, but I 
     <lb/>must say, that, as far as I am aware, and 
     <lb/>I believe this is the view of a great many 
     <lb/>people in Ontario, it is not the right kind of 
     <lb/>settlers that these lands are being given 
     <lb/>away to. We would rather see a better 
     <lb/>class even if we grow more slowly. Rapid 
     <lb/>growth is not the desideratum that we 
     <lb/>should strive for. We should look for 
     <lb/>quality as well as quantity. Therefore, 
     <lb/>I think the hon. gentleman, in pursuing that 
     <lb/>kind of argument, has not justified his posi<lb break="no"/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5552</fw>
   

     tion. He made the further statement that 
     <lb/>
     Ontario has done nothing with her Crown 
     <lb/>
     lands. He says: I want to know where 
     <lb/>
     they have ever placed a single settler up 
     <lb/>
     there. I am not here as the sponsor of the 
     <lb/>
     Ross government. We had that govern<lb break="no"/>ment for thirty years. I did my best to 
     <lb/>
     turn them out and I am glad to say that 
     <lb/>
     we did at last get them out. They gave 
     <lb/>
     away vast tracts of our estate to their 
     <lb/>
     political friends, but there is to-day in 
     <lb/>
     New Ontario a large area of land left 
     <lb/>
     from which a good deal of revenue will 
     <lb/>
     accrue to us for generations to come. If 
     <lb/>
     these lands in the west are worth as much 
     <lb/>
     as it is said they are and if they were 
     <lb/>
     handed over the government of that coun<lb break="no"/>try could be sustained for years and gen<lb break="no"/>erations on them. It would seem, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the hon. gentleman, that the people 
     <lb/>
     of the west should say : We will part with 
     <lb/>
     our inheritance, but we will take a mess 
     <lb/>
     of potage for it. These $2,000,000 will be 
     <lb/>
     only a mess of potage as compared with 
     <lb/>
     the value of these lands in years to come. 
     <lb/>
     Just compare that with the position of 
     <lb/>
     a man who has fallen heir to a great 
     <lb/>
     estate and who, on the death of his father, 
     <lb/>
     says that he prefers to retire on a life an<lb break="no"/>nuity and refuses to take any responsibility 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the management of 
     <lb/>
     his estate. What would you say of such a. 
     <lb/>
     man? Would you not say that he was 
     <lb/>
     a coward ? So he would be, because he 
     <lb/>
     would be laying down his birthright, sell<lb break="no"/>ing it for a mess of potage. Man is here for 
     <lb/>
     something more than to take an annuity and 
     <lb/>
     to live for ever in peaceful retirement. He 
     <lb/>
     should take the responsibility that falls to 
     <lb/>
     his lot. Why should these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     be put in a different position from that oc<lb break="no"/>cupied by the other provinces ? All the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces have their Crown lands 
     <lb/>
     except Manitoba. Have you any reason 
     <lb/>
     for making an exception in this case ? They 
     <lb/>
     are the most competent and the best able 
     <lb/>
     to administer these lands. They are on the 
     <lb/>
     spot. If there is anything wrong in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the administration of these 
     <lb/>
     lands these people are in the best position 
     <lb/>
     to make it right. They are the people to say 
     <lb/>
     what class of settlers they want in that 
     <lb/>
     country. They may say: We will take 
     <lb/>
     them a little slower but we will get the 
     <lb/>
     right kind. We will take the kind that will 
     <lb/>
     be a big boon to the country, that will build 
     <lb/>
     straight and true and right and if they do 
     <lb/>
     that they will not regret the policy of a lit<lb break="no"/>tle slower growth, of more solid growth, 
     <lb/>
     but of growth on right lines. Look at the 
     <lb/>
     great United States to the south of us. All 
     <lb/>
     that is best in that great republic came 
     <lb/>
     from that first little band of settlers who 
     <lb/>
     landed on Plymouth Rock. They are 
     <lb/>
     the people who laid the corner stone and 
     <lb/>
     set the foundation of that great republic. 
     <lb/>
     All that is truest and best in the United 
     <lb/>
     States to-day has descended from that lit<lb break="no"/>tle band of settlers that came out from 
     <lb/>

     Great Britain to seek freedom and the 
     <lb/>
     privilege of worshipping God in their own 
     <lb/>
     way. These people came out and 
     <lb/>
     laid the foundation of that great republic. 
     <lb/>
     To-day we are growing faster in the North<lb break="no"/>west than we have been doing in the past, 
     <lb/>
     I question very much if the Department 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior, of whose wise adminis<lb break="no"/>tration we have heard so much, is exercis<lb break="no"/>ing the care and wisdom which it should 
     <lb/>
     exercise in the settlement of that coun<lb break="no"/>try. I think it would be better if we 
     <lb/>
     selected our settlers a little more carefully. 
     <lb/>
     I think these lands should be worth some<lb break="no"/>thing to the settler coming in. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Muskoka (Mr. Wright) has 
     <lb/>
     stated that a Canadian has not the same 
     <lb/>
     advantages going in there as a man com<lb break="no"/>ing from a foreign country. If that is 
     <lb/>
     so it is a condition which should be recti<lb break="no"/>fied. Why should not the son of the Can<lb break="no"/>adian farmer receive as good treatment 
     <lb/>
     as the man coming from the old country? 
     <lb/>
     I cannot understand that. It strikes me 
     <lb/>
     as a strange thing that a Canadian is not 
     <lb/>
     receiving as good treatment as one who 
     <lb/>
     comes from a foreign land. Many of On<lb break="no"/>tario's best sons have gone to the North<lb break="no"/>west. Thousands and thousands have gone 
     <lb/>
     from Ontario and those are the kind of 
     <lb/>
     men we want in the Northwest. I com<lb break="no"/>mend to my hon. friend the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior this matter and I would ask 
     <lb/>
     him to see to it that the right kind of set<lb break="no"/>tlers go into that country. Do not be in 
     <lb/>
     too great a hurry to give away these lands. 
     <lb/>
     I understand that he says that we can make 
     <lb/>
     money out of giving them away, but I 
     <lb/>
     think it will he very difficult for him to 
     <lb/>
     prove that we can make more by giving 
     <lb/>
     away these lands. I understand his argu<lb break="no"/>ment is that we can make more money by 
     <lb/>
     giving away these lands than by offering 
     <lb/>
     them for sale. He tells us that the coal 
     <lb/>
     lands are no good because there is no 
     <lb/>
     market for the coal. The same argument 
     <lb/>
     might apply to wheat, or to any other pro<lb break="no"/>duct of the Northwest. It'is a matter of 
     <lb/>
     transportation. That coal is worth money 
     <lb/>
     if we can find a market. It is only a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of transportation. If we could not 
     <lb/>
    get the wheat out of the country, be<lb break="no"/>cause of insufficient transportation the 
     <lb/>wheat would have no value. These coal 
     <lb/>lands will certainly be of great importance 
     <lb/>to that country as development goes on. I 
     <lb/>would be quite willing to trust these peo<lb break="no"/>ple with the administration of these lands. 
     <lb/>I think it is their part to succeed to that 
     <lb/>responsibility. I believe that they can ad<lb break="no"/>minister these lands as well as they are 
     <lb/>being administered to-day. We are told they 
     <lb/>are well administered. From the remarks 
     <lb/>that have been made by the Minister of 
     <lb/>the Interior these lands have not realized 
     <lb/>as much to this country as they should 
     <lb/>have done. The hon. gentleman perhaps 
     <lb/>knows more about that than I do, but in 
     <lb/>the province of Ontario, although its as<lb break="no"/>
 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5554</fw>
    

     sets have been badly handled, the pro<lb break="no"/>vince has received a vast income and is 
     <lb/>
     today receiving a vast income from its 
     <lb/>
     Crown lands and will do so for gener<lb break="no"/>ations to come. He says there are no set<lb break="no"/>tlers in Northern Ontario as a result of 
     <lb/>
     that. Let me point to the Soo and to New 
     <lb/>
     Liskeard which five years ago was scarcely 
     <lb/>
     heard of and which has a population of 
     <lb/>
     5,000 to-day. Settlers are going in there 
     <lb/>
     in large numbers and if these Crown lands 
     <lb/>
     were handed over to the Northwest pro<lb break="no"/>vinces they might also be able to draw 
     <lb/>
     a large settlement. If there was anything 
     <lb/>
     wrong about the administration of these 
     <lb/>
     lands the fifty representatives that are 
     <lb/>
     going to represent the people of these two 
     <lb/>
     new provinces in their local assembly, being 
     <lb/>
     the people on the spot, could deal wisely 
     <lb/>
     and promptly with the conditions arising 
     <lb/>
     in connection with these lands if they were 
     <lb/>
     placed under their control. It was not 
     <lb/>
     in the House this afternoon when the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance introduced some am<lb break="no"/>endments. I have just had an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of seeing them casually. They may be in 
     <lb/>
     the right direction and I think that per<lb break="no"/>haps some of them are, but it did occur 
     <lb/>
     to me that the administration of these 
     <lb/>
     lands should be placed in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces and that the cash subsidy, not 
     <lb/>
     only in justice to the rights of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces, but in the best interests of these 
     <lb/>
     new provinces themselves, should be cut 
     <lb/>
     down to about the same figure as that 
     <lb/>
     which the older provinces are receiving. 
     <lb/>
     I do not see any good reason why that 
     <lb/>
     should not be done and I think that would 
     <lb/>
     be approved of by the country as a whole, 
     <lb/>
     because the cash subsidy is to be paid out 
     <lb/>
     of the pockets of the people of the whole 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. I think it would be advisable 
     <lb/>
     to revise the language of this clause and 
     <lb/>
     give the public lands to the provinces to 
     <lb/>
     which they really belong, thus pursuing the 
     <lb/>
     policy that has prevailed in this country 
     <lb/>
     ever since it was a country that the Crown 
     <lb/>
     lands shall belong to the various provinces 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion and that the cash subsidy 
     <lb/>
     should be the same to these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     as it is to the provinces of the older parts 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion.

     <persName ref="pers:ZIMM1">Mr. ZIMMERMAN</persName>. I am delighted to 
     <lb/>
     see that our hon. friend from Brantford 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Cockshutt) has got back his courage 
     <lb/>
     again. The other night he spoke to us for 
     <lb/>
     about an hour and a half. He took us all 
     <lb/>
     over creation. He told us that he had 
     <lb/>
     worshipped in the Catholic churches of 
     <lb/>
     Europe, Cuba and other countries, but for 
     <lb/>
     a long time we could not tell how he was 
     <lb/>
     going to vote, and we were left in doubt 
     <lb/>
     until the hour of midnight when he whisp<lb break="no"/>ered in subdued tones that he proposed to 
     <lb/>
     vote in support of the amendment. His 
     <lb/>
     conscience then immediately pricked him 
     <lb/>
     and he proceeded to recite the Lord's 
     <lb/>
     Prayer. He said, in low tones that he had

     changed his views on the question, but I 
     <lb/>
     can tell the hon. gentleman that if be con<lb break="no"/>sulted his constituents he would learn rea<lb break="no"/>sons why he should oppose the lands being 
     <lb/>
     handed over to the provinces. The manu<lb break="no"/>facturers and business men of this country 
     <lb/>
     want to see the business of Canada con<lb break="no"/>tinue to prosper as it has done for the past 
     <lb/>
     eight years. We have made wonderful 
     <lb/>
     progress under the present conditions ; im<lb break="no"/>migration is pouring into our country in 
     <lb/>
     great volumes and business generally is in<lb break="no"/>creasing very rapidly. If the lands were 
     <lb/>
     handed over to the provinces, I am afraid 
     <lb/>
     the hands of the clock would be turned 
     <lb/>
     back, not that the people of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     are not competent, but they would neces<lb break="no"/>sarily have to disturb the existing system 
     <lb/>
     and we cannot aiford to take any chances 
     <lb/>
     on that.

     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman that my courage has 
     <lb/>
     returned. I was not aware that I whisper<lb break="no"/>ed in low tones what side I was going to 
     <lb/>
     take. If the hon. gentleman Mr. Zimmer<lb break="no"/>man) did not hear me it was not because 
     <lb/>
     he could not, for he heard me a few min<lb break="no"/>utes before when he interrupted me. I do 
     <lb/>
     not remember that the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     found time during the debate to state his 
     <lb/>
     views. But I can tell him that there 
     <lb/>
     never was any doubt from the time I be<lb break="no"/>gan to speak until I concluded as to what 
     <lb/>
     way I was going to vote. Every one who 
     <lb/>
     knows me well, can tell the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man what my opinions are. If the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman could not understand the drift 
     <lb/>
     of my speech that is not my fault, because 
     <lb/>
     my decision was never for a moment un<lb break="no"/>defined from the beginning to the end of

     <lb/>
     say what some of his friends think but do 
     <lb/>
     not say. The hon. member stands for the 
     <lb/>
     principle of slow settlement in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories; he stands for the principle of smaller 
     <lb/>
     subsidies; he stands for the principle of the 
     <lb/>
     sale of the lands. He declares that the 
     <lb/>
     system of settlement in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario has been a success. We are glad 
     <lb/>
     to know all these things, and we are glad 
     <lb/>
     to know that gentlemen opposite stand now 
     <lb/>
     where they have always stood, namely, for 
     <lb/>
     slow settlement for the sale of the lands, 
     <lb/>
     and for general stagnation. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has suggested that it was under a 
     <lb/>
     Liberal administration in Ontario that the 
     <lb/>
     lands were not properly administered, but 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>

     Ontario was not always Liberal, and the 
     <lb/>
     history of the administration of the On<lb break="no"/>tario lands since the first provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was created, proves that a pro<lb break="no"/>vince which depends upon the sale of its 
     <lb/>
     lands for its revenue cannot afford to han<lb break="no"/>dle these lands with the liberality that the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government which does not de<lb break="no"/>pend upon that source of revenue is able to.

     <persName ref="pers:WRIG4">Mr. W. WRIGHT</persName>. Does the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman not know that nearly all the new 
     <lb/>
     lands that have been settled in Ontario 
     <lb/>
     within the last thirty years, have been ab<lb break="no"/>solutely given to the settlers ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I believe that the lands 
     <lb/>
     have been given to the settlers under that 
     <lb/>
     very Liberal administration to which the

     hon. gentleman objects, but what I said 
     <lb/>
     was that in all this great clay belt of 
     <lb/>
     northern Ontario which is laid down upon 
     <lb/>
     the map and which is said to be of very 
     <lb/>
     great agricultural value, there is not at 
     <lb/>
     the present time a single settler in that 
     <lb/>
     great clay belt as laid down on the map, 
     <lb/>
     nor has the government attempted to place

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I do not think I said that. 
     <lb/>
     I said there were large areas in Alberta 
     <lb/>
     and Saskatchewan that were not known, 
     <lb/>
     but I do say that the efforts of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government to colonize that coun<lb break="no"/>try have resulted in placing half a million 
     <lb/>
     people in the districts of Saskatchewan and 
     <lb/>
     Alberta during the same period that the

     province of Ontario has not placed a single

     settler on its lands known as the clay belt.

     friend seems to be unable to understand 
     <lb/>
     that the giving away of a part of the land 
     <lb/>
     can increase the value of the remainder. 
     <lb/>
     If he is not able to understand that then 
     <lb/>
     I am unable to explain it to him. The fact 
     <lb/>
     is that the giving away of the lands in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest and the policy under which these 
     <lb/>
     lands have been given away during the 
     <lb/>
     last few years, have resulted in doubling 
     <lb/>
     and trebling the value of the lands still 
     <lb/>
     remaining in the hands of the government 
     <lb/>
     and the railway companies, and at the 
     <lb/>
     same time it has had the result of increas<lb break="no"/>ing by millions and millions of dollars the 
     <lb/>
     revenue of this Dominion and the trade of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I am astonished beyond measure 
     <lb/>
     to hear the representative of a manufactur<lb break="no"/>ing constituency in the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     declare that he does not know that it makes 
     <lb/>
     any difference as to whether the west is 
     <lb/>
     settled or not. If there is one thing the 
     <lb/>
     manufacturers of eastern Canada depend 
     <lb/>
     on more than another, it is on the securing 
     <lb/>
     of settlers upon these prairies. It is that 
     <lb/>
     increase of settlement that has given them 
     <lb/>
     their increased business within the last 
     <lb/>
     few years, and it is to the further increase 
     <lb/>
     of that settlement they must look for 
     <lb/>
     still further increase of business. If the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Brantford (Mr. Cock<lb break="no"/>shutt) does not know that, I am satisfied 
     <lb/>
     there is not another manufacturer in this 
     <lb/>
     great city who does not know it. As to 
     <lb/>
     the allegation that there is discrimination 
     <lb/>
     as between foreigners and native Cana<lb break="no"/>dians in the administration of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     lands. I may say that I have not been ad<lb break="no"/>ministering the Department of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     very long, but I have lived in the North<lb break="no"/>west for many years and so far as my 
     <lb/>
     knowledge goes there is no such discrimi<lb break="no"/>nation. I say that the administration of 
     <lb/>
     the lands in the Northwest has been on a 
     <lb/>
     fair basis and that the settler is not asked 
     <lb/>
     who he is or where he comes from. The 
     <lb/>
     policy of the government is to secure set<lb break="no"/>tlers for this Iand, and if it should happen 
     <lb/>
     that this or the other difficulty is in the 
     <lb/>
     way, the men we make settlers of in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest are men who go there to over<lb break="no"/>come difficulties and not to be overcome by 
     <lb/>
     them.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WRIG4">Mr. W. WRIGHT</persName>. Did the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man say that they did not give grants to the 
     <lb/>
     Doukhobors and give facilities in that way, 
     <lb/>
     supplying cattle, horses and implements so 
     <lb/>
     as to give them a start in a manner which 
     <lb/>
     has not been done for men from Ontario ?

     any Doukhobors in my own part of the

     country and personally I am not aware of 
     <lb/>
     all the facts of the case, but I am aware 
     <lb/>
     of this fact, that in cases where there has 
     <lb/>
     been a general scarcity resulting from frost 
     <lb/>
     or grasshoppers it has been the practice to 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5558</fw>
          

     assist the settlers regardless of nationality 
     <lb/>
     in the procuring of seed grain. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that policy has been pursued by different 
     <lb/>
     governments, and so far as I know there 
     <lb/>
     has been no disagreement in regard to it. 
     <lb/>
     I think it as well to say right here and now 
     <lb/>
     that the slur which I believe is very fre<lb break="no"/>quently cast that there is discrimination in 
     <lb/>
     the lands of the Northwest as against Cana<lb break="no"/>dians has no foundation in fact, none What<lb break="no"/>ever, and that the aim in the administration 
     <lb/>
     of that department has been as I hope it 
     <lb/>
     will always be to secure the best men that 
     <lb/>
     can be got for the settlement of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. I would be delighted as the adminis<lb break="no"/>trator of the department if the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brantford (Mr. Cockshutt) would 
     <lb/>
     secure us a few shiploads of settlers of the 
     <lb/>
     same character as those who landed on 
     <lb/>
     Plymouth Rock. I will be glad to guarantee 
     <lb/>
     him and them the best facilities the coun<lb break="no"/>try affords. We want a lot of settlers of 
     <lb/>
     that kind and if he can direct us to any port 
     <lb/>
     where they can be secured, we will use 
     <lb/>
     every effort to bring them to Canada and 
     <lb/>
     to establish them in the west.

            </p>
   
            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COCK3">Mr. COCKSHUTT</persName>. I wish to correct an 
     <lb/>
     impression which the hon. minister convey<lb break="no"/>ed which is not warranted by anything I 
     <lb/>
     said, that is. that I stood for slow growth. 
     <lb/>
     That was not my remark; I said there are 
     <lb/>
     other considerations besides rapidity of 
     <lb/>
     growth, and I said that quality as well as 
     <lb/>
     quantity is one of those considerations. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member had no right to say that I 
     <lb/>
     stood for stagnation. He thinks I am stand<lb break="no"/>ing in the way of my own business. I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry he thinks that, but at the same time, 
     <lb/>
     he will see that I am looking after the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country and not of my own 
     <lb/>
     business when I make that proposition. I 
     <lb/>
     think this is a consideration that will ap<lb break="no"/>peal to all the provinces, that quality is a 
     <lb/>
     great consideration, and that in giving 
     <lb/>
     lands in the west they should be given only 
     <lb/>
     to people who are likely to make a sound 
     <lb/>
     foundation for a great nation. That is a 
     <lb/>
     sound doctrine; I do not retire from it. I 
     <lb/>
     do not think the hon. gentleman was war<lb break="no"/>ranted in fastening that implication upon 
     <lb/>
     me.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I regret that the 
     <lb/>
     new Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) 
     <lb/>
     seems so anxious to obstruct the progress 
     <lb/>
     of this Bill. Just as we were about to pass 
     <lb/>
     this section when no one was ready to take 
     <lb/>
     his feet for the purpose of saying anything 
     <lb/>
     further about it, the minister, who I sup<lb break="no"/>pose is in charge of the Bill, found it ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to rise, and to keep us here an hour 
     <lb/>
     or an hour and a half longer in the discus<lb break="no"/>sion he has opened up on the clay belt in

     Ontario. It is difficult to say what the clay 
     <lb/>
     belt has to do with this Bill, but as the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman has struck out new lines in 
     <lb/>
     other respects, he has struck out new lines 
     <lb/>
     in regard to government legislation. I think 
     <lb/>
     it a little unworthy of the hon. gentleman— 
     <lb/>
     we might have expected it when he was 
     <lb/>
     away on the back benches, but it was hard<lb break="no"/>ly worthy of him as Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior—to attempt to make a little cheap 
     <lb/>
     political capital by putting words into the 
     <lb/>
     mouths of hon. gentlemen on this side of 
     <lb/>
     the House which they had not used. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. What words ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. He put words into 
     <lb/>
     the mouths of the opposition which I ven<lb break="no"/>ture to say were never uttered by any mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the opposition. If he looks at Han<lb break="no"/>sard, he will see that. I am not going to 
     <lb/>
     waste time as he has done by repeating 
     <lb/>
     these words but he will recognize them to<lb break="no"/>morrow. It is not the usual course of a 
     <lb/>
     minister who is trying to get a Bill through 
     <lb/>
     parliament, when he has been treated with 
     <lb/>
     a fair amount of courtesy to suggest that 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who have spoken on this side 
     <lb/>
     of the House are dishonest and cowardly— 
     <lb/>
     because that is what the hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     remarks mean if anything. We hardly ex<lb break="no"/>pect that sort of thing from a Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Crown. He said the hon. member from 
     <lb/>
     Brandon was at least honest and had cour<lb break="no"/>age. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Surely ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. And he said it in 
     <lb/>
     such a context that he was imputing the 
     <lb/>
     want of those qualities to every hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who had spoken on this side. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Mr. Chairman, am I res<lb break="no"/>ponsible for all inferences that any hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman might choose to draw from my 
     <lb/>
     remarks ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. No, he is not, but 
     <lb/>
     when he uses language that warrants a 
     <lb/>
     direct inference he may expect that the in<lb break="no"/>ference will be noted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I can only say that it is 
     <lb/>
     usual when the cap fits for gentlemen to

     wear it.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. There the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has made the suggestion again. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman has always prided himself 
     <lb/>
     in this House as a private member, he and 
     <lb/>
     one other hon. gentleman have always spok<lb break="no"/>en of themselves as the only two honest and 
     <lb/>
     independent members in the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. Who is the other.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>.  I have not heard

     any other hon. gentleman in the House

     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. If I am to be called in

     that way.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I say that it is 
     <lb/>
     but the direct inference to be drawn from 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman's remarks as was the 
     <lb/>
     case just now, because the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man spoke of every one else as not possess<lb break="no"/>ing those qualifications, and although he 
     <lb/>
     did not speak of himself we all thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     understood what was in his mind and he 
     <lb/>
     understood it and he understands it now. 
     <lb/>
     It has been in his mind very often in the 
     <lb/>
     House but it is not worth while if he ex<lb break="no"/>pects to get this legislation through to take 
     <lb/>
     the course of throwing sneers across the 
     <lb/>
     floor of the House which might not be not<lb break="no"/>iced when he was a back bencher but may 
     <lb/>
     be when he is trying to get legislation 
     <lb/>
     through the House, or rather trying to ob<lb break="no"/>struct its progress for his leader called for 
     <lb/>
     a vote just as he took the floor.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I call for one 
     <lb/>
    now.

            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman will call. It is like the man who 
     <lb/>called spirits from the vasty deep. The 
     <lb/>question was whether they would answer. 
     <lb/>The hon. gentleman may call.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. But there 
     <lb/>
     may be no response.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Or there may be 
     <lb/>
     more response than he wants. Now. in re<lb break="no"/>gard to this interesting question of the clay 
     <lb/>
     belt of Ontario which the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior insists we shall go into, he regards 
     <lb/>
     the clay belt as I understood him as abso<lb break="no"/>lutely useless. Well we heard a great many 
     <lb/>
     speeches two years ago about the wonder<lb break="no"/>ful value of this clay belt when the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment proposed to spend a great many 
     <lb/>
     million dollars in running a railway through 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Do I understand the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member to say that I said that the clay 
     <lb/>
     belt was useless? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. He said that up to 
     <lb/>
     the present his own Liberal friends who 
     <lb/>
     have been boasting of their achievements 
     <lb/>
     in that regard have not succeeded in plant<lb break="no"/>ing a single settler in that district. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. What I tried to say was 
     <lb/>
     that they had not tried. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. My hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior is going from bad

     to worse. It was bad enough to say they 
     <lb/>
     had good intentions and did not succeed in 
     <lb/>
     carrying them out, but it is infinitely worse 
     <lb/>
     to say that they did not have even good 
     <lb/>
     intentions. That is what some Conservatives 
     <lb/>
     in Ontario have been saying of the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's friends during some time 
     <lb/>
     past, but I never heard so frank an admis<lb break="no"/>sion with regard to it as that which my

     Ontario from the First Minister and from 
     <lb/>
     other members opposite two years ago when 
     <lb/>
     we were discussing a proposal to pledge 
     <lb/>
     the credit of this country to the extent of 
     <lb/>
     about $150,000,000 for building a transcon<lb break="no"/>tinental railway. It was then described as 
     <lb/>
     a most wonderful country. We had not 
     <lb/>
     only quotations by the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     from the relations of the Jesuits of 250 
     <lb/>
     years ago but also from reports of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Ontario showing what a magni<lb break="no"/>ficent country it was. Why the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior used to applaud these quota<lb break="no"/>tions himself most vociferously at that time, 
     <lb/>
     but he seems now to have lost every possible 
     <lb/>
     recollection of them. Let me cite to him, 
     <lb/>
     when he says that not a single settler has 
     <lb/>
     been planted in that country, what was 
     <lb/>
     then said. Perhaps I am not locating the 
     <lb/>
     clay belt in the right place. as I am not so 
     <lb/>
     familiar with it as he is ; but I notice in 
     <lb/>
     the report by the officers of his own depart<lb break="no"/>ment the following :

     three other districts are being laid off. One

     new church has been erected and there are

     four or five other places where church services

     <lb/>
     and last year the settlers sold 300,000 ties and 
     <lb/>
     eight hundred car loads of wood, which netted 
     <lb/>

     to the arguments advanced by the Minister

     of the Interior. If he was out of order, 
     <lb/>
     surely I can refute the illogical arguments 
     <lb/>
     advanced by him. The first minister should 
     <lb/>
     have exercised his prerogative and called 
     <lb/>
     his colleague to order. It is only a few 
     <lb/>
     years since the present Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior made this very chamber ring with 
     <lb/>
     denunciations of the class of settlers the 
     <lb/>
     government were bringing into the region 
     <lb/>
     of East Edmonton. I refer to the Gali<lb break="no"/>cians. I could point out to him still fur<lb break="no"/>ther, as showing that discrimination against 
     <lb/>
     the people from the eastern part of Canada 
     <lb/>
     who settle in the Northwest, that the Douk<lb break="no"/>hobors from Russia and the Galicians from 
     <lb/>
     Austria and the Polish part of Russia and the 
     <lb/>
     Roumanians are landed in the Northwest at 
     <lb/>
     less cost than a man can travel to that 
     <lb/>
     country from Ottawa. They are put there 
     <lb/>
     by government agents on lands selected for 
     <lb/>
     them, whereas a Canadian has to select 
     <lb/>
     land at his own expense, and pay a higher 
     <lb/>
     rate of transportation than a Doukhobor 
     <lb/>
     or a Galician. There has been no encourage<lb break="no"/>ment whatever during the last few years

     given to the British race from eastern Can<lb break="no"/>ada or the British Isles compared with that

     <lb/>
     I do not see that any construction can be

     placed upon them other than that given by 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior. The hon.

     member, in referring to the matter, said : 
     <lb/>
     Get right class of settlers ; go slow and wait 
     <lb/>
     for settlement. These are the words he used 
     <lb/>
     in speaking of the immigration to this coun<lb break="no"/>try. Well, I happened to go into some of 
     <lb/>
     the details in connection with the cost of 
     <lb/>
     bringing immigrants to this country, and 
     <lb/>
     the information I got from the Immigration 
     <lb/>
     Department was that the American settlers 
     <lb/>
     cost the country less per head than any 
     <lb/>
     others and that the British immigrants had 
     <lb/>
     more money spent on them than any other 
     <lb/>
     class. There was more spent on British

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. W. J. ROCHE</persName>. I think that the ques<lb break="no"/>tion asked by the hon. member for Qu'Ap<lb break="no"/>pelle was very a-propos, and that was as 
     <lb/>
     to the division of the district of Keewatin. 
     <lb/>
     The First Minister, with his usual agility, 
     <lb/>
     has talked all around that question without 
     <lb/>
     attempting to give a satisfactory reply. He 
     <lb/>
     saw the rather embarrassing position in 
     <lb/>
     which he was placed when he declared his 
     <lb/>
     intention of dividing that territory in the 
     <lb/>
     manner indicated by his speech in introduc<lb break="no"/>ing the Bill. Then he claimed that the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario, and even the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, and also the new province of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan, had equal rights to the extension 
     <lb/>
     of their territory to the shore of Hudson bay 
     <lb/>
     with the province of Manitoba. So, if he 
     <lb/>
     means to have a division of the district of 
     <lb/>
     Keewatin, he will have to hand over the 
     <lb/>
     lands to these various provinces, or he will 
     <lb/>
     have to refuse them their lands. If he hands 
     <lb/>
     over to Ontario the portion of Keewatin that 
     <lb/>
      he thinks Ontario is entitled to, and vests 
     <lb/>
     that domain in the province of Ontario, he 
     <lb/>
     must adopt a similar policy in regard to that 
     <lb/>
     portion to be given to Manitoba also that 
     <lb/>
     portion to be added to Saskatchewan. If he 
     <lb/>
     refuses to hand over the domain to Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     that province will be claiming financial com<lb break="no"/>pensation for these lands. Moreover. you 
     <lb/>
     will have the unique spectacle of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     owning all its public domain save the portion 
     <lb/>
     of Keewatin reserved by the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. If you hand over to Manitoba the 
     <lb/>
     domain in that portion of the territory given 
     <lb/>
     to that province, you will have Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     not owning the 73,000 miles comprised with<lb break="no"/>in its present boundaries, but owning that 
     <lb/>
     portion of Keewatin over which the province 
     <lb/>
     will extend to Hudson bay. And you will 
     <lb/>
     have a similar state of affairs in Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan. So, I do not wonder that the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman was not able to make a satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory reply. He attempted a little jocularity 
     <lb/>
     at the expense of the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>
     York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) and accused that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman of exhibiting the new found 
     <lb/>
     zeal of the convert, quoting expressions of 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman of a year ago on which 
     <lb/>
     he put a different construction from the view 
     <lb/>
     expressed to-day. We are not obliged to go

     has been on this question of refusing to 
     <lb/>
     hand over the public domain to the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. My mind reverted to the speech 
     <lb/>
     made by the right hon. gentleman on the 
     <lb/>
     21st of February introducing this Bill. At 
     <lb/>
     page 1518 of ' Hansard' he argued that the 
     <lb/>
     lands should be retained by the Dominion 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     It is conceivable that if these lands were

     one of them might differ from ours and clash

            <p>
     That was the principal cause he assigned.

            <p>
     It might possibly render these efforts nuga<lb break="no"/>tory. For instance, if either of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, under the strain of financial difficulty, 
     <lb/>
     were to abolish the free homesteads, which have

     proved so beneficial and so great an inducement

     what a great blow that would be to our immi<lb break="no"/>gration policy. Or if the price of government

     lands for sale were to. be increased over the 
     <lb/>
     present very moderate rate, that would also be 
     <lb/>
     another blow to that policy.

            <p>
     To-night he tells us that the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government, in order to get ready money, 
     <lb/>
     might sell the lands at an inferior price- 
     <lb/>
     quite a contrary argument to the one he used 
     <lb/>
     on introducing the Bill. At that time he told 
     <lb/>
     us that, under the pressure of financial 
     <lb/>
     stringency. the provinces might increase the 
     <lb/>
     price of the land so much as to discourage 
     <lb/>
     immigration: to-night he states they might 
     <lb/>
     give the land away practically for nothing. 
     <lb/>
     The leader of the opposition (Mr. R.L. (Bor-   
     <lb/>
     den) asked the Prime Minister if he could 
     <lb/>
     not give us some estimate of the value of 
     <lb/>
     the lands within the area of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, and 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman stated that he was 
     <lb/>
     not in a position to give that estimate. I 
     <lb/>
    have here a book which was circulated 
     <lb/>among the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>and to which the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>must have given his consent. This was the 
     <lb/>hand-book of the Liberal party circulated 
     <lb/>among the people of the Northwest with a 
     <lb/>view to securing their votes in the last elec<lb break="no"/>tion. It is called 'Hand-book of Canadian 
     <lb/>politics illustrative of the progressive ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of the Liberal government.' 
     <lb/>' The story of a government that does things.' 
     <lb/>Chapter 18 is headed. ' What the Hon. Clif<lb break="no"/>ford Sifton has accomplished.' In the course 
     <lb/>of this chapter it is stated :

     The right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid

     hand-book showing the enormous tract of

     land available for settlement. But to-day 
     <lb/>
     they plead ignorance of the quantity of land 
     <lb/>
     in that country. To serve their own ends the

     <lb/>
     speak as though he had discovered this land 
     <lb/>
     and had made it profitable for agriculture.

     Yet, now that it suits their purposes they are

     minimizing the extent as well as the value

     <lb/>are giving the new provinces too little in lieu 
     <lb/>of their public domain. But we have been

     the 25,000,000 acres for each province ? 
     <lb/>
     What object have they in doing so ? That 
     <lb/>

     has not been explained But if you look up 
     <lb/>
     the speech of the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior. you will find the secret. He pointed 
     <lb/>
     out that if we placed the land at $1.50 an 
     <lb/>
     acre and the quantity at 25,000,000 acres, in 
     <lb/>
     the future these provinces might be coming 
     <lb/>
     back and demanding greater assistance 
     <lb/>
     from this parliament, because they might 
     <lb/>
     say that the lands were more valuable than 
     <lb/>
     the $1.50 they had been allowed and that 
     <lb/>
     there was a greater number of acres. So in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the views of the ex-Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior, and in order to provide 
     <lb/>
     against this contingency, they have simply 
     <lb/>
     excluded the $1.50 and the total number of 
     <lb/>
     acres from this Bill. And we see the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen from the Northwest Territories on 
     <lb/>
     the other side of the House assenting to a 
     <lb/>
     proposition that will prevent the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces from coming back to ask for an in<lb break="no"/>crease in the future, and at the same time, 
     <lb/>
     not providing for sufficient money to run 
     <lb/>
     their government for all time to come so as 
     <lb/>
     to avoid the necessity for them to appeal to 
     <lb/>
     this Dominion for more assistance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, the member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott) has shown himself to be an ex<lb break="no"/>pert as a political acrobat. In fact all the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the other side of the House 
     <lb/>
     from the west have taken a position unfav<lb break="no"/>ourable to the new provinces being given the 
     <lb/>
     ownership of these lands. The member for 
     <lb/>
     West-Assiniboia made one of the strongest 
     <lb/>
     speeches against that view when he first came 
     <lb/>
     into the House, and to-day he has changed 
     <lb/>
     his view, and, with all the zeal of a new con<lb break="no"/>vert, he is one of the strongest opponents of 
     <lb/>
     handing over the lands to the provinces and 
     <lb/>
     is making argument after argument to show 
     <lb/>
     with how much greater advantage this Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government can manage those lands 
     <lb/>
     than they could be managed by the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. If I desired to take up the time of 
     <lb/>
     the committee, I could read excerpts from 
     <lb/>
     his speeches that would show how different 
     <lb/>
     his attitude upon this question used to be 
     <lb/>
     from what it is to-day. The present Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior, or rather the would-be 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior, the member for 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia, has boldly asked: Why 
     <lb/>
     didn't you go up to Edmonton and challenge 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of the people during the recent 
     <lb/>
     election if you believed the people of the 
     <lb/>
     west are opposed to the Dominion retaining 
     <lb/>
     those lands ? The hon. gentleman was very 
     <lb/>
     brave ; he was not nearly so satisfied as he 
     <lb/>
     tried to make us believe. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man was quite willing himself to swallow 
     <lb/>
     the original clause 16 in the Autonomy Bill 
     <lb/>
     for the sake of getting the plum of the port<lb break="no"/>folio of the Interior. But today he says that 
     <lb/>
     we were afraid to go up to the constituency 
     <lb/>
     of Edmonton and challenge public opinion. 
     <lb/>
     Why did not the government select himself 
     <lb/>
     for the portfolio, the man they had marked 
     <lb/>
     out for it? Because they were afraid to 
     <lb/>
     open up a constituency where the average 
     <lb/>
     Canadian elector resides. and to take an ex<lb break="no"/>pression of opinion from men who under<lb break="no"/>

     stand the politics of our country, from peo<lb break="no"/>ple who have been long enough here to be<lb break="no"/>come acquainted with public questions. 
     <lb/>
     One reason why we did not go to Edmon<lb break="no"/>ton can be found in the remarks addressed 
     <lb/>
     to this House a few years ago by the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Minister of the Interior himself. It 
     <lb/>
     has been said that we did not contest Ed<lb break="no"/>monton because there was a certain number 
     <lb/>
     of Catholic voters in that constituency. 
     <lb/>
     That is not the case. One of the reasons 
     <lb/>
     why we did not go, is the reason assigned 
     <lb/>
     by the present Minister of the Interior, that 
     <lb/>
     his constituency is largely populated by a 
     <lb/>
     class of people who are not acquainted with 
     <lb/>
     British institutions, who do not understand 
     <lb/>
     our laws, and who would not understand 
     <lb/>
     the schools question or the land question. 
     <lb/>
     Now, what did that hon. gentleman state in 
     <lb/>
     regard to this very question two or three 
     <lb/>
     years ago ? I will read his remarks:

     Another idea that is conveyed is that all for<lb break="no"/>eign peoples are the same, that because the 
     <lb/>
     German people are foreigners and because they 
     <lb/>
     are desirable settlers, therefor the Galicians 
     <lb/>
     being foreigners and the Doukihobors being for<lb break="no"/>eigners, are also desirable settlers. Do my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friends know that they could not insult a 
     <lb/>
     German and Scandinavian as much in any other 
     <lb/>
     way as to compare him with a Doukhobor or a 
     <lb/>
     Galician ? The pride of race is as strong in 
     <lb/>
     these people as it is in us, and they object, and 
     <lb/>
     object very strongly, to being placed in the 
     <lb/>
     same category as a Slavic people, a people who 
     <lb/>
     less than two generations ago were serfs of the 
     <lb/>
     soil, and who unfortunately have not had the 
     <lb/>
     opportunities, even if they had the capability. 
     <lb/>
     to rise very high above that position to-day. 
     <lb/>
     Make no mistake, there is no comparison <choice><sic>bet<lb break="no"/>tween</sic><corr>between</corr></choice> the German who comes from Galicia and 
     <lb/>
     a Galician who comes from Galicia, and no man 
     <lb/>
     will resent such a comparison more than the 
     <lb/>
     German himself. But the Galician or the Douk<lb break="no"/>hobor who have been reared under circum<lb break="no"/>stances which did not permit them to know 
     <lb/>
     what free government is, who know nothing of 
     <lb/>
     government except that government is a tyr<lb break="no"/>rany, these people, let them, be ever so good,

     These are the expressions of the present

     never repudiated these words so far as I

     Let me say one word to the government, and

     it will be a word of advice. I speak here to<lb break="no"/>night on behalf of the most populous district

     I speak the sentiments of the majority of the

     There the member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     has one reason why the Conservative oppo<lb break="no"/>sition did not see fit to challenge an ex<lb break="no"/>pression of opinion from these people, who 
     <lb/>
     are depicted by the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     as illiterate, ignorant of British institutions 
     <lb/>
     and of our laws and politics. Now, there 
     <lb/>
     has been something, I think, kept back by 
     <lb/>
     this government, some reason why they did 
     <lb/>
     not wish to hand over these lands to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, something beneath the surface. 
     <lb/>
     I think it has been touched upon by some 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen in some of their speeches, 
     <lb/>
     and I think I pointed it out myself when 
     <lb/>
     speaking on the second reading. But any 
     <lb/>
     person who lives in the west knows whereof 
     <lb/>
     I speak when I say that one reason why the 
     <lb/>
     government are retaining those lands in 
     <lb/>
     their possession is that they desire to have 
     <lb/>
     the wonderful leverage which they will have 
     <lb/>
     at election time by holding all these lands 
     <lb/>
     in their own hands. Every homestead inspec<lb break="no"/>tor, you might say, is an active political par<lb break="no"/>tisan, an election agent during the course ot 
     <lb/>
     a campaign. Yes from one end of the year to 
     <lb/>
     the other. I do not have to go outside my 
     <lb/>
     own constituency to find examples of what 
     <lb/>
     occurred during the last campaign. One 
     <lb/>
     homestead inspector in my riding openly 
     <lb/>
     appeared at the polls in that contest, stood 
     <lb/>
     there in company with a mounted police<lb break="no"/>man with his side arms on, and in company 
     <lb/>
     with an interpreter from the Yorkton land 
     <lb/>
     office—the three of them—and the electors 
     <lb/>
     had to run the gauntlet of the three of them 
     <lb/>
     before coming in, each one bringing pres<lb break="no"/>sure to bear upon them, threatening them 
     <lb/>
     with retaining their homestead patents if 
     <lb/>
     they voted for your humble servant. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These people were simply intimidated. 
     <lb/>
     they went in and shouted out how they 
     <lb/>

     desired to vote and it was left to the de<lb break="no"/>puty returning officer to mark their ballots 
     <lb/>
     for them, it being simply open voting. 
     <lb/>
     After he had secured the whole vote en 
     <lb/>
     bloc this homestead inspector openly made 
     <lb/>
     the boast that now he would betake him<lb break="no"/>self to the constituency of Dauphin, the 
     <lb/>
     election having been postponed for one 
     <lb/>
     week, and that after getting through there 
     <lb/>
     he was going to the constituency of my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Mackenzie (Mr. Cash) to 
     <lb/>
     lend his active assistance there. That is 
     <lb/>
     the reason, and it is a very important rea<lb break="no"/>son to the government, why they are so 
     <lb/>
     anxious to retain these lands in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion government. It is be<lb break="no"/>cause of the wonderful influence that these 
     <lb/>
     government officials have over these peo<lb break="no"/>ple, who, as the hon. Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior states, are not at all acquainted with 
     <lb/>
     our homestead laws and whose future pros<lb break="no"/>perity, if these officials were to put into 
     <lb/>
     effect what they have threatened to do, 
     <lb/>
     would suffer a very serious impediment. 
     <lb/>
     That is one reason why the lands are not 
     <lb/>
     handed over to the provinces: If they were 
     <lb/>
     handed over the provinces would have their 
     <lb/>
     own officials and it would not interfere 
     <lb/>
     with the immigration policy of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government any more than it does 
     <lb/>
     in the other provinces of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     where they have the ownership of the pub<lb break="no"/>lic domain. They could work in harmony 
     <lb/>
     with the officials of the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment and it would not be an impediment 
     <lb/>
     to the encouragement of immigration. At 
     <lb/>
     this late hour I will not take up the time 
     <lb/>
     of the committee any longer, but I protest 
     <lb/>
     against the government retaining these 
     <lb/>
     lands and I claim that there can be no suffi<lb break="no"/>cient monetary consideration to compensate 
     <lb/>
     the people of the west in the future for the 
     <lb/>
     loss of their public domain. These lands 
     <lb/>
     should be handed over to be administered 
     <lb/>
     under the advice of the fifty members who 
     <lb/>
     will represent the people in the local legis<lb break="no"/>latures of these provinces and to be ad<lb break="no"/>ministered by the respective governments 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces, who will have officials on 
     <lb/>
     the ground and who will administer them 
     <lb/>
     much more advantageously to the people 
     <lb/>
     interested there than they can be adminis<lb break="no"/>tered 1,500 or 2,000 miles distant from the

     son which he has suggested for not going

     there. I should have had pleasure in going 
     <lb/>
     into West Assiniboia if the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     had become the Minister of the Interior. I 
     <lb/>
     must confess that I could not see the drift 
     <lb/>
     of his remark that Roman Catholics should 
     <lb/>
     have the same right to express their 
     <lb/>
     opinions as Protestants. Who said they 
     <lb/>
     had not? I can assure the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     that it was not any one on this side of the

     following a course with which we have 
     <lb/>
     become familiar and which has been pur<lb break="no"/>sued by hon. gentlemen on the other side 
     <lb/>
     of the House who have grown accustomed 
     <lb/>
     to telling the members of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic faith that the Protestants are at<lb break="no"/>tacking their religion. That is the very 
     <lb/>
     surest way of promoting bigotry and re<lb break="no"/>ligious strife and it has been sedulously 
     <lb/>
     practised by members opposite and is abso<lb break="no"/>lutely without any foundation at all.

     <lb/>
     wishes I will describe a cartoon which ap<lb break="no"/>peared in the Ottawa ' Free Press' in which 
     <lb/>the right hon. First Minister was shown as a 
     <lb/>knight in full armour with the lance of right<lb break="no"/>eousness in his hands, going to attack a dou<lb break="no"/>ble headed dragon breathing out rebellion 
     <lb/>and bigotry. I think one head was that 
     <lb/>of my hon. friend from Victoria and Hali<lb break="no"/>burton (Mr. Hughes) representing rebellion 
     <lb/>and another head was that of my hon. 
     <lb/>friend from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) repre<lb break="no"/>senting bigotry and on the top of this dra<lb break="no"/>gon was a representation of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>from North Toronto (Mr. Foster) without 
     <lb/>many clothes on him and in the form of a 
     <lb/>devil. This wonderful creature was being 
     <lb/>attacked by the right hon. First Minister 
     <lb/>with the lance of righteousness. That is 
     <lb/>one little cartoon— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURE1">Mr. BUREAU</persName>. That is only one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>—that comes to my mind and 
     <lb/>
     I think it compared very badly with some 
     <lb/>
     of the admirable cartoons which have ap<lb break="no"/>peared in the Toronto ' News.'

            <p>
     If I were asked what would have the 
     <lb/>
     strongest influence upon an election at Ed<lb break="no"/>monton, I would, with my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Marquette (Mr. W. J. Roche), say that it 
     <lb/>
     would be the enormous influence which is 
     <lb/>
     exercised on new settlers in a new country 
     <lb/>
     by the land and immigration officials of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government. Their influence is 
     <lb/>
     something overpowering, it is a very difficult 
     <lb/>
     influence to counteract and it is a standing 
     <lb/>
     wonder to myself how it is that any Conser<lb break="no"/>vatives managed to get elected in the Terri<lb break="no"/>

            <p>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. No. What I meant 
     <lb/>
     was that it was not intended to restrict them 
     <lb/>
     as to the character of the buildings. The 
     <lb/>
     grant being for a special purpose it is rea<lb break="no"/>sonable that they should apply it to that 
     <lb/>
     purpose. The reason for stating it in the 
     <lb/>
     amendment is that in view of any further 
     <lb/>
     transactions we might have. it is well to 
     <lb/>

     shown in the provinces. Does the amend<lb break="no"/>ment mean merely a statement of the reason

     five years ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. It is a suggestion to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces as to the use to which it should 
     <lb/>
     put the money. but there is no restriction 
     <lb/>
     as to that particular use. I think it will 
     <lb/>
     be found necessary to spend quite that sum 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps more. We certainly did intend 
     <lb/>
     that the money should be applied to build<lb break="no"/>ings, but there is no other restriction.

     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. It was understood that 
     <lb/>
     I should change the phraseology a little of 
     <lb/>
     the resolution relating to allowance in lieu 
     <lb/>
     of subsidy. The question has been raised 
     <lb/>
     as to whether the words of section 2 would 
     <lb/>
     create anything more than an annual pay<lb break="no"/>ment and after the word 'advanced ' in the 
     <lb/>
     third line of section 2, I propose to add the 
     <lb/>
     words : 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     I think the wording is already plain 
     <lb/>
     enough but this addition will probably make 
     <lb/>
     it plainer that it is an annual payment only 
     <lb/>
     and not a capital sum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. I am not quite clear 
     <lb/>
     that the amendment will get over the diffi<lb break="no"/>culty to which I have referred. In a similar 
     <lb/>
     instance the province of Ontario claimed 
     <lb/>
     that they were not only entitled to be paid 
     <lb/>
     the annual sum but that if they desired 
     <lb/>
     they were entitled to get the principal upon 
     <lb/>
     which that interest was based. Notwith<lb break="no"/>standing that the Act of parliament creat<lb break="no"/>ing the annual sum declares that it should 
     <lb/>
     be paid as an additional subsidy, and not<lb break="no"/>withstanding that the wording of that Act 
     <lb/>
     (chap. 4 statutes of 1884) is much more 
     <lb/>
     expressive than the words in the amend<lb break="no"/>ment of the Finance Minister himself, a 
     <lb/>
     portion of that capital amount has been 
     <lb/>
     paid over to the province. True, it is 
     <lb/>
     charged to the province as a debt, but no 
     <lb/>
     doubt the intention is that at some future 
     <lb/>
     time the entire sum may be paid over. I am 
     <lb/>
     quite aware that the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     argues against my contention that the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1884 speaks of this sum as a 'capital 
     <lb/>
     sum.' but as against that there is the broad 
     <lb/>
     statement that the amount of $142,414 is 
     <lb/>
     the annual payment to be made to the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Ontario in consideration of that 
     <lb/>
     capital sum and the Act declares that the 
     <lb/>
     sum shall be paid to Ontario as an addi<lb break="no"/>tional subsidy. I very much fear that the 
     <lb/>
     contention will be set up in years to come, 
     <lb/>
     that as this sum is interest there must be 
     <lb/>
     capital behind it, and that if the province 
     <lb/>
     is entitled to interest it is entitled under the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1885, chap. 4, to call for the principal 
     <lb/>
     when it so desires. I know that the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Finance is endeavouring to get over 
     <lb/>
     that, but I think he should have used words 
     <lb/>
     so explicit that all chance of difficulty in the 
     <lb/>
     future would be avoided. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Why refer to this as interest at all? 
     <lb/>
     Could we not call it by some other name? 
     <lb/>

     Could we not simply declare the fact 
     <lb/>
     that inasmuch as the province of Alberta 
     <lb/>
     has no debt it is to be paid in lieu of debt al<lb break="no"/>lowance this annual sum of $400,000 a year 
     <lb/>
     in perpetuity, and make no reference what<lb break="no"/>ever to the fact that it is based on any prin<lb break="no"/>ciple sum or its being 5 per cent on an 
     <lb/>
     estimated capital account or debt account. 
     <lb/>
     There will be perhaps opportunities be<lb break="no"/>fore this has finally passed the House to 
     <lb/>
     further consider the question. I quite ap<lb break="no"/>prove of the course that the minister is 
     <lb/>
     pursuing in endeavouring to get around the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty, but I respectfully submit that in 
     <lb/>
     my opinion he has not quite overcome the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty and the door is still left open for 
     <lb/>
     the contention that this $400,000 is interest 
     <lb/>
     and that the capital is there and that the 
     <lb/>
     province of Alberta when it desires more 
     <lb/>
     money will have a right to call upon the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada to pay over the $8,<lb break="no"/>000,000, which is not the intention of this 
     <lb/>
     House and not the intention of this com<lb break="no"/>mittee. If the hon. gentleman will take 
     <lb/>
     the trouble to read up the debates of 
     <lb/>
     1884 as reported in 'Hansard ' and observe 
     <lb/>
     the explicit language that was used by 
     <lb/>
     Sir Leonard Tilley and also by Sir Richard 
     <lb/>
     Cartwright at that time, and what seemed 
     <lb/>
     to be the clear understanding, that it never 
     <lb/>
     was the intention of the government to 
     <lb/>
     pay $2.848.000 allowed to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, as additional capital it is surprising 
     <lb/>
     that at this distant date you will find 
     <lb/>
     an hon. gentleman interpreting that 
     <lb/>
     clause in language entirely different 
     <lb/>
     from what Sir Leonard Tilley and Sir 
     <lb/>
     Richard Cartwright used at that time. Sir 
     <lb/>
     Leonard Tilley was distinct in his declara<lb break="no"/>tion that the. capital sum should never be 
     <lb/>
     paid and Sir Richard Cartwright who was 
     <lb/>
     the financial critic at that time accepted 
     <lb/>
     that explanation and understood that only 
     <lb/>
     the $142.414 yearly which was called 
     <lb/>
     interest should be paid over. I would draw 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the minister to this item 
     <lb/>
     again and possibly if he still thinks there 
     <lb/>
     is any room for doubt, before the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion passes the final stage he will give it 
     <lb/>
     his further valuable consideration and place 
     <lb/>
     the matter beyond all possible doubt by 
     <lb/>
     leaving out any reference at all to the 
     <lb/>
     matter of interest which would leave it 
     <lb/>
     clear that the sum on which this interest is 
     <lb/>
     calculated is not capital at all and that 
     <lb/>
     the province would have no claim on the 
     <lb/>
     capital sum.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I think the language 
     <lb/>
     of the Ontario case and the language used 
     <lb/>
     here differ so materially that there is rea<lb break="no"/>son for a view in respect to the Ontario 
     <lb/>
     case which would not apply to this case. 
     <lb/>
     However, if my hon. friend and I cannot 
     <lb/>
     agree as to the Ontario case, I suppose we 
     <lb/>
     can all agree that we should come to a clear 
     <lb/>
     understanding in this case. Let me say that 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion which I gave in the Ontario 
     <lb/>
     case I was of course speaking on the legal

     advice of the Department of Justice. 
     <lb/>
     The intention of the statute must be ga<lb break="no"/>thered from the language of the statute 
     <lb/>
     itself and we must not as a rule look to 
     <lb/>
     the speeches of members of parliament 
     <lb/>
     to ascertain the precise meaning of the 
     <lb/>
     statutes. I think that hon. members on 
     <lb/>
     the other side who are lawyers will possi<lb break="no"/>bly say that in the form in which we now 
     <lb/>
     propose the motion, it becomes an annual 
     <lb/>
     payment and not a capital sum. How<lb break="no"/>ever, I have not had the benefit of the ad<lb break="no"/>vice of the Minister of Justice on this 
     <lb/>
     amendment as he is not present. I 
     <lb/>
     think in deference to the opinions of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Halton (Mr. Henderson) 
     <lb/>
     I should not let the resolution go out of 
     <lb/>
     committee before making the suggestion, 
     <lb/>
     and if before the final stage, after con<lb break="no"/>sultation. the Minister of Justice is of op<lb break="no"/>inion that the matter is not clear, I would 
     <lb/>
     be glad to accept my hon. friend's sug<lb break="no"/>gestion to make it more clear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. I would say this 
     <lb/>
     further that we are not bound, I think, 
     <lb/>
     exactly by the language of this resolution. 
     <lb/>
     We must read it in connection with the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1885, cap. 4. which gave additional powers 
     <lb/>
     to the province with reference to the use of 
     <lb/>
     money under such uncertain conditions 
     <lb/>
     when it is for the purpose of constructing 
     <lb/>
     public works, so that we must not rely en<lb break="no"/>tirely upon the wording of this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. we must read it as it will be interpret<lb break="no"/>ed in the light of the legislation of 1885. 
     <lb/>
     That is a matter which I would desire 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice to look over very 
     <lb/>
     carefully indeed. I may say to the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance that I took good care to 
     <lb/>
     see the Minister of Justice. We were both 
     <lb/>
     in the city of Quebec and we had quite 
     <lb/>
     a good understanding on that ques<lb break="no"/>tion in a jocular way. I would invite the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance to draw the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the Minister of Justice to that special 
     <lb/>
     Act of Parliament to which he referred 
     <lb/>
     on a former occasion and have that Act 
     <lb/>
     of Parliament read in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     present legislation and see whether or not 
     <lb/>
     it might throw some other light upon it, 
     <lb/>
     or cause some other interpretation to be 
     <lb/>
     made at some future time.

     <lb/>
     to think that apart from the Act of 1885 
     <lb/>
     with which I am not familiar, the amend<lb break="no"/>ment of the Minister of Finance would 
     <lb/>
     be sufficient for the purpose intended, al<lb break="no"/>though I have not given it very much con<lb break="no"/>sideration, but as I understand the mat<lb break="no"/>ter will be open when we get into com<lb break="no"/>mittee on the Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. Certainly.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I intended to_have 
     <lb/>
     asked, when clause 2 was being discus<lb break="no"/>sed why it is that the sum of $8,107.500 has 
     <lb/>
     been selected as the amount of debt the 
     <lb/>
     equivalent of interest on which shall be paid 
     <lb/>

     <fw type="num">5575</fw>                 <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>             
 

     to the new provinces? I asked a similar 
     <lb/>
     question in regard to clause one, but not 
     <lb/>
     in regard to this clause. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. It is made up on the 
     <lb/>
     basis of the allowance made to the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Manitoba some years ago, the sum 
     <lb/>
     of $27.77 per head, the same rate as was 
     <lb/>allowed Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. 
     <lb/>Afterwards in the re-adjustment in the debt 
     <lb/>accounts that sum was increased to $32.43 
     <lb/>so that the sum which has been taken in the 
     <lb/>other provinces was accepted as the basis 
     <lb/>of this calculation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. I did not raise that 
     <lb/>
     question but I am very glad that the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition has raised it, as it is a 
     <lb/>
     matter of information, but I very naturally 
     <lb/>
     inferred that the amount of debt of the old 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick as well as Manitoba were all 
     <lb/>
     taken into consideration in arriving at this 
     <lb/>
     particular sum because it does seem strange 
     <lb/>
     that a specific sum of eight millions and 
     <lb/>
     some odd hundreds of thousands of dollars 
     <lb/>
     should be used. I have no doubt the offi<lb break="no"/>cers of the Finance Department have gone 
     <lb/>
     into a careful calculation embracing the 
     <lb/>
     debt of the old provinces of Canada as well 
     <lb/>
     as those of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     and Manitoba. I have not attempted to 
     <lb/>
     make the calculation but I assume that all 
     <lb/>
     these things are considered and on that 
     <lb/>
     basis the matter is calculated. We are 
     <lb/>
     obliged to take it for granted that that has 
     <lb/>
     been done with the utmost care and that 
     <lb/>
     whatever has been done has been done with 
     <lb/>
     a view to uniformity.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. We have taken the basis 
     <lb/>
     of the other provinces and applied it to the 
     <lb/>
     estimated population of the new provinces.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. W. J. ROCHE</persName>. The right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has submitted a schedule in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the delimitation of the consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies for local purposes, and has given 
     <lb/>
     the number of votes cast at the last general 
     <lb/>
     elections. That is very useful, but it would 
     <lb/>
     be still more useful if he could give the 
     <lb/>
     population. He will say that the popula<lb break="no"/>tion is much larger than it was at the last 
     <lb/>
     census, but we would like to have some idea 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the formation of those con<lb break="no"/>stituencies by population. We should pay 
     <lb/>
    some respect to representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion and should have some estimate of the 
     <lb/> 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">5576</fw>
           
population of the constituencies of the pres<lb break="no"/>ent day,<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I have no ob<lb break="no"/>jection to give the population as it was at 
     <lb/>
     the last census, but with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     actual population, we thought the best 
     <lb/>
     method to give an idea of it was to give 
     <lb/>
     the number of votes cast. We have no in<lb break="no"/>formation in the department showing what 
     <lb/>
     the population may be at present, but if it 
     <lb/>
     is possible to give better information we 
     <lb/>
     shall gladly give it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. W. J. ROCHE</persName>. There might have 
     <lb/>
     been local conditions which prevented the 
     <lb/>
     votes in certain districts coming out. If 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman cannot glve the 
     <lb/>
     population. he could give the number of 
     <lb/>
     qualified voters in each district. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. That was the sug<lb break="no"/>gestion I was about to make. The right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman has not only the number of 
     <lb/>
     votes cast but the number of voters register<lb break="no"/>ed.

     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. I do not see how 
     <lb/>
     you can give the present population but you

     can give the registration.
