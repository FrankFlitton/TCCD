     great and progressive Canada, with its

     A land of settled government,

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName> (Carleton, Ont.). Be<lb break="no"/>fore the Orders of the Day are called, I 
     <lb/>
     wish once more to call to the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House the quite unprecedented condi<lb break="no"/>tion of affairs which exists at the present 
     <lb/>
     time. During many months we have not 
     <lb/>
     had in this House the presence of the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Public Works (Mr. Sutherland). 
     <lb/>
     That gentleman is one of my personal 
     <lb/>
     friends, although we are opposed in politics, 
     <lb/>
     and no one regrets more than I do the un<lb break="no"/>fortunate circumstance that illness prevents 
     <lb/>
     him from taking his place among us, and 
     <lb/>
     any remarks which I have to make 
     <lb/>
     with regard to violation of constitutional 
     <lb/>
     usage by the government are, of course, 
     <lb/>
     not connected in any way with that gentle<lb break="no"/>man, because I would be very glad indeed 
     <lb/>
     to have him restored to us, to once more 
     <lb/>
     have his assistance in the House and to 
     <lb/>
     have him back at work in his department 
     <lb/>
     again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But my right hon. friend seems to take 
     <lb/>
     for granted that he is at liberty, so long as 
     <lb/>
     he may see fit, to deprive parliament and 
     <lb/>
    the country of the services of a Minister 
     <lb/>of Public Works possessing the authority 
     <lb/>and invested with the responsibility which 
     <lb/>that position gives to him. I have 
     <lb/>looked a little into this question, which 
     <lb/>has arisen more than once in Great 
     <lb/>Britain, and I find that the rule there acted 
     <lb/>upon is not at all in accordance with that 
 

            <cb/>
          

     suggested by the right hon. gentleman. To 
     <lb/>
     cite just one instance, in 1871, action was 
     <lb/>
     taken in both Houses of parliament in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the absence of Mr. Childers, the 
     <lb/>
     First Lord of the Admiralty, during the 
     <lb/>
     early part of the session, on account of 
     <lb/>
     the state of his health, and within a month 
     <lb/>
     after his resignation took place. It has 
     <lb/>
     been asserted in this House, I do not know 
     <lb/>
     with what truth, that the Minister of Pub<lb break="no"/>lic Works some time ago placed his resigna<lb break="no"/>tion in the hands of the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, or at all events told him that his port<lb break="no"/>folio was at his service whenever the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country required it. However 
     <lb/>
     that may be, I wish courteously to place 
     <lb/>
     on record a remonstrance against the con<lb break="no"/>tinuance of this condition of affairs. I do 
     <lb/>
     not think there is any warrant for it under 
     <lb/>
     the constitution. Indeed, I do not think 
     <lb/>
     there is any warrant for it under the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the Order in Council which was discussed 
     <lb/>
     somewhat last session, and under which one 
     <lb/>
     minister of the Crown may under certain 
     <lb/>
     circumstances act for another minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Crown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     On another occasion, which is referred 
     <lb/>
     to by Mr. Todd in his work on consti<lb break="no"/>tutional government, Lord John Russell 
     <lb/>
    had accepted the seals of the Colonial 
     <lb/>Office, at a time when he was absent on 
     <lb/>a diplomatic mission in Vienna. Within two 
     <lb/>weeks after he had accepted the seals of 
     <lb/>office, the matter was brought to the at<lb break="no"/>tention of parliament, and again on two or 
     <lb/>three occasions subsequently, and was made 
     <lb/>the occasion of a grave criticism of the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration, which only ceased when he 
     <lb/>took his place in parliament on the 28th 
     <lb/>of April. Now, so far as my hon. friend 
     <lb/>the Minister of Public Works is concerned, 
     <lb/>he has been absent from his duties in parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and from his duties in the depart<lb break="no"/>ment for a very long time ; and if there be 
     <lb/>any foundation for the rumour that he is 
     <lb/>ready to surrender the seals of office at a 
     <lb/>moment's notice, I do not know for what 
     <lb/>reason the right hon. gentleman proposes to 
     <lb/>carry on the business of the country in the 
     <lb/>way in which it is carried on at the present 
     <lb/>time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     We have not only the case of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Public Works, but we have what seems 
     <lb/>
     to me a much more serious violation of 
     <lb/>
     constitutional usage in the conduct of the 
     <lb/>
     government with respect to the vacant port<lb break="no"/>folio of the Interior. I do not want to 
     <lb/>
     repeat to-day what has already been said 
     <lb/>
     in this House. I have asked the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister more than once for an explanation 
     <lb/>
     of his extraordinary conduct in passing over 
     <lb/>
     that gentleman in introducing a very im<lb break="no"/>portant measure, a most momentous mea<lb break="no"/>sure, into this parliament without even hav<lb break="no"/>ing submitted the terms of perhaps its 
     <lb/>
     most important clause to that gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     although his return was daily expected. 
     <lb/>
     My right hon. friend has treated that very 
  

            <pb n="3557" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3557.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3557</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 31, 1905</fw> <fw type="num">3558</fw>
         

     lightly. He has treated also very lightly 
     <lb/>
     the circumstance that he also withheld 
     <lb/>
     the terms of that clause from the knowledge 
     <lb/>
     of his Minister of Finance, who certainly 
     <lb/>
     of all ministers of the Crown, should have 
     <lb/>
     been acquainted with the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     measure. I might almost venture to say 
     <lb/>
     that the conduct of the Prime Minister, 
     <lb/>
     in bringing that Bill down while with<lb break="no"/>holding from parliament the knowledge 
     <lb/>
     that those gentlemen had not approved of 
     <lb/>
     it, amounted to an insult to this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment ; I think I might even go further, 
     <lb/>
     and say that the right hon. gentleman, in 
     <lb/>
     taking that course, demeaned himself ; and 
     <lb/>
     not one word of explanation with regard 
     <lb/>
     to that very peculiar circumstance has fal<lb break="no"/>len from the right hon. gentleman's lips 
     <lb/>
     from that day to this. Instead of that, we 
     <lb/>
     have had mere flippant replies or absolute 
     <lb/>
     silence when any explanation has been cour<lb break="no"/>teously demanded across the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House. Moreover, we have had rumours, 
     <lb/>
     1 do not know with what truth, but it is 
     <lb/>
     right that they should be stated and some 
     <lb/>
     answer made—we have had rumours from 
     <lb/>
     the press of the province of Quebec in close 
     <lb/>
     touch with this administration, and even 
     <lb/>
     direct statements, that the cause assigned 
     <lb/>
     to this parliament for the resignation of the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior was not the true 
     <lb/>
     cause. Further than that, a certain journal 
     <lb/>
     published in the province of Quebec with 
     <lb/>
     which a very devoted champion and warm 
     <lb/>
     and intimate personal friend of the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister is connected, has seen fit to make 
     <lb/>
     that statement in the form of a cartoon, 
     <lb/>
     which most of us have seen, but to which 
     <lb/>
     I will not make any further reference by 
     <lb/>
     way of description.

     <lb/>
     expert in regard to the opinions of that

     paper ; but my hon. friend from Labelle 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Bourassa), who is a warm champion 
     <lb/>
     of the government with regard to this mea<lb break="no"/>sure with which the resignation of the late 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior is closely associat<lb break="no"/>ed, has a very close connection with that 
     <lb/>
     paper, if I am rightly informed.

     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. If the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle were here, I am sure he would dis<lb break="no"/>sent from my hon. friend's statement. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Labelle has repeatedly de<lb break="no"/>clared before this House and before the pub<lb break="no"/>lic that he had nothing to do with the 'Le

            <cb/>
       

     the statement of the hon. member if he 
     <lb/>
     were here ; but I have been imformed, per<lb break="no"/>haps incorrectly, that the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle has been one of the regular con<lb break="no"/>tributors to that journal, and I myself have 
     <lb/>
     seen contributions in that journal which pur<lb break="no"/>ported to be signed by that hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think my hon. friend will deny that.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. I can say to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend that when the paper was started about 
     <lb/>
     two years ago the hon. member for Labelle 
     <lb/>
     wrote two or three articles which he signed 
     <lb/>
     'Henri Bourassa ;' but since then he has 
     <lb/>
     declared over and over again that he has 
     <lb/>
     nothing to do with the paper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I accept whatever 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend states about it without the 
     <lb/>
     slightest reserve, either parliamentary or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise, and I will leave that for the gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen from the province of Quebec to 
     <lb/>
     settle. I do not pretend to know anything 
     <lb/>
     about it. There is another little interesting

     rumour which has come to us from time to 
     <lb/>
     time, and I observe that in former days my 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend was very much interested 
     <lb/>
     in these rumours and used always to bring 
     <lb/>
     them to the attention of parliament in order 
     <lb/>
     that they might be contradicted. I have 
     <lb/>
     looked up his record in that regard and find 
     <lb/>
     that I have good precedent for what I am 
     <lb/>
     about to mention. There is a very strong 
     <lb/>
     rumour, said to have emanated from a cer<lb break="no"/>tain member of the administration, who 
     <lb/>
     lately received a pretty severe little stab 
     <lb/>
     in this House from the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior (Mr. Sifton), that the ex-minister 
     <lb/>
     was not so absolutely ignorant of the terms 
     <lb/>
     of this measure, in the first instance, as had 
     <lb/>
     been suggested in this House. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know about that, but my right hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     can perhaps give us information and set at 
     <lb/>
     rest at once that disquieting rumour. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But what is the position to-day, so far as 
     <lb/>
     the Department of the Interior is concerned? 
     <lb/>
     We have a statute which says that there 
     <lb/>
     shall be a Department of the Interior and 
     <lb/>
     there shall be a Minister of the Interior. We 
     <lb/>
     start with that in the first instance. That 
     <lb/>
     statute goes on to say : ' The Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior shall have the control and manage<lb break="no"/>ment of the affairs of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories.' Those are the exact words of the 
     <lb/>
     statute, and that statute has been in force 
     <lb/>
     during every one of the thirty-one days 
     <lb/>
     which have elapsed since the ex—Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior has resigned. What was my 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend's view with regard to this 
     <lb/>
     constitutional question not long ago ? I 
     <lb/>
     have already brought it to the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House, but it is not out of place that I 
     <lb/>
     shall repeat his own words again : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     Well, we have a statute which says that 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior shall have the 
     <lb/>
     control and management of the affairs of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories, and we have the 
     <lb/>
     words of the Prime Minister himself who 
     <lb/>
     tells us that the Minister of the Interior, 
     <lb/>
     apart from any statute, has a special re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility with regard to the affairs of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories with which he is more 
     <lb/>
     closely connected than his colleagues. But 
     <lb/>
     What are we proposing to do at present? 
     <lb/>
     We are proposing to take a step which 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman and his colleagues 
     <lb/>
     declare to be one of the most momentous 
     <lb/>
     ever taken by a parliament of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Yet the right hon. gentleman has not 
     <lb/>
     filled the post of Minister of the Interior. 
     <lb/>
     That position is still vacant. We are now in 
     <lb/>
     the heat of debate upon the Bills he has in<lb break="no"/>troduced. Before long we shall be in com<lb break="no"/>mittee on those Bills, and we shall not have 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of the presence and counsel 
     <lb/>
     of a minister specially responsible for the 
     <lb/>
     administration of those Territories. We do 
     <lb/>
     not find at present in the cabinet any minis<lb break="no"/>ter who is able to carry on the work of that 
     <lb/>
     department. I have been informed by men. 
     <lb/>
     whom I have no reason to disbelieve, on 
     <lb/>
     various occasions during the last two or 
     <lb/>
     three weeks, that the work of that depart<lb break="no"/>ment is practically at a standstill for the 
     <lb/>
     lack of a responsible minister, familiar with 
     <lb/>
     its affairs and able to give his undivided 
     <lb/>
     attention to them. Why is this the case? 
     <lb/>
     Is there any reason for it? Let me show 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend how zealous he was in re<lb break="no"/>spect of such matters when little difficulties, 
     <lb/>
     such as have recently occurred in the present 
     <lb/>
     administration, happened to occur some ten 
     <lb/>
     years ago in the Conservative administra<lb break="no"/>tion of that day. What was the right hon.

     gentleman's view then:

     <lb/>
     New Brunswick at the time when it served

     my right hon. friend which I have just read. 
 



            <cb/>
         
 
     He is proposing to give to these Territories 
     <lb/>
     a constitution which at no time in the future 
     <lb/>
     will a Canadian parliament be able to 
     <lb/>
     change, and, forgetting the great constitu<lb break="no"/>tional rule which he laid down in days gone 
     <lb/>
     by, he is proposing to do this in the absence 
     <lb/>
     of any representative of those Territories 
     <lb/>
     in the cabinet. He is proposing that parlia<lb break="no"/>ment should finally deal with a measure 
     <lb/>
     vitally affecting the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     while these Territories are absolutely unre<lb break="no"/>presented in the cabinet. For what purpose 
     <lb/>
     was that statute passed creating the portfolio 
     <lb/>
     of Minister of the Interior ? Why, if not 
     <lb/>
     that there shall be in the cabinet a minister 
     <lb/>
     representing that country who would be 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly competent to safeguard its inter<lb break="no"/>ests especially in matters of such import<lb break="no"/>ance as the one now before us? Why, in 
     <lb/>
     those days my right hon. friend was so 
     <lb/>
     anxious in this regard, that upon the mere 
     <lb/>
     rumour of the resignation of ministers from 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, he moved the adjournment of the 
     <lb/>
     House and discussed the question at length. 
     <lb/>
     Later on, upon full explanation being given, 
     <lb/>
     when he had been assured that those gentle<lb break="no"/>men had not resigned and were at one with 
     <lb/>
     their colleagues, he was so much interested 
     <lb/>
     in the constiutional aspect of the case that 
     <lb/>
     he again moved the adjournment. But to<lb break="no"/>day when we inquire whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     vacant portfolio of the interior will be filled, 
     <lb/>
     my right hon. friend seems to emerge tem<lb break="no"/>porarily from a condition of forgetfulness. 
     <lb/>
     He is as one who would say: 'Why, bless 
     <lb/>
     my soul, then there is a Department of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior: I must look after it one of these 
     <lb/>
     days. There are Northwest Territories, but 
     <lb/>
     I had almost forgotten their existence. One 
     <lb/>
     of these days we will take the question up 
     <lb/>
     when there is nothing else to do ; but in the 
     <lb/>
     meantime we will go on and deal with most 
     <lb/>
     important questions affecting these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories without any regard Whatever to the 
     <lb/>
     statute.' In those days he was a stickler 
     <lb/>
     for constitutional usage but today he dis<lb break="no"/>plays a complete change of front. Let me 
     <lb/>
     read one more brief extract from a speech 
     <lb/>
     of the right hon. gentleman of those days : 
            </p>
            
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>
     Moreover here are two seats vacant, vacant 
     <lb/>
     since yesterday, and although the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men who occupy these seats may not have ten<lb break="no"/>dered officially their resignations to His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency, it is quite evident that they are no 
     <lb/>
     longer in harmony with their colleagues. other<lb break="no"/>wise they would be in their places to dis<lb break="no"/>charge their share of the business of the 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     In view of the cynical disregard of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution which we see every day in this 
     <lb/>
     House, is not the reminiscence, brought up 
     <lb/>
     by the utterances I have just quoted, per<lb break="no"/>fectly delicious ? Here are two-thirds of the 
     <lb/>
     cabinet not in harmony with the other one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     third, if we apply the test which the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman himself applied ten years 
     <lb/>
     ago. How many of the colleagues of my 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend are present in the House 
     <lb/>
     to-day ? There is a vacant seat next to him. 
  

            <pb n="3561" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3561.jpg"/>

     The one next to that is vacant. There is 
     <lb/>
     another vacant on his left and another along<lb break="no"/>side of the Minister of Inland Revenue. 
     <lb/>
     There is also a vacant seat immediately be<lb break="no"/>hind the right hon. gentleman. But still 
     <lb/>
     there is an unusually large number of minis<lb break="no"/>ters in the House to-day, and I have taken, 
     <lb/>
     I must admit, an unfortunate occasion to 
     <lb/>
     exhibit an object lesson to the country. 
     <lb/>
     Usually we have only about three ministers 
     <lb/>
     present, and we must therefore, according 
     <lb/>
     to the test which the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     applied ten years ago, conclude that the 
     <lb/>
     other ten are on the eve of resignation. 
     <lb/>
     However that may be, let me say that I do 
     <lb/>
     not observe in anything which has been sug<lb break="no"/>gested by my right hon. friend any reason 
     <lb/>
     why the portfolio of the Interior should not 
     <lb/>
     be filled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He has said nothing on the subject. Has 
     <lb/>
     he no material ? If he does not appoint 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) 
     <lb/>
     to be Chief Justice of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, in view of the constitutional argu<lb break="no"/>ment he gave us the other day, I imagine 
     <lb/>
     that that hon. gentleman would make a very 
     <lb/>
     good Minister of the Interior, and I am in<lb break="no"/>clined to press his claims. He is a very 
     <lb/>
     good friend of mine personally, though we 
     <lb/>
     differ somewhat politically ; and I stand 
     <lb/>
     here to urge the claims of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Edmonton to this position. He is a 
     <lb/>
     gentleman of ripe experience and great 
     <lb/>
     ability, and, as we all know a gentleman 
     <lb/>
     of absolute and perfect independence on 
     <lb/>
     all questions. But, if we cannot have my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Edmonton, why should 
     <lb/>
     we not have the hon. member from West 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia (Mr. Scott). Is not he capable ? 
     <lb/>
     Is there any apprehension on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. Prime Minister that there will 
     <lb/>
     be any difficulty about securing the election 
     <lb/>
     of either of these gentlemen ? Does he 
     <lb/>
     propose to let this matter stand until after 
     <lb/>
     the close of the present session, in defiance 
     <lb/>
     of all the high constitutional principles 
     <lb/>
     which he professed ten years ago ? If there 
     <lb/>
     is a lack of material among the members 
     <lb/>
     for the Northwest Territories, why not ap<lb break="no"/>point some broad minded man like my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt), who 
     <lb/>
     spoke last night, or my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) ? Could not one of 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen be induced to go up and 
     <lb/>
     teach these men in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, whom they described as so narrow 
     <lb/>
     and bigoted that they could not be trusted, 
     <lb/>
     some of these men whom my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) described as 
     <lb/>
     regenade Liberals?—why not send one of 
     <lb/>
     these broad-minded tolerant gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     these men of the Northwest Territories to 
     <lb/>
     teach them what true Christian charity and 
     <lb/>
     toleration really are. I do not think there 
     <lb/>
    could be any objection to that, though, of 
     <lb/>course, my hon. friend from Labelle might 
     <lb/>be himself a candidate for the Chief Jus<lb break="no"/>ticeship in oppositon to my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>Edmonton, for he has said that he is ready 
   

            <cb/>
  

     to discuss the constitution with any man 
     <lb/>
     in this country or anywhere else. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, just one more observation on this 
     <lb/>
     subject. The right hon. gentleman (Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid Laurier) was rather facetious ten 
     <lb/>
     years ago. He told us of those two min<lb break="no"/>isters coming back and likened them to 
     <lb/>
     kittens coming back to their cream. Well, 
     <lb/>
     we have had a couple of kittens who were 
     <lb/>
     a little skittish on this occasion. One, it is 
     <lb/>
     true, did not leave the cream. It arched 
     <lb/>
     its back and curved its tail, but remained 
     <lb/>
     within a reasonable distance of the cream, 
     <lb/>
     and is still lapping. The other did leave 
     <lb/>
     the cream. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Shooed away. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. There is a disquiet<lb break="no"/>ing rumour throughout the country, to which 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Lau<lb break="no"/>rier) might address himself, that, although 
     <lb/>
     the minister in question, like the kitten, has 
     <lb/>
     left the cream for the time being there is 
     <lb/>
     being prepared for him an exceedingly 
     <lb/>
     dainty dish of cream which will be served 
     <lb/>
     up in due season. We do not know whe<lb break="no"/>ther that may be the case or not; but, per<lb break="no"/>haps it would be well for the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, remembering the analogy which 
     <lb/>
     he gave to the House some time ago, to 
     <lb/>
     tell us whether or not there is anything 
     <lb/>
     in this rumour. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But, in all seriousness, Mr. Speaker, I do 
     <lb/>
     think it is due to the House and to the coun<lb break="no"/>try that the Prime Minister should state 
     <lb/>
     what the intention of the government is in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the filling of the portfolio. The 
     <lb/>
     government, in defiance of all constitu<lb break="no"/>tional usages and of constitutional rules laid 
     <lb/>
     down by themselves on many occasions 
     <lb/>
     intend, apparently, to press this mea<lb break="no"/>sure through parliament without hav<lb break="no"/>ing in the cabinet any minister who is more 
     <lb/>
     especially responsible for the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. We should be informed, in view 
     <lb/>
     of the delay in filling this position, what 
     <lb/>
     is the cause of that delay and also when 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister expects to fill this port<lb break="no"/>folio. Or, if he does not propose to fill it 
     <lb/>
     in the immediate future, may I not, res<lb break="no"/>pectfully, and with every right, ask him 
     <lb/>
     to announce to the House and to the coun<lb break="no"/>try what the difficulties really are which 
     <lb/>
     prevent him, at the present time, from call<lb break="no"/>ing to his cabinet some gentleman from the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories or elsewhere, who, in 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet, will particularly represent these 
     <lb/>
     Territories.

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Rt. Hon. Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName> (Prime

     reason why he has not yet been replaced. 
     <lb/>
     Yet, I might have hoped that my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     would abstain on this occasion from referr<lb break="no"/>ing to another gentleman, a highly respected 
     <lb/>
     member of this House, who, unfortunately, is 
     <lb/>
     not in his seat, from a cause which, we 
     <lb/>
     might have hoped, would appeal to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman's sympathy as to the sympathy 
     <lb/>
     of every member of this House. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, I think, was not well actuated, nor 
     <lb/>
     do I think his remarks were at all called 
     <lb/>
     for, in directing the attention of the House 
     <lb/>
     to the fact that the Minister of Public 
     <lb/>
     Works (Mr. James Sutherland) has not been 
     <lb/>
     in his place in this House during the pre<lb break="no"/>sent session. The fact is correctly stated, 
     <lb/>
     and, perhaps, under different circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     no fault could be found with the observa<lb break="no"/>tions which my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Bor<lb break="no"/>den) has made. But I was under the im<lb break="no"/>pression that the well known cause of the 
     <lb/>
     absence from the House of the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Public Works would warrant everybody in 
     <lb/>
     allowing that absence to pass without re<lb break="no"/>mark. The hon. gentleman (Mr. James 
     <lb/>Sutherland) has been absent from this 
     <lb/>House because of the state of his health. 
     <lb/>I am reminded that, some six or seven years 
     <lb/>ago, when another of my colleagues, the 
     <lb/>Minister of Militia (Sir Frederick Borden) 
     <lb/>having suffered a severe shock in a railway 
     <lb/>accident, was absent from this parliament 
     <lb/>for a whole session, not a word was ever 
     <lb/>uttered upon the subject. Everybody un<lb break="no"/>derstood the circumstances and hoped that 
     <lb/>the hon. gentleman would resume his duties 
     <lb/>as we hope that the hon. Minister of Public 
     <lb/>Works will, in the near future, be able to 
     <lb/>resume his place. And that is the reason 
     <lb/>why the absence of the Minister of Public 
     <lb/>Works should not be commented upon. My  
     <lb/>hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) has referred 
     <lb/>to a rumour that the Minister of Public 
     <lb/>Works has tendered his resignation to me. 
     <lb/>I would have preferred not to speak upon 
     <lb/>this subject. I do not know that the House 
     <lb/>expects me to speak upon it even after 
     <lb/>the reference to it made by my hon. friend. 
     <lb/>Still, I may say that the Minster of Public 
     <lb/>Works has not placed his resignation in my  
     <lb/>hands. When he told me that he was in 
     <lb/>poor health and could not attend to the 
     <lb/>business of the session, I took it upon my<lb break="no"/>self to say to him, ' My friend, you had bet<lb break="no"/>ter go away and stay away until you are 
     <lb/>better ; we will arrange to carry on the 
     <lb/>work of your department ; and every mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the House will be glad to know that 
     <lb/>there is hope that you will soon come back 
     <lb/>again.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, with regard to the resignation of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior (Mr. Sifton), I have only one obser<lb break="no"/>vation to make in answer to the numerous 
     <lb/>
     queries my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
     <lb/>
     has put to me. So far as I know, and I 
     <lb/>
    have no reason to believe to the contrary, 
     <lb/>the only difference that occurred between 


            <cb/>
    

     myself and the late Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior was that he resigned upon this edu<lb break="no"/>cational question and for no other reason. 
     <lb/>
     I owe it to my hon. friend from Brandon to 
     <lb/>
     make this statement openly, widely, and, 
     <lb/>
     as I hope, for ever to set at rest any rum<lb break="no"/>ours to the contrary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, it is true that my hon. friend has 
     <lb/>
     not been replaced yet. How many days 
     <lb/>
     have elapsed since he resigned his portfolio? 
     <lb/>
     Just thirty-one days. But, before I come 
     <lb/>
     to that, let me say that I do not think there 
     <lb/>
     is any anology whatever between the re<lb break="no"/>signation of my hon. friend the late Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior and what took place some 
     <lb/>
     ten years ago, in 1895. Then we saw a 
     <lb/>
     very different spectacle—members coming 
     <lb/>
     in and members going out, members resign<lb break="no"/>ing one day and taking back their resigna<lb break="no"/>tion the following day, or the following 
     <lb/>
     week, members absent from parliament, 
     <lb/>
     not because they were called away a few 
     <lb/>
     days for any reason, but members not in 
     <lb/>
     their seats because they were neither in nor 
     <lb/>
     out of the government, and because they 
     <lb/>
     did not appear to know what position they 
     <lb/>
     occupied. There is nothing of the kind 
     <lb/>
     here, we know where we are, at all events. 
     <lb/>
     But when there are disagreements amongst 
     <lb/>
     ministers, the honourable course is for the 
     <lb/>
     dissenting minister to proffer his resigna<lb break="no"/>tion, and to say to the Prime Minister : I 
     <lb/>
     do not agree with your policy. This is what 
     <lb/>
     has taken place ; and therefore there is no 
     <lb/>
     analogy whatever between what took place 
     <lb/>
     in 1895 and what is taking place to-day. 
     <lb/>
     It is true, as I say, that the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Brandon has not been replaced in the 
     <lb/>
     cabinet. My hon. friend the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition asks, for what cause ? Is it any 
     <lb/>
     lack of material ? Perhaps it may be for 
     <lb/>
     an opposite cause, perhaps it is too abundant 
     <lb/>
     material. There is such a thing as an em<lb break="no"/>barras de richesse, although my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     appears to be suffering from the reverse, 
     <lb/>
     he is suffering from penury. while we on 
     <lb/>
     this side are suffering from abundance and 
     <lb/>
     that may be just as good a reason as the 
     <lb/>
     reason suggested by my hon. friend. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Make two ministers 
     <lb/>
     then. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     but that would be a good reason, I will think 
     <lb/>
     of it. It might be well to have two ministers 
     <lb/>
     instead of one ; but I am sure that if I 
     <lb/>
     were to ask parliament for an appropriation 
     <lb/>
     for another minister my hon. friend would 
     <lb/>
     be one of the first to object, he would not 
     <lb/>
     allow us to do it. However, we will have 
     <lb/>
     to be content with one Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, that is all we are called upon to ap<lb break="no"/>point. I do not think my hon. friend can 
     <lb/>
     charge the government with negligence be<lb break="no"/>cause it has not appointed another minister 
     <lb/>
     to a portfolio which has been vacant only 
     <lb/>
     thirty-one days. I do not think there has 
     <lb/>
     been any negligence whatever, on the con<lb break="no"/>trary I think the government has done right

     to deliberate, to consider what position 
     <lb/>
     they are going to take, who they are going 
     <lb/>
     to call upon to fill the very important place 
     <lb/>
     left vacant by the late minister. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman appreciates of course the fact that 
     <lb/>
     in this connection I called attention to the 
     <lb/>
     peculiar condition, namely, that we are 
     <lb/>
     about to pass a very important Bill with 
     <lb/>
     regard to those Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Yes, and this 
     <lb/>
     is a reason why, in my estimation, instead 
     <lb/>
     of pressing the matter. we should exercise 
     <lb/>
     a little delay. This Bill cannot be postponed 
     <lb/>
     if we intend to have these provinces begin 
     <lb/>
     operations on the 1st of July next. There 
     <lb/>
     are many reasons why this should be done. 
     <lb/>
     the people expect it, and therefore we can<lb break="no"/>not delay the prosecution of the Bill. But 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman wants us at the same 
     <lb/>
     time to proceed with the Bill and to proceed 
     <lb/>
     with an election in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, or somewhere else. I do not think, 
     <lb/>
     under the circumstances. we can do any<lb break="no"/>thing else than to proceed. as governments 
     <lb/>
     have always proceeded in these matters, 
     <lb/>
     and to take time to consider who is the best 
     <lb/>
     man to seek to fill this position. There are 
     <lb/>
     numerous precedents, of which I will refer 
     <lb/>
     to a few. There has been a vacancy before 
     <lb/>
     in the portfolio on the Interior. For in<lb break="no"/>stance, the Department of the Interior had 
     <lb/>
     been filled by a very able man. the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Thomas White. from the 5th of August. 
     <lb/>
     1885. to the 21st April, 1888, and then a 
     <lb/>
     vacancy occurred through the death of that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman. That vacancy remained from 
     <lb/>
     the 21st April to the 3rd August, 1888. not 
     <lb/>
     one month. not two months, not three 
     <lb/>
     months, but more than three months elapsed 
     <lb/>
     before the vacancy was filled. This oc<lb break="no"/>curred during a session of parliament. and 
     <lb/>
     I do not remember that any word of criti<lb break="no"/>cism was made against the government 
     <lb/>
     because they did not proceed immediately 
     <lb/>
     to fill that portfolio. But that is not all. 
     <lb/>
     I would call attention to another important 
     <lb/>
     department of the government, the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Railways. That department was 
     <lb/>
     created on the 20th of May, 1879. it was 
     <lb/>
     filled by Sir Charles Tapper, who occupied 
     <lb/>
     the position until the 23rd of May, 1884, 
     <lb/>
     when the position became vacant and re<lb break="no"/>mained vacant—how long? To the 25th of 
     <lb/>
     September, 1884 ? No, but until the 25th 
     <lb/>
     of September, 1885, nearly a year and four 
     <lb/>
     months. But that is not all. The Hon. 
     <lb/>
     John Henry Pope occupied the portfolio 
     <lb/>
     from September 25, 1885, to April 1, 1889. 
     <lb/>
     when a vacancy again occurred by the death 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Pope, and the portfolio remained 
     <lb/>
     vacant until the 28th of November, 1889, 
     <lb/>
     when it was filled by Sir John A. Macdon<lb break="no"/>ald. He occupied the post of Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Railways until the 6th of June, 1891, when 
     <lb/>
     the portfolio became vacant and remained 
     <lb/>
     so until the 11th of January, 1892, when 
     <lb/>
     it was filled by the hon. member for Lanark 
   

            <cb/>
   

     (Mr. Haggart). Yet there was not. so far 
     <lb/>
     as I remember, much criticism on the fact 
     <lb/>
     of these vacancies remaining so long, one 
     <lb/>
     of them for a year and four months. On 
     <lb/>
     the present occasion, a vacancy has oc<lb break="no"/>curred in the portfolio of the Interior, but it 
     <lb/>
     will not remain vacant for one year and four 
     <lb/>
     months. not even for four months, not even 
     <lb/>
     for three months, but in due time, and be<lb break="no"/>fore long, I shall give my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     fullest satisfaction that he desires to have 
     <lb/>
     on this question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Hon. GEO. E. FOSTER</persName> (North Toronto) 
     <lb/>
     The right hon. gentleman has, as usual, 
     <lb/>
     risen to the occasion in his own way ; whe<lb break="no"/>ther that way is satisfactory to the House 
     <lb/>
     and to the country is another matter. He 
     <lb/>
     has, as often happens recently, not treated 
     <lb/>
     the matter seriously. He seems to think 
     <lb/>
     that. as the responsible head of a govern<lb break="no"/>ment, he is not bound to give any sufficient 
     <lb/>
     reasons for violations of constitutional prac<lb break="no"/>tice, violations of precedent and violations 
     <lb/>
     of the canons of good government. He read 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend. the leader of the opposition, 
     <lb/>
     a lecture upon propriety, which I think was 
     <lb/>
     altogether uncalled for. It seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Carleton (Mr. R. L. 
     <lb/>
    Borden) introduced his reference to the 
     <lb/>Department of Public Works in the most 
     <lb/>kindly and most courteous way. He 
     <lb/>attempted to find no fault with the 
     <lb/>minister personally. But what did 
     <lb/>strike him, and what, I think he ex<lb break="no"/>pressed to the House very properly and very 
     <lb/>reasonably, was the fact that one of the 
     <lb/>most important departments of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is now, not for one month, or two 
     <lb/>months. or three months, or four months, 
     <lb/>but for many, many months more than that, 
     <lb/>practically without a head. Well, whilst 
     <lb/>disposed in every way to have a kindly 
     <lb/>feeling to the hon. gentleman who has the 
     <lb/>misfortune by illness to be away from his 
     <lb/>department, I think it is very well under<lb break="no"/>stood that there is not a probability of that 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman again administering that de<lb break="no"/>partment. He has been out of it for a long 
     <lb/>series of months. It. has been practically 
     <lb/>taken over by another gentleman who is 
     <lb/>not responsible in the way that a minister 
     <lb/>is. I am not at all saying that he would not 
     <lb/>make a very good responsible minister, but 
     <lb/>no man can in a lay position, so to speak, 
     <lb/>administer a department with the same 
     <lb/>power and with the same sense of responsi<lb break="no"/>bility as one who is specially appointed 
     <lb/>under the law. So that, in reference to that 
     <lb/>the maxim which has been so often men<lb break="no"/>tioned here of late that the King's govern<lb break="no"/>ment must go on applies. The King's gov<lb break="no"/>ernment must go on. It will not wait even 
     <lb/>for illness or for death or for any of these 
     <lb/>circumstances. The affairs of the country 
     <lb/>are over and superior to all these and there 
     <lb/>is not the least doubt in the world that the 
     <lb/>department suffers from the lack of a res<lb break="no"/>ponsible head. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<p>
     Saying no more about that, if this de<lb break="no"/>partment is, for the reasons that the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. First Minister stated, vacant and has 
     <lb/>
     been vacant for ever so long it ought to be 
     <lb/>
     an additional reason and a very strong 
     <lb/>
     additional reason why other departments 
     <lb/>
     which are vacant or virtually vacant in 
     <lb/>
     this House should be filled up. For in<lb break="no"/>stance, take the Department of the Interior. 
     <lb/>
     The minister himself of that department 
     <lb/>
     for a long time, by reason of illness, was 
     <lb/>
     unable to be at the department. I suppose 
     <lb/>
     there is no department of this government 
     <lb/>
     which has so varied a range of interests and 
     <lb/>
     requires so much a constant, steady and 
     <lb/>
     firm head as the Department of the Inte<lb break="no"/>rior. The hon. gentleman who was the 
     <lb/>
     minister has been away from that depart<lb break="no"/>ment for a considerable length of time. 
     <lb/>
     Changes took place whilst he was away, 
     <lb/>
     changes which have never been explained 
     <lb/>
     to this House. The deputy minister retired 
     <lb/>
     or was forced to retire, I do not know 
     <lb/>
     which, and a new man was placed in the 
     <lb/>
     department. There is an additional reason 
     <lb/>
     why there should be some responsible head 
     <lb/>
     of the department. With its varied inter<lb break="no"/>ests, with its multiplied avenues of ap<lb break="no"/>proach—approach for all kinds of influences 
     <lb/>
     extending from the administration of the 
     <lb/>
     gold regions in the far north down 
     <lb/>
     all through an immense range of territory 
     <lb/>
     in Canada itself, with its branches all over 
     <lb/>
     the United States of America and all over 
     <lb/>
    Europe as well there is not a department 
     <lb/>which lends itself so much to abuse and 
     <lb/>to results which inevitably arise from the 
     <lb/>want of careful and firm handling than 
     <lb/>that very same department. There have 
     <lb/>been things said against that department 
     <lb/>and they are said against that department 
     <lb/>now. The right hon. gentleman has not 
     <lb/>read the newspapers and moved up and 
     <lb/>down Canada without knowing all these 
     <lb/>things. For that reason then, and when a 
     <lb/>new deputy minister takes hold, nominally, 
     <lb/>there should be a strong, firm and respon<lb break="no"/>sible man at the head of the department. 
     <lb/>During the whole session we have not been 
     <lb/>able to get any information from the In<lb break="no"/>terior Department such as we should have 
     <lb/>got. There has not been a question of 
     <lb/>moment brought up because there has been 
     <lb/>no person in the House representing the de<lb break="no"/>partment to answer for the department. 
     <lb/>The right hon. gentleman who leads the 
     <lb/>government says : I am nominally the head 
     <lb/>of the department. ' Nominally' that is the 
     <lb/>correct word. It is absolutely impossible 
     <lb/>for him to master the details of that 
     <lb/>department with the multiplied duties 
     <lb/>that he has as premier—absolutely im<lb break="no"/>possible and still that portfolio re<lb break="no"/>mains open? Why ? Because of lack 
     <lb/>of material ? The Prime Minister will 
     <lb/>not say that. In his easy way he has 
     <lb/>rather attributed it to an embarrassment of 
     <lb/>riches. Well, the right hon, gentleman can<lb break="no"/>not delay for ever. He can make up his 
     <lb/>mind quickly enough if he wishes to. He

     can delay just as long as any other man if 
     <lb/>
     it suits him to delay, but we know that at 
     <lb/>
     this very moment he has within his mind's 
     <lb/>
     eye the man he proposes to appoint as 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior. Why does he not 
     <lb/>
     have him go to the west? Is he afraid that 
     <lb/>
     his Bill will be through before the election 
     <lb/>
     can be carried out. I think he can possess 
     <lb/>
     his soul in patience so far as that is con<lb break="no"/>cerned. He will have ample time to send 
     <lb/>
     his man to the Northwest Territories and 
     <lb/>
     give one single, solitary opportunity, the 
     <lb/>
     only one, of permitting the Northwest 8. 
     <lb/>
     voice of allowing one portion at least of 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories to pronounce upon the policy of this 
     <lb/>
     Bill which is so all important to that great 
     <lb/>
     western country. The right hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the government, stickler for precedent 
     <lb/>
     that he is when he is out of office, puts it 
     <lb/>
     lightly away when he assumes the badge 
     <lb/>
     of office. He erects into a constitutional 
     <lb/>
     principle what had never before been taken 
     <lb/>
     is a constitutional principle in order to serve 
     <lb/>
     a purpose. The purpose once served he 
     <lb/>
     throws away his invention, he has no use 
     <lb/>
     for it, until another circumstance arises 
     <lb/>
     which will call for another constitutional 
     <lb/>
     principle. What is his constitutional prin<lb break="no"/>ciple ? It was adverted to by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend here (Mr. R. L. Borden). It was the 
     <lb/>
     result of a circumstance which was none 
     <lb/>
     too creditable to the government of my 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend. An hon. gentleman went 
     <lb/>
     into a department in the temporary ab<lb break="no"/>sence of another minister meddled in a 
     <lb/>
     matter of its administration and so brought 
     <lb/>
     about some considerable confusion in the 
     <lb/>
     government of this country. It was then 
     <lb/>
     that the new constitutional principle was 
     <lb/>
     devised, invented, brought out brand new. 
     <lb/>
     that there was a geographical ministerial 
     <lb/>
     responsibility as well as a constitutional 
     <lb/>
     responsibility—all very good for the occa<lb break="no"/>sion and yet when you have a great part 
     <lb/>
     of this country to be erected into provinces, 
     <lb/>
     to be, by an irrevocable decree fashioned, 
     <lb/>
     moulded and formed the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman refuses to consult with the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the government of that coun<lb break="no"/>try. He brings down here at his own ex<lb break="no"/>press request and call the only representa<lb break="no"/>tives that are available of these two great 
     <lb/>
     Territories—the premier and one of his ca<lb break="no"/>binet, backed up, as I said the other day, 
     <lb/>
     by a third member of his cabinet. When 
     <lb/>
     he gets them here he throws them lightly 
     <lb/>
     aside, at least the Tory part of the <choice><sic>repre<lb break="no"/>sensation</sic><corr>reprensentation</corr></choice>, he finds sources of information in 
     <lb/>
     his own way and he refuses almost abso<lb break="no"/>lutely upon the most important part of his 
     <lb/>
     Bill to recognize the legal and constitutional 
     <lb/>
     representative of that portion of the coun<lb break="no"/>try for which this Bill is being specially 
     <lb/>
     provided. As he himself says this is the 
     <lb/>
     most momentous of questions before the 
     <lb/>
     House affecting absolutely and particularly 
     <lb/>
     that portion of the country, and yet he will 
     <lb/>
     not either test the feeling of the people of 
     <lb/>
     that country, or what is of much more im<lb break="no"/>
          

            <pb n="3569" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3569.jpg"/>

     portance than that, he will not give to 
     <lb/>
     that portion of the country its minister 
     <lb/>
     with geographical responsibility as well as 
     <lb/>
     constitutional responsibility. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, a circumstance occurred not long 
     <lb/>
     ago which rather lends force to the argu<lb break="no"/>ment and which affects some men in 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman's cabinet. What 
     <lb/>
     did we find in October of last year ? We 
     <lb/>
     found the right hon. gentleman coming 
     <lb/>
     down to the province of Ontario, getting 
     <lb/>
     down upon bended knees before a luminary 
     <lb/>
     of the law and saying to him in so many 
     <lb/>
     English words: My dear Mr. Aylesworth I 
     <lb/>
     have colleagues and representatives in the 
     <lb/>
     government from the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     who have been with me for some time, but 
     <lb/>
     I find that in Ontario my hold is growing 
     <lb/>
     gradually weaker. I am not only not in<lb break="no"/>creasing the strength, but I see that 
     <lb/>
     strength diminishing. I do not want to 
     <lb/>
     turn these out to pasture, poor as they 
     <lb/>
     are, and so I must have you come in and 
     <lb/>
     save the remnant in the province of Onta<lb break="no"/>rio. The right hon. gentleman needed some 
     <lb/>
     strength, and if ever there was a practi<lb break="no"/>cal illustration of that need we have it 
     <lb/>
     this year. The lynx-eyed minister, the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General (Sir William Mulock), 
     <lb/>
     is not here, and I suppose I may venture 
     <lb/>
     to mention him to-day Without his inflicting 
     <lb/>
     upon this House that oft-repeated story 
     <lb/>
     repeated so well along the concessions and 
     <lb/>
     side lines of North Ontario, learned and 
     <lb/>
     conned and repeated so often up and down 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario, and repeated so 
     <lb/>
     often in this House, that it is becoming a 
     <lb/>
     tale oft-told, with the little interest that 
     <lb/>
     attaches to a tale oft-told. I suppose that 
     <lb/>
     I may refer to the fact that he slept at his 
     <lb/>
     post while the most important legislation 
     <lb/>
     was being performed for these orphan ter<lb break="no"/>ritories in the Northwest. Is there not some 
     <lb/>
     reason why there should be a brave, bright, 
     <lb/>
     strong, wide-awake man brought in from 
     <lb/>
     the west who will not sleep at his post, 
     <lb/>
     but who will know What is going on and 
     <lb/>
     see that his geographical ministerial re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility is fully exercised in the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation of the people in the country from 
     <lb/>
     which he comes. If the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) can keep consti<lb break="no"/>tutionally portfolios open for one month, 
     <lb/>
     he can keep them open for two, three or 
     <lb/>
     four months. He was the gentleman who, 
     <lb/>
     in opposition, pleaded always for a full 
     <lb/>
     cabinet, for the ministerial responsibility 
     <lb/>
     to be properly divided and distributed, and 
     <lb/>
     that there should be at the post of power 
     <lb/>
     in each department a responsible head. 
     <lb/>
     He knows as well as we all know that that 
     <lb/>
     is proper constitutional doctrine, and that 
     <lb/>
     it is necessary for the good government and 
     <lb/>
     good administration of the country. Yet he 
     <lb/>
     does not fill the vacant position, and he does 
     <lb/>
     not give us any valid reason why. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HUGH1">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName> (Victoria and Hali<lb break="no"/>burton). The First Minister has referred 
  

            <cb/>
       

     to the fact that after the death of the late 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Thomas White the portfolio of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior was vacant for some time. That 
     <lb/>
     is true, but he also knows that at that time 
     <lb/>
     a new principle in constitutional govern<lb break="no"/>ment, the principle that there must be a 
     <lb/>
     responsible minister for the district, had 
     <lb/>
     not been engrafted on the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     this country. The First Minister has given 
     <lb/>
     us that new line in the constitution. At 
     <lb/>
     that time also there was no great crisis in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest, as there is on the present 
     <lb/>
     occasion, for it must be remembered that the 
     <lb/>
     vacancy in the portfolio of the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior to-day is caused owing to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that legislation is before this House 
     <lb/>
     which the responsible minister from the 
     <lb/>
     district refused to endorse and which he 
     <lb/>
     claims is not satisfactory to the people of 
     <lb/>
     that region. Therefore, the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     are entirely changed, and, as far as the 
     <lb/>
     parallel goes, the Prime Minister's argu<lb break="no"/>ment will not hold godd. The custom in 
     <lb/>
     all these matters in the old country is that 
     <lb/>
     there shall be a responsible minister at 
     <lb/>
     each post. The leader of the opposition (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     R. L. Borden) has referred to a case in 
     <lb/>
     point, where, in 1871, objection was simply 
     <lb/>
     taken in the House of Commons to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Childers, First Lord of the Ad<lb break="no"/>miralty, was absent during illness, and 
     <lb/>
     within one month thereafter Mr. Childers 
     <lb/>
     resigned. This is even more important than 
     <lb/>
     the case of the absence of a minister 
     <lb/>
     through illness. We have before us an im<lb break="no"/>portant measure which is going to affect 
     <lb/>
     that Northwest country for weal or woe. 
     <lb/>
     The minister refuses to sanction that mea<lb break="no"/>sure and retires from the cabinet, but owing 
     <lb/>
     to certain pressure, I do not know what 
     <lb/>
     the pressure or arrangement may have been, 
     <lb/>
     time may solve it, but owing to some nego<lb break="no"/>tiations—and they are good at carrying on 
     <lb/>negotiations and bringing about mediations 
     <lb/>in the cabinet—the Ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior has agreed to vote for the govern<lb break="no"/>ment's emasculated measure, as he terms it, 
     <lb/>although on every solitary point in the Bill 
     <lb/>he differs essentially from the First Minis<lb break="no"/>ter and the cabinet. The circumstances 
     <lb/>are such that I maintain they warrant the 
     <lb/>action of the government in filling the post 
     <lb/>at the very first opportunity. The First 
     <lb/>Minister has stated that this Bill cannot 
     <lb/>wait, that it must become law by the lst 
     <lb/>of July. It is not very long from now until 
     <lb/>the 1st of July, and if the First Minister is 
     <lb/>anxious that the measure shall get through 
     <lb/>by the lst of July it might be advisable for 
     <lb/>him to seriously consider whether or not 
     <lb/>its passage would not be facilitated by the 
     <lb/>appointment of a new Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, who might go before his constituents. 
     <lb/>seek re-election and test the feeling as to 
     <lb/>the reception which the Bill will likely 
     <lb/>meet when it has been passed by this House. 
     <lb/>The Prime Minister would likely make 
     <lb/>time if he adopted such a course rather 
     <lb/>than trusting to the Bill being passed with<lb break="no"/>

     out opposition and becoming law by the 1st 
     <lb/>
     of July, so that he could thereafter have 
     <lb/>
     the election of the Minister of the Interior. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to say a word about the position of 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Public Works. The acting 
     <lb/>
     minister (Mr. Hyman), I regret to say, has 
     <lb/>
     just gone out. No man regrets the illness 
     <lb/>
     of the present minister—I refer to the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. James Sutherland—more than I do my<lb break="no"/>self. He is a gentleman for whom I have 
     <lb/>
     always had and always shall have the very 
     <lb/>
     highest personal regard, and no one will 
     <lb/>
     more heartily welcome him back to health 
     <lb/>
     and to this House than I. But what are 
     <lb/>
     the facts of the case ? It is generally un<lb break="no"/>derstood, in fact a gentleman whom the 
     <lb/>
     minister himself has consulted, has stated 
     <lb/>
     that the Minister of Public Works has asked 
     <lb/>
     the First Minister to accept his resignation, 
     <lb/>
     but for some reason or other this resigna<lb break="no"/>tion has not been accepted. That respon<lb break="no"/>sible position, which the constitution requires 
     <lb/>
     shall be held by a member having a seat in 
     <lb/>
     the parliament directly responsible to the 
     <lb/>
     people, has not been filled, and one of the 
     <lb/>
     largest spending departments of the public 
     <lb/>
     service is without a responsible head in this 
     <lb/>
     House to-day. I am not saying one word 
     <lb/>
     about the hon. member for London, the min<lb break="no"/>ister without portfolio (Mr.   Hyman),  a 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who I believe undoubtedly stands 
     <lb/>
     head and shoulders over his colleagues from 
     <lb/>
     that province. I am not saying one word 
     <lb/>
     about his fitness, and that is all the more 
     <lb/>
     reason why he should be made the re<lb break="no"/>sponsible minister. He occupies a peculiar 
     <lb/>
     position.   His position in the cabinet is 
     <lb/>
     simply that of a minister without portfolio. 
     <lb/>
     He is not responsible for any department, 
     <lb/>
     and has not appealed to the people for re<lb break="no"/>election after his appointment as minister. 
     <lb/>
     I am sure the First Minister will hear me 
     <lb/>
     out when I say that the position he now 
     <lb/>
     occupies is entirely unconstitutional. It is 
     <lb/>
     pointed out in Todd, page 483, volume 2, in 
     <lb/>
     reference to the case of Lord Russell, spok<lb break="no"/>en of by the leader of the opposition (Mr.

     As a matter of fact. Lord Jehn Russell

     returned and resumed his seat on April 30. 


            <cb/>
 

     Although the Prime Minister was in his 
     <lb/>
     place, the minister who was both formally 
     <lb/>
     and technically responsible returned in less 
     <lb/>
     than two months, and that satisfied the 
     <lb/>
     House and the country. The case of the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Public Works was entirely dif<lb break="no"/>erent. The member for London is not tech<lb break="no"/>nically qualified. He may be formally quali<lb break="no"/>fied as a member of the Privy Council, but 
     <lb/>
     he is not technically qualified for the office 
     <lb/>
     of Minister of Pubilc Works, and therefore 
     <lb/>
     I maintain that there should be no delay in 
     <lb/>
     accepting the resignation of the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Public Works. Then the member for Lon<lb break="no"/>don, one of the most popular men in the 
     <lb/>
     country, will have an opportunity of prov<lb break="no"/>ing whether or not the present cabinet has 
     <lb/>
     the confidence of the people of this Domin<lb break="no"/>ion, not only in regard to the Public Works 
     <lb/>
     Department, but in regard to their general 
     <lb/>
     conduct of other matters. The custom of the 
     <lb/>
     English constitution is that all important 
     <lb/>
     measures involving important principles, 
     <lb/>
     such as that involved in the Bill before the 
     <lb/>
     House, should be pronounced upon by the 
     <lb/>
     people before becoming law. The First Min<lb break="no"/>ister knows that this measure was not at all 
     <lb/>
     discussed before the electorate. No one 
     <lb/>
     dreamed that there were going to be the con<lb break="no"/>tentious matters in this Bill that have been 
     <lb/>
     found in it. Therefore I maintain that the 
     <lb/>
     duty of the Prime Minister is to hold this 
     <lb/>
     Bill off until the feeling of the country in 
     <lb/>
     regard to it can be tested in a general elec<lb break="no"/>tion. I maintain that there is only one of 
     <lb/>
     two courses open to him at the present time. 
     <lb/>
     One is to go to the country and test the 
     <lb/>
      feeling of the electors in a general election; 
     <lb/>
     another is to appoint a new Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     interior and put him in the field in some 
     <lb/>
     riding in the Northwest and test the feeling 
     <lb/>
     of the country in that way. The portfolio of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior should not be held open a mo<lb break="no"/>ment' longer than is absolutely necessary.

     <lb/>
     Speaker, I beg to say a few words on this 
     <lb/>
     question before the motion is disposed of. 
     <lb/>
     it seems to me that we are face to face with 
     <lb/>
     a very unusual state of things both in this 
     <lb/>
     House and in the country. We are confront<lb break="no"/>ed with what may fairly be regarded. under 
     <lb/>
     constitutional government. as a very grave 
     <lb/>
     crisis. Confederation is yet on its trial. It 
     <lb/>
     was adopted many years ago to overcome 
     <lb/>
     difficulties which experience had shown to 
     <lb/>
     exist in our previous form of government, 
     <lb/>
     and with the object of doing justice to every 
     <lb/>
     interest and every locality. The fathers of 
     <lb/>
     confederation wisely and carefully consider<lb break="no"/>ed this constitution before it was adopted. 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of endeavouring. as far as 
     <lb/>
     the experience of the national life would en<lb break="no"/>able them to do up to that time. to avoid 
     <lb/>
     the troubles of the past and to provide a pm. 
     <lb/>
     per government for the future; and the 
     <lb/>
     principle they laid down was representation 
     <lb/>
     by population in the popular chamber—this

     is, that every member should represent a 
     <lb/>
     certain number of the electors or population. 
     <lb/>
     But they provided that every member should 
     <lb/>
     represent a certain area as well. The deli<lb break="no"/>mitation of the areas each of which should 
     <lb/>
     elect a member was made in the first sta<lb break="no"/>tutes, and that was observed and carried 
     <lb/>
     out in our first election. The fathers 
     <lb/>
     of confederation believed that we required 
     <lb/>
     an upper House as well as a lower 
     <lb/>
     House—a corrective chamber that would 
     <lb/>
     not be subject to the excitement of elections 
     <lb/>
     but that would be appointed by the Crown; 
     <lb/>
     and the selection of the men who were to 
     <lb/>
     form that chamber was made on the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple that each should represent not only 
     <lb/>
     a certain province, but a certain district in 
     <lb/>
     that province. From Quebec there were to 
     <lb/>
     be twenty-four, from Ontario twenty-four, 
     <lb/>
     and from the maritime provinces twenty-four 
     <lb/>
     and each was to represent a certain dis<lb break="no"/>trict within his particular province. There 
     <lb/>
     were not only twenty-four members of the 
     <lb/>
     Senate assigned to Quebec, but the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act says :

            <p>
     I am giving this recapitulation to show 
     <lb/>
     that the designers of confederation had in 
     <lb/>
     view not only representation by population, 
     <lb/>
     but representation of locality as well, and 
     <lb/>
     that this principle applied not only to the 
     <lb/>
     popular chamber, which was to be elected, 
     <lb/>
     but to the Senate, which was not to be elect<lb break="no"/>ed, and to the cabinet ministers. With re<lb break="no"/>gard to ministerial representation, we find 
     <lb/>
     that a certain number of ministers were as<lb break="no"/>signed to Quebec. Originally it was three. 
     <lb/>
     Now it is four, with an extra one, which 
     <lb/>
     makes the number five. The same number 
     <lb/>
     was assigned to Ontario and the same num<lb break="no"/>ber to the maritime provinces ; and these 
     <lb/>
     were so arranged that each locality would 
     <lb/>
     be represented. That principle was follow<lb break="no"/>ed for years as strongly as any other prin<lb break="no"/>ciple to be found within the four corners 
     <lb/>
     of the constitution. It was a part of our 
     <lb/>
     unwritten constitution, and we lived up to 
     <lb/>
     it carefully and closely, because it was be<lb break="no"/>lieved that by doing so we did justice to all 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country and to all interests in<lb break="no"/>volved, and no injustice to any. A certain 
     <lb/>
     number of cabinet ministers was assigned to 
     <lb/>
     each province in proportion to its popula<lb break="no"/>tion, its importance and its area. As time 
     <lb/>
     went on and settlement went westward, 
     <lb/>
     we were obliged to change that a little. We 
     <lb/>
     dropped some of our representation in the 
     <lb/>
     smaller provinces in the east, and endeavour<lb break="no"/>ed to give representation to the west ; be<lb break="no"/>cause it was felt that so long as there was 
     <lb/>
     a section that had no voice in the cabinet, 
     <lb/>
     we were not fully carrying out the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of representation that was adopted by 


            <cb/>
    


     the fathers of confederation. What was all 
     <lb/>
     this intended for ? That every locality 
     <lb/>
     should have its voice and its spokesman in 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of the nation and in the cab<lb break="no"/>inet, so that justice might be done to all 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country. That was the aim 
     <lb/>
     and the reason why this unwritten consti<lb break="no"/>tution was followed as closely as any por<lb break="no"/>tion of our written constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are two objects in view in organ<lb break="no"/>izing a cabinet. What are these two ob<lb break="no"/>jects ? The first is to select men who are 
     <lb/>
     fitted for the position. The second is to 
     <lb/>
     make the selection so that each member of 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet may represent a certain local<lb break="no"/>ity and the special interests in that locality. 
     <lb/>
     These interests may be commercial or ma<lb break="no"/>ritime or something else. And the selec<lb break="no"/>tion should be such as will receive the en<lb break="no"/>dorsation of the people. These are the two 
     <lb/>
     objects in view in filling a cabinet. In a 
     <lb/>
     well balanced cabinet, every district has its 
     <lb/>
     voice at the council board, every district 
     <lb/>
     has its representative in council. But ap<lb break="no"/>plying this principle to the present condi<lb break="no"/>tion of things, what is the situation to<lb break="no"/>day. We have in this confederation about 
     <lb/>
     2,100,000 square miles of territory. How 
     <lb/>
     much of that territory is represented in 
     <lb/>
     this cabinet ? Take the combined provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and Prince Edward Island, and they 
     <lb/>
     only represent 564,000 square miles. Take 
     <lb/>
     the balance of the territory which is not 
     <lb/>
     represented, which has no voice in the ca<lb break="no"/>binet, which has no say at the council 
     <lb/>
     board, and we find that it comprises 1,558,<lb break="no"/>888 square miles.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP3">Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>. What is the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I am not going into de<lb break="no"/>tails as regards population, but if you take 
     <lb/>
     the map of the Dominion and draw a line 
     <lb/>
     straight through it from south to north. 
     <lb/>
     going as far west as you will find a cabinet 
     <lb/>
     representative at present—that is the city 
     <lb/>
     of London—you will find that two-thirds of 
     <lb/>
     the territory of the Dominion is without a 
     <lb/>
     cabinet representative. Is that just or un<lb break="no"/>just ? Is that carrying out the design of 
     <lb/>
     the fathers of confederation ? Is that doing 
     <lb/>
     justice to all and injustice to none ? I 
     <lb/>
     say it is not. Two-thirds of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     to-day have no voice at the council board. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever policy may be introduced and de<lb break="no"/>cided upon there, they have no opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of expressing their dissent or assent or of 
     <lb/>
     shaping it any way whatever. A rather emi<lb break="no"/>nent writer on confederation said that it 
     <lb/>
     was the solemn duty of each province keen<lb break="no"/>ly to watch and promptly to repel any at<lb break="no"/>tempt faint or forcible which the federal 
     <lb/>
     government might be disposed to make on 
     <lb/>
     the rights and privileges of any one of them. 
     <lb/>
     That is Mr. Watson's idea of the duties of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces. But how can a province ex<lb break="no"/>ercise this scrutiny unless it has its full 
     <lb/>
     representation, not only in the House of 
 


            <pb n="3575" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3575.jpg"/>

     Commons, but on the council board of a 
     <lb/>
     nation. And if this large portion of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion has no voice in the council, surely 
     <lb/>
     it is deprived of a portion of its undoubted 
     <lb/>
     rights. I find that two-thirds of the area 
     <lb/>
     of this Dominion is not represented at the 
     <lb/>
     council board, and that at the very time 
     <lb/>
     when a most important question, one vi<lb break="no"/>tally affecting the interests of that country, 
     <lb/>
     is about to be decided. One of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to-day has almost been driven into 
     <lb/>
     revolt, if we can believe what we read in 
     <lb/>
     the newspapers. I refer to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. The absolute refusal of the 
     <lb/>
     rights of that province to have its bounda<lb break="no"/>ries extended, the absolute refusal to do its 
     <lb/>
     claims justice when these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     are being created, has irritated it to such 
     <lb/>
     an extent that its government has threaten<lb break="no"/>ing to resign as a protest against the con<lb break="no"/>duct of this administration. Are we not 
     <lb/>
     then face to face with a very serious crisis? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A great question is now before us for de<lb break="no"/>termination, namely, the establishment of 
     <lb/>
     two new provinces out in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. What ownership shall these 
     <lb/>
     provinces have in the soil? What repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives shall they possess ? What legis<lb break="no"/>lative power shall be given them ? What 
     <lb/>
     interference shall we make with what they 
     <lb/>
     believe to be their undoubted rights in the 
     <lb/>
     future ? All these great questions are be<lb break="no"/>ing discussed by this parliament, and these 
     <lb/>
     Territories have no voice at the council 
     <lb/>
     board. They had a voice there not long 
     <lb/>
     ago, but their representative resigned as a 
     <lb/>
     rebuke against the high-handed and unwar<lb break="no"/>ranted conduct of the government on the 
     <lb/>
     Autonomy Bill. A Minister of the Crown, 
     <lb/>
     representing that country, gave practical ex<lb break="no"/>pression of his dissent from that policy by 
     <lb/>
     resigning his portfolio. Under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances, it certainly is the duty of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to fill that portfolio at the earliest 
     <lb/>
     possible moment and have a united cabinet 
     <lb/>
     on the policy which they are submitting to 
     <lb/>
     parliament. Why are they not acting in 
     <lb/>
     accord with the principles of constitutional 
     <lb/>
     government ? Why do they not appoint a 
     <lb/>
     minister and let him go before the people, 
     <lb/>
     so that the people may have an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of endorsing or condemning the policy of 
     <lb/>
     the administration? The reason, Sir, is 
     <lb/>
     evident. They dare not do it. They want 
     <lb/>
     to force the Bill through without giving 
     <lb/>
     the people chiefly interested an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of declaring their will regarding it. They 
     <lb/>
     refuse to respect the sovereign rights of the 
     <lb/>
     people. They are acting in utter disregard 
     <lb/>
    of the great electorate which can make 
     <lb/>and unmake parliament ? Are they afraid 
     <lb/>to appeal to that power ? I am justified by 
     <lb/>their conduct in coming to the conclusion 
     <lb/>that they are afraid to trust the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Then, are we not justified in raising our 
     <lb/>voice in rebuke of the conduct of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment ? Are we not justified in calling 
     <lb/>public attention to that conduct as a viola<lb break="no"/>tion of the principles of constitutional gov<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>


     ernment under which we live ? We should 
     <lb/>
     clearly be doing less than our duty if we 
     <lb/>
     refrained from inviting public attention to 
     <lb/>
     the present condition of affairs. As I have 
     <lb/>
     said, it is clear that the government dare 
     <lb/>
     not allow the people to speak, to signify 
     <lb/>
     their agreement or disagreement with the 
     <lb/>
     measure now before the House. At best, 
     <lb/>
     the representation of the Northwest in regard 
     <lb/>
     to this measure could only be indirect so 
     <lb/>
     far as the cabinet is concerned. The peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest Territories sent their 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, their accredited representa<lb break="no"/>tive. Except for this delegate they are 
     <lb/>
     represented only by a few members in this 
     <lb/>
     House whose voices are but little heard. 
     <lb/>
     The government has acted in a most high<lb break="no"/>handed and tyrannical fashion in its treat<lb break="no"/>ment of the rights of the people of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, when a member is selected for the 
     <lb/>
     cabinet, he is selected on two grounds— 
     <lb/>
     his fitness for the position and the locality 
     <lb/>
     he represents. And who is to determine 
     <lb/>
     his fitness ? First, the Prime Minister who 
     <lb/>
     chooses him. But the judgment of the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister must be endorsed by the 
     <lb/>
     people, for, according to our constitutional 
     <lb/>
     forms, a minister, on his appointment, must 
     <lb/>
     go before the people to be endorsed by 
     <lb/>
     them. Have the government dared to ap<lb break="no"/>point a minister and so seek the judgment 
     <lb/>
     of the people on their policy? They have 
     <lb/>
     not. This policy was not before the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in the last election, and so there has 
     <lb/>
     not been the opportunity for the people to 
     <lb/>
     express themselves upon it. The only con<lb break="no"/>clusion that we can come to is that the 
     <lb/>
     government are afraid of the people and 
     <lb/>
     dare not take the step of appointing a min<lb break="no"/>ister to fill the present vacancy because the 
     <lb/>
     effect of that would be to give the people 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity to express their opinions upon 
     <lb/>
     this important measure. The financial in<lb break="no"/>terests of that great country in the North<lb break="no"/>west are involved ; their whole future is 
     <lb/>
     involved. Yet, they have no one in the cab<lb break="no"/>inet to speak for them or determine their 
     <lb/>
     rights,—the people of the Northwest must 
     <lb/>
     go into the ' Blind pool' to which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) referred 
     <lb/>
     last year. Yet, the Prime Minister declares 
     <lb/>
     over and over again that he admires the 
     <lb/>
     British constitution and tries to follow it. 
     <lb/>
     His conduct, in my opinion, is the very re<lb break="no"/>verse of all that; he violates every prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of constitutional government by the 
     <lb/>
     course he pursues. He acts like the Czar 
     <lb/>
     of Russia, deliberately against the people's 
     <lb/>
     rights and wishes. The people are given 
     <lb/>
     no opportunity to determine what their leg<lb break="no"/>islative rights shall be with regard to their 
     <lb/>
     property, their financial relations to the Do<lb break="no"/>minion or any of the other great questions 
     <lb/>
     involved in this measure. And their accre<lb break="no"/>dited representative, their Prime Minister, 
     <lb/>
     is spurned when he comes here and seeks to 
     <lb/>
     speak on behalf of his people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The conduct of the government is a direct

     invasion of provincial rights. The present 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) should 
     <lb/>
     be the last man in Canada to disregard or 
     <lb/>
     ignore provincial rights in carrying on our 
     <lb/>
     government. The fathers of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, when they were determining what 
     <lb/>
     form of government we should have, were 
     <lb/>
     compelled, owing to the sentiment of Que<lb break="no"/>bec to favour a federal union rather than a 
     <lb/>
     legislative union. Under the federal union 
     <lb/>
     the boundaries of provincial rights are 
     <lb/>
     clearly marked and held as sacred, while, 
     <lb/>
     under a legislative union the provinces 
     <lb/>
     would have only such powers as were given 
     <lb/>
     them by the central authority. I find the 
     <lb/>
     following passage in the life of Sir John A. 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald. Speaking of the discussions 
     <lb/>
     which took place before confederation was

     consummated he said :

     manage theirs. In this respect, the mea<lb break="no"/>sure does not carry out the principle of con<lb break="no"/>federation. And it comes with doubly bad 
     <lb/>
     grace from a Prime Minister who comes 
     <lb/>
     from Quebec, a province that insisted upon 
     <lb/>
     a form of confederation which would make 
     <lb/>
     their provincial rights secure. Now that the 
     <lb/>
     rights of his own province are established, 
     <lb/>
     the Prime_ Minister attacks the provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights of the new provinces in the west. 
     <lb/>
     In view of all this I say we are face to 
     <lb/>
     face with a great crisis and there is strong 
     <lb/>
     excitement throughout our country. And 
     <lb/>
     why ? Because of the outrage upon the 
     <lb/>
     feelings and opinion: of the people who 
     <lb/>
     have no opportunity to help themselves. 
     <lb/>
     Should this continue ? I say it should not. 
     <lb/>
     I have called attention to the fact that dis<lb break="no"/>regard of our constitutional system almost 
     <lb/>
     drove one province into revolt, and, if it 


            <cb/>
     

     is persisted in, it may arouse to revolt the 
     <lb/>
     people of the new provinces. The sooner 
     <lb/>
     the government place themselves squarely 
     <lb/>
     upon the principles of the constitution and 
     <lb/>
     give to the Northwest a representative in 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet, the better it will be for every<lb break="no"/>body. We shall then have an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to work out our constitutional system to a 
     <lb/>
     success, instead of making it the discourag<lb break="no"/>ing failure it undoubtedly will be if this 
     <lb/>
     government and their SUCcessors set consti<lb break="no"/>tutional principles at defiance.

     <persName ref="pers:STOC1">Mr. A. A. STOCKTON</persName> (St. John City and 
     <lb/>
     County). Mr. Speaker, I think the points 
     <lb/>
     made by the leader of the opposition (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     R. L. Borden) are well taken. I hope the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) will 
     <lb/>
     pardon me if I say that I do not think that 
     <lb/>
     he met the question asked by the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition with the frankness which the 
     <lb/>
     circumstances demanded. It will be re<lb break="no"/>membered, that, after the introduction of 
     <lb/>
     the Bills which have produced so much 
     <lb/>
     discussion in this House, the question was 
     <lb/>
     asked of the Prime Minister whether the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) would 
     <lb/>
     be back in time for the discussion of these 
     <lb/>
     Bills. The First Minister replied that he 
     <lb/>
     did not know when the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior would be here, meaning that he did 
     <lb/>
     not expect, and did not care whether the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior were here 01- not, 
     <lb/>
     since he, the First Minister, had charge of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, let me say that the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     has not answered the question put by the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition except by citing the 
     <lb/>
     instances which took place ten, twelve or 
     <lb/>
     more years ago. What is the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the First Minister with respect to those 
     <lb/>
     instances? Did he approve of them, or 
     <lb/>
     does he approve of them now? Does he 
     <lb/>
     think that citing those instances is a suf<lb break="no"/>ficient answer to the question put him by 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition? I would like 
     <lb/>
     to know what the opinions of the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister are upon those instances. I say, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, thatif there ever was a time 
     <lb/>
     in the history of this country when it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary that a responsible minister from 
     <lb/>
     that Northwest country should be here on 
     <lb/>
     the floor of this House, it in to-day. We 
     <lb/>
     know that the proposition has been put 
     <lb/>
     forward that the ministers represent lo<lb break="no"/>calities, and that they are to be trusted 
     <lb/>
     to a large extent with the administration of 
     <lb/>
     affairs in those localities. How stands the 
     <lb/>
     matter to-day? Is there any representative 
     <lb/>
     from the great Northwest here today to 
     <lb/>
     look after the interests of that great coun<lb break="no"/>try, which is causing so much discussion 
     <lb/>
     and occupying so much attention in this 
     <lb/>
     House and in the country at large? Not one, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, and so far as any information is given 
     <lb/>
     by the First Minister to-day, there will be no 
     <lb/>
     representative in the government from the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest until after these Bills are passed. 
     <lb/>
     Is that fair to the people of that country?

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3580</fw>
     

     Is it fair to the representatives of that 
     <lb/>country in this House to force this meas<lb break="no"/>ure through without the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west, by their responsible minister, having<lb/>a voice in the consideration of the measure?<lb/>I think not, Sir, and I think it is unfair to<lb/>that country that it should have no re<lb break="no"/>sponsible minister here while this discus<lb break="no"/>sion is going on, and while this measure is<lb/>being passed through the House.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sir, there is another phase of the<lb/>question. When the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior appeared here, apparently to the con<lb break="no"/>fusion of the First Minister, two days<lb/>after he had introduced this Bill, what took<lb/>place? The resignation of the Minister of<lb/>the Interior. Why ? As a protest against<lb/>the action of the First Minister in intro<lb break="no"/>ducing the Autonomy Bills in his absence,<lb/>and particularly against the educational<lb/>clauses thereof, which the ex-Minister of<lb/>the Interior could not endorse, and he va<lb break="no"/>cated his seat as a protest against the ac<lb break="no"/>tion of the First Minister and of his gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. That was a challenge thrown <lb/>down to the First Minister and to his gov<lb break="no"/>ernment upon their polict with respect to <lb/>these Bills. There is a vacancy in the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment now, the government is without a<lb/>Minister of the Interior. Let the First<lb/>Minister test the feeling of the people of the<lb/>Northwest upon this question by selecting<lb/>from his plethora of ability that he has be<lb break="no"/>hind him a gentleman to fill the position of<lb/>Minister of the Interior, and let him send<lb/>that gentleman back for re-election in order<lb/>to test the feelings of the people of the<lb/>Northwest with respect to his policy. That<lb/>would be the manly way, that would be<lb/>the bold way, that would be the proper<lb/>way on the part of men who are willing to<lb/>trust the people. Is this government will<lb break="no"/>ing to trust the people in connection with <lb/>these Bills?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. No.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr STOCKTON. The conduct of the <lb/>government apparently shows that they are<lb/>not willing to trust the people. I say,<lb/>don't gag the people of the Northwest, give<lb/>them an opportunity to say whether they<lb/>want this legislation or not, give them an<lb/>opportunity to say in a constitutional way<lb/>whether they are in harmony with the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment with respect to this measure. The<lb/>right hon. gentleman has an opportunity<lb/>of doing that. If he and his government do<lb/>not do it, they show that they do not trust<lb/>the people; although the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is reported to have said that he was<lb/>a democrat to the hilt. Now, Sir, I should<lb/>say no more on this question. I felt that<lb/>I could not remain silent while a question<lb/>of this importance was before the House.<lb/>I repeat that the conduct of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment in keeping this seat vacant is not fair<lb/>to the people of the Northwest, it is not fair<lb/>to the people of the rest of Canada, and,<lb/>furthermore, it is contrary to the constitu<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
   

     tional usages which obtain in the mother 
     <lb/>country and all the great self-governing<lb/>colonies of the empire.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. H. LENNOX</persName> (South Simcoe). I did 
     <lb/>not intend to speak on this question until<lb/>the main question came again before the <lb/>House. But I do feel that this is a time for<lb/>hon. members of the House to speak out,<lb/>and say distinctly what they think of<lb/>the conduct of the government. I had<lb/>hoped, there being seven representatives in<lb/>this House from the Northwest supporting<lb/>the government, that they at all events<lb/>would defend the interests of their own<lb/>section in this matter. When I find that<lb/>the First Minister has been able so far to<lb/>influence and to control those hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers, I think it necessary that the rest of<lb/>us should speak definitely on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject. Now the First Minister has been per<lb break="no"/>fectly consistent, and with my great re<lb break="no"/>spect for the First Minister, I shall take the<lb/>liberty of addressing a few plain words to <lb/>him in the English language which I hope<lb/>he will fairly understand. I hope that the<lb/>people of this country will become seized<lb/>of the situation, and although it is vain to<lb/>hope that the government will listen to the<lb/>voice of reason on this subject, there is<lb/>one power in this country great enough to<lb/>arrest the action of the government, and <lb/>that is the press. I hope that they will<lb/>take this matter up and agitate from end<lb/>to end of Canada before this measure goes<lb/>through, in order that we may guarantee<lb/>the interests of the great west in this House.<lb/>I say that the First Minister to-day has<lb/>been consistent in his attitude throughout<lb/>this whole matter, not only in this matter,<lb/>but during the last two sessions, in treating<lb/>lightly subjects of great importance and in<lb/>treating the representative of the people<lb/>with levity by neglecting their just de<lb break="no"/>mands. The First Minister must appre<lb break="no"/>hend that he has not on any occasion when<lb/>the leader of the opposition, either to-day<lb/>or previously, asked for information which<lb/>this House has a right to obtain, given a<lb/>fair, square and honest answer to a question.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Now the First Minister says, we know 
     <lb/>where we are. Well, perhaps they do. It<lb/>is rather recent information, for they did<lb/>not know where they were two or three weeks ago,<lb/>but the party lash has been applied. They<lb/>know where they are to-day but they do not<lb/>know where they will be to-morrow. They<lb/>do not know where they will be a week<lb/>hence and I warrant there are some hon.<lb/>gentlemen opposite who do not know yet<lb/>quite what is going to develop during the<lb/>course of this discussion, and who do not<lb/>know where they will be a week hence. <lb/>Probably the hon. member for Edmonton<lb/>(Mr. Oliver) thinks he knows where he is.<lb/>The hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr.<lb/>Scott) probably thinks he knows where he is<lb/>

     or where he is going to be, but, they do not 
     <lb/>
     both know it. One of them will probably 
     <lb/>
     get the office and we will then see a display 
     <lb/>
     of the anger of the one who has not got the 
     <lb/>
     position he desires. The right hon. First 
     <lb/>
     Minister says that it is only thirty-one days' 
     <lb/>
     delay, and he also said that in 1888 it was a 
     <lb/>
     matter of months or probably more that the 
     <lb/>
     position of Minister of the Interior was 
     <lb/>
     vacant. Does the right hon. gentleman want 
     <lb/>
     that to go to the country as the honest, states<lb break="no"/>manlike utterance of the First Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion of Canada ? But, if we have, 
     <lb/>
     as was said by hon. members on his own side 
     <lb/>
     of the House, and as is the fact, before us 
     <lb/>
     one of the most momentous questions that 
     <lb/>
     have at any time involved the consideration 
     <lb/>
     of this House, a question that will affect the 
     <lb/>
     future of the west, half a million miles of 
     <lb/>
     the best territory of this Dominion and 
     <lb/>
     the best agricultural country that exists 
     <lb/>
     to-day, is there any analogy between this 
     <lb/>
     case and the case of the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior in 1888 ? 'Only thirty-one days ago,' 
     <lb/>
     says the right hon. First Minister, and in a 
     <lb/>
     while when it suits my convenience, when I 
     <lb/>
     get entirely ready, after I have held at bay 
     <lb/>
     the office-seekers who want the position and 
     <lb/>
     whom I dare not now offend because I want 
     <lb/>
     to dangle before them the plums of office 
     <lb/>
     and not offend any one of them until after 
     <lb/>
     this crucial period has gone by, then, after 
     <lb/>
     the 1st of July, after I have riveted upon 
     <lb/>
     the west and established the system of 
     <lb/>
     fetters that I desire, then, at my conveni<lb break="no"/>ence, as the great Czar of Canada—for the 
     <lb/>
     time being ; not for all time to come, thank 
     <lb/>
     God,—I will announce what I will do. He 
     <lb/>says that he is embarrassed by a wealth of<lb/>
    material. Very likely. The right hon. 
     <lb/>First Minister is perfectly sincere. He 
     <lb/>has a wealth of material in this House. 
     <lb/>One man says that he is as good as the other. 
     <lb/>Each man says: I am the big man for the 
     <lb/>situation; and this is a source of embarrass<lb break="no"/>ment perhaps to the right hon. First Min<lb break="no"/>ister. He dare not fill that position because 
     <lb/>he is afraid that some of his followers whose 
     <lb/>votes he depends upon might not be avail<lb break="no"/>able in this crisis. I do not know that I 
     <lb/>need say much further in reference to what 
     <lb/>the right hon. First Minister has said. 
     <lb/>The right hon. gentleman is more remark<lb break="no"/>able for what he does not say on these 
     <lb/>occasions than for what he says. But, he 
     <lb/>asks : Would you expect us to have an 
     <lb/>election and to have this discussion going 
     <lb/>on at the same time ? What does the right 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman mean by that ? Does it 
     <lb/>require his personal supervision to engineer 
     <lb/>the election in the west ? Does it require 
     <lb/>that the strength of the cabinet shall 
     <lb/>be transferred to the west or to any of the 
     <lb/>most important points of the west while an 
     <lb/>election is going on ? Does the right hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman feel that the situation is so deli<lb break="no"/>cate and dangerous in the west that it will 
     <lb/>require all the power of the government, 


            <cb/>
      

     and probably more to bring about the result 
     <lb/>
     that he wants ? Does he anticipate now 
     <lb/>
     that when the 1st of July has gone past and 
     <lb/>
     when he does appoint a Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior the people of the west will visit 
     <lb/>
     with condemnation the administration which 
     <lb/>
     is now in power at Ottawa ? Or, does he 
     <lb/>
     simply mean that it will require so much 
     <lb/>
     manipulation that it would be impossible 
     <lb/>
     to carry on this discussion in the House 
     <lb/>
     and carry on an election in the west at the 
     <lb/>
     same time ? What is the meaning of it ? 
     <lb/>
     Is it an admission to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada (wrested from the right hon. First 
     <lb/>
     Minister) because we have not had such an 
     <lb/>
     admission made often in this House, that 
     <lb/>
     he realizes that it will take the most super<lb break="no"/>human effort on his part to win in 
     <lb/>
     the west if he were to open a con<lb break="no"/>stituency there at the present time ? In 
     <lb/>
     other words that he has not, with all the 
     <lb/>
     wealth of material that he has in this House 
     <lb/>
     or out of it, because he could select a 
     <lb/>
     minister for this position out of the House 
     <lb/>
     as well as in it—he could send Mr. Ayles<lb break="no"/>worth up there if he could be elected,—the 
     <lb/>
     least chance of electing his Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior if he will accept the challenge 
     <lb/>
     which is a fair and square challenge, to 
     <lb/>
     give to those people who have not been al<lb break="no"/>lowed to voice their opinions the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of testing this question and of saying 
     <lb/>
     whether they want this measure proposed 
     <lb/>
     by the right hon. First Minister or not. 
    </p>

            <p>Now, I had intended to refer to another 
     <lb/>aspect of this case, but I find that I have got 
     <lb/>excited and that is not usual with me. I 
     <lb/>must excuse myself. I believe I am justi<lb break="no"/>fied in asking for the indulgence of this 
     <lb/>House if I do get a little excited on this 
     <lb/>occasion. I believe as the right hon. min<lb break="no"/>ister says, that our passions on some of these 
     <lb/>occasions are not wholly ignoble, it is prob<lb break="no"/>ably ' the exaggeration of a noble sentiment,' 
     <lb/>the right hon. minister says and perhaps 
     <lb/>there is a little exaggeration of noble senti<lb break="no"/>ments from time to time as the debate goes 
     <lb/>on. I think that when we cannot get a 
     <lb/>solitary member representing the west on 
     <lb/>the government side of the House to stand 
     <lb/>up and advocate the rights of the west, when 
     <lb/>we cannot get the hon. Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>(Mr. Fielding) who was an advocate of 
     <lb/>opinions which are in direct conflict with the 
     <lb/>proposition of the government to-day, when 
     <lb/>we cannot get that great democrat to rise 
     <lb/>up and say that in this day the people shall 
     <lb/>be supreme, when we cannot get back into 
     <lb/>the House that champion of national schools, 
     <lb/>the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton), 
     <lb/>to speak one word on behalf of the great 
     <lb/>people of the west, a place which is to be 
     <lb/>the garden of Canada in the future and the 
     <lb/>grandest agricultural territory within this 
     <lb/>country,—when we cannot get these hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen to stand up and say one word on 
     <lb/>behalf of the great people of the west, then, 
     <lb/>I feel that I am justified in having got a

     a distinct and logical argument as I intend<lb break="no"/>ed when I rose to speak.

     Mr. Speaker, I rise for a little informa<lb break="no"/>tion, not that I expect to get any from

     the solon who has just addressed the House. 
     <lb/>
     But, the principle has evidently been laid 
     <lb/>
     down this afternoon that a province is not 
     <lb/>
     represented in this House unless it has a 
     <lb/>
     member of the government. In this case it 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that there has been a rather 
     <lb/>
     gross insult addressed to the ten men who 
     <lb/>
     represent these Territories in the House

     Speaker, in the opening remarks of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the leader of the opposition this after<lb break="no"/>noon he referred to the course pursued by 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier) when he was leader of the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     opposition in this House some years ago. 
     <lb/>
     The right hon. gentleman on that occasion 
     <lb/>
     drew the attention of this House to certain 
     <lb/>
     rumours going the rounds of the newspapers 
     <lb/>
     of this country coupled with the fact that 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency the Governor General had

     postponed a trip that he anticipated making. 
     <lb/>
     He thought the circumstances sufficient to 
     <lb/>
     warrant him in calling the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     government of the day to the importance 
     <lb/>
     of these rumours. One of the arguments he 
     <lb/>
     employed in that case was to the effect that 
     <lb/>
     the government was not in the position in 
     <lb/>
     which it ought to be before asking parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to transact the business of the country.

     What circumstances? The circumstances 
     <lb/>
     arising from the rumours going around the 
     <lb/>
     public press of this country that certain 
     <lb/>
     seats in the government were vacant. It 
     <lb/>
     seemed to him a remarkable thing that he 
     <lb/>
     found some of these seats vacated, vacated 
     <lb/>
     by whom ? By the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     west ? No ; the right hon. gentleman seem<lb break="no"/>ed to be exercised particularly about the 
     <lb/>
     representatives, not of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, but of the province of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     Why was my hon. friend so much exercised 
     <lb/>
     on that occasion ? It was not because of 
     <lb/>
     any particular or important question brought 
     <lb/>
     up in this House on that occasion. In 1893 
     <lb/>
     parliament met on April 18. This matter 
     <lb/>
     was brought up by the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     on July 9, and that session closed on July 
     <lb/>
     22, thirteen days after he had given the 
     <lb/>
     government notice of the fact that certain 
     <lb/>
     ministers had not been in their places the 
     <lb/>
     day before. Why was he so much exercised 
     <lb/>
     over the fact of these ministers not being 
     <lb/>
     properly representative of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ? Was it bcause parliament was 
     <lb/>
     liable to vote a penny unwiseiy in their 
     <lb/>
     absence ? Every man who knows anything 


            <cb/>
        

     of the political history of this country knows 
     <lb/>
     what was taking place at that time ; he 
     <lb/>
     knows that an issue similar to that which 
     <lb/>
     is being discussed to-day was being con<lb break="no"/>sidered by the people and the government, 
     <lb/>
     and it was more due to that fact, I venture 
     <lb/>
     to say, that the right hon. gentleman object<lb break="no"/>ed to these ministers not being in their 
     <lb/>
     places on that particular occasion. My 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend has been asked civilly and 
     <lb/>
     often lately by the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. R. L. Borden) why it is that the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of Minister of the Interior is not filled. 
     <lb/>
     The right hon. gentleman rises in his place 
     <lb/>
     and says that the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     again has another little joke. And what is 
     <lb/>
     the little joke ? It is not the spending of a 
     <lb/>
     small amount of the people's money, but it 
     <lb/>
     is the passage of legislation for all time 
     <lb/>
     affecting the Northwest Territories, that 
     <lb/>
     will involve millions of dollars, and yet the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister says this is a little joke, and 
     <lb/>
     that there is no occasion to have a Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior appointed to perform the 
     <lb/>
     special duties of that portfolio. The right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman has submitted to the House, 
     <lb/>
     in the .speech from the Throne, this para<lb break="no"/>graph :

     The rapid growth in the population of the

     justifies the wisdom of conferring on these

            <p>
     Before I deal with that, let me refer to a 
     <lb/>
     rumour or two that we have recently heard, 
     <lb/>
     because if the hon. gentleman was justified 
     <lb/>
     in those days I am justified to-day in re<lb break="no"/>ferring to these rumours. A rumour went 
     <lb/>
     abroad in this country previous to the 23rd 
     <lb/>
     of November last that certain gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     met at Three Rivers, in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, and that certain arrangements 
     <lb/>
     were entered into by the government with 
     <lb/>
     respect to provincial autonomy in the North<lb break="no"/>west. Again I say that I cannot understand 
     <lb/>
     how the right hon. gentleman and his gov<lb break="no"/>ernment placed that paragraph in the speech 
     <lb/>
     from the Throne and submitted it to this 
     <lb/>
     House, and then come to this House and 
     <lb/>
     told us, as members of this House, and 
     <lb/>
     told the people of the country, that he had 
     <lb/>
     not consulted the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     upon this important plank in the platform 
     <lb/>
     in the speech from the Throne. What did 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman say when he in<lb break="no"/>troduced this Bill in this House ? I shall 
     <lb/>
     quote his own words. He said :

<p>
     Of the four questions which are to be em<lb break="no"/>bodied in provincial autonomy, the educa<lb break="no"/>tion question was in the mind of the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman the most important. I 
     <lb/>
     again ask the Prime Minister are we to be<lb break="no"/>lieve, are we to suppose, that in the prepara<lb break="no"/>tion of the speech from the Throne, which 
     <lb/>
     was prepared during the early part of this 
     <lb/>
     year, the Minister of the Interior was in no 
     <lb/>
     wise consulted in respect to these four 
     <lb/>
     planks ? I for one refuse to take that view, 
     <lb/>
     because I do not think the ex-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior is so ignorant with respect to 
     <lb/>
     the contents of this Bill as he would leave 
     <lb/>
     this House and this country to believe. Re<lb break="no"/>ference has been made to the creating of a 
     <lb/>
     vacancy. What do we find in the city of 
     <lb/>
     Toronto ? We find a bargain day for the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party. Why have we a bar<lb break="no"/>gain day now ? Is this the old system of 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal party of this country, when they 
     <lb/>
     have a government backed up by a large 
     <lb/>
     majority and a seat becomes vacant, is it 
     <lb/>
     now the new Liberal policy to give the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party a bargain day and to 
     <lb/>
     allow them to elect their candidate by ac<lb break="no"/>clamation ? I have here the statement of 
     <lb/>
     the executive of the Reform Association of 
     <lb/>
     the city of Toronto. We have the candidate 
     <lb/>
     in the last contest coming to the city of 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, consulting with the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     and his cabinet, going back to Toronto and 
     <lb/>
     advising the Liberal executive of the city of 
     <lb/>
     Toronto not to put up a candidate, refusing 
     <lb/>
     to be a candidate himself and saying that it 
     <lb/>
     was not a wise policy to put a candidate in 
     <lb/>
     the field ; and, therefore, the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
     are going to allow the Conservative candi<lb break="no"/>date to be elected by acclamation. Why is 
     <lb/>
     this ? Is that the way to ascertain public 
     <lb/>
     opinion in this country on an important 
     <lb/>
     question of this kind ? I venture to say that 
     <lb/>
     if the right hon. gentleman had an election 
     <lb/>
     in Toronto he would find that the policy 
     <lb/>
     which he is now pursuing would be rejected, 
     <lb/>
     not only by the Conservative party of To<lb break="no"/>ronto, but by a very large number of the 
     <lb/>
     Liberals as well. I would like to ask the 
     <lb/>
     premier, if he has any influence upon the 
     <lb/>
     ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) or 
     <lb/>
     upon the hon. member for Lisgar (Mr. Green<lb break="no"/>way), one the late premier of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba and the other one of his min<lb break="no"/>isters, to kindly whisper into the ears of 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen the suggestion that they 
     <lb/>
     should stay a little more in this chamber 
     <lb/>
     and give the people of this country the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of their presence and advice, even 
     <lb/>
     as private members. Is it any wonder that 
     <lb/>
     members of the opposition find fault with 
     <lb/>
     the government, when we find important 
     <lb/>
     members like these absenting themselves 
     <lb/>
     when one of the greatest and most import<lb break="no"/>ant issues ever brought up in parliament is 
     <lb/>
     being discussed from day to day ? They ab<lb break="no"/>solutely refuse, by their absence from this 
     <lb/>
     House, to take part in the discussion. I am 
     <lb/>
     sure it would allay, to some extent, the 
     <lb/>
     feeling of the people of this country if they 
     <lb/>
     knew that men entertained the views which 
     

            <cb/>
        

     the late premier of Manitoba did entertain— 
     <lb/>
     I do not know if he does now or not—but 
     <lb/>
     certainly the views entertained by the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior, were to stay in their 
     <lb/>
     places in this House and give us the benefit 
     <lb/>
     of their views from time to time as occa<lb break="no"/>sion requires. Then probably they would 
     <lb/>
     assist in allaying the strong feeling that 
     <lb/>
     exists in this country that these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     are overlooking the interests of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories by their undue absence 
     <lb/>
     from this House. The Prime Minister re<lb break="no"/>ferred to-day to the fact that the opposition 
     <lb/>
     are making a great deal of capital out of 
     <lb/>
     the thirty-one days of non-appointment of a 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior. Let me point out 
     <lb/>
     to my hon. friend that the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior has not been in this House during 
     <lb/>
     this session. He came in after the intro<lb break="no"/>duction of this Bill. Let me remind the 
     <lb/>
     premier that since 1896 we have had minis<lb break="no"/>ter after minister absent from their duties 
     <lb/>
     during the session, and no one has been a 
     <lb/>
     greater sinner in that respect than the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior. To-day he is seen 
     <lb/>
     passing by this chamber, paying attention 
     <lb/>
     for a moment or two to the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     here, but then, in his high and lofty way, 
     <lb/>
     he retires from the chamber and allows the 
     <lb/>
     members to discuss these important matters 
     <lb/>
     in his absence. It is high time that these hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen fully understood that it is their 
     <lb/>
     duty to attend in this chamber and give us 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of their advice on these import<lb break="no"/>ant matters. If the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     and his friends were correct in 1895, when 
     <lb/>
     they said that it was important for ministers 
     <lb/>
     to be in their places, they should take a 
     <lb/>
     little of their own medicine to-day, and see 
     <lb/>
     that their ministers are in their places in 
     <lb/>
     this House.

     <persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. W. H. BENNETT</persName> (East Simcoe). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I usually agree with the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition, but I think he is rather too 
     <lb/>
     exacting this afternoon. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     asks that the First Minister should go back 
     <lb/>
     on his official record since he has been 
     <lb/>
     premier of this Dominion, and start from 
     <lb/>
     this day on a new course. That is alto<lb break="no"/>gether too much to ask of the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister, and I think my hon. friend the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition is rather drawing on his 
     <lb/>
     imagination when he expects that the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister will do it. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     referred to the fact that the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister found fault with the government of 
     <lb/>
     Sir John Thompson on one occasion for not 
     <lb/>
     filling up his cabinet and complained that 
     <lb/>
     at that time for nearly two days two min<lb break="no"/>isters had absented themselves from the 
     <lb/>
     chamber. Well, Sir, the circumstances were 
     <lb/>
     very different then from what they are now. 
     <lb/>
     Neither of these hon. gentlemen had resign<lb break="no"/>ed his seat ; the present premier was not 
     <lb/>
     in a position to know that either intended 
     <lb/>
     to resign his seat ; but the fact that they 
     <lb/>
     had not been in their places, and some news<lb break="no"/>paper comment which he saw on the cir<lb break="no"/>
           

            <pb n="3587" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3587.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3588</fw>

cumstance, suggested to him the idea of 
     <lb/>
     dividing the House on the matter, and he 
     <lb/>
     did divide the House. What do we see on 
     <lb/>
     the present occasion ? We see the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior absent from the first day 
     <lb/>
     of the session. Whether his absence was 
     <lb/>
     owing to ill-health I know not, and I think 
     <lb/>
     the public are very little concerned about 
     <lb/>
     it. But we do know that as soon as the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister introduced certain legis<lb break="no"/>lation into this House, the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior was here to dissent from the 
     <lb/>
     proposition of the government ; and we 
     <lb/>
     know that as a result of his dissent he has 
     <lb/>
     gone out of the cabinet and is out of it 
     <lb/>
     to-day ; and every one knows that the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister and his cabinet are afraid to take 
     <lb/>
     the bull by the horns—I am speaking meta<lb break="no"/>phorically—and test popular opinion in the 
     <lb/>
     west, just as they are afraid to test popular 
     <lb/>
     opinion in the province of Ontario. What 
     <lb/>
     is the report of the hon. gentleman's own 
     <lb/>
     political friends from the city of Toronto ? 
     <lb/>
     It is that he has become a Czar and an 
     <lb/>
     autocrat. Mr. Robinette, their candidate 
     <lb/>
     in the last election came down here the 
     <lb/>
     other day ; he was seen here ; his presence 
     <lb/>
     was reported in the newspapers ; and be<lb break="no"/>cause Mr. Robinette informed the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister that he would not be a supporter 
     <lb/>
     of the government's policy in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest, the Czar, the leader of this ad<lb break="no"/>ministration, says there must be no con<lb break="no"/>test in Centre Toronto. Now, I am going 
     <lb/>
     to appeal to the First Minister to remem<lb break="no"/>ber the watchword of the late premier of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario, his own right arm, 
     <lb/>
     which was paralyzed on the 25th of Jan<lb break="no"/>uary, when the people got a chance. What 
     <lb/>
     was the watchword of the Hon. George W. 
     <lb/>
     Ross ? It was : ' Build up Ontario.' What 
     <lb/>
     did that mean ? It meant to build up On<lb break="no"/>tario in every possible way—mentally, mor<lb break="no"/>ally, educationally and commercially ; and 
     <lb/>
     I appeal to the First Minister to build up 
     <lb/>
     Ontario to-day. In the first place, build 
     <lb/>
     it up morally by keeping faith with the 
     <lb/>
     public there. The First Minister went 
     <lb/>
     through the province of Ontario last No<lb break="no"/>vember—but I will not harrow up his feel<lb break="no"/>ings by mentioning the places where he 
     <lb/>
     spoke, because every one knows what fol<lb break="no"/>lowed—desolation and disaster to the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     candidates. He came to East Simcoe, and 
     <lb/>
     the result there is seen. He went to the 
     <lb/>
     city of Toronto and to other points and 
     <lb/>
     said, it is true, my cabinet representatives 
     <lb/>
     from Ontario are a rum lot ; I have one 
     <lb/>
     in the Senate who is past four score years ; 
     <lb/>
     I have Sir Richard Cartwright on my hands, 
     <lb/>
     but he is to be transferred to the Senate at 
     <lb/>
     an early day ; although the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Customs is a benevolent, good-hearted soul, 
     <lb/>
     he is not known beyond the confines of his 
     <lb/>
     own bailiwick. But, he said, I am going to 
     <lb/>
     strengthen the cabinet in Ontario ; I am 
     <lb/>
     going to bring in a big man in the person 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Aylesworth. The First Minister 


            <cb/>
        

     has not got Mr. Aylesworth yet, but there 
     <lb/>
     is a chance to get him. There are two 
     <lb/>
     counties in Ontario which he could carry, 
     <lb/>
     and only two. Why does he not give Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Aylesworth a chance to run in Russell or 
     <lb/>
     in Prescott ? I know he will not trust him<lb break="no"/>self in North Oxford, nor will he trust him<lb break="no"/>self anywhere else in Ontario.

     <persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. BENNETT</persName>; Mr. Aylesworth knows 
     <lb/>
     Toronto ; he lives there. Now, the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister has not kept faith with the electors 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Ontario. He promised 
     <lb/>
     them last November that if they would only 
     <lb/>
     support him, he would build up a stable ag<lb break="no"/>gregation from Ontario. What has he done? 
     <lb/>
     There was a time in this House when our 
     <lb/>
     dull moments were enlivened by the ora<lb break="no"/>tory of Sir Richard Cartwright ; but he 
     <lb/>
     has stolen Sir Richard Cartwright from the 
     <lb/>
     House and sent him to the Senate. We 
     <lb/>
     have left only our benevolent friend the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Customs and our soporific friend 
     <lb/>
     the Postmaster General. I think it has 
     <lb/>
     come to a pretty pass in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario that we have to content ourselves 
     <lb/>
     with the cabinet representation that we 
     <lb/>
     have. But let us go a little further. Let 
     <lb/>
     us bear in mind that these two gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     are seriously restricted—that they are not 
     <lb/>
     allowed to perform any acts of importance. 
     <lb/>
     They are allowed to manage departments 
     <lb/>
     which extract money from the pockets of the 
     <lb/>
     people ; neither of them is allowed to 
     <lb/>
     spend a dollar, practically ; but when it 
     <lb/>
     comes to spending money, all the depart<lb break="no"/>ments for that purpose go to ministers from 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces. True, the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Public Works for a time had some dispos<lb break="no"/>ition of patronage, but the Minister of Mar<lb break="no"/>ine and Fisheries came up and filched that 
     <lb/>
     from the province of Ontario, and to-day 
     <lb/>
     what is left for the Minister of Public 
     <lb/>
     Works amounts to practically nothing, and 
     <lb/>
     even that is not controlled by a minister who 
     <lb/>
     has the consent and approval of a con<lb break="no"/>stituency in Ontario. It is quite true that 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend who represents North Ox<lb break="no"/>ford (Mr. Sutherland). and whose absence 
     <lb/>
     we all regret just as sincerely as any gentle<lb break="no"/>man on the other side of the House, is prac<lb break="no"/>tically out of politics. The kindly refer<lb break="no"/>ence made by the hon. leader of the oppos<lb break="no"/>ition did not deserve the reply which it re<lb break="no"/>ceived from the First Minister. We all ack<lb break="no"/>nowledge that circumstances sometimes 
     <lb/>
     arise in politics to deprive both political 
     <lb/>
     parties of some of their friends and leaders; 
     <lb/>
     and it is to-day a notorious fact, admitted 
     <lb/>
     by hon. gentlemen opposite, that Mr. Suther<lb break="no"/>land is not coming back to this House. Nay, 
     <lb/>
     I go further and say that I saw a letter 
     <lb/>
     myself the other day, written by a friend of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Sutherland in Mexico, where he is, in 
     <lb/>
     which it is stated that his health was pre<lb break="no"/>carious, and that no one seriously believes 
    

            <pb n="3589" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3589.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3589</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 31, 1905</fw> <fw type="num">3590</fw>
         

     he will resume his duties in the Public 
     <lb/>
     Works Department. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And the First Minister knows, just as 
     <lb/>
     well as he knows that the sun will rise to<lb break="no"/>morrow, that Mr. Sutherland does not in<lb break="no"/>tend to come back and take charge of that 
     <lb/>
     portfolio, and we all regret it. He knows 
     <lb/>
     equally well that the hon. member for Lon<lb break="no"/>don (Mr. Hyman) has been named for that 
     <lb/>
     portfolio—named months ago—and has been 
     <lb/>
     discharging the duties for the past year. 
     <lb/>
     Yet in the face of that fact, this government 
     <lb/>
     are so much in terror of the Ontario electo<lb break="no"/>rate, that they dare not open the seat in 
     <lb/>
     London to-day. You may boast that you 
     <lb/>
     have a majority of five hundred or six hun<lb break="no"/>dred for the hon. member for London in that 
     <lb/>
     city, but that majority was reduced to 
     <lb/>
     something like twenty in the last campaign. 
     <lb/>
     The excuse given by his friends is that they 
     <lb/>
     were over-confident or he would have re<lb break="no"/>ceived his old-time majority. Well, this 
     <lb/>
     is the time and place in which, if the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment have a scintilla of confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     people of Ontario, to show that confidence 
     <lb/>
     by throwing down the gauntlet and opening 
     <lb/>
     up the constituency of London. But if they 
     <lb/>
     should, the hon. member for London (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hyman) knows, and the cabinet knows, 
     <lb/>
     what will be the result. Here we have a 
     <lb/>
     cabinet in this humiliating position that it 
     <lb/>
     has only two ministers of the Crown on the 
     <lb/>
     floor of this House from Ontario. True, there 
     <lb/>
     are two in the Senate, but I do not suppose 
     <lb/>
     the public are much exercised about them. 
     <lb/>
     The Minister of Customs (Mr. Paterson) has 
     <lb/>
     been over the stony path and the thorny 
     <lb/>
     places. He spent all his life in the constitu<lb break="no"/>ency of South Brant but that <choice><sic>constituensy</sic><corr>constituency</corr></choice> 
     <lb/>
     finally turned him out. Then he went over 
     <lb/>
     the corduroy road in North Grey but did not 
     <lb/>
     dare return there, and finally sought solace 
     <lb/>
     in a haven of rest with a solid Liberal ma<lb break="no"/>jority of 1,000, but that hon. minister knows 
     <lb/>
     that so low has his party fallen in the esti<lb break="no"/>mation of the people of Ontario that nearly 
     <lb/>
     every seat went against it in the last local 
     <lb/>
     election. And what is the position of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North York (Sir William 
     <lb/>
     Mulock)? That riding was long in the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     fold, but the hon. gentleman knows that if 
     <lb/>
     it were open to-day it would return an 
     <lb/>
     opponent to the present government. Then 
     <lb/>
     there is my hon. friend from Centre York 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Campbell), who, we all know, is knock<lb break="no"/>ing at the threshold for admission to the 
     <lb/>
     cabinet, and who represents a riding speci<lb break="no"/>ally constructed for him. He has been 
     <lb/>
     standing at the door waiting and watching 
     <lb/>
     long, but they dare not open it for him, and 
     <lb/>
     it is a notorious fact that another gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who has been aspiring to cabinet promotion, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) has openly gone out in revolt against 
     <lb/>
     the government on this question. Yet the 
     <lb/>
     government intend to rush this Bill through 
     <lb/>
     the House this session. If we were in the 
     <lb/>
     last days of a last session of parliament, 
     <lb/>
     the government would never be able to put 
    

            <cb/>
 

     their Bill through, but if this Bill cannot 
     <lb/>
     be killed in this House, the government 
     <lb/>
     which brought it down will be killed when 
     <lb/>
     they go before the people of the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
     This government may force the Bill through 
     <lb/>
     by means of what I would call a machine, 
     <lb/>
     if it were parliamentary, or what I would 
     <lb/>
     call a servile majority, if the rules of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment would allow it ; it may be voted 
     <lb/>
     through by a majority who have promises 
     <lb/>
     of preferment and place; but all I can say 
     <lb/>
     is that the government will not get prefer<lb break="no"/>ment at the hands of the electorate when 
     <lb/>
     they go before the country. There is one 
     <lb/>
     power which is irresistible and that is the 
     <lb/>
     power of the people, and those gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who vote for this measure will certainly 
     <lb/>
     stultify themselves in the eyes of their con<lb break="no"/>stituents in the Northwest Territories. They 
     <lb/>
     know that they are stultifying themselves 
     <lb/>
     to-day. Their own leaders have told them, 
     <lb/>
     as the hon. member for St. John (Mr Stock<lb break="no"/>ton) told them a little while ago, that this 
     <lb/>
     cabinet is afraid to trust the people who 
     <lb/>
     are most vitally interested. It knows that 
     <lb/>
     it cannot have a cabinet minister elected 
     <lb/>
     in the west. What is the standing of the 
     <lb/>
     government today in the great city of 
     <lb/>
     Toronto ? Why, a large number of their 
     <lb/>
     friends want to precipitate a fight there, 
     <lb/>
     but they will only do it on one condition 
     <lb/>
     and that is that the policy of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment on this question must be condemned. 
     <lb/>
     What a pitiable spectacle does not this 
     <lb/>
     government represent ? In a riding like 
     <lb/>
     Centre Toronto, which was only carried by 
     <lb/>
     the late Mr. Clarke, probably the most po<lb break="no"/>pular man in that city, by a bare majority 
     <lb/>
     of three hundred in the last contest, this 
     <lb/>
     government and their followers dare not 
     <lb/>
     put up a candidate to-day. They call how<lb break="no"/>ever on their followers to vote for this mea<lb break="no"/>sure and to trust that in time it will be for<lb break="no"/>gotten. They should remember that there 
     <lb/>
     was a statesman named Stratton in Ontario 
     <lb/>
     who asked the people to forget, but the people 
     <lb/>
     did not; and we have a spectacle presented 
     <lb/>
     to-day by this government exactly similar to 
     <lb/>
     that which was presented by the Ross gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in Ontario, and in like manner 
     <lb/>
     when this government does go to the people 
     <lb/>
     it will have as little chance as it expects to 
     <lb/>
     have in Centre Toronto and share the same 
     <lb/>
     fate which overtook the late local govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It may win Russell and Prescott but 
     <lb/>
     will be beyond help in the rest of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince.

     If, Mr. Speaker, the Bills before the House 
     <lb/>
     to create the two provinces of Alberta and 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan constitute to representatives 
     <lb/>
     from the other parts of Canada the 
     <lb/>
     most important measure that has been sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to parliament since confederation, 
     <lb/>
     how much more should their importance be 
     <lb/>
     impressed upon one, who, like myself, is 
     <lb/>
     entrusted with the duty of representing 
     <lb/>
     in this House a very considerable section 
     <lb/>
     of the country which it is proposed to form 
     <lb/>
     into these new provinces. I may say, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, in all sincerity that I regret to a 
     <lb/>
     very much larger extent to-day than on any 
     <lb/>
     former occasion that I am not gifted with 
     <lb/>
     that felicity of expression which has dis<lb break="no"/>tinguished so many of the speakers who 
     <lb/>
     have preceded me, and that consequently I 
     <lb/>
     shall not be able to embellish the remarks 
     <lb/>
     I shall have to present to the House with 
     <lb/>
     flowers of oratory such as have adorned 
     <lb/>
     many of the speeches we have had on this 
     <lb/>
     question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Of the magnitude of the subject, of course, 
     <lb/>
     there can be no question. We are proposing 
     <lb/>
     to round out the confederation of half, and 
     <lb/>
     probably the richer half of the North Ameri<lb break="no"/>can continent, affecting an enormous area 
     <lb/>
     of exceptional fertility and capable of sus<lb break="no"/>taining millions, if not tens of millions 
     <lb/>
     of people. We are fulfilling the dream of 
     <lb/>
     those far-sighted men, the fathers of con<lb break="no"/>federation. We are, once for all, placing 
     <lb/>
     upon the half million of people who, at 
     <lb/>
     present, constitute the population of these 
     <lb/>
     areas and upon the future millions that 
     <lb/>
     will constitute that population, the duties 
     <lb/>
     of self-government according to free Bri<lb break="no"/>tish principles. And we are, at the same 
     <lb/>
     time, fixing for all time to come the finan<lb break="no"/>cial status, setting apart the financial re<lb break="no"/>sources, upon which these people shall be 
     <lb/>
     enabled to carry on their duties of self-gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, We are giving by charter to 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces many powers which 
     <lb/>
     the people there have been exercising up 
     <lb/>
     to the present time, as well as a number of 
     <lb/>
     powers, which, until now, have been exer<lb break="no"/>cised on their behalf by this parliament. 
     <lb/>
     We are proposing to make these people 


            <cb/>
 

     fully responsible for their own self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the important matters of educa<lb break="no"/>tion, public works and all affairs of internal 
     <lb/>
     development which, it may be said, are 
     <lb/>
     the most vital, the most constant, and the 
     <lb/>
     most intimate affairs affecting the life of 
     <lb/>
     the people of any country, and the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of which, it may be said, is so much 
     <lb/>
     more difficult in a sparsely-settled country 
     <lb/>
     such as these areas are at the present time, 
     <lb/>
     than in old communities. Upon the import<lb break="no"/>ance of the subject of education there is 
     <lb/>
     no occasion for comment here. In my op<lb break="no"/>inion, the House has been, during the pre<lb break="no"/>sent debate, giving more attention to a 
     <lb/>
     matter which has developed into an ex<lb break="no"/>tremely sentimental issue, than to the prac<lb break="no"/>tical, substantial phase of the education 
     <lb/>
     question. I may say that I am more con<lb break="no"/>cerned, and I am satisfied that the people 
     <lb/>
     that I represent are more concerned, as to 
     <lb/>
     whether they are to be enabled by the pow<lb break="no"/>ers which parliament proposes to confer 
     <lb/>
     upon them and the financial resources the 
     <lb/>
     House proposes to place at their disposal, 
     <lb/>
     for all time to come to keep up an efficient 
     <lb/>
     system of education than they are as to the 
     <lb/>
     extremely narrow issue which divides the 
     <lb/>
     proposition of the government from the pro<lb break="no"/>position of the leader of the opposition (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     R. L. Borden)—no, I beg the pardon of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition,—of the hon. member repre<lb break="no"/>senting the county of Carleton. The 
     <lb/>
     matter of local public works, the mat<lb break="no"/>ter of bridges. the matter of fire guards, 
     <lb/>
     the matter of drainage, and in some 
     <lb/>
     localities the matter of domestic water 
     <lb/>
     supply—these are all affairs of exceeding 
     <lb/>
     importance to the people now, and will be 
     <lb/>
     of importance to the millions of people who, 
     <lb/>
     we expect, will be in that territory in the 
     <lb/>
     years to come. And these matters now must 
     <lb/>
     be dealt with, and, for a considerable time 
     <lb/>
     to come, will have to be dealt with, by 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government more than is the 
     <lb/>
     case in older communities where these af<lb break="no"/>fairs are handled municipally. These are 
     <lb/>
     matters which lie at the very root of the 
     <lb/>
     existence of a people in a new country 
     <lb/>
     and upon these things depend whether the 
     <lb/>
     settler in these new provinces is to be 
     <lb/>
     encouraged to wage the battle of life under 
     <lb/>
     the conditions to be found in that country, 
     <lb/>
     or whether he shall labour under disad<lb break="no"/>vantages too great to be borne—as unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately, has been the fate of some who 
     <lb/>
     went into those Territories in the past, though 
     <lb/>
     not, I am glad to say, in the very recent 
     <lb/>
     past. The condition of the settlers' land 
     <lb/>
     as to drainage ; the state of his range,—whe<lb break="no"/>ther devastated by the prairie fire or properly 
     <lb/>
     protected—the existence of a bridge over the 
     <lb/>
     creek or river so that the settler may pass 
     <lb/>
     over with his team without risking his life 
     <lb/>
     at a crossing ; the efficiency of his school 
     <lb/>
     —upon these matters, I say, depends to a 
     <lb/>
     very large extent the whole future of the

     measures proposes to create. The subject 
     <lb/>
     of transportation is one to which very great 
     <lb/>
     attention has been given by this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment in recent years. The subject of rail<lb break="no"/>way transportation is a very important 
     <lb/>
     one ; but I may point out that in these 
     <lb/>
     Territories at the present time, I think it 
     <lb/>
     is not going too far to say, the matter of 
     <lb/>
     wagon roads is of quite as great an im<lb break="no"/>portance as the matter of railway communi<lb break="no"/>cation. Railways of course, are necessary. 
     <lb/>
     But the railway cannot be brought to every 
     <lb/>
     man's door, and, to reach the railway, the 
     <lb/>
     wagon road is necessary. A computation 
     <lb/>
     has been made which goes to establish the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the settler or farmer who is fifteen 
     <lb/>
     miles from the railway shipping point is un<lb break="no"/>der as great a cost in getting his wheat to 
     <lb/>
     the shipping point—supposing that that point 
     <lb/>
     is Regina, where I live—as he is under for 
     <lb/>
     the carriage of that wheat from the ship<lb break="no"/>ping point to the head of the Lakes, nearly 
     <lb/>
     800 miles. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Therefore, there can be no question of 
     <lb/>
     the importance and magnitude of the ques<lb break="no"/>tions involved in the Bills. I have, on sev<lb break="no"/>eral occasions before, had the privilege of 
     <lb/>
     addressing this House ; but on no previous 
     <lb/>
     occasion have I felt so greatly the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility resting upon me as upon this occas<lb break="no"/>ion. And, whether my tenure of office here 
     <lb/>
     as the representative of a constituency prove 
     <lb/>
     long or short, I do not think that at any 
     <lb/>
     future time it will be my duty to address 
     <lb/>
     the House upon a subject of such importance 
     <lb/>
     as I feel the subject now under discussion 
     <lb/>
     to be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In replying to the admirable speech with 
     <lb/>
     which these Bills were introduced by the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. First Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laur<lb break="no"/>ier) the hon. member for Carleton (Mr. R. L. 
     <lb/>
     Borden) devoted a good deal of attention— 
     <lb/>
     more attention than I had expected him to 
     <lb/>
     give—to certain aspects of the case which 
     <lb/>
     had formed the subject matter of discussion 
     <lb/>
     up and down the township lines and in the 
     <lb/>
     school-houses of the Northwest up to the 
     <lb/>
     third of November last, but which did not 
     <lb/>
     seem to me to be quite in keeping with the 
     <lb/>
     kind of discussion which might be expected 
     <lb/>
     from the leader of the opposition speaking 
     <lb/>
     upon such an occasion, and dealing with 
     <lb/>
     such a measure as this, before a body as 
     <lb/>
     this House. The hon. gentleman sought to 
     <lb/>
     establish the proposition that the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     First Minister and his government had 
     <lb/>
     made a right-about-face since last session 
     <lb/>
     upon the question whether or not provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy should be granted to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories. And, 
     <lb/>
     in his endeavour to sustain a very weak 
     <lb/>
     position, he sought to make use of a remark 
     <lb/>
     or rather an ejaculation of the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter on one occasion about two years ago. 
     <lb/>
     It was alleged that the Prime Minister had 
     <lb/>
     said 'Hear, hear,' when the hon member 
     <lb/>
     for Marquette (Mr. W. J. Roche) had made 
     <lb/>
     some remark to impress the idea that the 
 

            <cb/>
    

     government was not favourable to provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy. I do not know whether 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend—in fact I must take it for 
     <lb/>
     granted that my hon. friend was not aware 
     <lb/>
     that before the end of that session the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister had set himself right on that point, 
     <lb/>
     and I will read a passage which may be 
     <lb/>
     found in the 'Hansard' of 1903, page 13907 : 
     <lb/>

     Mr. ROCHE (Marquette). I stated that I was 
     <lb/>
     putting the Prime Minister's sentiments cor<lb break="no"/>rectly before the House to the effect that for 
     <lb/>
     many years to come the Territories need not

     expect autonomy at the hands of this govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and the Prime Minister said ' hear, hear.'

     Why, it is within the knowledge of every<lb break="no"/>body in Canada, and should be within the 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of every member of this House 
     <lb/>
     who was in the last parliament, that on seve<lb break="no"/>ral occasions responsible ministers of the 
     <lb/>
     Crown stated their opinion authoritatively 
     <lb/>
     that the time had nearly come when full pro<lb break="no"/>vincial powers must be conferred on the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest Territories. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon, then Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior, as long ago as three years, stated 
     <lb/>
     in the House that he had arrived at the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that provincial autonomy must 
     <lb/>
     very soon be meted out to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories. During the ses<lb break="no"/>sion of 1903, the Minister of Finance, in 
     <lb/>
     the most explicit terms, stated two or three 
     <lb/>
     times that the government had arrived at 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion that the time was near at 
     <lb/>
     hand when full provincial powers must be 
     <lb/>
     conferred on these people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, I listened with a great deal 
     <lb/>
     of interest to the able address given to the 
     <lb/>
     House last evening by the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who represents the district of Qu'Appelle 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Lake) in this House. If it would not 
     <lb/>
     be presumptuous on my part to say so, I 
     <lb/>
     would congratulate the House, I would con<lb break="no"/>gratulate the Northwest, and particularly I 
     <lb/>
     would congratulate our hon. friends oppo<lb break="no"/>site upon their acquisition of that hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, who was elected last November to 
     <lb/>
     represent the district of Qu'Appelle. Of 
     <lb/>
     course, I do not quite agree with every one 
     <lb/>
     of the statements made by that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman ; but I will say this for him, 
     <lb/>
     that he made the class of speech that friends 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest Territories desired to be 
     <lb/>
     made before this question of provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy was determined, before the 
     <lb/>
     details and terms were determined ; it was 
     <lb/>
     the class of speech which the true friend 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest felt it proper to make, and 
     <lb/>
     just the class of speech I have made myself 
     <lb/>
     the first session I came into this parliament. 
     <lb/>
     But I cannot agree with quite all the 
     <lb/>
     things which my hon. friend stated as 
     <lb/>
     facts. I understood the hon. gentleman to 
     <lb/>
     say that Mr. Haultain's draft Bill, pre<lb break="no"/>pared, I think, in December, 1901, or Janu<lb break="no"/>ary. 1902, was unanimously endorsed 
     <lb/>
     by the assembly of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>
    

            <pb n="3595" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3595.jpg"/>

     tories, with the exception of one point, that 
     <lb/>
     point relating to the number of provinces, 
     <lb/>
     whether there should be one province or 
     <lb/>
     more. I think I can convince my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     that he was mistaken in that regard. One 
     <lb/>
     strong objection was raised, not by a Lib<lb break="no"/>eral in the assembly, but by one of the Con<lb break="no"/>servative members, a gentleman who acts 
     <lb/>
     in conjunction with the member for Qu'Ap<lb break="no"/>pelle, and who was a Conservative can<lb break="no"/>didate in one of the districts of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories last fall, Dr. Patrick, of 
     <lb/>
     Yorkton, who took violent exception to the 
     <lb/>
     terms of the draft Bill, because, as he said, 
     <lb/>
     it was attempting to grab too much, the 
     <lb/>
     terms were extravagant and would do dam<lb break="no"/>age to the interests of the Territories by at<lb break="no"/>tempting to grab too much. Then, I under<lb break="no"/>stood my hon. friend to lay down the pro<lb break="no"/>position that because that draft Bill had 
     <lb/>
     been endorsed by the assembly, and because 
     <lb/>
     it was before the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories last fall during the general elec<lb break="no"/>tion, therefore no member representing a 
     <lb/>
     district of the Northwest Territories had 
     <lb/>
     any mandate or right to do other than ob<lb break="no"/>ject to any kind of a Bill which was not 
     <lb/>
     framed entirely upon the lines of that draft 
     <lb/>
     Bill, voted upon by the Northwest legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. If that was the position taken by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend, and I think it was, for I listen<lb break="no"/>ed to him carefully, I may tell him that he 
     <lb/>
     is entirely out of accord with his mentor, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain. Mr. Haultain never took such 
     <lb/>
     a position. My hon. friend from Qu'-Ap<lb break="no"/>pelle, as well as myself, heard Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain declare himself explicitly, in a meeting 
     <lb/>
     of the legislature towards the end of 1903, 
     <lb/>
     that he never expected to get all he asked 
     <lb/>
     for, they were simply laying down their pro<lb break="no"/>position, and were asking everything that 
     <lb/>
     was possible, leaving to those on the other 
     <lb/>
     end of the bargain to say how much the 
     <lb/>
     terms had to be cut down. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     However, Mr. Speaker, I suppose that in 
     <lb/>
     this discussion it is rather the amendment 
     <lb/>
     proposed by the hon. member for Carleton 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. R. L. Borden) which is engaging the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the House. That amendment 
     <lb/>
     reads : 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            </p>

            <p>
     Upon the establishment of a province in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories of Canada as proposed 
     <lb/>
     by Bill (No. 69), the legislature of such pro<lb break="no"/>vince, subject to and in accordance with the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the British North America Acts, 
     <lb/>
     1867 to 1886, is entitled to and should enjoy full 
     <lb/>
     powers of provincial self-government including 
     <lb/>
     power to exclusively make laws in relation to 
     <lb/>
     education. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     That is a proposition, Mr. Speaker, that 
     <lb/>
     commands my warm approval in some re<lb break="no"/>spects, but I am sorry to say that my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's speech did not quite fit in with his 
     <lb/>
     amendment. It is a proposition that, on the 
     <lb/>
     face of it, would be looked upon with favour 
     <lb/>
     by every resident of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. But when we look at it a little more 


            <cb/>
   

     closely, it may not be such a favourable pro<lb break="no"/>position. As the members of this House can 
     <lb/>
     readily believe, particularly when they listen 
     <lb/>
     to such representatives from the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     as the hon. member from Edmonton (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Oliver) and the hon. member from Brandon 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton), the people of those western 
     <lb/>
     prairies like to have things placed before 
     <lb/>
     them definitely, and I may tell the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Carleton that before the resi<lb break="no"/>dents of the Northwest Territories will be 
     <lb/>
     able to accept his proposition they will want 
     <lb/>
     to know what class of schools he means, 
     <lb/>
     whether he means absolute freedom to 
     <lb/>
     settle their school system or whether he 
     <lb/>
     means anything else ; whether he means, 
     <lb/>
     for instance, the application of section 93 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act, which 
     <lb/>
     would not leave the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     absolute freedom to settle this question for 
     <lb/>
     themselves. And upon another phase of the 
     <lb/>
     question, that concerning the lands, I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry to say that my hon. friend's speech 
     <lb/>
     entirely disagrees with his resolution. With 
     <lb/>
     reference to the matter of the retention of 
     <lb/>
     the lands by the federal power, to which 
     <lb/>
     proposition he takes exception, giving his 
     <lb/>
     opinion that the land should be transferred 
     <lb/>
     to the provincial authorities, he said :

     We had a suggestion in the discussion that 
     <lb/>
     took place this afternoon and we had a more 
     <lb/>
     particular suggestion in the discussion that 
     <lb/>
     took place some days ago as to there being 
     <lb/>
     at the present moment no friend of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest in the government. The friends 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest must be looked for 
     <lb/>
     amongst hon. gentlemen opposite. Well, 
     <lb/>
     I am bound to say that I think the friendship 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. member for Carleton will bear 
     <lb/>
     a little analysis. If it has a sentimental 
     <lb/>
     feature, something that is not going to cost 
     <lb/>
     anything, something that is not going to 
     <lb/>
     bear on any other section of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     our hon. friends opposite are great friends 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest, but, whenever we 
     <lb/>
     come down to a substantial matter like 
     <lb/>
     limiting the self governing powers of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest in regard to their 
     <lb/>
     actual and substantial resources the boot 
     <lb/>
     is on the other foot. That is an entirely dif<lb break="no"/>ferent aspect of the case. There are hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen behind my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Carleton who are great friends of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Territories too. It would be such 
     <lb/>
     an awful thing if any power of self govern<lb break="no"/>ment were denied to the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, but they are anxious to 
     <lb/>
     take away about half the territory of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories.

     My hon. friend began in the middle of a

    end of it. That is all I desire to call atten<lb break="no"/>tion to.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I fail to see what differ<lb break="no"/>ence there is in the meaning between the 
     <lb/>portion that my hon. friend has quoted and 
     <lb/>the portion that I quoted, except the sug<lb break="no"/>gestion added that the consent of the North<lb break="no"/>west might be asked. And let me tell him 
     <lb/>that he will very much more readily get the 
     <lb/>consent of the people of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories to leaving in perpetuation a system 
     <lb/>of schools which is absolutely satisfactory 
     <lb/>to Protestant and Catholic alike than he 
     <lb/>will get their consent to any such invasion 
     <lb/>of their rights as is involved in his sugges<lb break="no"/>tion. On the sentimental question of lands, 
     <lb/>on the sentimental side of the school ques<lb break="no"/>tion hon. gentlemen opposite or a section 
     <lb/>of them, headed by the leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position, are great friends of the Northwest 
     <lb/>Territories, but when it comes down to sub<lb break="no"/>stantial things, as I said, the boot is entirely 
     <lb/>on the other foot. Talk about invading 
     <lb/>autonomy. Why, Sir, no such radical and 
     <lb/>substantial invasion of Northwest autonomy 
     <lb/>as this suggestion involves—as read and re<lb break="no"/>peated again here now by himself—could be 
     <lb/>imagined by an avowed enemy of provincial

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. WALTER SCOTT</persName>. When you left the 
     <lb/>
     chair at six o'clock, Mr. Speaker, I was 
     <lb/>
     commenting upon the violent difference 
     <lb/>
     between the purport of the amendment 
     <lb/>
     moved by the hon. member for Carleton 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. R. L. Borden) and the direct suggestion 
     <lb/>
     contained in his speech. The proposals of 
     <lb/>
     the government contemplate a payment in 
     <lb/>
     lieu of the public domain to these two new 
     <lb/>
     provinces aggregating $750,000 per annum at 
     <lb/>
     the beginning ; as the population of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces increases, this payment is to 
     <lb/>
     increase to an amount in the future 
     <lb/>
     of $2,225,000 per annum. The gentleman 
     <lb/>
     from Carleton (Mr. R. L. Borden) objects 
     <lb/>
     to these proposals and suggests instead that 
     <lb/>
     the public domain should be transferred to 
     <lb/>
     the management of the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ments, but with the proviso that those pro<lb break="no"/>vincial governments shall be limited in their 
     <lb/>
     management of this public domain, the 
     <lb/>
     suggestion being, if I understood my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend accurately, that the homestead lands 
     <lb/>
    should continue to be given away as they 
     <lb/>are now given by this government as free

     homestead lands, and that the odd-numbered 
     <lb/>
     sections should continue, in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the policy of the present government, to be 
     <lb/>
     sold at low settlement prices, probably not 
     <lb/>
     greater than $3 per acre. The proposition 
     <lb/>
     then of the hon. gentleman is to turn over 
     <lb/>
     that land to the provinces, to saddle on 
     <lb/>
     these provinces all the expenses of adminis<lb break="no"/>tration and say to them : You must give 
     <lb/>
     away free your own property or you must 
     <lb/>
     dispose of that land at low settlement 
     <lb/>
     prices, as is now done, to induce settlement. 
     <lb/>
     Much of this land might be disposed of to 
     <lb/>
     great immediate profit if a purely revenue 
     <lb/>
     policy was applied. You say to those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces that they must use their own pro<lb break="no"/>perty for all time to come, not for their 
     <lb/>
     own purposes but for the purposes and 
     <lb/>
     benefit of the Dominion. I repeat, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that I am amazed that any man 
     <lb/>
     in this House would give voice to such 
     <lb/>
     a suggestion, for such a violent invas<lb break="no"/>ion of provincial autonomy, as is con<lb break="no"/>tained in the suggestion of my hon. friend. 
     <lb/>
     It needs no argument to show the differ<lb break="no"/>ence that might be made in the receipts 
     <lb/>
     from this public domain by the application 
     <lb/>
     of a different policy. The policy which is 
     <lb/>
     being pursued by this government is a settle<lb break="no"/>ment policy which yields practically no 
     <lb/>
     net revenue. There has been practically 
     <lb/>
     no net revenue from these lands in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and the Northwest Territories since 
     <lb/>these lands were acquired thirty-five years<lb/>ago.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     But a purely revenue policy might be 
     <lb/>followed, as it would be right of those<lb/>provinces, if they were to assume the res<lb break="no"/>ponsibility and the expense of administering<lb/>the domain, to follow a purely revenue<lb/>policy. The probability is that a provincial<lb/>government, as has been well explained by<lb/>my hon. friend from Edmonton (Mr. Oliver),<lb/>not having the same inducement, or the <lb/>same opportunity, to reap indirect profits<lb/>from the settlement policy of the federal<lb/>government, would be driven by neces<lb break="no"/>sity to adopt a purely revenue policy ; and<lb/>the suggestion contained in the speech of<lb/>the hon. leader of the opposition would<lb/>simply amount to putting a limitation upon<lb/>the new provinces amounting in the years<lb/>to come to perhaps scores of millions of<lb/>dollars.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, I dare say that it is hard 
     <lb/>for the leopard to change his spots, and it<lb/>is hard for our friends of the Conservative<lb/>party to do more than express sentimental<lb/>friendship for the Northwest Territories. It<lb/>is hard for them to get away from the po<lb break="no"/>licy with regard to provincial autonomy<lb/>which was announced on their behalf last<lb/>session, when they gave us to understand<lb/>that they were anxious that the people of<lb/>the Northwest should be granted au<lb break="no"/>tonomy, so that hereafter they should be<lb/>under the expense of building their own rail<lb break="no"/>ways and this parliament should not be<lb/>under the expense of maintaining the<lb/>
   

            <cb/>
       

     mounted police force. It was suggested in 
     <lb/>
     their campaign literature that the reason<lb break="no"/>ably generous money grants voted to the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest government were a proof of the 
     <lb/>
     gross incompetence and extravagance of the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance; 
     <lb/>
     and there was the further suggestion from 
     <lb/>
     one of their front bench members that pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy ought to be granted to the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories and independent legis<lb break="no"/>latures should be created there and put in 
     <lb/>
     charge of the public resources, so that those 
     <lb/>
     legislatures might be able to turn hand<lb break="no"/>springs with those resources in favour of 
     <lb/>
     the corporations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, there are a number of im<lb break="no"/>portant details embodied in this provincial 
     <lb/>
     autonomy proposal ; and different items in 
     <lb/>
     this collection of details gave different 
     <lb/>
     members who felt the seriousness of the 
     <lb/>
     proposals different difficulties. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Brandon (Mr. Sifton) explained 
     <lb/>
     to the House a week ago to-night that the 
     <lb/>
     school phase of the matter constituted the 
     <lb/>
     most serious difficulty for him. I have to 
     <lb/>
     confess that another detail constituted a 
     <lb/>
     very serious difficulty for me. That was 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way tax exemption embodied in section 23 
     <lb/>
     of the Bills. This is one feature in these 
     <lb/>
     provincial establishment proposals with re<lb break="no"/>gard to which I think that less than justice 
     <lb/>
     has been meted out to the people of those 
     <lb/>new provinces. As a matter of fact, as the<lb/>Prime Minister can testify, and as my fel<lb break="no"/>low Liberal members from the Northwest<lb/>Territories know, in my opinion the un<lb break="no"/>settled position of that tax exemption mat<lb break="no"/>ter was a sufficient reason to justify fur<lb break="no"/>ther delay in granting autonomy to the <lb/>Territories ; and if act, protest or influence<lb/>of mine could have prevented the prepara<lb break="no"/>tion and presentation of these Bills, the Bills<lb/>would not be before the House. But when<lb/>I found this Dominion government unani<lb break="no"/>mously, together with the Northwest govern<lb break="no"/>ment and a majority of the Northwest mem<lb break="no"/>bers all determined to proceed now, I had to<lb/>come to a decision which would either pre<lb break="no"/>vent me from exercising any influence in<lb/>the details of autonomy or agree to forego<lb/>my own opinion on the point, agree to ac<lb break="no"/>tion now, and take my part in obtaining a<lb/>settlement of terms and conditions accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the wishes of the electors whom I<lb/>represent. Even now, were I not satis<lb break="no"/>fied that the financial terms as a whole are<lb/>so ample and generous as to offset in a<lb/>great measure the financial handicap meant<lb/>by the exemption feature, I should deem<lb/>it my duty to myself and the Northwest<lb/>Territories to oppose the Bills. I may say<lb/>further that the overturning by the Supreme<lb/>Court of the decision given by the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba Court in 1903, does seriously lessen the<lb/>force of the position I held against creating<lb/>these provinces at present, and my reluct<lb break="no"/>ance is also relieved in some degree by the<lb/>intimation given by the premier of probable<lb/>

     action in the future by this government 
     <lb/>
     towards removing the incubus of the ex<lb break="no"/>emptions. The mention in the Bills of spe<lb break="no"/>cific compensation to the provinces on ac<lb break="no"/>count of the exemptions was deemed unwise 
     <lb/>
     for the reason that such mention might 
     <lb/>
     complicate such action at a future day. 
     <lb/>
     While voting for the Bills, I hold myself 
     <lb/>
     free to perhaps move an amendment in 
     <lb/>
     some direction in committee to section 23. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One of the questions which had to be 
     <lb/>
     considered in connection with this matter 
     <lb/>
     was the question of the number of pro<lb break="no"/>vinces — whether there should be one pro<lb break="no"/>vince, as was contemplated in the request 
     <lb/>
     made by the Northwest government and 
     <lb/>
     legislature, or more than one province. I 
     <lb/>
     may be permitted to say that I was my<lb break="no"/>self quite strnngly in favour of the propo<lb break="no"/>sition that only one province should be 
     <lb/>
     created ; and even yet, looking at the ques<lb break="no"/>tion purely from the local and territorial 
     <lb/>
     point of view, I can see no reason why one 
     <lb/>
     government, one legislature, one set of ma<lb break="no"/>chinery, should not have been sufficient for 
     <lb/>
     that territory. But, on the other hand, I 
     <lb/>
     was bound to recognize, as the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories generally have recognized. 
     <lb/>
     that the other partners in confederation had 
     <lb/>
     a right to an opinion in this matter, and 
     <lb/>
     the decision which has been come to, to 
     <lb/>
     create two provinces, is, I think, generally 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory to the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west as a whole. Except for the protest in 
     <lb/>
     the letter of Mr. Haultain, which was 
     <lb/>
     given a mild echo by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) last evening, I know 
     <lb/>
     of no protest raised in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories against the creation of two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Those of us who originally fa<lb break="no"/>voured one province were finally com<lb break="no"/>pelled to recognize the impossibility of hav<lb break="no"/>ing the whole of that great area erected 
     <lb/>
     into a single province while leaving Mani<lb break="no"/>toba in its present size, and the people I 
     <lb/>
     represent were unanimously against the ex<lb break="no"/>tension of the Manitoba boundaries west<lb break="no"/>ward. My duty to the people I represent, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, seemed to be clear, and I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that I have done my duty by those 
     <lb/>
     people in assenting to the proposition to 
     <lb/>
     have two provinces created.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. M. S. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy), speaking two or three nights 
     <lb/>
     ago, voiced an objection against the divid<lb break="no"/>ing line which has been selected, the fourth 
     <lb/>
     meridian, contending that it should have 
     <lb/>
     been farther east, and pointing out that 
     <lb/>
     the ex-Minister of the Interior had contend<lb break="no"/>ed that. the line should have been sixty 
     <lb/>miles farther east. Well, the question of 
     <lb/>the dividing line was not looked upon, on 
     <lb/>my part at least, as being a contentious 
     <lb/>matter. From my point of view, it would 
     <lb/>have been better for my province, in one 
     <lb/>sense, to have had the dividing line brought 
     <lb/>farther east, because if the financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion of each province were to be the same 
     <lb/>it would be better for the province the 
 

            <cb/>
       

     smaller it was. But on the basis that each 
     <lb/>
     should have equal financial strength, each 
     <lb/>
     member in giving advice was under great 
     <lb/>
     responsibility as regards the line to divide 
     <lb/>
     the area. I may say that my own advice 
     <lb/>
     was that the present eastern boundary of 
     <lb/>
     Alberta should be selected as the dividing 
     <lb/>
     line and I still believe that the future will 
     <lb/>
     Show that that would have been the most 
     <lb/>
     equitable dividing line between the two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, looking to their future populations. 
     <lb/>
     It must not be forgotten that the province 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta will have in the extreme north a 
     <lb/>
     large habitable area, the counterpart of 
     <lb/>
     which the province of Saskatchewan will 
     <lb/>
     not possess. My hon. friend from Calgary 
     <lb/>
     suggested that the area covered by the 
     <lb/>
     foothills in the Rocky Mountains should, so 
     <lb/>
     far as population is concerned, be elimi<lb break="no"/>nated. I do not agree with him at all in 
     <lb/>
     that regard. There are immense coal de<lb break="no"/>posits in that area. and I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     that in the years to come there will be im<lb break="no"/>mense coal-mining towns in the southern 
     <lb/>
     part of Alberta in the Rocky Mountains. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A question has been raised regarding the 
     <lb/>
     interests to stockmen and the branding of 
     <lb/>
     cattle. Well, if there should be any diffi<lb break="no"/>culty in that regard, it is one that will be 
     <lb/>
     very easily overcome by such a means pos<lb break="no"/>sibly as the creation of a commission by 
     <lb/>
     the two provinces acting conjointly to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the administration of brands. But no 
     <lb/>
     matter how far east you might put the divid<lb break="no"/>ing line. the whole ranching country would 
     <lb/>
     not be included in the western province. 
     <lb/>
     There have been years when the town of 
     <lb/>
     Yorkton, at the extreme east side of the 
     <lb/>
     eastern province, was the largest cattle ex<lb break="no"/>porting point in the Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the matter of representation, as well 
     <lb/>
     as other non-contentious matters which have 
     <lb/>
     been dealt with in the Bill, the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories have nothing but satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     to express. The provision for a census to be 
     <lb/>
     taken next year and for a redistribution for 
     <lb/>
     the purposes of this House on the basis of 
     <lb/>
     such census is entirely satisfactory, as is 
     <lb/>
     also in a general way the provision with 
     <lb/>
     regard to representation in the Senate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I come to the matter of the compen<lb break="no"/>sation for the lands and the financial terms. 
     <lb/>
   I may say at once that the financial terms

     and the compensation for lands command 
     <lb/>
     together my very hearty endorsation. I 
     <lb/>
     propose to trouble the House with a few 
     <lb/>
     details. They will be pretty dry, but I am 
     <lb/>
     inclined to think that they have more bear<lb break="no"/>ing on the case and should interest the 
     <lb/>
     people concerned considerably more than a 
     <lb/>
     good deal of the matter that has been pre<lb break="no"/>sented to the House. Taking the two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces together the financial terms include 
     <lb/>
     a grant for government of $100,000, a per 
     <lb/>
     capita subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per 
     <lb/>
     head on a basis of 500,000 population—a very 
     <lb/>
     generous computation at present—amount<lb break="no"/>ing to $400,000 ; an annual payment as

     debt allowance of $810,750 with a land 
     <lb/>
     allowance of $750,000, being a total annual 
     <lb/>
     subsidy to the two provinces of $2,060,750. 
     <lb/>
     And in addition to that there is a grant 
     <lb/>
     in the first five years towards public build<lb break="no"/>ings in the two provinces of $937,500. In 
     <lb/>
     some respects these terms are even better 
     <lb/>
     than those which were demanded by the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest through their legis<lb break="no"/>lature and government. We must bear in 
     <lb/>
     mind that Mr. Haultain's draft Bill con<lb break="no"/>templated only one province whereas now 
     <lb/>
     we are creating two provinces. The draft 
     <lb/>
     Bill asks for a grant for government of 
     <lb/>
     $50,000 and we are giving a grant of $100,<lb break="no"/>000. The original draft Bill asked for a 
     <lb/>
     debt allowance which would have yielded 
     <lb/>
     only $405,375, being calculated on a popu<lb break="no"/>lation of 250,000 for the whole area, where<lb break="no"/>as the population to-day is estimated at 
     <lb/>
     500,000 and the allowance is just twice the 
     <lb/>
     amount in the draft Bill. The claim in 
     <lb/>
     the draft Bill with regard to the per capita 
     <lb/>
     subsidy was 80 cents up to a limit of popu<lb break="no"/>lation of 1,300,000, that being the limit ap<lb break="no"/>plied in the case of the province of Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     whereas this Bill provides for payment 
     <lb/>
     up to a limit of population of 1,600,000. This 
     <lb/>
     will mean a difference eventually of $163,<lb break="no"/>200 annually to the advantage of the two 
     <lb/>
     provinces. In these respects the proposal 
     <lb/>
     of the government is better than the petition 
     <lb/>
     made by the people of the Territories through .' 
     <lb/>
     their legislature. To put the thing briefly, 
     <lb/>
     each province will start with a revenue as 
     <lb/>
     follows :

            <p>Analyses show that these revenues will 
     <lb/>yield at the beginning on the present popu<lb break="no"/>lation $4.10 per capita. When the popula<lb break="no"/>tion reaches 400,000, they will yield $3.33 


            <cb/>
 

     per capita, when the population amounts to 
     <lb/>
     800,000 they will yield $2.30 per capita, and 
     <lb/>
     when it reaches 1,200,000 they will give 
     <lb/>
     $1.84 per capiita. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Of course any autonomy proposition is 
     <lb/>
     a matter of comparison. There is no such 
     <lb/>
     thing as absolute autonomy. We are not 
     <lb/>
     professing to grant absolute autonomy to 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     All we are professing to do, and all we 
     <lb/>
     are asked to do, is to put the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories in an equitable position com<lb break="no"/>pared With the other provinces. All the 
     <lb/>
     Territories asked was that in the matter of 
     <lb/>
     local self-government, they should be put 
     <lb/>
     on an equal footing with the other provin<lb break="no"/>ces. It is therefore necessary to make some 
     <lb/>comparison between the conditions which 
     <lb/>these new provinces will enjoy and those 
     <lb/>enjoyed by the other provinces. I find that 
     <lb/>the province of New Brunswick during the 
     <lb/>year 1903—which is the last year for which 
     <lb/>I was able to obtain reports—had an ap<lb break="no"/>proximate population of 331,000 and drew 
     <lb/>a subsidy of $491,361. That province de<lb break="no"/>rived from its public domain a gross revenue 
     <lb/>of $176,570, from which ought to be de<lb break="no"/>ducted the expenses of administration ; but 
     <lb/>taking the gross figures, that province re<lb break="no"/>ceived $2 per head of its population as com<lb break="no"/>pared with $3.33 per head which the new 
     <lb/>provinces will receive when their popula<lb break="no"/>tion is 400,000, and $4.10 which they will 
     <lb/>be entitled to receive as soon as this Bill 
     <lb/>goes through. The balance of the revenue 
     <lb/>of New Brunswick was of course derived 
     <lb/>from local taxation, such as receipts from 
     <lb/>licenses, &amp;c. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     In the same year the total population of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia was 460,000, and it drew a 
     <lb/>
     subsidy of $432,807 from the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     From the Crown domain its gross revenue 
     <lb/>
     was $681,731, making a total of $1,114,538 
     <lb/>
     or $2.42 per head. whereas the province of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan, with the same population, 
     <lb/>
     will receive $1,337,875 or $2.90 per head. 
     <lb/>
     And, in 1899, four years earlier, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia had only a total of $336,000 from the 
     <lb/>
     Crown domain, and, from the two sources 
     <lb/>
     of subsidy and lands derived only $1.60 per 
     <lb/>
     head. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1899 Quebec drew a subsidy from 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government of $1,086,714 and 
     <lb/>
     derived from the Crown domain $1,029,473, 
     <lb/>
     or a total of $2,116,187, which, with an ap<lb break="no"/>proximate population of 1,600,000 meant 
     <lb/>
     $1.32 per head. The province of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, with a population of 1,200,000 will 
     <lb/>
     draw $2,207,875, or $1.84 per head ; and, 
     <lb/>
     with a population equal to that of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     or 1,600,000, will draw $1.38 per head, as 
     <lb/>
     against $1.32 per head in the case of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1899, Ontario, with an approximate 
     <lb/>
     population of 2,180,000 drew as subsidy $1,<lb break="no"/>339,287, and derived from Crown domain 
     <lb/>
     $1,302,562, gross, a total of $2,641,849, or 
     <lb/>
     $1.20 per head. And, with an equal popu<lb break="no"/>lation Saskatchewan will draw $2,217,875. 


            <pb n="3605" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3605.jpg"/>

     <lb/>
            
   

     or only $1.10 per head. With Manitoba I will 
     <lb/>
     make no comparison, because that province, 
     <lb/>
     I think every one admits, is not under fair 
     <lb/>
     terms. In 1899, with an approximate popu<lb break="no"/>lation of 250,000, Manitoba drew only 
     <lb/>
     $524,281 from lands and subsidies, as against 
     <lb/>
     a little over $1,000,000 for Saskatchewan 
     <lb/>
     with the same population. For the last two 
     <lb/>
     years Manitoba has been selling railway 
     <lb/>
     lands and increasing her annual revenue. 
     <lb/>
     But that cannot long continue. In 1903, 
     <lb/>
     even with these sales of nearly $300,000, 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba's total lands and subsidy revenue 
     <lb/>
     was $826,175 with a population of 255,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think, that as a whole, these comparisons 
     <lb/>
     will show that the terms which have been 
     <lb/>
     granted to the people of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories while not over-generous, are fair ; 
     <lb/>
     they simply place the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, judging by the conditions 
     <lb/>
     of the other provinces, in a fair and equit<lb break="no"/>able position to carry on their affairs of 
     <lb/>
     local government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Attention has already been called to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that I gave expression to some opinion 
     <lb/>
     in this House on the matter of dealing with 
     <lb/>
     the lands when the question of autonomy 
     <lb/>
     came to be settled. That is perfectly true. 
     <lb/>
     I may be permitted to read again some of 
     <lb/>
     the very good doctrine that I then uttered, 
     <lb/>
     as it is preserved in 'Hansard.' In 1901 I 
     <lb/>
     said :

     It will be observed that the burden of my 
     <lb/>
     statement related not so much to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion whether the lands should be transferred 
     <lb/>
     to local management as to the question 
     <lb/>
     whether these local governments should be 
     <lb/>
     given an equitable financial status in com<lb break="no"/>parison with the local governments in the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces. And that object is achieved 
     <lb/>
     in these propositions presented by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, not precisely, as I then urged, by 
     <lb/>
     actual transfer of the lands, but by a 
     <lb/>
     method, which, I am convinced, is financi<lb break="no"/>ally even better for the local governments. 
     <lb/>
     I was a strong believer in the principle of 
     <lb/>
     the ownership of the lands by the province, 
     <lb/>
     or at all events, that the province 
     <lb/>
     should have the right of the beneficial 
     <lb/>
     interest in them. I am a strong believer in 
     <lb/>
     that principle still, and it is that principle 
     <lb/>
     that is practically assented to in this 
     <lb/>
     measure. But I may say, that in 1901, when 
     <lb/>
     I made that statement, and even later, the 
     <lb/>
     principle found no general acceptance in this 
     <lb/>
     House or amongst any of the people east of 
     <lb/>
     the great lakes ; and my main purpose in 
     <lb/>
     uttering these words here was to try and im<lb break="no"/>press upon the people of eastern Canada the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of recognizing the right of posses<lb break="no"/>sion or, at least, of the beneficial interest in 
     <lb/>
     the lands of the Northwest Territories by 
     <lb/>
     the people of these Territories. Now, this 
     <lb/>
     House has already heard the very clear and 
     <lb/>
     ample statements made on this subject by 
     <lb/>
     the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
     <lb/>
     and by my hon. friend from Edmonton (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Oliver). They have made arguments which 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion are unanswerable. There has 
     <lb/>
     been no genuine attempt on the part of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite to answer them. At all 
     <lb/>
     events those arguments were sufficient to 
     <lb/>
     convert me to the proposition that it is abso<lb break="no"/>lutely better for the people of those 
     <lb/>
     new provinces to have the lands adminis<lb break="no"/>tered here, so long as the provinces obtain 
     <lb/>
     a sufficient sum in lieu of lands to place 
     <lb/>
     them in an equitable position to carry on 
     <lb/>
     their educational system, their public works, 
     <lb/>
     and, generally, their local affairs. And I am 
     <lb/>
     the more confirmed in that view by the ex<lb break="no"/>pressions which have fallen from hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on the other side of the House. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster),

     who, we assume, is the chief financial spokes<lb break="no"/>man for the Conservative party in this

     What did the hon. gentleman mean ? 
     <lb/>
     There is no difference in the item, grant 
     <lb/>
     for government. No one will contend that 
     <lb/>
     that is a better grant than the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are drawing. There is no substantial 
     <lb/>
     difference in the per capita subsidy. There 
     <lb/>
     is just one province, Nova Scotia, up to the 
     <lb/>
     present time, exceeding the limit of 400,000 
     <lb/>
     souls. Their population now is 460,000. 
     <lb/>
     But, except in that case there is no differ<lb break="no"/>ence at the present moment in the per capita 
     <lb/>
     arrangement made for these provinces and 
     <lb/>
     the arrangement at present in existence with 
     <lb/>
     other provinces. There is no difference in 
     <lb/>
     the debt account ;—no other suggestion 
     <lb/>
     would be listened to with regard to the debt. 
     <lb/>
     The only meaning that can be attached to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman's words is that too much 
     <lb/>
     money is being paid to these provinces in 
     <lb/>
     lieu of their public lands. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) gave ex<lb break="no"/>pression to this sentiment on March 23rd :

     I would like to point out, as a member from

    the province of Quebec, that it would be a great 
     <lb/>calamity indeed if the Minister of Justice and 
     <lb/>the government did not arrive at a conclusion 
     <lb/>that it is necessary to modify that section 
     <lb/>which has regard for instance to lands....
     <lb/>As to us in the piovince of Quebec, why, Sir, 
     <lb/>we have twenty-five million acres of good land 
     <lb/>for settlement, which we are trying to settle, 
     <lb/>which we are doing our best to settle. Instead 
     <lb/>of devoting all our energies and all our moneys 
     <lb/>and public resources to settle the lands in our 
     <lb/>own province, under the terms of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, we are going to pay this enormous indem<lb break="no"/>nity, these millions of dollars to keep a hold 
     <lb/>on the lands of the North-west.

     It is evident from these expressions that 
     <lb/>
     our hon. friends in the Conservative party, 
     <lb/>
     if they had the making of these proposals, 
     <lb/>
     would not have granted as good financial 
     <lb/>
     terms as we have now, would not have 
     <lb/>
     granted the amounts which are stated in 
     <lb/>
     the Bills to be paid to these new provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Now I find, in looking up the public records, 
     <lb/>
     that in pursuit of a proper and wise policy 
     <lb/>
     of settlement and development, this govern<lb break="no"/>ment has derived practically no profit from 
     <lb/>
     the Crown lands in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories since the Dominion first acquired 
     <lb/>
     them. From 1870 to 1880 the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of Crown lands in Manitoba and the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest cost $1,244,499.34 in excess of 
     <lb/>
     receipts. In the years 1881-1890 the ac<lb break="no"/>counts show $753,576.53 in excess of expend<lb break="no"/>iture. In the years from 1891 to 1900 there 
     <lb/>
     was again an excess of expenditure amount 
     <lb/>
     ing to $184,398.95. In the years from 1901 
     <lb/>
     up to 1904 there has been an excess of ex<lb break="no"/>penditure over receipts of $11, 733. 49. Tak<lb break="no"/>ing the whole period from 1870 up to date, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, the administration of lands in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest has cost this Dominion $687,<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>

     055.25 in excess of receipts, to which must 
     <lb/>
     be added refunds amounting to $329,950, 
     <lb/>
     making a total of $1,017,005.25. But if we 
     <lb/>
     take into account certain lands granted 
     <lb/>
     in redemption of scrip issued for rebellion 
     <lb/>
     services, half-breed claims and other pur<lb break="no"/>poses, amounting to $3,758,490, there is 
     <lb/>
     shown a favourable balance of $2,741,484.75, 
     <lb/>
     or an annual average of $78,328.13. As 
     <lb/>
     has already been stated, the Dominion profit 
     <lb/>
     from the policy so wisely pursued has to be 
     <lb/>
     looked for in other quarters,—from the cus<lb break="no"/>toms and other receipts and from the gen<lb break="no"/>erally improved conditions throughout Can<lb break="no"/>ada. The total revenues of Canada have in<lb break="no"/>creased in the last seven or eight years by 
     <lb/>
     about 100 per cent. In 1896 the total revenue 
     <lb/>
     was $35,000,000 or $36,000,000, last year the 
     <lb/>
     total revenue was over $70,000,000. We 
     <lb/>
     have been spending money in administering 
     <lb/>
     the lands, not for the purpose of making 
     <lb/>
     direct profit, but, on the other hand, we have 
     <lb/>
     brought about an exceedingly favourable 
     <lb/>
     result, in seven or eight years doubling the 
     <lb/>
     total revenue of this Dominion.

     The particular benefit to the provinces in 
     <lb/>
     the plan that is being adopted as opposed to 
     <lb/>
     the plan of transferring the public do<lb break="no"/>main to the local governments, is found in 
     <lb/>
     the fact that we have from the start 
     <lb/>
     an assured revenue ; whereas, if the lands 
     <lb/>
     were transferred to the local governments, 
     <lb/>
     and if no change of policy were put 
     <lb/>
     into effect by them, they would have great 
     <lb/>
     difficulties, in the initial years of their pro<lb break="no"/>vincial experience, in getting enough rev<lb break="no"/>enue to carry on the affairs of government, 
     <lb/>
     Moreover, their financial position is assured 
     <lb/>
     in the far future years, fifty or one hundred 
     <lb/>
     years hence, as long as this confederation 
     <lb/>
     lasts ; whereas, on the other hand, and in 
     <lb/>
     the case of some of the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     fifty or one hundred years hence, the Crown 
     <lb/>
     domain cannot be worth very much to 
     <lb/>
     those provinces so far as concerns their re<lb break="no"/>venues. The principle of the provincial 
     <lb/>
     right to a beneficial interest in the 
     <lb/>
     land is recognized in the most substantial 
     <lb/>
     manner, and I am pleased to be able to 
     <lb/>
     say, because I believe it to be the truth, 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the Northwest are emi 
     <lb/>
     nently satisfied. I venture to say that there 
     <lb/>
     is scarcely a man in the Northwest, who is 
     <lb/>
     not actuated by partisan sentiment, but has 
     <lb/>
     stated, either to himself or to his neighbours, 
     <lb/>
     that this is a better proposition than would 
     <lb/>
     be the proposition to turn over the lands to 
     <lb/>
     local management. I may be permitted to 
     <lb/>
     give to the House some actual expressions 
     <lb/>
     of opinion on this point. So far as possible, 
     <lb/>
     I will not give partisan opinions. The 
     <lb/>
     'Standard' newspaper of Regina, publish<lb break="no"/>ed by a gentleman of independent tenden<lb break="no"/>cies, neither Conservative or Liberal, since 
     <lb/>
     the publication of the terms of these Bills, 
     <lb/>
     has written :

     It is difficult, at the present stage, to pass

     judgment upon the terms proposed in the Au<lb break="no"/>tonomy Bills. It is, however, quite evident that

     the Dominion will retain control of the Terri<lb break="no"/>torial public lands. Perhaps, under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances, this is best for all concerned. The two 
     <lb/>
     great needs of the new provinces at first, will 
     <lb/>
     be population and railway development. To se<lb break="no"/>cure the former, the inducement of free home<lb break="no"/>steads must continue to be offered, and to secure 
     <lb/>
     railway extension, lands, or the proceeds of lands 
     <lb/>
     are usually granted. Thus, we see, that if the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces owned the unallotted lands they 
     <lb/>
     should have practically to give them away. At 
     <lb/>
     the same time the cost of land administration 
     <lb/>
     would have to be borne. The duties of the im<lb break="no"/>migration Department, too, would follow the 
     <lb/>
     land. The new provinces could not be easily 
     <lb/>
     equipped for these onerous duties. It took the 
     <lb/>
     federal authorities many years to bring immi<lb break="no"/>gration work up to its present status. They 
     <lb/>
     have it now in a state of high efficiency, with 
     <lb/>
     experienced agents at work in various parts of 
     <lb/>
     the world. It is important that the good work 
     <lb/>
     shall continue to go on undisturbed. A hand<lb break="no"/>some equivalent, either in cash or in interest- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     bearing credit, will suit the new provinces much 
     <lb/>
     better than the extra responsibilities which are 
     <lb/>
     involved in the ownership and control of the 
     <lb/>
     public domain.

            </p>

            <p>
     The circumstances of the old provinces were 
     <lb/>
     altogether different. They had railways and 
     <lb/>
     population long before confederation, and they 
     <lb/>
     also had the lands and their respective. land

     departments in full organization.

     Now, I am going to read to the House a

     a gentleman in Regina, dated February

     24th, three days after these propositions had 
     <lb/>
     been presented to the House and had been 
     <lb/>
     reported in Regina. This letter was not 
     <lb/>
     sent me for publication, or with the idea 
     <lb/>
     that its contents would ever reach any per<lb break="no"/>son but myself. I think a letter of this kind 
     <lb/>
     is the best sort of evidence to show the 
     <lb/>
     actual situation as it struck the gentleman

     interested. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I come now to a subject which is per<lb break="no"/>haps more contentious in its nature, al<lb break="no"/>though I am obliged to repeat again that I
     <lb/>
     think that a totally disproportionate amount 
     <lb/>
     of attention has been given to what is only 
     <lb/>
     a phase of the educational matter. The mat<lb break="no"/>ter of education is one of very prime import<lb break="no"/>ance, the most important matter to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of any province and the most important 
     <lb/>
     subject that could possibly be dealt with 
     <lb/>
     by any parliament or local legislature. But 
     <lb/>
     the matter that is being debated in the 
     <lb/>
     House is the narrowest kind of an issue as 
     <lb/>
     between the proposition of the government 
     <lb/>
     and the proposition, as it is explained by 
     <lb/>
     himself, of the hon. member for Carleton. 
     <lb/>
     However, before actually taking up the 
     <lb/>
     educational clause, let me make another 
     <lb/>
     brief reference. The year of confederation, 
     <lb/>
     1867, chances to be also the year in which I 
     <lb/>
     was ushered into this world and it will not 
     <lb/>
     be a matter of surprise, therefore, that some 
     <lb/>
     of the negotiations and some of the events 
     <lb/>
     that occurred prior to that time are not 
     <lb/>
     very definitely within my recollection. I 
     <lb/>
     was thrown into circumstances which did 
     <lb/>
     not conduce to a great deal of research or 
     <lb/>
     study historical or constitutional. Probably 
     <lb/>
     there are many people in Canada, in On<lb break="no"/>tario, in Manitoba and in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories who may be like myself in this 
     <lb/>
     regard. We have had it in our minds, from 
     <lb/>
     what we have seen in the newspapers and 
     <lb/>
     from the sentiments we have heard ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by people around us that the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibilty for the insertion of the clause 
     <lb/>
     protecting the rights of minorities in the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian constitution, the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, was upon the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     hierarchy, that they had in some way en<lb break="no"/>gineered that provision into the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion Act and that it was probably only the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic people of the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada who were interested in the obser<lb break="no"/>vance of that principle. Or, to state it the 
     <lb/>
     other way, we have had the impression 
     <lb/>
    that the Protestants in Canada were and 
   

            <pb n="3611" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3611.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3612</fw>
     

     ought to be antagonistic to the observance of 
     <lb/>
     that provision for the protection of minority 
     <lb/>
     rights which is embodied in the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. I have to admit that 
     <lb/>
     it came with a kind of a shock to me in the 
     <lb/>
     first instance to hear that it was not the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic hierarchy but the Protest<lb break="no"/>ant people of Canada who stood up for the 
     <lb/>
     insertion of that protection in the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. The House has heard the indisput<lb break="no"/>able proof of that fact which was given by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the First Minister in his 
     <lb/>
     speech in this House on the 21st of Febru<lb break="no"/>ary and again in another speech on the 
     <lb/>
     22nd March of this year. But, perhaps, it 
     <lb/>
     will do no harm if I quote from another 
     <lb/>
     gentleman for whom some hon. members 
     <lb/>
     on the other side of the House may have a 
     <lb/>
     higher regard. The late leader of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party, Sir Charles Tupper, re<lb break="no"/>ferred to this matter in a speech delivered 
     <lb/>
     in this House in 1896. Sir Charles Tupper 
     <lb/>
     was one of the fathers of confederation 
     <lb/>
     who took part in the negotiations which re<lb break="no"/>sulted in confederation, and he speaks as 
     <lb/>
     a man having knowledge. He said: 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     I say with knowledge that but for the consent

     especially the Protestants of Quebec, and but

     And he went on to say that the change 
     <lb/>
     which took place in the clause was this, 
     <lb/>
     that instead of its being confined to both 
     <lb/>
     the Canadas, it was broadened to include 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces that might enter confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. 0f the fact, therefore, that this pro<lb break="no"/>vision was inserted for Protestant interests. 
     <lb/>
     and not for Roman Catholic interests, there 
     <lb/>
     cannot be any successful dispute. It was 
     <lb/>
     not inserted for the Protestants of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     alone, but it was inserted for what was 
     <lb/>
     expected to be the Protestant minority in the 
     <lb/>
     territory lying west of the great lakes. Par<lb break="no"/>liament, in 1870, in creating the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, provided for minority rights in 
     <lb/>
     separate schools, not for Catholic interests 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba, but for what were believed to 
     <lb/>
     be Protestant interests. There was just as 
     <lb/>
     much expectation that the minority in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba would be a Protestant minority as 
     <lb/>
     that it would be a Roman Catholic minority. 
     <lb/>
     Let any gentleman read the 1875 debates. 
     <lb/>
     read the debate that took place when the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories' Act was passed, and 
     <lb/>
     it must be plain to him, if he has an open, 
     <lb/>
     impartial mind, that the parliament of Can 
     <lb/>
     ada in 1875 provided, not specially for Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholic minorities, but provided for 
     <lb/>
     expected Protestant minorities in the North 
     <lb/>
     west Territories. At all events, let any 
     <lb/>
     gentleman read these 1875 debates impaiu 
     <lb/>
     tially, and he cannot possibly deny that 
     <lb/>
     Blake, Mackenzie, Sir John Macdonald and 
     <lb/>
     Sir Alexander Campbell—I believe that 
     <lb/>
     none of these gentlemen was a Roman Cath<lb break="no"/>olic; each one of them bears an honoured 
     <lb/>
     name, and each one of them was a Pro<lb break="no"/>testant—supported the separate school

     In the face of that language if the late

     he do? Support the protection to min<lb break="no"/>ority rights ? Certainly. That therefore

     opponent of the separate school as was Mr.

     Brown.

            </p>

            <p>
     Take the late Mr. Dalton McCarthy ; he 
     <lb/>
     proposed in the year 1894 in this House to 
     <lb/>
     do what was the duty of any one who had 
     <lb/>
     a seat in this House, and believed that 
     <lb/>
     the separate school in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories was an iniquity, an impropriety or 
     <lb/>
     an injury to the Northwest Territories. He 
     <lb/>
     proposed that they should be abolished so 
     <lb/>
     far as this House was concerned. He pro<lb break="no"/>posed to leave the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories free to abolish separate 
     <lb/>
     schools if they wished to do so, and one 
     <lb/>
     of the very reasons he urged was that if 
     <lb/>
     the separate school provision was not abol<lb break="no"/>ished until the moment when the Territories 
     <lb/>
     entered the union as provinces then it would 
     <lb/>
     be impossible ever to abolish separate schools 
     <lb/>
     in that Territory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But looking at the whole history of the 
     <lb/>
    matter, we must remember that it was for 
     <lb/>Protestant minorities as well as for Roman 
     <lb/>Catholic minorities that this protection was 
     <lb/>placed in the British North America Act. I 
     <lb/>want to speak with perfect sincerity. This 
     <lb/>is a serious question especially for those of 
     <lb/>us who come from the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>I want to say, speaking as a Protestant, 
     <lb/>not as a member of the minority, that in 
     <lb/>view of the history of this matter I would 
     <lb/>be ashamed of myself as a Protestant and 
     <lb/>ashamed of the Protestant majority if we 
     <lb/>would wish now, merely because we have 
     <lb/>the power and because it is no longer our 
     <lb/>rights that will be affected, to use that pow<lb break="no"/>er, to deny the very thing which we as 
     <lb/>Protestants stood out for when a Protest<lb break="no"/>ant minority was affected. The principle 
     <lb/>is there clear and distinct to me. as I think 
     <lb/>it must be to every man with an impartial 
     <lb/>mind. 
     <lb/>

            <p>It is urged against the Liberal party

     Was he speaking truly or falsely? Was

     <lb/>
     living in the country west of the great 
     <lb/>
     lakes and familiar with the sentiment of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, could deny that he was telling 
     <lb/>
     the truth. It was such a violent wrench that 
     <lb/>
     if that action had not been prevented by 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
     <lb/>
     the chances are that confederation would 
     <lb/>
     have been split into its original fragments. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentlemen opposite were taking 
     <lb/>
     a different course from what they are 
     <lb/>
     taking to-day. but then as now they 
     <lb/>
     were forgetting that constitutions are made 
     <lb/>
     for the provinces, not provinces for 
     <lb/>
     the constitution. The right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who now leads the House (Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier) was standing then for respect for 
     <lb/>
     established rights. the established right of 
     <lb/>
     the people of the province to have such a 
     <lb/>
     school system as they saw fit to have with<lb break="no"/>in its constitution. He is doing the same 
     <lb/>
     to-day, he is standing to-day for respect for 
     <lb/>
     the established rights of minorities in that 
     <lb/>
     area of country which is going to constitute 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces. Is he proposing any 
     <lb/>
     wrench of the principle of the constitution 
     <lb/>
     as the government of 1896 did? Why Sir, 
     <lb/>
     he is proposing the very opposite as has 
     <lb/>
     been conclusively proven by the extracts 
     <lb/>
     from speeches which I have read to the 
     <lb/>
     House. The principle of protection for 
     <lb/>
     minority rights is there in the constitution, 
     <lb/>
     and no impartial man, no man who wishes 
     <lb/>
     to be fair, can disregard the existence of 
     <lb/>
     that principle in the constitution ; whether 
     <lb/>
     it is there by letter of law, whether the 
     <lb/>
     letter of the constitution would hear this 
     <lb/>
     interpretation, or not, there can be no 
     <lb/>
     successful denial of the fact that in pro<lb break="no"/>viding as these Bills do, for the con<lb break="no"/>tinuation to the minorities of exactly the 
     <lb/>
     rights they are enjoying when they enter 
     <lb/>
     this confederation as provinces, the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment is purely and simply regarding the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the Confederation Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There has been a good deal of cavil upon 
     <lb/>
     the point as to whether that area should 
     <lb/>
     be considered as a province before its entry 
     <lb/>
     or as a Territory. No person will deny 
     <lb/>
     or seek to deny that it is only a Territory 
     <lb/>
     but after all the human beings on the 
     <lb/>
     areas out there are just the same as they 
     <lb/>
     would be if they were in provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     their interests and conditions are prac<lb break="no"/>tically not different at all from the 
     <lb/>
     conditions under the same institutions 
     <lb/>
     if the areas were provinces instead of 
     <lb/>
     being territories. On this point perhaps 
     <lb/>
     it will not be out of place for me to quote 
     <lb/>
     from a gentleman whose authority is very 
     <lb/>

     believe the majority of the Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholics in the country are in groups. 
     <lb/>
     They do not constitute minorities. Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights, as I have already said, 


            <cb/>
     

     is a comparative term. I believe—and 
     <lb/>
     the large majority of the people in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories that I have 
     <lb/>
     heard from since these proposals were 
     <lb/>
     brought down also believe—that provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights are being granted to them in the full<lb break="no"/>est sense in which they are enjoyed by any 
     <lb/>
     other province of Canada. A common 
     <lb/>
     school—that is just what we are asked to 
     <lb/>
     vote for in this proposition; a non-sectarian 
     <lb/>
     school, absolutely under state control. A 
     <lb/>
     free west—that is, a reasonably free west; 
     <lb/>
     just as free as Ontario. Talk about 
     <lb/>
     throttling the west! Then two-thirds of 
     <lb/>
     the people of this Dominion live in prov<lb break="no"/>inces which are throttled, are they feeling 
     <lb/>
     very badly? They have in Ontario, I under<lb break="no"/>stand, what are called church schools, and 
     <lb/>
     I believe they have church schools in Que<lb break="no"/>bec also. Are they feeling badly ? If this 
     <lb/>
     proposition were placing a severe hardship 
     <lb/>
     on the people of the west, it is not as severe 
     <lb/>
     a hardship as has been placed on the people 
     <lb/>
     of these other provinces, because it is giv<lb break="no"/>ing the west, not an ecclesiastical school, 
     <lb/>
     not a church school, but a free common 
     <lb/>
     school under state control. At all events, 
     <lb/>
     two-thirds of the people of this Dominion 
     <lb/>
     are living in provinces not more free, not 
     <lb/>
     so free,—provinces that have always been 
     <lb/>
     looked upon as being autonomous provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and apparently doing very well. The Bill, 
     <lb/>
     I believe to be in strict harmony with that 
     <lb/>
     motto: 'A free west, a common school, 
     <lb/>
     provincial rights and religious equality.' 
     <lb/>
     These provinces will be as free as any other 
     <lb/>
     province if we are to regard and apply the 
     <lb/>
     principles of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act—I for one believe more free, because, 
     <lb/>
     by section 16 of the Bill, we restrict and 
     <lb/>
     diminish the full and complete application 
     <lb/>
     of section 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Autonomy, as I said before. is a 
     <lb/>
     comparative term. As was pointed out 
     <lb/>
     very well by the hon. Postmaster General 
     <lb/>
     last evening, there are no two provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Canada with the same constitution. I ven<lb break="no"/>ture to say that the average citizen of the 
     <lb/>
     Territory, if he had been asked if he would 
     <lb/>
     accept the autonomy that British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     has would have said: No, the limit of popu<lb break="no"/>lation would not suit either of these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. If asked if he would accept the 
     <lb/>
     autonomy that Manitoba has, he would say 
     <lb/>
     certainly not, notwithstanding that Mani<lb break="no"/>toba is absolutely free in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     school matter, because the financial terms 
     <lb/>
     given to Manitoba would be entirely unsatis<lb break="no"/>factory to the new provinces. For the same 
     <lb/>
     reason as in the case of British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     he would not be prepared to accept the au<lb break="no"/>tonomy which the maritime provinces pos<lb break="no"/>sess. Make the suggestion to him that he 
     <lb/>
     accept the autonomy which Quebec has, and 
     <lb/>
     what would he say? Quebec is limited in 
     <lb/>
     the matter of language; it is obliged to re<lb break="no"/>cognize officially two languages, and it is 
     <lb/>
     limited in other respects. He would not ac<lb break="no"/>

           <fw type="num">3617</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 31, 1905</fw> <fw type="num">3618</fw>
      

     cept that. The average citizen of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, if asked to accept the autonomy of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario, would at first blush 
     <lb/>
     say yes; but some of us on inquiring a little 
     <lb/>
     further would say: Certainly not; there is 
     <lb/>
     a limitation in Ontario with regard to schools 
     <lb/>
     which we do not want to apply in Alberta 
     <lb/>
     and Saskatchewan, and in these Bills it 
     <lb/>
     is not applied.

     <lb/>
     to say that the Northwest provinces are 
     <lb/>
     getting exactly the same provincial auto<lb break="no"/>nomy as the other provinces. Is it not a 
     <lb/>
     fact that every province in confederation to<lb break="no"/>day, except Ontario and Quebec, has the 
     <lb/>
     absolute right to legislate with regard to 
     <lb/>
     education ?

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I have endeavoured to ex<lb break="no"/>plain to the House very clearly my position 
     <lb/>
     on that point—that there are no two prov<lb break="no"/>inces in Canada with exactly the same 
     <lb/>
     measure of autonomy, and probably the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories would not 
     <lb/>
     be willing to accept the exact position oc<lb break="no"/>cupied by any other single province in Can<lb break="no"/>ada. I believe that the provisions of these 
     <lb/>
     Bills will place the Northwest Territories in 
     <lb/>
     a position as nearly as possible of absolute 
     <lb/>
     and satisfactory average equality with the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces of Canada. I know that the 
     <lb/>hon. member for East Grey, in the depth of<lb/>
     his sincerity, would like to have a contrary 
     <lb/>impression created. I said a moment ago 
     <lb/>that there were some misconceptions pre<lb break="no"/>vailing, and we have heard some of them 
     <lb/>voiced in this House. I am going to read 
     <lb/>to the House a communication which I have 
     <lb/>received which puts those misconceptions 
     <lb/>a little more bluntly than we hear them 
     <lb/>put in this House, but it expresses the 
     <lb/>same spirit. This letter reached me this 
     <lb/>week. To satisfy my hon. friend from East 
     <lb/>Grey, I will say at the beginning that I am

     was that the right be left with the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to deal with the school question as

     they saw fit. I did not ask that they should

     do away with separate schools or introduce

     separate schools, but be left free to deal

     friend, but the fact remains that there were 
     <lb/>
     people in the province of Ontario who, in 
     <lb/>
     last January, before these Bills were brought 
     <lb/>
     down, were writing to people in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories; and if I had the file of the 
     <lb/>
     Calgary 'Herald' here—which is a Conser<lb break="no"/>vative organ—1 could read a very strong 
     <lb/>
     article advising the people of Ontario to 
     <lb/>
     mind their own business and not meddle in 
     <lb/>
     this affair of the people of the Territories, 
     <lb/>
     who are well able to look after it them<lb break="no"/>selves. But to continue with these com<lb break="no"/>munications and resolutions; here is a reso<lb break="no"/>lution which was adopted by a public meet<lb break="no"/>ing at Moosejaw :

     <lb/>
     it, that right in that clause there is a mis<lb break="no"/>conception. As a matter of fact, this legis<lb break="no"/>lation was not brought into existence by the 
     <lb/>
     local legislature, but initiated by this par<lb break="no"/>liament. Practically all the protests and 
     <lb/>
     communications and complaints which have 
     <lb/>
     been raised are based upon misconceptions, 
     <lb/>
     though not of so violent a character, I must 
     <lb/>
     admit, as those which exist in the mind of 
     <lb/>
     the writer of the letter who signed himself 
     <lb/>
     'a lover of freedom.' And a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     that misconception exists apparently in the 
     <lb/>
     city of Toronto. A gentleman who for many 
     <lb/>
     years held, first in Manitoba and then in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories, the important position of super<lb break="no"/>intendent of education, spoke at a recent 
     <lb/>
     public gathering in Toronto—a gathering 
     <lb/>
     held as a protest against the legislation sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to this House. I refer to Dr. Goggin. 
     <lb/>
     I read from the report in the Toronto

     We have all had experience with

     'Old Liberal,' 'Disgusted Liberal,' 'Long-

     standing Liberal,' and various other 
     <lb/>
     classes of Liberal who come to the front 
     <lb/>
     during a general election or at other 
     <lb/>
     periods of excitement. In my own 
     <lb/>
     hearing the name of Mark Twain has 
     <lb/>
     been used twice in the course of this debate. 
     <lb/>
     On one occasion Mr. Clemens, more widely 
     <lb/>
     known by his pen-name ' Mark Twain,' was 
     <lb/>
     inspecting a group of statuary in the house 
     <lb/>
     of a friend. One statue was that of a 
     <lb/>
     young woman coiling her hair. The great 
     <lb/>
     humorist had a puzzled expression, and, 
     <lb/>
     when asked what he thought of the statue 
     <lb/>
     he said, 'Well, it isn't true to nature : she 
     <lb/>
     ought to have a mouth full of hair<lb break="no"/>pins.' We in the west have been 
     <lb/>
     acquainted with Dr. Goggin for many 
     <lb/>
     years. but no matter how full of politi<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
       

     cal hairpins he was even his best friend 
     <lb/>
     would fail to recognize him from this des<lb break="no"/>cription given of him in the Toronto ' News.' 
     <lb/>
     We have always known him as a very esti<lb break="no"/>mable, a very genial, but a very thorough<lb break="no"/>going Conservative. I entirely refuse to be<lb break="no"/>lieve that Dr. Goggin is correctly reported. 
     <lb/>
    I venture to say that the Toronto 'News,' 
     <lb/>pursuing its very frequent policy of mis<lb break="no"/>representation, has incorrectly reported Dr. 
     <lb/>Goggin, in representing him as belonging to 
     <lb/>the class of 'Disgusted Liberals.' Dr. 
     <lb/>Goggin later on referred to Mr. Haultain's

     Sir Wilfrid Laurier has said that he did not

     think there was much to be accomplished by

     discussion. We know where Mr. Haultain

     or not. One of our objects in coming here to<lb break="no"/>night is to help him to discover where he

     ought to be. We know that the people of the

     There were consultations going on nearly<lb/>every day. If there were no discussions be<lb break="no"/>tween the members of the government and 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories with regard to education whose was 
     <lb/>
     the fault ? Was there any prohibition rest<lb break="no"/>ing upon Mr. Haultain against bringing the 
     <lb/>
     matter of education into the conference ? 
     <lb/>
     I will point out to you a little later, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that in not bringing up the matter 
     <lb/>
     of education Mr. Haultain was doing exactly 
     <lb/>
     what he had been doing in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. For years he had been discus<lb break="no"/>sing this autonomy matter, and yet until 
     <lb/>
     the time of the general election last October 
     <lb/>
     you will fail to find any reference he ever 
     <lb/>
     made in any discussion to the subject of 
     <lb/>
     education. If there were no long discussions 
     <lb/>
     between him and the members of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment with regard to education, I venture 
     <lb/>
     to say that Mr. Haultain and his colleague 
     <lb/>
     are at least as much to blame as are the 
     <lb/>
     members of the government.

     Now I revert to a matter that I mentioned

     a little while ago,—I will have something 
     <lb/>
     to say with regard to Dr. Goggin a little 
     <lb/>
     later—whether this Territory should be 
     <lb/>
     treated in these measures, as a territory or 
     <lb/>
     a province. There has been a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     discussion coming from the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House on that point. I find that the opinion 
     <lb/>
     from Mr. Christopher Robinson, K.C., read 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule) had that idea in it—in fact that 
     <lb/>
     idea was the basis of Mr. Robinson's opin<lb break="no"/>ion. Mr. Robinson said :

     and I say that when that draft Bill 
     <lb/>
     was prepared Mr. Haultain, nor any 
     <lb/>
     of his colleagues, nor any of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Northwest legislature, nor 
     <lb/>
     any of the people of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories who were taking an interest in 
     <lb/>
     the matter, ever had any intention of ask<lb break="no"/>ing for greater freedom in this matter of 
     <lb/>
     schools than they had been enjoying for 
     <lb/>
     the last fourteen years. Dr. Goggin, as I 
     <lb/>
     said. was superintendent of education in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories for a number of 
     <lb/>
     years ; he was practically the deputy of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain in the educational depart<lb break="no"/>ment at the time this draft Bill was framed. 
     <lb/>
     Dr. Goggin moved to Toronto a little more 
     <lb/>
     than two years ago, at about which time 
     <lb/>
     he was interviewed on the subject of au<lb break="no"/>tonomy by the Toronto 'News.' He was 
     <lb/>
     asked his opinion as to the reason of the 
     <lb/>
     delay by parliament in dealing with this 
     <lb/>
     matter of autonomy, and this is what he 
     <lb/>
     said :

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     There are those who assert that the delay in

            <p>
     Dr. Goggin knew the contents of the 
     <lb/>
     draft Bill, he was in Regina at the time 
     <lb/>
     it was prepared, and was then Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain's superintendent of education. He was 
     <lb/>
     there during the local election in 1902 when, 
     <lb/>
     as is stated, the people of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     voted upon and endorsed the demand made 
     <lb/>
     by the government for autonomy, and after 
     <lb/>
     he came to Toronto a year later he declared 
     <lb/>
     he had seen no declaration by the premier 
     <lb/>
     or legislature of the Territories that they 
     <lb/>
     wanted additional freedom in the matter of 
     <lb/>
     the schools constitution. I say, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     and I say it solemnly, because it is a weighty 
     <lb/>
     statement, not to be made lightly, I say 
     <lb/>
     that in view of the fact that in his own 
     <lb/>
     draft Bill, Mr. Haultain asked for a pro<lb break="no"/>vincial charter in which separate schools 
     <lb/>
     would be imposed and guaranteed in the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces as if the Territories were 
     <lb/>
     one of the original provinces, a charter hav<lb break="no"/>ing the effect which the Nova Scotia charter 
     <lb/>
     would possess with regard to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools if a separate school system had 
     <lb/>
     been in existence in Nova Scotia in 1867—I 
     <lb/>
     say that the ground taken in this letter of 
     <lb/>
     protest by Mr. Haultain can only be classed 
     <lb/>
     as a piece of the rankest and most patent 
     <lb/>
     partisan misrepresentation ever witnessed 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion of Canada. I ask the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Qu' Appelle who was a member 
     <lb/>
     of the legislature, and was one of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain's closest associates, if, up to April, 
     <lb/>
     1903. if up to the time of the Moosejaw con<lb break="no"/>vention in 1903, when Mr. Haultain was 
     <lb/>
     dragooned by his party associates at the 
     <lb/>
     instance of the leader of the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party here—if the hon. member for Qu' Ap<lb break="no"/>pelle ever understood that Mr. Haultain, or 
     <lb/>
     his government, or the legislature intended 
     <lb/>
     to ask a constitution with regard to edu<lb break="no"/>cation different from the constitution that 
     <lb/>
     they had at that moment ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I thoroughly understood that 
     <lb/>
     the draft Bill provided for absolute freedom 
     <lb/>
     of action to the new provinces in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter of education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Well, the draft Bill speaks 
     <lb/>
     for itself, and it asks that these areas be 
     <lb/>
     not treated as Territories but be treated as 
     <lb/>
     if they were at this moment provinces. And 
     <lb/>
     Dr. Goggin had no such understanding as 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend professes. Nor had I. Nor 
     <lb/>
     had the assembly generally. I think it is 
     <lb/>
     proper for me to point out that this parti<lb break="no"/>cular conduct on the part of Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     is strictly of a piece with his whole conduct 
     <lb/>
     of political matters since the convention 
     <lb/>
     two years ago when he was dragooned at 
     <lb/>
     Moosejaw. 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I strongly object to the 
     <lb/>
    suggestion being made that I knew Mr. 
     <lb/>Haultain was dragooned ; nothing of the 
     <lb/>sort, I think he acted entirely of his own 
     <lb/>free will. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HERR2">Mr. HERRON</persName>. I do not think the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman from West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) 
     <lb/>
     would dare go into Alberta and make a 
     <lb/>
     statement of that kind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Well, my present sphere is 
     <lb/>
     sufficient for me now, perhaps I may have 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity some time to make this state<lb break="no"/>ment elsewhere. Mr. Haultain knows since 
     <lb/>
     last October and November whether I have 
     <lb/>
     fear or hesitation about making the state<lb break="no"/>ment elsewhere. I say his conduct in 
     <lb/>
     this matter is of a piece with his conduct 
     <lb/>
     during the last two years. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) remembers 
     <lb/>
     that in the fall of 1903 We had a discussion 
     <lb/>
     about a certain matter of capital advance. 
     <lb/>
     I read a telegram from Mr. Haultain which 
     <lb/>
     practically asked me to get a capital ad<lb break="no"/>vance on certain terms which he said 
     <lb/>
     would be satisfactory to him. Well, later 
     <lb/>
     in the assembly he declared that they were 
     <lb/>
     not satisfactory, and it is to the knowledge 
     <lb/>
     of everybody that that declaration had 
     <lb/>
     absolutely no other motive than partisanship 
     <lb/>
     and had no other result that the detriment 
     <lb/>
     of the people of the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I understood Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain's objection was this, that if the increas<lb break="no"/>ed amount of money was given out of ex<lb break="no"/>penditure it was to be regarded as paying 
     <lb/>
     off so much debt, it was to be counted as 
     <lb/>
     a debt against the province and taken into 
     <lb/>
     consideration when autonomy was given, 
     <lb/>
     because, he said, we have no right to be 
     <lb/>
     saddled with that as a debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. That of course may be call<lb break="no"/>ed a side issue. Mr. Haultain asked us by 
     <lb/>
     telegram to get a capital advance on cer<lb break="no"/>tain terms, we got it on those terms, and he 
     <lb/>
     said in his telegram that he would be satis<lb break="no"/>fied. But later on he stated in the legis<lb break="no"/>lature that it was not satisfactory, and for 
     <lb/>
     purely partisan reasons, which nobody can 
     <lb/>
     successfully deny. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I did not understand 
     <lb/>
     that the money was got on the terms that 
     <lb/>
     he asked for at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Absolutely. Then as this 
     <lb/>
     matter has become one of some interest as 
     <lb/>
     we hear it said that here is the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the duly accredited, constitutional repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of the Northwest Territories, their 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister. I think it becomes our duty 
     <lb/>
     to look into his credentials. What is his 
     <lb/>
     position at the present time ? He is 
     <lb/>
     the reputed head of the legislature, but 
     <lb/>
     I make the statement on my respon<lb break="no"/>sibility as a member of this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, that Mr. Haultain does not at the 
     <lb/>
     present moment possess the confidence of 


            <pb n="3627" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3627.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3627</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3628</fw>
    

     the Northwest legislature. If he had a meet<lb break="no"/>ing of the legislature to-day I know posi<lb break="no"/>tively that he could not command a 
     <lb/>
     majority. There are seven vacancies, since 
     <lb/>
     the last meeting of the legislature seven 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen have resigned, and I verily be<lb break="no"/>lieve that if these constituencies were 
     <lb/>
     to elect new members, Mr. Haultain to<lb break="no"/>morrow would not be able to control 
     <lb/>
     a majority. He is in a sense, of 
     <lb/>
     course, Prime Minister, but if we are go<lb break="no"/>ing to stick to the constitution as strictly 
     <lb/>
     as our friends this afternoon have argued 
     <lb/>
     for it, Mr. Haultain must admit that he is 
     <lb/>
     not the constitutional representative of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories at this 
     <lb/>
     moment. Is further evidence needed ? Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain made this very autonomy mat<lb break="no"/>ter, as my hon. friend from Brandon 
     <lb/>
     knows, an issue in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories in the last general election as far as 
     <lb/>
     he could to obscure the Grand Trunk Pacific. 
     <lb/>
     He stumped the Northwest Territories on it 
     <lb/>
     and what was the result ? Seven Liberal 
     <lb/>
     members returned, every one with an aver<lb break="no"/>age majority of 1,200, as against three Con<lb break="no"/>servatives with an average majority of less 
     <lb/>
     than 150. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. You ought to have an 
     <lb/>
     election for the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     now.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. We had a good deal of dis<lb break="no"/>cussion this afternoon and many brave 
     <lb/>
     statements were made by hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite. We had very similar statements 
     <lb/>
     made last year. We had a number of fing<lb break="no"/>ers pointing across the floor of the House 
     <lb/>
     then as they were pointing across this after<lb break="no"/>noon and from month to month in 1904 and 
     <lb/>
     during the previous session of 1903 hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen said: Only dare to come down 
     <lb/>
     to the people; only dare to do it. Well, the 
     <lb/>
     government did dare do it and the result is 
     <lb/>
     as I have said, that in British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     there were seven Liberals returned and 
     <lb/>
     not a single Conservative, in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories seven Liberals. with a majority 
     <lb/>
     averaging a little over 1,200, as against 
     <lb/>
     three Conservatives barely squeezed in, 
     <lb/>
     and in Manitoba seven Liberals as against 
     <lb/>
     three Conservatives. And when we got 
     <lb/>
     before the people their complaint was that 
     <lb/>
     we had taken them unawares. Let the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Elgin (Mr. Ingram) not 
     <lb/>
     concern himself. Whether a new Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior is selected from British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia or the Northwest Territories 0r 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, I venture to say that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment will be able to carry the election of 
     <lb/>
     such a minister in whatever district they 
     <lb/>
     may choose to select him from. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some references have been made to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bulyea, the colleague of Mr. Haultain. 
     <lb/>
     Some serious insinuations have been made 
     <lb/>
     against Mr. Bulyea. Some were made by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Foster) a few days ago. He insinuated, 


            <cb/>
      

     and because no direct denial was made he 
     <lb/>
     took it as an admitted fact, that Mr. Bul<lb break="no"/>yea had been, as he put it colleaguing with 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. Prime Minister and the Lib<lb break="no"/>eral members from the Territories apart 
     <lb/>
     from Mr. Haultain. I think I am revealing 
     <lb/>
     no secret when I say that I have been pres<lb break="no"/>ent at no conference at which the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. Prime Minister was present and at 
     <lb/>
     which Mr. Bulyea was present. We have 
     <lb/>
     had numberless conferences with the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister and his colleagues, but at none 
     <lb/>
     of these conferences was Mr. Bulyea pres<lb break="no"/>ent. Let me turn that proposition around. 
     <lb/>
     I am sorry that the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto is not here. Is there anybody here 
     <lb/>
     who is prepared to state— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Toronto did not make that statement 
     <lb/>
     at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Is there anybody present 
     <lb/>
     who is able to state—and the hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition will have an' opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of answering this question—that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain was careful to have Mr. Bulyea 
     <lb/>
     with him every time he was in meeting and 
     <lb/>
     in discussion with the hon. leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position in regard to this autonomy matter? 
     <lb/>
     Several hon. gentlemen opposite have sug<lb break="no"/>gested that Mr. Bulyea had deserted the 
     <lb/>
     position of the Northwest Territories in 
     <lb/>
     failing to sign the letter of protest which 
     <lb/>
     appeared over the signature of Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain. I have already read the letter 
     <lb/>
     and it is patent to everybody that the only 
     <lb/>
     protest of any kind contained in that letter 
     <lb/>
     is in regard to this school matter. He does 
     <lb/>
     not lay stress on the matter of the num<lb break="no"/>ber of provinces, he does not lay stress on 
     <lb/>
     the matter of lands; the only thing he does 
     <lb/>
     lay stress on is the matter of the schools 
     <lb/>
     and I have proved to the House, I think, 
     <lb/>
     to the satisfaction of every lawyer and 
     <lb/>
     every layman in the House, that Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain's own draft Bill, which was assented 
     <lb/>
     to by the legislature and the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, asked for the con<lb break="no"/>tinuation of the separate school system. Is 
     <lb/>
     it Mr. Haultain or Mr. Bulyea who has de<lb break="no"/>serted the position of the Territories ? 
     <lb/>
     If, as alleged, Mr. Bulyea declined to sign 
     <lb/>
     that letter, I think Mr. Bulyea was simply 
     <lb/>
     performing his duty. He declined to turn 
     <lb/>
     from the position that the people of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories had taken on that matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for North Toronto, too, 
     <lb/>
     stated something in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     question that had been asked by Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain in regard to schools at the time of the 
     <lb/>
     last general election and the answer given 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for Brandon (Mr. Sif<lb break="no"/>ton). That is perfectly true. He went on 
     <lb/>
     to say that a question was put to all the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal candidates in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories as to what their action was going to 
     <lb/>
     be in regard to schools if they were re<lb break="no"/>turned to parliament and that they told the 
     <lb/>
     people that they must trust to the govern<lb break="no"/>
          

            <pb n="3629" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3629.jpg"/>

     ment. If the hon. member for North To<lb break="no"/>ronto were here, I would put the question 
     <lb/>
     to him—perhaps the hon. member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey (Mr. Sproule) can answer it—what 
     <lb/>
     basis is there beyond their imagination for 
     <lb/>
     such an assertion as that?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. What assertion ?

     <lb/>
     of schools and that their answer was: You 
     <lb/>
     must trust to the government. I make this 
     <lb/>
     statement here, that beyond the question 
     <lb/>
     that was put by Mr. Haultain in Regina 
     <lb/>
     to the then Minister of the Interior, who 
     <lb/>
     was going to Regina a week later, I never 
     <lb/>
     heard the question mentioned in the whole 
     <lb/>
     of my campaign. The question was never 
     <lb/>
     put to me ; I never gave an answer in 
     <lb/>
     regard to this question. Everybody knew 
     <lb/>
     that the Northwest Territories were to be 
     <lb/>
     granted autonomy very early in the new 
     <lb/>
     parliament and no Roman Catholic or Pro<lb break="no"/>testant ever came to me privately or ever 
     <lb/>
     put the question at a public meeting or 
     <lb/>
     asked me in any way, prior to the 3rd 
     <lb/>
     November, what my action would be in that 
     <lb/>
     regard. This is further proof of the most 
     <lb/>
     convincing nature, if any were needed be<lb break="no"/>yond what I have already given to the 
     <lb/>
     House, that the Northwest Territories were 
     <lb/>
     not asking for any more freedom in regard 
     <lb/>
     to schools than that which they have en<lb break="no"/>joyed for the last 14 years. The hour is 
     <lb/>
     late— 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Go on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Some hon. gentlemen ap<lb break="no"/>pear to be very much concerned about the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of the new section 16, about the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of the Bills as they at present 
     <lb/>
     stand. The hon. member for Calgary (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy), the other evening, expressed 
     <lb/>
     what he considered a doubt about it and 
     <lb/>
     this doubt was repeated last night by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake). 
     <lb/>
     They are doubtful whether any change has 
     <lb/>
     been made in the Bills. I am not very much 
     <lb/>
     concerned with the meaning of the original 
     <lb/>
     section 16, because we are not dealing with 
     <lb/>
     that. But, of course, we are very much 
     <lb/>
     concerned with the meaning of the Bills in 
     <lb/>
     the shape in which they are going to be 
     <lb/>
     adopted, we hope. I would ask the House 
     <lb/>
     just for a moment to try and wipe away 
     <lb/>
     some of the technical and constitutional rub<lb break="no"/>bish with which some hon. members seek 
     <lb/>
     to confuse our minds. The main question 
     <lb/>
     as presented by the original section 16 had 
     <lb/>
     reference to the provision for the distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of the money to all classes of schools. 
     <lb/>
     In the first place the right was given to 
     <lb/>
     minorities to establish separate schools and 
     <lb/>
     in the next place it was provided that an 
     <lb/>
     equitable division of the funds should be 
     <lb/>
     granted to them. There was no connecting 
     <lb/>
     link, so it appeared to us, which would keep 
     <lb/>
     the separate schools under state control as 


            <cb/>
   

     they are at the present time. The new 
     <lb/>
     section 16 simply validates and keeps in 
     <lb/>
     effect ordinances Nos. 29 and 30 of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories passed in 1901. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Calgary advanced the 
     <lb/>
     contention that these ordinances which, 
     <lb/>
     when they were of questionable validity, 
     <lb/>
     as some men think, yet did undoubtedly 
     <lb/>
     effect the total abolition of the church or 
     <lb/>
     religious school, will by the process of 
     <lb/>
     acquiring unquestioned validity effect the 
     <lb/>
     restoration of the ecclesiastical school. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that the proposition only needs 
     <lb/>
     to be stated clearly to constitute its own 
     <lb/>
     answer. The right to separate schools is 
     <lb/>
     very clearly laid down in section 41 of ordin<lb break="no"/>ance No. 29, as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     <lb/>
     in such case the ratepayers establishing such 
     <lb/>
     Protestant or Roman Catholic separate school 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     I believe this is the exact language im<lb break="no"/>ported from section 14 of the old Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories Act. But that is governed in 
     <lb/>
     the ordinance by section 4, which says :

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     <lb/>
     and if that were not sufficient we also have 
     <lb/>
     section 45 which states :

            <p>
     It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that if we 
     <lb/>
     just keep our minds free from being con<lb break="no"/>fused by technicalities, keep our minds on 
     <lb/>
     the point which is as to whether or not we 
     <lb/>
     are to have a separate school controlled by 
     <lb/>
     the church or a separate school controlled 
     <lb/>
     by the state, there is no liability of any 
     <lb/>
     conflict of opinion about the legislation which 
     <lb/>
     the government asks the House to adopt. 
     <lb/>
     I am not going to take the time to read 
     <lb/>
     the various regulations in these ordinances, 
     <lb/>
     they have already been placed in ' Hansard,' 
     <lb/>
     but I say that there is in them no limita<lb break="no"/>tion of power to control, vary, improve or 
     <lb/>
     do anything in relation to the mana<lb break="no"/>gement of schools, all the schools, the 
     <lb/>
     separate school and the public school, 
     <lb/>
     except that the province must by le<lb break="no"/>gislation provide for public schools and per<lb break="no"/>mit minorities to have separate schools, both 
     <lb/>
    of which, conducted in the same way and 
 

            <pb n="3631" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-31_Page_3631.jpg"/>

     yielding the same results, must receive the 
     <lb/>
     same public aid. This is the minority right 
     <lb/>
     which is enjoyed in the NorthWest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies at the present moment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To me this is not so much a constitutional 
     <lb/>
     as a practical question. What is the best 
     <lb/>
     thing for parliament to do in the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the people who live in those Territories ? 
     <lb/>
     I may say that the legislation is no com<lb break="no"/>promise for me as it was for the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brandon (Mr. Sifton). It is exactly 
     <lb/>
     what I wanted, I would not care to assent 
     <lb/>
     to anything else. it is just what the North<lb break="no"/>west wanted, it is in fact, stated a little 
     <lb/>
     less clearly in his Bill, just what Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain asked for in his draft Bill. It is just 
     <lb/>
     what the Northwest people voted for in 
     <lb/>
     the general election of 1902 and what the 
     <lb/>
     assembly more than once unanimously voted 
     <lb/>
     for, or thought they were voting for. I 
     <lb/>
       would ask again if the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey (Mr. Sproule) has ever heard a 
     <lb/>
     protest from any one in the Territories 
     <lb/>
     against the condition of things existing 
     <lb/>
     there. I say there is no objection so far as 
     <lb/>
     I have ever heard. There are I think in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories 11 separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     Line Roman Catholic and two Protestant. 
     <lb/>
     One of them is at Edmonton, and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) has al<lb break="no"/>ready spoken ; I venture to say he has not 
     <lb/>
     heard in the town of Edmonton any protest 
     <lb/>
     from anybody against the existence of that 
     <lb/>
     separate school there. Another one is at 
     <lb/>
     Mrathcona and another at Wetaskiwin and 
     <lb/>
    the same remark will apply to my hon. 
     <lb/>friend for Strathcona (Mr. P. Talbot). The 
     <lb/>hon. member for Calgary (Mr. M. S. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) spoke the other day and he did not 
     <lb/>enter any protest against the separate 
     <lb/>school. There is one at Lethbridge and one 
     <lb/>at MacLeod. If the hon. member for Al<lb break="no"/>berta (Mr. Herron) is still here he may be 
     <lb/>able to say whether there is any protest 
     <lb/>in his district against the existence of 
     <lb/>the two separate schools in that district. 
     <lb/>There is another one at Regina and another 
     <lb/>one at or near Wapella. Speaking of the 
     <lb/>Regina separate school, I say that it is 
     <lb/>satisfactory to all the people in Regina 
     <lb/>and that any proposition to abolish the 
     <lb/>separate school in existence in Regina 
     <lb/>would be more unsatisfactory to the 
     <lb/>Protestants who live there than to the 
     <lb/>Roman - Catholics. I admit that there 
     <lb/>is some objection against the permission 
     <lb/>of separation in school matters. That is the 
     <lb/>only possible objection there can be to separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools in the west, the objection against 
     <lb/>separation, but in the practical operation 
     <lb/>in town school districts there is no practical 
     <lb/>objection, because, as in the case of Regina, 
     <lb/>the separate school takes the place of a 
     <lb/>ward school in the same way as it does 
     <lb/>in Nova Scotia, as I am informed. For in<lb break="no"/>stances, in towns in Nova Scotia there is 
     <lb/>one ward school set apart for Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholics. It is managed entirely 


            <cb/>
          

     by Roman Catholic trustees and at<lb break="no"/>tended entirely by Roman Catholic children. 
     <lb/>
     It is merely in effect the system we have 
     <lb/>
     in the Territories. The word 'coercion' 
     <lb/>
     used in this case is a deliberate at<lb break="no"/>tempt to deceive the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country. To speak of coercion in this 
     <lb/>
     matter is to distort the meaning of the 
     <lb/>
     word. You cannot find a protest in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories against existing con<lb break="no"/>ditions. You cannot find an advocate of 
     <lb/>
     any alteration in the separate school feature 
     <lb/>
     of the existing law. We will have the 
     <lb/>
     separate school whether you pass section 
     <lb/>
     16 or not. The most vehement denouncers of 
     <lb/>
     these Bills on the ground 0f provincial rights 
     <lb/>
     in the same breath proclaim their satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion with our separate school. The pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights cry in this case has no sub<lb break="no"/>stance. It is a cry: for a shadow and such 
     <lb/>
     a cry becomes ridiculous. I say as a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Liberal party that I protest 
     <lb/>
     against this attempt to bring ridicule on 
     <lb/>
     what is a good sound principle of the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party. Provincial rights with sub<lb break="no"/>stance is a principle worth fighting for, and 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal party has always fought for 
     <lb/>
     that principle when it was challenged. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. How is it that so many 
     <lb/>
     Liberals from the Territories have signed 
     <lb/>
     petitions to this House praying that the right 
     <lb/>
     be left to them to legislate with regard to 
     <lb/>
     schools ?   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Some or these people have 
     <lb/>
     signed under a misconception. There are peo» 
     <lb/>
     ple in the west, as (I shall prove to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend before I get through, who do not 
     <lb/>
     know that we have a separate school system 
     <lb/>
     and they signed petitions under the im<lb break="no"/>pression that this parliament was trying to 
     <lb/>
     introduce a separate school system. I ask 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend now to be candid about 
     <lb/>
     it. Would it not be simply and absolutely 
     <lb/>
     ridiculous for me coming from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories as I do to be crying for 
     <lb/>
     a right and demanding a power and in the 
     <lb/>
     same breath protesting that I would not 
     <lb/>
     exercise that power if I had it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Not at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. That is exactly the position 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain takes; he is crying for the 
     <lb/>
     power to deal with this matter and pro 
     <lb/>
     testing in the hearing of. the whole people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada that he would not exercise that 
     <lb/>
     power if he had it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is said that if the privileges of the 
     <lb/>
     minority are safe in the hands of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the west, we should leave this question 
     <lb/>
     for them to settle. That is the position of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Carleton (Mr. R. L. 
     <lb/>
     Borden). He says: Leave it to the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial legislatures and trust to the justice 
     <lb/>
     of the people of the province. That question 
     <lb/>
     cannot be put to me. I am not one of the 
     <lb/>
     minority who are chiefly concerned; I am

     a member of the majority. The question 
     <lb/>
     must be put to the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     minority in this House. I presume that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
     <lb/>
     is to-night representing the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Carleton (Mr. R. L. Borden), and I would 
     <lb/>
     ask, when the leader of the Opposition put 
     <lb/>
     the question to the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     minority who sit with him in this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment how many of them expressed their 
     <lb/>
     willingness to have the guarantee left out 
     <lb/>
     and to leave the matter to the justice of the 
     <lb/>
     majority. It is not for me as a member of 
     <lb/>
     the majority to answer this question, it is 
     <lb/>
     not to the majority, it is to the members 
     <lb/>
     of the minority that that question is put. 
     <lb/>
     If they say they are willing I would say 
     <lb/>
     that possibly we might consent to leave 
     <lb/>
     out the guarantee, although as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     fact I prefer to have the guarantee left in 
     <lb/>
     this shape so that there will be no uncer<lb break="no"/>tainty in these provinces. Can we blame 
     <lb/>
     the members of the minority after all when 
     <lb/>
     we look at the history of Manitoba and the 
     <lb/>
     Territories ? We have cut the minority pri<lb break="no"/>vilege down there from what it was origin<lb break="no"/>ally interpreted to mean. It was origin<lb break="no"/>ally interpreted by the legislature of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories, the old Northwest council, to 
     <lb/>
     mean that there should be church control for 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic schools. We have cut that 
     <lb/>
     down. We all know what occurred in Man<lb break="no"/>itoba and what occurred in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     French language. As soon as the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     legislature obtained the power to deal with 
     <lb/>
     it, it abolished the dual system, and I say as 
     <lb/>
     a representative of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories that it did the only reasonable thing. 
     <lb/>
     It would have been absurd in that country 
     <lb/>
     to have continued the official publication of 
     <lb/>
     all laws and court records in French, be<lb break="no"/>cause not one out of 500 of those who could 
     <lb/>
     read laws at all could not read them in 
     <lb/>
     English. I say looking at the history of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and the Northwest, that if I was 
     <lb/>
    a member of the minority I would not con<lb break="no"/>sent to have the guarantee cut out, because 
     <lb/>I would fear that the time would come, and 
     <lb/>that not in the very far future, when the 
     <lb/>final vestige of the separate school would 
     <lb/>disappear.

     comes under the same government as the

     public school. Its teachers have to be cer<lb break="no"/>tificated in the same way, with the same 
     <lb/>
     qualifications and the same normal school 
     <lb/>
     training. It has the same text books and 
     <lb/>
     has to produce the same results to earn the 
     <lb/>
     same money grants.

     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. What is the difference

     between the two schools then ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Not any difference, only the 
     <lb/>
     one I have mentioned.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. It is certainly a separate 
     <lb/>
     school, though it is not a religious school. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. It may be in a differ<lb break="no"/>ent building. but it is the same school. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. It is the same class of 
     <lb/>
     school. When our friends of the minority 
     <lb/>
     decline, as, in my judgment, they have good 
     <lb/>
     reason to decline, looking at the history of 
     <lb/>
     the school question in the Northwest, to 
     <lb/>
     have the guarantee cut out of the Bill, then 
     <lb/>
     it is reasonable for me as a member of the 
     <lb/>
     majority, in view of the fact that it is not 
     <lb/>
     going to violate any principle of sound 
     <lb/>
     public policy, to leave the guarantee in. 
     <lb/>
     Indeed, as I have explained, I prefer to 
     <lb/>
     have the guarantee left in in this shape, 
     <lb/>
     and, so far as the educational provisions are 
     <lb/>
     concerned, I vote for these Bills without 
     <lb/>
     any hesitation. This is exactly the pro<lb break="no"/>position I want, for the following reasons :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     1. It removes all uncertainty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. It respects the minority conscience 
     <lb/>
     without violating any sound public principle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. It provides securely against agitation 
     <lb/>
     in future. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. It perpetuates a system which has in 
     <lb/>
     practice proved to be eminently satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     to all classes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     5. It means coercion in no sense or adap<lb break="no"/>tation of the word, because it merely guar<lb break="no"/>antees what would be continued by the al<lb break="no"/>most universal will of the provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     6. It continues a system preferable in its 
     <lb/>
     practical working out to the public school 
     <lb/>
     system of Manitoba, where the minority 
     <lb/>
     have a theoretical grievance, which interest<lb break="no"/>ed parties are constantly able to exaggerate, 
     <lb/>
     and who continue to chafe under what 
     <lb/>
     they believe to be an infringement on their 
     <lb/>
     rights. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     7. It furnishes a possible common ground 
     <lb/>
     of action by the members of this House, and 
     <lb/>
     thus maintains unity. No common action 
     <lb/>
     was possible either upon the original section 
     <lb/>
     16 or upon the amendment of the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     8. More than all, it is satisfactory to me 
     <lb/>
     as a citizen of, and one of the majority in, 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest, because it not only reason<lb break="no"/>ably secures minority rights, but it absolute<lb break="no"/>ly secures majority rights against such in<lb break="no"/>vasion as was attempted by parliament in 
     <lb/>
     1896 in the case of Manitoba. It is the only 
     <lb/>
     absolute guarantee of educational autonomy 
     <lb/>
     contained in any suggestion made to this 
     <lb/>
     House, excepting only that of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brandon (Mr. Sifton), to specifical<lb break="no"/>ly make the provinces free and get imperial 
     <lb/>
     ratification of the free charters. Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain's draft Bill left the door specifically

     being a partisan all along the line—in fact, 
     <lb/>
     down to the time of the last general election 
     <lb/>
     in October, 1904—had no intention, as no<lb break="no"/>body connected with the public affairs of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest had any intention, of asking 
     <lb/>

     the hon. member for Western Assiniboia

            <p><persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. As I have already stated,

     <lb/>before the Bill was presented to the House, 
     <lb/>to mention the subject of education, but 
     <lb/>neglected during all the discussions that 
     <lb/>took place on the subject of autonomy in

     <lb/>the subject of education. He pointed out 
     <lb/>the advantages that autonomy would give, 
     <lb/>and the changes it would mean, but never 
     <lb/>once referred to the matter of schools. I 
     <lb/>will read to my hon. friend the description

     Take all the speeches that were ever

     in the Territories, for that matter, and there

     never was any reference to the question of

     of any person a desire for more freedom in

     that, when the cue was given by Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain last fall, in the heat of the election,

     there would not have been some one to pre<lb break="no"/>sent the matter to the candidates, and to

     (Mr. Sproule) say that I had thirty-nine 
     <lb/>
     meetings in my constituency last fall. At 
     <lb/>
     every one of these there was an able lawyer 
     <lb/>
     representing the Conservative candidate. At 
     <lb/>
     every one the question of autonomy was dis<lb break="no"/>cussed, and I was never asked at any one of 
     <lb/>
     them by anybody, Liberal, Conservative, 
     <lb/>
     Catholic or Protestant, one word about the 
     <lb/>
     school question in any shape or form. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Will the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     excuse me just one moment ? I want to 
     <lb/>
     settle a question of fact. We are told that 
     <lb/>
     there is absolutely no difference between the 
     <lb/>
     conduct of the minority schools and the 
     <lb/>
     majority schools. We are told that the 
     <lb/>
     qualifications of teachers are the same, the 
     <lb/>
     inspection, the curriculum, the text books, 
     <lb/>
     and that the only difference is the last half 
     <lb/>
     hour in the day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. There is not even any dif<lb break="no"/>ference then ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Well, here is the annual 
     <lb/>
     report of the Department of Education of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories for 1903. What 
     <lb/>
     does it say with reference to the readers :

     the point is essential ? If he will study the 
     <lb/>
     effect of the legislation we are passing, he 
     <lb/>
     will find that we are giving the provinces 
     <lb/>
     full autonomy in the matter of those very

     text books.

     statement that the schools both of the 
     <lb/>
     minority and the majority are conducted 
     <lb/>
     exactly the same in every respect with the 
     <lb/>
     exception of the last half hour.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I was about to make a sort 
     <lb/>
     of confession to my hon. friend. I would 
     <lb/>
     have had no objection at all to stating my 
     <lb/>
     views during the election regarding what 
     <lb/>
     would be the proper action for the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     parliament to take on the school question. 
     <lb/>
     I will give my hon. friend the proof of this. 
     <lb/>
     Two years ago his leader put on the order 
     <lb/>
     paper a motion with regard to autonomy, 
     <lb/>
     concerning which I prepared some notes. 
     <lb/>
     The debate came on very late. I spoke on 
     <lb/>
     the question after midnight and did not use 
     <lb/>
     all of my notes. In the next session of 1904, 
     <lb/>
     I expected the leader of the opposition to 
     <lb/>
     again raise that question and I amplified my 
     <lb/>
     notes. The question never did come up ; 
     <lb/>
     but if it had. I have here exactly what I in<lb break="no"/>tended to say and I shall read a portion of 
     <lb/>
     it for the benefit of my hon. friend :

     <lb/>
     in Manitoba lack the guarantee of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, while in the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     they possess the right. Practically the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories system is just as satisfactory

     The difference my hon. friend alludes to

     is so slight that it is generally not con<lb break="no"/>sidered worth referring to. There is a dif<lb break="no"/>ference in the authorized text books used 
     <lb/>
     in the first two standards, but we are giving 
     <lb/>
     the provinces full autonomy to deal with this

     question of text books themselves.

     did not intend and Mr. Haultain's draft Bill

     did not contemplate any change with regard 
     <lb/>
     to schools. I had Dr. Goggin's interview 
     <lb/>
     given two years ago, a portion of which I 
     <lb/>
     have read, in which he said that he had not

     seen any declaration by the legislature or

     the premier that they intended to ask for 
     <lb/>
     any change with regard to schools. The

     interview is a very considerable one and I

     Doubtless there are extremists on both sides

     school question when autonomy is dealt with,

     to-morrow thy would retain the present school

     system which permits the minority to have

     their separate schools. In Regina, where I live, 
     <lb/>
     we have excellent public schools and we have 
     <lb/>
     also an excellent separate school, and I verily 
     <lb/>
     believe that any step taken to abolish that sep<lb break="no"/>arate school would find its most active and re<lb break="no"/>solute opposition amongst members of the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant majority.

     That was typewritten some time in June 
     <lb/>
     or July last, and it was really amplified from 
     <lb/>
     notes made nearly two years ago. If the 
     <lb/>
     question had ever come up, I should have 
     <lb/>
     had no hesitation at all—and this is the 
     <lb/>
     truth—in expressing my opinion on the sep<lb break="no"/>arate school matter prior to the election 
     <lb/>
     that was supposed to be impending, or in 
     <lb/>
     the campaign for that matter, just as I am 
     <lb/>
     expressing it here to-night. I consider the 
     <lb/>
     proposition before the House is better for 
     <lb/>
     these provinces than any other suggestion 
     <lb/>
     that has been made. The proposition of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Carleton (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
     <lb/>
    to permit the application of section 93 of the 
     <lb/>British North America Act, even if his inter<lb break="no"/>
  

            <cb/>
 
pretation were correct—which other able 
     <lb/>lawyers deny—and 1870 was the time of 
     <lb/>union for the purposes of interpretation, 
     <lb/>would leave the provinces subject to the 
     <lb/>cast-iron rock-ribbed, irrevocable—as the 
     <lb/>hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) 
     <lb/>said—system of church and ecclesiastical 
     <lb/>schools which this Dominion parliament, by 
     <lb/>a majority of eighteen, at the instance 
     <lb/>of hon. gentlemen opposite, endeavoured 
     <lb/>to force upon the people of Manitoba in 1896. 
     <lb/>Who can guarantee that a similar juncture 
     <lb/>is impossible at some time in the future, 
     <lb/>when parliament, regardless of the senti<lb break="no"/>ment of the people, may be cajoled and 
     <lb/>coerced, by threats, by intimidation, by any 
     <lb/>of the devices known to unscrupulous politi<lb break="no"/>cal leaders—by the same means that the 
     <lb/>hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
     <lb/>knows better than any of us were used in 
     <lb/>1896, parliament might be induced to at<lb break="no"/>tempt to invade the autonomy of these new 
     <lb/>provinces. The hon. member for East Grey 
     <lb/>knows that if the remedial legislation of 
     <lb/>1896 had been enacted there was no power 
     <lb/>111 the Dominion of Canada that could have 
     <lb/>repealed it. I find that this Bill not only 
     <lb/>protects minority rights to a perfectly justi<lb break="no"/>fiable extent without coercion or invasion 
     <lb/>of substantial provincial autonomy, but it 
     <lb/>is also intended to protect the majority 
     <lb/>rights in the way I have described. It em<lb break="no"/>bodies a charter, secure and safe against 
     <lb/>the possibility of a later invasion of the po<lb break="no"/>litical autonomy of the provinces, which 
     <lb/>the application of section 93 as intended by 
     <lb/>Mr. Borden's amendment would leave room 
     <lb/>and invitation for ; and this Bill is a far 
     <lb/>more complete and secure measure of au<lb break="no"/>tonomy than is the proposition of the leader 
     <lb/>of the opposition.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, since the opening of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent session this House has lost one of its<lb/>valuable and prominent members, the late<lb/>hon. member for Centre Toronto, Mr. E. F.<lb/>Clarke. He was prominent not only in<lb/>this House but in the organization of which <lb/>the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule)<lb/>is an ornament. Amongst all classes of peo<lb break="no"/>ple and in this parliament he was recog<lb break="no"/>nized as a very broad-minded man. It is<lb/>fortunate, perhaps, that he has left his<lb/>opinion with regard to this very subject.<lb/>In his newspaper the 'Orange Sentinel' of<lb/>which he was the editor for many years<lb/>is the following statement, published in the<lb/>issue of February 9 : <lb/>

     It is not certain whether the people or. the

     object to having separate schools fastened upon 
     <lb/>

     protest against such a course, although it has

     been known for two years or more that the 
     <lb/>
     change was imminent. This makes it 
     <lb/>
     appear that the people interested are satis<lb break="no"/>fied. If that is the case, there is nothing for 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces to do but to acquiesce with

     <lb/>
     province should not be coerced into establish<lb break="no"/>ing separate schools, it follows that it should

     not be coerced into rejecting separate schools.

     Consequently the logical position for Ontario

     <lb/>
     of the people principally concerned and their 
     <lb/>
     representatives in parliament. The provisions 
     <lb/>
     affecting the school question are now so framed 
     <lb/>
     as to maintain in the west the same system 
     <lb/>
     which has been in vogue in the past and under 
     <lb/>
     the conditions of which educational matters 
     <lb/>
     were conducted mcst harmoniously. The 
     <lb/>
     amended clauses have already met with the 
     <lb/>
     endorsation of the leading papers in the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, including the Calgary 'Herald' and 
     <lb/>
     others which were greatly concerned as to the 
     <lb/>
     effect which would be the outcome of the 
     <lb/>
     clause as originally presented.

     A few journalistic firebrands in Ontario are

     fate of the new northwestern provinces. We

     One of the most distracted of these gentle<lb break="no"/>men is J. S. Willison, who moulds public opin<lb break="no"/>ion down east through the medium of the To<lb break="no"/>ronto ' News.' Prior to January 25 last, he was 
     <lb/>
     engaged in a long and most strenuous effort to 
     <lb/>
     oust Mr. Ross &amp; Co., and with the incidental 
     <lb/>
     assistance of tens upon tens of thousands of in<lb break="no"/>telligent voters he won a victory over his foes 
     <lb/>
     somewhat in the style in which Bill Adams put 
     <lb/>
     Napoleon to flight at Waterloo. The 'News' 
     <lb/>
     had then a just and sensible cause to advocate 
     <lb/>
     and success is as easy under such circumstances 
     <lb/>
     as taking candy from a child.

            <p>

     affects people two thousand miles from the

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     First let me say that the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     Autonomy Bill were better than I expected from 
     <lb/>
     a financial standpoint. I must express my 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction with the terms secured by the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest. The result is all that could have 
     <lb/>
     been expected. As regards the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses, I am prepared to accept the old law. 
     <lb/>
     I am not competent to judge of how far the pro<lb break="no"/>posed clauses exceed the clauses in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories Act, but where they do I be<lb break="no"/>lieve Sifton and others are justified in opposing 
     <lb/>
     them. But I prefer that this question as an 
     <lb/>
     issue be removed from the provincial field. So 
     <lb/>
     long as the assembly retains control and en<lb break="no"/>forces uniformity of teachers' qualifications, 
     <lb/>
     books, curricula and inspection, we have nothing 
     <lb/>
     to dread from the 'narrow and illiterate' 
     <lb/>
     separate school products. In fact I feel that 
     <lb/>
     we lose sight of our main privilege that we may 
     <lb/>
     always, when we so desire, act in unity and 
     <lb/>
     harmony with our Catholic neighbours, and my 
     <lb/>
     experience with the Catholic laity is that they 
     <lb/>
     will meet us half way.

     I cannot but commend the unselfish interest of 
     <lb/>
     the Toronto ' News,' Sam. Hughes and others in 
     <lb/>
     our education. As for the position taken by 
     <lb/>
     Sifton, I hope he is prepared to agree to the 
     <lb/>
     re-enactment of the old law. I could not fol<lb break="no"/>low him further than that. I do not think there 
     <lb/>
     would be any difficulty in justifying before the 
     <lb/>
     electorate an adherence to the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories Act. To so many of us the matter does 
     <lb/>
     not appeal, as the Catholic population in most 
     <lb/>
     settlements is so small as to have no power ; 
     <lb/>
     in other settlements so largely in the majority 
     <lb/>
     that the question is unimportant. In no case 
     <lb/>
     have I known of a duplication of schools when 
     <lb/>
     not required. Considered on its merits from a 
     <lb/>
     practical view-point and leaving sentiment 
     <lb/>
     aside the question is unimportant so long as 
     <lb/>
     uniformity is maintained in the course of 
     <lb/>
     studies and general efficiency.

     here.  .    .    . If you have time I want you to 
     <lb/>
     answer and let me know in brief the real mean<lb break="no"/>ing of the situation in this separate school 
     <lb/>
     matter.

     I believe that expression represents the 
     <lb/>
     views of most of the people who have been 
     <lb/>
     signing these protests and petitions. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that practically everybody in the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, ninety-nine people out of a hun<lb break="no"/>dred, would prefer to have these schools 
     <lb/>
     continued in the same way as they have 
     <lb/>
     been carried on for the last fourteen years.

     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. In reply to that state<lb break="no"/>ment, may I ask the hon. gentleman this 
     <lb/>
     question : I understood him to say that 
     <lb/>
     these people were directing their attention 
     <lb/>
     to the original clause 16 and were not aware 
     <lb/>
     of the modification, or otherwise they would 
     <lb/>
     be satisfied. Is it not a fact that most of 
     <lb/>
     the petitions only expressed the hope that 
     <lb/>
     the government would not, by any enact<lb break="no"/>ment or otherwise interfere with the free<lb break="no"/>dom of the provinces in legislating in re<lb break="no"/>gard to education ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I venture to say that every 
     <lb/>
     one of these petitions originated in Ontario. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That is about as nearly 
     <lb/>
     correct as the other statement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I venture to state again 
     <lb/>
     that most of the people who signed these 
     <lb/>
     petitions will later on express themselves as 
     <lb/>
     entirely satisfied with the school constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. I say again that the proposition in 
     <lb/>
     the Bills is not a compromise to me at all. 
     <lb/>
     It is purely and exactly what I myself, and 
     <lb/>
     I believe the majority of the members from 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories, wanted placed 
     <lb/>
     in the Bills. We have in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories in this very delicate and difficult 
     <lb/>
     matter of religion in connection with edu<lb break="no"/>cation reached a solution which has been 
     <lb/>
     in effect for fourteen years, which has no 
     <lb/>
     superior in any province of Canada, not ex<lb break="no"/>cluding the province of Manitoba, not exclud<lb break="no"/>ing the province of Nova Scotia or any 
     <lb/>
     other province. We have the most satis<lb break="no"/>factory solution of this difficult subject that 
     <lb/>
     is to be found anywhere in Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     why should we take away the advantages

     of that solution from the people in the initi<lb break="no"/>ation of these new provinces ? Why should 
     <lb/>
     we endanger the future prosperity of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces by subjecting them to the possi<lb break="no"/>bility of an agitation over this difficult and 
     <lb/>
     delicate matter ? The proposition which is 
     <lb/>
     contained in these Bills is the most success<lb break="no"/>ful and satisfactory proposition that could 
     <lb/>
     be devised in respect to this subject. Yet 
     <lb/>
     there can be no doubt about the disturbed 
     <lb/>
     state of feeling existing in various other 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country—a disturbance fraught 
     <lb/>
     with exceeding danger. There are two men 
     <lb/>
     in this country who could in a day settle 
     <lb/>
     all further difficulty in this matter. There 
     <lb/>
     is practically a unanimity of opinion on 
     <lb/>
     this side of the House and amongst all 
     <lb/>
     Liberals throughout Canada on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. There are two men who could in a 
     <lb/>
     day take all possible further danger out of 
     <lb/>
     this question. These two men are Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain, who, notwithstanding the fact that he 
     <lb/>
     lacks the constitutional position to enable 
     <lb/>
     him to represent the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
     is still bound to be held by a great many 
     <lb/>
     people as being in a sense the representa<lb break="no"/>tive of the Territories in this matter. If 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain and the hon. leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position together could bring themselves to 
     <lb/>
     the plane that was adopted by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) in 
     <lb/>
     this House, entirely above party politics and 
     <lb/>
     take a patriotic stand, I say that we would 
     <lb/>
     come to a satisfactory settlement in regard 
     <lb/>
     to this question in a day or a week, and that 
     <lb/>
     we would hear no more about this difficulty 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the Northwest Autonomy 
     <lb/>
     Bills. If the hon. member for North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     were here, I would like to quote to him 
     <lb/>
     some very admirable words to which he 
     <lb/>
     gave voice in 1896 : 
     <lb/>

     The hon. member for North Toronto made 
     <lb/>
     a very excellent speech in 1896, which would 
     <lb/>
     apply with far greater and more proper 
     <lb/>
     force to the present situation than it did to 
     <lb/>
     the suggested legislation of that time ; and 
     <lb/>
     if he were here, I would say to him that I 
     <lb/>
     think that if ten years from this he reads 
     <lb/>
     both of these speeches—the speech of 1896 
     <lb/>
     and the speech of 1905—he will be far 
     <lb/>
     prouder of his 1896 speech than he will be 
     <lb/>
     of the speech which he delivered two days 
     <lb/>
     ago in this House.

     I repeat, in conclusion, that I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with the propositions contained in 
     <lb/>
     these Bills and that they are the most im<lb break="no"/>portant that ever have been presented to 
     <lb/>
     this parliament nobody disputes. I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that they will result not only in 
     <lb/>
     the immediate future, but in the inter<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>


     mediate future as well as in the far future, 
     <lb/>in the existence of two provinces in no<lb/>sense inferior to, in every way equal with,<lb/>their sister provinces-enjoying absolute<lb/>religious equality, full provincial rights, an<lb/>efficient free public or common, non-sec<lb break="no"/>tarian school system controlled by the state<lb/>and on a plan guaranteeing the perfect<lb/>autonomy of every conscience and scruple<lb/>-in a word, enjoying freedom in every<lb/>resonable and British sense of the <lb/>term ;-and that the provisions of these<lb/>Bills will enable the people of these<lb/>new provinces to carry on their great work<lb/>and fulfil the duties that fall upon them as<lb/>self-governing provinces in this Dominion<lb/>with every measure of success. When I re<lb break="no"/>member that this government and this par<lb break="no"/>liament are undertaking, in addition to the <lb/>generous terms which I have already de<lb break="no"/>scribed, to bear the cost of the lands ad<lb break="no"/>ministration, that they are undertaking to<lb/>continue the free homesteading policy, that <lb/>they are undertaking to continue to main<lb break="no"/>tain an active immigration policy, that they<lb/>are undertaking to continue the Northwest<lb/>Mounted Police in that country for some<lb/>time and that they are aiding and continu<lb break="no"/>ing to aid great railway projects in these <lb/>new provinces, I say, and I am sure that<lb/>in so saying I voice the sentiment of the <lb/>Northwest people, that these measures are<lb/>based upon those principles of justice, equ<lb break="no"/>ality and above these, generosity, the ob<lb break="no"/>servance of which in his whole public life<lb/>has contributed to the position which my<lb/>right hon. friend the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment holds in the confidence and affection<lb/>of the people of Canada.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I trust, that, notwithstanding the threats<lb/>that were made this afternoon across the<lb/>floor of the House, the 1st of July next,<lb/>the 38th anniversary of the birth of con<lb break="no"/>federation, will witness the admission of<lb/>these twin provinces into full sisterhood<lb/>of the provincial communion to continue<lb/>in a path of development already well start<lb break="no"/>ed and which each and every one of us<lb/>may hope will lead as the years go by to <lb/>greater and greater magnitude and perfec<lb break="no"/>tion-helping to make in still more pro<lb break="no"/>nounced degree this fair Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada the proudest gem in the great galaxy<lb/>of nations forming the British Empire.<lb/>
