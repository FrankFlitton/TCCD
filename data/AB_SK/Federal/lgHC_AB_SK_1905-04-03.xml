            <!--<p>
     of that solution from the people in the initi<lb break="no"/>ation of these new provinces ? Why should 
     <lb/>
     we endanger the future prosperity of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces by subjecting them to the possi<lb break="no"/>bility of an agitation over this difficult and 
     <lb/>
     delicate matter ? The proposition which is 
     <lb/>
     contained in these Bills is the most success<lb break="no"/>ful and satisfactory proposition that could 
     <lb/>
     be devised in respect to this subject. Yet 
     <lb/>
     there can be no doubt about the disturbed 
     <lb/>
     state of feeling existing in various other 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country—a disturbance fraught 
     <lb/>
     with exceeding danger. There are two men 
     <lb/>
     in this country who could in a day settle 
     <lb/>
     all further difficulty in this matter. There 
     <lb/>
     is practically a unanimity of opinion on 
     <lb/>
     this side of the House and amongst all 
     <lb/>
     Liberals throughout Canada on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. There are two men who could in a 
     <lb/>
     day take all possible further danger out of 
     <lb/>
     this question. These two men are Mr. Haul- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     tain, who, notwithstanding the fact that he 
     <lb/>
     lacks the constitutional position to enable 
     <lb/>
     him to represent the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
     is still bound to be held by a great many 
     <lb/>
     people as being in a sense the representa<lb break="no"/>tive of the Territories in this matter. If 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain and the hon. leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position together could bring themselves to 
     <lb/>
     the plane that was adopted by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) in 
     <lb/>
     this House, entirely above party politics and 
     <lb/>
     take a patriotic stand, I say that we would 
     <lb/>
     come to a satisfactory settlement in regard 
     <lb/>
     to this question in a day or a week, and that 
     <lb/>
     we would hear no more about this difficulty 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the Northwest Autonomy 
     <lb/>
     Bills. If the hon. member for North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     were here, I would like to quote to him 
     <lb/>
     some very admirable words to which he 
     <lb/>
     gave voice in 1896 : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Let us plant our feet in the firm path of 
     <lb/>
     constitutional compact and agreement, of good 
     <lb/>
     faith, and of honest, fair dealing. Let us take 
     <lb/>
     and pass on that gleaming torch of prudent 
     <lb/>
     compromise under whose kindly light the fa<lb break="no"/>thers of the confederation marched safely 
     <lb/>
     through in times far more troublous and far 
     <lb/>
     less advanced than ours, into an era of har<lb break="no"/>mony and continued peace. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The hon. member for North Toronto made 
     <lb/>
     a very excellent speech in 1896, which would 
     <lb/>
     apply with far greater and more proper 
     <lb/>
     force to the present situation than it did to 
     <lb/>
     the suggested legislation of that time ; and 
     <lb/>
     if he were here, I would say to him that I 
     <lb/>
     think that if ten years from this he reads 
     <lb/>
     both of these speeches—the speech of 1896 
     <lb/>
     and the speech of 1905—he will be far 
     <lb/>
     prouder of his 1896 speech than he will be 
     <lb/>
     of the speech which he delivered two days 
     <lb/>
     ago in this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I repeat, in conclusion, that I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with the propositions contained in 
     <lb/>
     these Bills and that they are the most im<lb break="no"/>portant that ever have been presented to 
     <lb/>
     this parliament nobody disputes. I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that they will result not only in 
     <lb/>
     the immediate future, but in the inter<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     mediate future as well as in the far future, 
     <lb/>in the existence of two provinces in no<lb/>sense inferior to, in every way equal with,<lb/>their sister provinces-enjoying absolute<lb/>religious equality, full provincial rights, an<lb/>efficient free public or common, non-sec-<lb break="maybe"/>tarian school system controlled by the state<lb/>and on a plan guaranteeing the perfect<lb/>autonomy of every conscience and scruple<lb/>-in a word, enjoying freedom in every<lb/>resonable and British sense of the <lb/>term ;-and that the provisions of these<lb/>Bills will enable the people of these<lb/>new provinces to carry on their great work<lb/>and fulfil the duties that fall upon them as<lb/>self-governing provinces in this Dominion<lb/>with every measure of success. When I re<lb break="no"/>member that this government and this par<lb break="no"/>liament are undertaking, in addition to the <lb/>generous terms which I have already de<lb break="no"/>scribed, to bear the cost of the lands ad<lb break="no"/>ministration, that they are undertaking to<lb/>continue the free homesteading policy, that <lb/>they are undertaking to continue to main<lb break="no"/>tain an active immigration policy, that they<lb/>are undertaking to continue the Northwest<lb/>Mounted Police in that country for some<lb/>time and that they are aiding and continu<lb break="no"/>ing to aid great railway projects in these <lb/>new provinces, I say, and I am sure that<lb/>in so saying I voice the sentiment of the <lb/>Northwest people, that these measures are<lb/>based upon those principles of justice, equ<lb break="no"/>ality and above these, generosity, the ob<lb break="no"/>servance of which in his whole public life<lb/>has contributed to the position which my<lb/>right hon. friend the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment holds in the confidence and affection<lb/>of the people of Canada.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I trust, that, notwithstanding the threats<lb/>that were made this afternoon across the<lb/>floor of the House, the 1st of July next,<lb/>the 38th anniversary of the birth of con<lb break="no"/>federation, will witness the admission of<lb/>these twin provinces into full sisterhood<lb/>of the provincial communion to continue<lb/>in a path of development already well start<lb break="no"/>ed and which each and every one of us<lb/>may hope will lead as the years go by to <lb/>greater and greater magnitude and perfec-<lb break="maybe"/>tion-helping to make in still more pro<lb break="no"/>nounced degree this fair Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada the proudest gem in the great galaxy<lb/>of nations forming the British Empire.<lb/>

     On the same date as the agreement with 
     <lb/>
     Power was entered into it was transferred 
     <lb/>
     to Messrs. Joseph Kilgour and Charles Mil<lb break="no"/>ler, of Toronto, and on the 2nd June a fur<lb break="no"/>ther agreement was drawn up and execut<lb break="no"/>ed by Kilgour and Miller.

     The contract stood in the name of Messrs.

     Kilgour and Miller until 30th September, 
     <lb/>
     1899, when it was assumed by the British

     <lb/>
     Joseph Kilgour is president and Charles Mil<lb break="no"/>ler, solicitor, under a new four year con<lb break="no"/>tract), by whom it has been carried on to

     Mr CHISHOLM—by Mr. Sam Hughes— 
     <lb/>
     asked : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     1. Referring to a statement made on the 27th 
     <lb/>
     of February last, by Honourable C. S. Hyman, 
     <lb/>
     on behalf of the Postmaster General, that there 
     <lb/>
     had been collected by assessment from the 
     <lb/>
     postmasters, mail clerks, and those handling 
     <lb/>
     the mails for the Dominion, the sum of $63,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     349.16, and that the losses so far as ascertained 
     <lb/>
     were $19,909.51, leaving a balance of profit of 
     <lb/>
     $45,992.68, how much of this loss of $19,909.51 
     <lb/>
     was caused by the postmasters alone ? and 
     <lb/>
     what is the amount of loss by said postmasters 
     <lb/>
     alone in each of the provinces of the Dominion ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. Is it the intention of the Post Office De<lb break="no"/>partment to continue this system of assess<lb break="no"/>ment ? If so, will they reduce the assessments 
     <lb/>
     to meet the requirements of the actual losses ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. Is the same assessment made on a post<lb break="no"/>master whose salary is $500 a year as on a 
     <lb/>
     postmaster whose salary is $1,500 a year ? If 
     <lb/>
     so, why ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Rt. Hon. Sir WILFRID LAURIER (for 
     <lb/>
     the Postmaster General) : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. Statement of losses by provinces on 
     <lb/>
     account of postmasters made good out of 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     2. Yes. The department's policy is to 
     <lb/>
     conduct the system on safe lines, and will 
     <lb/>
     increase or reduce the rate of assessment as 
     <lb/>
     experience appears to demand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. No. The amount of insurance is based 
     <lb/>
     upon the revenue of the office, not the 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     ' Every accounting postmaster, the rev<lb break="no"/>enue of whose office is under $2,000 a year, 
     <lb/>
     is required to give security to the extent of 
     <lb/>
     $800. Where the revenue exceeds $2,000 a

     year, but is less than $5,000, the insurance 
     <lb/>
     required is $1,200. Where it exceeds $5,-

     000. the insurance required is $2,000. Where 
     <lb/>
     it exceeds $15,000 but is less than $25,000, 
     <lb/>
     the insurance required is $2,500. Where 
     <lb/>
     the revenue exceeds $25,000, except in the 
     <lb/>
     cities of Montreal and Toronto, the insu<lb break="no"/>rance required is $3,000. In the case of the 
     <lb/>
     cities of Montreal and Toronto, the insu<lb break="no"/>rance required is $5,000. Each postmaster 
     <lb/>
     of a non-accounting post office is required 
     <lb/>
     to give $200 security, and if the estimated 
     <lb/>
     revenue of his office does not exceed $100 a 
     <lb/>
     year, it is optional with him to give bonds 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. W. J. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker. After hearing the very full dis<lb break="no"/>cussion on this Bill by members on both 
     <lb/>
     sides of the House ; a discussion from a 
     <lb/>
     constitutional standpoint, the standpoint 
     <lb/>
     of public policy and from the standpoint 
     <lb/>
     of political exigencies by some hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on the other side of the House, 
     <lb/>
     it is not with the idea that I can add 
     <lb/>
     anything of a very original character 
     <lb/>
     that I propose for a short time to con<lb break="no"/>tinue the debate. However, being a western 
     <lb/>
     man ; a resident of Manitoba for the past 
     <lb/>
     22 years, quite naturally I take a great in<lb break="no"/>terest in anything pertaining to the welfare 
     <lb/>
     of our great western heritage, and my ideas 
     <lb/>
     are not so provincial that I desire to limit 
     <lb/>
     that interest to matters mainly connected 
     <lb/>
     with the province of my adoption. In 
     <lb/>
     looking over the history of our country I 
     <lb/>
     think there are few of us but must admit, 
     <lb/>
     in the light of past experience, that there 
     <lb/>
     are some things that we might very well 
     <lb/>
     improve upon had we the drafting of our 
     <lb/>
     constitution anew. The great fathers of con<lb break="no"/>federation who in their united wisdom con<lb break="no"/>solidated into one mighty whole the numer<lb break="no"/>ous provinces of this splendid Dominion 
     <lb/>
     are deserving of every eulogium that can 
     <lb/>
     possibly be bestowed on them. They had 
     <lb/>
     many intricate and delicate questions to 
     <lb/>
     cope with, prejudices to overcome, rights 
     <lb/>
     and privileges to safeguard and protect,

     to them for the successful manner in which 
     <lb/>
     they accomplished their difficult task. But 
     <lb/>
     of what use is experience if you do not 
     <lb/>
     profit by it? And in the granting of a new 
     <lb/>
     constitution to these baby provinces in the 
     <lb/>
     west we should be careful to avoid the 
     <lb/>
     pitfalls of the past, to improve where im<lb break="no"/>provement is possible upon existing legis<lb break="no"/>lation and to start those new provinces 
     <lb/>
     unhampered in their career, by any obnox<lb break="no"/>ious restrictions that can be a source of 
     <lb/>
     vexation, turmoil and strife amongst the 
     <lb/>
     mixed population inhabiting that part of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion. Some of these people are 
     <lb/>
     our fellow Canadians from the older pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ; some are our fellow British sub<lb break="no"/>jects from England, Scotland and Ireland, 
     <lb/>
     some come from the more advanced Euro<lb break="no"/>pean races and many come from the repub<lb break="no"/>lic to the south. All these classes of settlers 
     <lb/>
     at any rate come from countries where they 
     <lb/>
     have been in the enjoyment of the greatest 
     <lb/>
     amount of constitutional liberty and they 
     <lb/>
     will look for and expect the same liberty 
     <lb/>
     in their new homes. We are therefore legis<lb break="no"/>lating at the present time not merely for 
     <lb/>
     existing conditions but for the whole future 
     <lb/>
     of that country. We can afford, nay it is 
     <lb/>
     our duty, it is an imperative duty that we 
     <lb/>
     should deal not only justly, but generously 
     <lb/>
     in starting these new provinces house<lb break="no"/>keeping on their own account. There may 
     <lb/>
     have been reasons of a financial character 
     <lb/>
     that prevented this Dominion from dealing 
     <lb/>
     with some of the other provinces, upon their 
     <lb/>
     entering into confederation, with equal gen<lb break="no"/>erosity, but because of that lack of liberty 
     <lb/>
     and generosity repeated demands have been 
     <lb/>
     made on the treasury of this country by 
     <lb/>
     those provinces and we should guard against 
     <lb/>
     anything of that kind in the initial dealings 
     <lb/>
     with these new provinces of the west. I 
     <lb/>
     am sure there is a desire on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     older settled provinces not only to accord 
     <lb/>
     the very best possible treatment of a finan<lb break="no"/>cial character, but to grant the greatest 
     <lb/>
     amount of constitutional liberty and legis<lb break="no"/>lative freedom in our dealings with these 
     <lb/>
     new provinces. The financial arrangements 
     <lb/>
     should not be entered into in any niggardly 
     <lb/>
     spirit nor should they be carped at be<lb break="no"/>cause they happen to be more generous 
     <lb/>
     than those accorded to the several provinces 
     <lb/>
     in which we each reside. Nor should this 
     <lb/>
     government deny or withhold from these 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the west the management of 
     <lb/>
     certain affairs, the control of certain fea<lb break="no"/>tures of their policy, simply because of a 
     <lb/>
     reluctance on the part of this government 
     <lb/>
     to part with what has undoubtedly been in 
     <lb/>
     the past and will be in the future great 
     <lb/>
     political party levers, features of admin<lb break="no"/>istration which have been used for this 
     <lb/>
     purpose and can be so used in the future. 
     <lb/>
     There are a few things that I as a Mani<lb break="no"/>toban desire to speak about before enter<lb break="no"/>ing on a discussion of the provisions of the 


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3674</fw>
   

     Bill proper. One of these is incidental to 
     <lb/>
     this Bill and was dealt with by the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister in his introductory remarks ; I 
     <lb/>
     refer to the reasons he assigned for refusing 
     <lb/>
     the reasonable request of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba through their legislators for an 
     <lb/>
     extension of the boundaries of that province. 
     <lb/>
     The Prime Minister stated that this request 
     <lb/>
     had been made not only upon his govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but upon other governments in the 
     <lb/>
     past. It was a request most reasonable in 
     <lb/>
     its character, a unanimous request joined 
     <lb/>
     in by both political parties, but a request 
     <lb/>
     which even at this most opportune moment 
     <lb/>
     when the delimitation of the western pro<lb break="no"/>vinces is being made, he and his govern<lb break="no"/>ment could not entertain. And what are 
     <lb/>
     the reasons he has given ? First because 
     <lb/>
     the government of Sir John A. Macdonald 
     <lb/>
     had a similar request made to them some 
     <lb/>
     20 years ago, and if it could not be enter<lb break="no"/>tained on that occasion it could not be en<lb break="no"/>tertained to-day ; yet in the earlier por<lb break="no"/>tion of his remarks the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     admitted that the Canada of those days 
     <lb/>
     was not the Canada of to-day. That was 
     <lb/>
     very true and he might have said further 
     <lb/>
     that the Manitoba of those days was not 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba of to-day. At that time Mani<lb break="no"/>toba was supposed to extend as far east 
     <lb/>
     as the head of lake navigation. All of that 
     <lb/>
     portion of country east of Rat Portage 
     <lb/>
     to Port Arthur which was looked upon as 
     <lb/>
     disputed territory had been counted in as 
     <lb/>
     belonging to Manitoba, and that province 
     <lb/>
     was supposed to constitute an area of 154,<lb break="no"/>000 square miles, but to-day we find that 
     <lb/>
     owing to the decision given in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the boundary award all that portion 
     <lb/>
     east of Rat Portage has been handed over 
     <lb/>
     to Ontario thus diminishing the area of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba by more than one-half. So I say 
     <lb/>
     that the request of 1905 is a much more 
     <lb/>
     reasonable one and an entirely different 
     <lb/>
     one inasmuch as it is a request on behalf 
     <lb/>
     of a province that we know for a certainty 
     <lb/>
     contains only some 73,700 square miles, 
     <lb/>
     whereas the request of twenty years ago 
     <lb/>
     was on behalf of a province which we im<lb break="no"/>agined contained 154,000 square miles. Per<lb break="no"/>sonally I would have preferred to have seen 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba's western boundary extended still 
     <lb/>
     further west as far as the 105th Meridian 
     <lb/>
     of west longitude, having one province west 
     <lb/>
     of that line extending to the eastern boun<lb break="no"/>dary of the province of British Columbia. 
     <lb/>
     Thus we would have two good sized provin<lb break="no"/>ces whose areas would have been more in 
     <lb/>
     conformity with those of British Colum<lb break="no"/>bia, Ontario and Quebec. By doing this 
     <lb/>
     we would have done away with this dupli<lb break="no"/>cation of governments and the increased 
     <lb/>
     cost as a consequence thereof. We have 
     <lb/>
     been told frequently in times gone by that 
     <lb/>
     Canada is already over-governed, because 
     <lb/>
     of this multiplication of provinces whose 
     <lb/>
     areas are too small. With such a division of 
     <lb/>
     territory as I suggest we would have avoid<lb break="no"/>
         

            <pb n="3675" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-03_Page_3675.jpg"/>
          <fw type="num">3675</fw>                           <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>                              
   

     ed the great expense entailed by this duplica<lb break="no"/>tion of provinces, and we would have had two 
     <lb/>
     splendid provinces that would have proved 
     <lb/>
     powerful factors in this great confederation. 
     <lb/>
     I realize that there is a considerable senti<lb break="no"/>ment opposed to that view in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. I cannot admit that their 
     <lb/>
     objection is a valid one ; I think it is large<lb break="no"/>ly sentimental. They look upon the word 
     <lb/>
     'annexed' with objection ; they do not 
     <lb/>
     desire to be merged. It is not a universal 
     <lb/>
     sentiment, but still a considerable portion 
     <lb/>
     of the people there object to merging their 
     <lb/>
     fortunes with those of the people of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, and we cannot entirely ignore senti<lb break="no"/>ment when it is very strongly developed. 
     <lb/>
     But I feel sure that if they had decided 
     <lb/>
     voluntarily to join their fortunes with those 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Manitoba, within the next 
     <lb/>
     five or ten years, because of the great ad<lb break="no"/>vantages they would have derived by rea<lb break="no"/>son of increased transportation facilities, 
     <lb/>
     by reason of reduced freight rates and other 
     <lb/>
     great advantages they would be perfectly 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with their position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Whatever reason the government may 
     <lb/>
     have had for not desiring to extend the 
     <lb/>
     boundaries of Manitoba westward the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the northern boundary is entirely 
     <lb/>
     different. By the provisions of this Bill 
     <lb/>
     the easterly boundary of Saskatchewan is 
     <lb/>
     the western boundary of Manitoba, extend<lb break="no"/>ing from the northwest corner of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     to the 60th parallel of north latitude, and 
     <lb/>
     that portion of the provisional district of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan lying east of that boundary 
     <lb/>
     line is put where ? In the new province of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan ? In the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba? No, it is thrown into unorganized 
     <lb/>
     territory under the jurisdiction of this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. What objection was there to hav<lb break="no"/>ing that portion added to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba ? The right hon. gentleman said 
     <lb/>
     he could not, contrary to the wishes of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Territories, take any portion 
     <lb/>
     of their land away from them, west of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba's boundary line, and that they 
     <lb/>
     had, through their legislators in their assem<lb break="no"/>bly, on more than one occasion, put them<lb break="no"/>selves on record as being opposed to hav<lb break="no"/>ing any part of that territory taken away 
     <lb/>
     from them. But he has not the same rea<lb break="no"/>son for refusing to give Manitoba this dis<lb break="no"/>trict overlapping it on the north. On the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, the very same territorial assem<lb break="no"/>bly, composed of the very same gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who passed this resolution objecting to any 
     <lb/>
     part of the territory west of Manitoba's boun<lb break="no"/>dary line being taken from them, passed 
     <lb/>
     resolutions in which they gave their con<lb break="no"/>sent to having that portion which overlaps 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba on the north added to that pro<lb break="no"/>vince. Still in the face of that resolution, 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman refuses to ac<lb break="no"/>cede to the request of the government of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. I find, on looking at the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories journal of the 14th of De<lb break="no"/>cember, 1898, the following resolution was 
     <lb/>
     passed : 
     <lb/>

<p>
     The order of the day being read for the

     second reading of resolution reported from the

            </p>

            <p>
     Whereas, it is expedient that the boundary 
     <lb/>
     lines between the Northwest Territories and 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces and territories should be 
     <lb/>
    finally determined at an early date. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     And whereas, this legislature denies the right 
     <lb/>
     of the parliament of Canada to increase, dim<lb break="no"/>inish or otherwise alter the limits of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, except as hereinafter men<lb break="no"/>tioned, without its consent because it claims

     the people of the provinces in this respect ;

     And whereas, certain areas now comprised

     belong to other provinces or territories, and

     So that, we have the very same gentle<lb break="no"/>men in that territorial assembly, passing 
     <lb/>
     that resolution, giving their consent to 
     <lb/>
     having this district north of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     boundary line added to the province, yet 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman refused to accede 
     <lb/>
     to the request of the province of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     endorsed as it was by the Territorial As<lb break="no"/>sembly. What reason did he give for not 
     <lb/>
     acceding to that reasonable request ? He 
     <lb/>
     said that in this House there are a number 
     <lb/>
     of representatives of the people who live in 
     <lb/>
     that sparsely settled portion of the coun<lb break="no"/>try ; and if these people objected to being 
     <lb/>
     incorporated in the limits of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     parliament would not be justified in add<lb break="no"/>ing them to that province. But, let me 
     <lb/>
     ask the First Minister, did he obtain the 
     <lb/>
     consent of those people before he put them 
     <lb/>
     into the unorganized territories ? Did he 
     <lb/>
     obtain their consent before separating them 
     <lb/>
     from the rest of the district of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan and putting them outside that dis<lb break="no"/>trict ? Most assuredly not. Why not then 
     <lb/>
     have incorporated them within the limits 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba. There is no valid reason why 
     <lb/>
     that district should not be added to that 
     <lb/>
     province. What was the reply he gave when 
     <lb/>
     the request was made to have the northern 
     <lb/>
     limit of Manitoba extended to the 60th pa<lb break="no"/>rallel of north latitude ? Oh, he said, I 
     <lb/>
     must first consult the province of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario and the province 
     <lb/>
     of Saskatchewan. Each of these provinces 
     <lb/>
     has an equal right for the extension of its 
     <lb/>
     territory to Hudson bay ; and some time 
     <lb/>
     in the future it is my intention to have a 
     <lb/>
     conference between the representatives of 
     <lb/>
     those provinces to see how the territory of 
     <lb/>
     Keewatin may be divided before we ac<lb break="no"/>cede to the request of Manitoba. But what 
     <lb/>
     possible reason is there for consulting any 
     <lb/>
     of those provinces. The province of On<lb break="no"/>tario intervenes between Keewatin and the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec. What say could the 
  

            <pb n="3677" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-03_Page_3677.jpg"/>

     province of Quebec have in connection with 
     <lb/>
     the division of Keewatin ? Or even the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario, for that matter ? Why 
     <lb/>
     both of these have had large additions to 
     <lb/>
     their territories since Manitoba was made 
     <lb/>
     a province and Manitoba was not consulted ? 
     <lb/>
     There is the less cause for consulting them, 
     <lb/>
     when we take into consideration the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the district of Keewatin has been un<lb break="no"/>der the jurisdiction of Manitoba the past 
     <lb/>
     thirty years. The administration of justice 
     <lb/>
     in that district has all taken place under the 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction of the lieutenant governor of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     can be extended to the Hudson bay without 
     <lb/>
     encroaching on one foot of territory pro<lb break="no"/>perly belonging to Ontario or Quebec. In 
     <lb/>
     my opinion therefore the refusal of the 
     <lb/>
     request of Manitoba was entirely unjust 
     <lb/>
     and will meet with the condemnation of 
     <lb/>
     every citizen of that province irrespective 
     <lb/>
     of party. This has not been a party ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Hon. gentlemen who occupy seats in 
     <lb/>
     this House from the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     have brought it up in the Manitoba legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. Hon. gentlemen on the opposite side 
     <lb/>
     have brought it up, and it has been treated 
     <lb/>
     as a non-party question. It is also being 
     <lb/>
     treated in that light by the press of both 
     <lb/>
     political parties. It has even received the 
     <lb/>
     endorsation of the mouthpiece of the Lib<lb break="no"/>eral party in the east, the Toronto 'Globe.' 
     <lb/>
     And in view of this general expression of 
     <lb/>
     approval, it seems to me that the province 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba has been treated in a most 
     <lb/>
     cavalier and unjust manner. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was somewhat surprised to find that 
     <lb/>
     the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
     <lb/>
     in that lengthy speech which he addressed 
     <lb/>
     to this House, representing as he does a 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba constituency, did not think this 
     <lb/>
     question of sufficient importance to even 
     <lb/>
     give it a passing notice. He was a member 
     <lb/>
     of the government no doubt, when this and 
     <lb/>
     similar requests were made in the past. 
     <lb/>
     He was, in Ottawa when the delegation 
     <lb/>
     from that province came here to press its 
     <lb/>
     claim. He was also in the city when the 
     <lb/>
     delegation from the board of trade of the 
     <lb/>
     city of Winnipeg came down and pressed 
     <lb/>
     the claim of that province. Still he has 
     <lb/>
     never uttered a protest against the action 
     <lb/>
     of this government in turning down the rea<lb break="no"/>sonable request of Manitoba for an exten<lb break="no"/>sion of its territory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Laying aside the question of the extension 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba's boundaries, there are two 
     <lb/>
     features in this Bill which deserve special 
     <lb/>
     condemnation by the people of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba. I refer to the 
     <lb/>
     educational clauses and the land clauses. 
     <lb/>
     Why do I say they should meet with the 
     <lb/>
     condemnation of the province of Manitoba ? 
     <lb/>
     Because we, in that province, have had 
     <lb/>
     our bitter experience in connection with 
     <lb/>
     each of those questions. Up to the present 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba is the only province in confedera<lb break="no"/>tion which has been denied the ownership 
     <lb/>
    if its public lands, and because of that fact, 
 

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3678</fw>
       

     our legislators have had to come down to 
     <lb/>
     the central government on numerous occa<lb break="no"/>sions, hat in hand, asking an addition to 
     <lb/>
     their public revenues in order to be able 
     <lb/>
     to cope with the requirements of that deve<lb break="no"/>loping province. There would have been 
     <lb/>
     no need for these begging trips had that 
     <lb/>
     province been dealt with justly and fairly 
     <lb/>
     as were the other provinces, and we take a 
     <lb/>
     sufficient interest in the newly created pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in the west to desire that they should 
     <lb/>
     not have a similar experience and that they 
     <lb/>
     should profit by our example. Therefore 
     <lb/>
     we urge on the government the claims of 
     <lb/>
     our sister provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In my opinion also no financial consi<lb break="no"/>deration, which even at present may appear 
     <lb/>
     most liberal in its character—eulogized as 
     <lb/>
     liberal by hon. gentlemen opposite-will 
     <lb/>
     sufficiently compensate for the withholding 
     <lb/>
     from those new provinces of their public 
     <lb/>
     domain. Without their lands, those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces will have not one single asset inde<lb break="no"/>pendent of this government, save the power 
     <lb/>
     of taxing themselves. To obtain a prece<lb break="no"/>dent for this treatment, the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman had to go to the American republic. 
     <lb/>
     How frequently have we not heard that right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman in eloquent tones declaim 
     <lb/>
     against our borrowing examples from Ameri<lb break="no"/>can politicians ! But, he did not go to the 
     <lb/>
     American republic when he desired to get 
     <lb/>
     a precedent in connection with the school 
     <lb/>
     policy. On the contrary he went out of his 
     <lb/>
     way to offer a gratuitous insult to the Amer<lb break="no"/>icans who are flocking into our Northwest 
     <lb/>
     by thousands, when he compared their com<lb break="no"/>paratively inferior moral stamina with ours 
     <lb/>
     and attributed it largely to their public 
     <lb/>
     school system and to the exclusion from that 
     <lb/>
     system of the teaching of certain religious 
     <lb/>
     dogma. He always goes, he tells us, for 
     <lb/>
     his great examples to the motherland, but 
     <lb/>
     in this instance he did not. Had he gone to 
     <lb/>
     the motherland for a precedent in the 
     <lb/>
     settlement of the land question, he would 
     <lb/>
     have had a precedent entirely contradictory 
     <lb/>
     to the policy he has followed. He would 
     <lb/>
     have found that imperial statesmen in days 
     <lb/>
     gone by took the same position as the one 
     <lb/>
     he takes now regarding the ownership of 
     <lb/>
     those lands. He would have found that 
     <lb/>
     they urged that those lands should be held 
     <lb/>
     by the empire for the benefit of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the empire. But better counsels pre<lb break="no"/>vailed, and it was recognized that these 
     <lb/>
     lands could not be administered to the 
     <lb/>
     same advantage from Downing street as in 
     <lb/>
     Canada itself. What the imperial govern<lb break="no"/>ment has done for this Dominion the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government should have done for the 
     <lb/>
     provinces and handed over to them their 
     <lb/>
     lands to administer in the interest of their 
     <lb/>
     own people. Justice, Sir, is far more es<lb break="no"/>sential-very often at any rate—than any 
     <lb/>
     mere financial consideration ; and I much 
     <lb/>
     mistake the character and temper of our 
     <lb/>
     western people if they do not condemn the 
     <lb/>
     government's policy in reference to these

     lands. The right hon. Prime Minister (Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid Laurier) admits that he has adopt<lb break="no"/>ed this policy simply as a matter of policy. 
     <lb/>
     But the only colour of reason he has assigned 
     <lb/>
     for it is that he fears lest, in the future, 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces may, through stress of 
     <lb/>
     financial stringency, due to incurring debts 
     <lb/>
     not wisely but too well, resort to increasing 
     <lb/>
     the price of these lands, or may possibly 
     <lb/>
     do away with the policy of free homesteads 
     <lb/>
     which, up to this time, has done so much 
     <lb/>
     to attract immigrants to our shores, and to 
     <lb/>
     place settlers on our western prairies. But, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, surely the people making their homes 
     <lb/>
     in the western part of the Dominion, and 
     <lb/>
     those whom they select to administer their 
     <lb/>
     affairs, would be at least as anxious to bring 
     <lb/>
     people to settle on these lands as would the 
     <lb/>
     government here at Ottawa ; and how much 
     <lb/>
     more careful are they likely to be of the 
     <lb/>
     character of these immigrants than this 
     <lb/>
     government has shown itself to be in the 
     <lb/>
     past. And, moreover, with how much great<lb break="no"/>er advantage could these lands be adminis<lb break="no"/>tered by the local government through of<lb break="no"/>ficials under their control than by a govern<lb break="no"/>ment at Ottawa two thousand or two 
     <lb/>
     thousand five hundred miles from the scene 
     <lb/>
     of operations. Evidently the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     and his colleagues have not confidence in 
     <lb/>
     the ability of the western people to legislate 
     <lb/>
     for themselves. When the question of grant<lb break="no"/>ing autonomy to the Northwest was up for 
     <lb/>
     discussion in parliament two or three years 
     <lb/>
     ago the Prime Minister and his then col<lb break="no"/>league, the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton), took the ground that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories were already in possession 
     <lb/>
     of practically complete powers of self-gov<lb break="no"/>ernment save the power to incur debt ; and 
     <lb/>
     they doubted the wisdom of granting them 
     <lb/>
     this power lest it might be utilized for un<lb break="no"/>wise and unnecessary purposes. Apparent<lb break="no"/>ly, that feeling has never entirely been 
     <lb/>
     overcome by these gentlemen, even to this 
     <lb/>
     day ; otherwise they would have proposed 
     <lb/>
     the granting of a full measure of autonomy 
     <lb/>
     to the people of the Territories, including 
     <lb/>
     the power to manage their own lands and 
     <lb/>
     control their educational system. Two years 
     <lb/>
     ago, the Prime Minister expressed his dis<lb break="no"/>sent from the policy of granting autonomy 
     <lb/>
     for many years to come. But political 
     <lb/>
     exigencies forced him to abandon that 
     <lb/>
     position. In the midst of the last elec<lb break="no"/>tion campaign, it was suddenly brought 
     <lb/>
     to his memory—even in the turmoil 
     <lb/>
     and cares and worries of the occasion. 
     <lb/>
     he remembered—that he had left letters of 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, unanswered for months. So he sent 
     <lb/>
     a letter giving a pledge—no doubt urged 
     <lb/>
     to by his candidates in the west, who had 
     <lb/>
     rightly gauged public opinion—that imme<lb break="no"/>diately after the election he would take up 
     <lb/>
     the question of autonomy and introduce a 
     <lb/>
     measure during the first session of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. I venture to say that had the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest been aware of the 

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3680</fw>
     

     character of the Autonomy Bill, and had 
     <lb/>
     they been informed of the restrictions to 
     <lb/>
     he placed upon their legislative liberty, the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
     <lb/>
     would not to-day enjoy the support of such 
     <lb/>
     a large number of representatives from the 
     <lb/>
     west as he now has. And not only that, 
     <lb/>
     but he would not have been in the enjoy<lb break="no"/>ment of the support he receives from other 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the Dominion in this House. 
     <lb/>
     To-day we have a measure which, to use 
     <lb/>
     a common expression, grants autonomy with 
     <lb/>
     a string to it, one that says in effect : Thus 
     <lb/>
     far shalt thou go and no farther. The Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister in effect says : We can trust you 
     <lb/>
     with powers of self government, including 
     <lb/>
     the power to tax yourselves for all neces<lb break="no"/>sary local purposes, we can trust you with 
     <lb/>
     the power of administering justice in these 
     <lb/>
     provinces ; we can trust you with the work<lb break="no"/>ing out of your transportation problem— 
     <lb/>
     provided, that is, you can do it dispoiled as 
     <lb/>
     you are of your chief asset, your public 
     <lb/>
     lands—we can trust you with the mainten<lb break="no"/>ance of law and order in these provinces : 
     <lb/>
     we can trust you with these things, and feel 
     <lb/>
     that you will acquit yourself in a creditable 
     <lb/>
     manner ; but hands off the Dominion lands 
     <lb/>
     and the separate schools, though no person 
     <lb/>
     has threatened either one or the other, 
     <lb/>
     for these are preserves of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government upon which you must not 
     <lb/>
     trespass. He declares, in effect : We, 
     <lb/>
     the members of the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment have not sufficient confidence in 
     <lb/>
     either your ability or your wisdom to 
     <lb/>
     control and manage your own lands in the 
     <lb/>
     interest of your own people; through your 
     <lb/>
     youth and inexperience as legislators you 
     <lb/>
     might adopt some policy that would con<lb break="no"/>flict with the policy of this central govern<lb break="no"/>ment to your detriment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is true that the other provinces of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, save the province of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     are in the enjoyment of their public domain; 
     <lb/>
     it is true that your legislators in the past 
     <lb/>
     have given every evidence of capacity and 
     <lb/>
     statesmanship ; it is true you have been 
     <lb/>
     governed wisely and well ; it is true your 
     <lb/>
     country is peopled with a thrifty, intelligent, 
     <lb/>
     and industrious people ; nevertheless we 
     <lb/>
     cannot entrust to you this great patrimony 
     <lb/>
     lest you might dissipate it in a prodigal 
     <lb/>
    manner : Therefore, your liberties must be 
     <lb/>curtailed and your jurisdiction must be 
     <lb/>limited; likewise your assets. And so a 
     <lb/>proud and self-reliant people are made to 
     <lb/>feel the humiliation of a patronizing restraint 
     <lb/>exercised by those who are in no way their 
     <lb/>superiors. If this government were fearful 
     <lb/>lest the new provinces might, at some time 
     <lb/>in the future do away with this policy of 
     <lb/>free homesteads that has been such a factor 
     <lb/>in bringing immigrants to our shores, then, 
     <lb/>rather than retain the lands in their own 
     <lb/>possession, why could they not have follow<lb break="no"/>ed the suggestion of the leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition (Mr. R. L. Borden) and have incorpor<lb break="no"/>ated a provision in the law which would 
   

            <pb n="3681" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-03_Page_3681.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3681</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 3, 1905</fw> 
       

     perpetuate that system so long as we had 
     <lb/>
     any homesteads to grant ? Such a course 
     <lb/>
     would have been much less objectionable 
     <lb/>
     than this restraint upon the liberties of the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces. They are already restricted 
     <lb/>
     in their powers in regard to education, and 
     <lb/>
     I say that such a restraint as that, especially 
     <lb/>
     as it would have to receive the consent 
     <lb/>
     of the people resident there, would have 
     <lb/>
     been far less objectionable ; and you would 
     <lb/>
     have preserved this policy of free home<lb break="no"/>steads, quite as well as if the lands were 
     <lb/>
     administered in the city of Ottawa. And 
     <lb/>
     besides it would have done away with a 
     <lb/>
     whole host of officials who are on the pay<lb break="no"/>roll of this country and whose duties are 
     <lb/>
     merely of a nominal character, save during 
     <lb/>
     an election campaign. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, an argument has been used, that 
     <lb/>
     the fact of the other provinces of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion being in the enjoyment of their 
     <lb/>
     public domain is not a parallel case ; that 
     <lb/>
     while the lands of the other provinces were 
     <lb/>
     owned by those provinces prior to their 
     <lb/>
     entry into confederation, the lands of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories were purchased— 
     <lb/>
     'purchased' being the word used—by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government for the benefit 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion at large. Now, Sir, I, as 
     <lb/>
     a westerner, object to that word ' purchased.' 
     <lb/>
     These lands were not 'purchased.' It is 
     <lb/>
     true that the sum of £300,000 was paid to 
     <lb/>
     the Hudson Bay Company, not for these 
     <lb/>
     lands, but for certain privileges they enjoyed 
     <lb/>
     and for the relinquishment of what was, at 
     <lb/>
     best, a doubtful title, on their part. But 
     <lb/>
     this money was borrowed on the credit of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, and interest is being paid 
     <lb/>
     upon it to-day just as much by the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest, man for man, as by the 
     <lb/>
     residents in eastern Canada. But, if the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories are to be denied the 
     <lb/>
     beneficial ownership of these lands by 
     <lb/>
     reason of this argument, how is it that a 
     <lb/>
     certain portion of this territory has been 
     <lb/>
     handed over to one province ? How is it that 
     <lb/>
     150,000 miles of territory in Ungava, a part 
     <lb/>
     of this 'purchased' land, paid for with 
     <lb/>
     money raised on the credit of the Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     was handed over, without a cent of compen<lb break="no"/>sation, to the province of Quebec ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some more powerful logic, some better 
     <lb/>
     reasoning will have to be adduced in order 
     <lb/>
     to convince the residents of western Canada 
     <lb/>
     that they are not equally entitled to the 
     <lb/>
     ownership of these lands as are the people 
     <lb/>
     who reside in other portions of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. After the premier had laboured 
     <lb/>
     hard to prove the ownership of those lands 
     <lb/>
     belong to the Dominion, stating that on the 
     <lb/>
     ground of public policy they should be re<lb break="no"/>tained in the Dominion, he has practically 
     <lb/>
     admitted the justice of the claim of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the west to those lands by providing 
     <lb/>
     in this Bill for compensation for the same. 
     <lb/>
     If they purchased those lands and paid $300<lb break="no"/>000, why purchase them the second time, 
     <lb/>
     paying $1.50 an acre, and especially since 
     <lb/>
     he maintains that that is nothing like what 
  

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3682</fw>
     

     they are worth ? It is impossible to tell ex<lb break="no"/>actly their financial value ; but in setting 
     <lb/>
     aside some 25,000,000 acres of land at $1.50 
     <lb/>
     an acre, when the ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     has stated that the school lands alone, some 
     <lb/>
     50,000,000 acres, would be worth at least $3 
     <lb/>
     an acre, you can easily see that the pro<lb break="no"/>vince: do not get sufficient compensation for 
     <lb/>
     withholding their lands from them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, the Prime Minister appeared to be 
     <lb/>
     very solicitous of public sentiment in 
     <lb/>
     the west saying that he could not 
     <lb/>
     grant the request of the people of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     for an extension of its boundaries west<lb break="no"/>ward against the wishes of the people 
     <lb/>
     who reside in the territories. But he 
     <lb/>
     was not so careful of public opinion 
     <lb/>
     when he denied to them the ownership of 
     <lb/>
     their lands, nor did he consult their wishes 
     <lb/>
     when he decided to impose upon them a 
     <lb/>
     school system which may in years to come 
     <lb/>
     prove entirely unsatisfactory to them. He 
     <lb/>
     does not even allow them the option of say<lb break="no"/>ing how those schools shall be maintained ; 
     <lb/>
     but under the provisions of this Bill he 
     <lb/>
     decides that the two systems shall receive 
     <lb/>
     an equitable share of public money in such 
     <lb/>
     a manner as not to discriminate between 
     <lb/>
     them. Now, as a layman, I can see practi<lb break="no"/>cally no difference between the amended 
     <lb/>
     and the original clauses. It is true that the 
     <lb/>
     ex-Minister of the Interior, with fine sar<lb break="no"/>casm at the expense of the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice, read into the original clause 16 a 
     <lb/>
     much different meaning to that which he 
     <lb/>
     attaches to the amended clause. Of course, 
     <lb/>
     he was having a drive at his late colleague, 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice, through a draughts<lb break="no"/>man; though, as any person could see, it 
     <lb/>
     was not even necessary to read between the 
     <lb/>
     lines to know who the cx-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior meant by this particular draughts<lb break="no"/>man. Here are his words : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     But I am bound to say, Mr. Speaker, that 
     <lb/>
     when my hon. friend the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     employed a draughtsman to draw this clause, 
     <lb/>
     with instructions to maintain only the existing 
     <lb/>
     state of affairs in the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
     the draughtsman either wholly misunderstood 
     <lb/>
     his instructions or he possessed the most re<lb break="no"/>markable faculty for covering things which 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Well, every member from the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories was going to agree with the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice prior to the advent of 
     <lb/>
     the ex-Minister of the Interior upon the 
     <lb/>
     scene. They saw no objection to that ori<lb break="no"/>ginal clause 16, every man of them was 
     <lb/>
     going to support it until their hands were 
     <lb/>
     forced by the return of the ex-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior. According to the ex-Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior, the original clause, no matter 
     <lb/>
     how inefficiently those separate schools 
     <lb/>
     might be carried on, even if religious teach<lb break="no"/>ing was made the primary feature of the 
     <lb/>
     schools and secular education the secondary 
     <lb/>
     feature, no matter how inferior those schools 
     <lb/>
     might turn out to be, they were entitled to 
     <lb/>
     share and share alike with the public schools

     out of the proceeds of the sales of the public 
     <lb/>
     lands and all other moneys granted for 
     <lb/>
     educational purposes. Is this an evidence 
     <lb/>
     of the tolerance that the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man spoke about in his introductory speech? 
     <lb/>
     Is this all the confidence he has in the peo<lb break="no"/>ple inhabiting the Northwest Territories ? 
     <lb/>
     What evidence have they ever given that 
     <lb/>
     they will not deal justly, and even generous<lb break="no"/>ly, with minorities in that country ? The

     right hon. gentleman is quite willing to 
     <lb/>
     consult their wishes when he thinks those 
     <lb/>
     wishes are in accord with his own ; but 
     <lb/>
     he is not willing to be guided by their de<lb break="no"/>sires when they run counter to his own 
     <lb/>
     views. He does follow out their wishes 
     <lb/>
     when he refuses Manitoba's request for an 
     <lb/>
     extension of her boundaries, but he will not 
     <lb/>
     be bound by them when they ask for public 
     <lb/>
     lands, and he considers it the essence of 
     <lb/>
     statesmanship when he refuses them the 
     <lb/>
     right to say what their school system shall 
     <lb/>
     be, and denies them what the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act evidently intended they should 
     <lb/>
     have, namely, the sole control of their edu<lb break="no"/>cational affairs. If the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man desired an evidence of public sentiment 
     <lb/>
     in the Territories on educational matters, if 
     <lb/>
     he was in quest of that pillar of cloud by 
     <lb/>
     day and that pillar of fire by night to show 
     <lb/>
     him the way and to give him the light, to 
     <lb/>
     use his own simile, let him look at the history 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools in that country, and he 
     <lb/>
     will find that, notwithstanding the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories Act was passed 
     <lb/>
     in 1875 permitting the establishment of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in that country, there ex<lb break="no"/>ists to-day but about ten separate schools 
     <lb/>
     to nearly 1,100 public schools. What greater 
     <lb/>
     evidence could he desire or require as to 
     <lb/>
     the public sentiment of that country regard<lb break="no"/>ing the character of the school system they 
     <lb/>
     desire ? And, Sir, what avail is it to resur<lb break="no"/>rect the mouldy speeches of the Hon. George 
     <lb/>
     Brown, of the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie 
     <lb/>
     and of the Hon. Edward Blake, to prove 
     <lb/>
     what those gentlemen had in their minds 
     <lb/>
     when they incorporated that provision in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories Act, stating that 
     <lb/>
     they wished intending immigrants to know 
     <lb/>
     what kind of schools they were going to 
     <lb/>
     have in that country, when I venture to 
     <lb/>
     say that not one man in 5,000 who have 
     <lb/>
     gone into that country to make homes for 
     <lb/>
     themselves ever asked the question whether 
     <lb/>
     there were separate schools there. The only 
     <lb/>
     question agitating them was: What educa<lb break="no"/>tional facilities are there for giving my chil<lb break="no"/>dren a good common school education ? A 
     <lb/>
     proof of this is found in the fact that, not<lb break="no"/>withstanding that the Act permitting separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools has been in existence thirty 
     <lb/>
     years, there is a diminishing number of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools and a rapidly increasing 
     <lb/>
     number of public schools. In face of this 
     <lb/>
     experience and of this overwhelming public 
     <lb/>
     sentiment in the Northwest, the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister has incorporated a clause in this Act 
     <lb/>
     forcing upon those new provinces a school 


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3684</fw>
       

     system that may or may not prove to their 
     <lb/>
     liking in the years to come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, the ex-Minister of the Interior has 
     <lb/>
     stated that he is personally aware of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that people have taken the trouble to 
     <lb/>
     secure copies of the ordinance to see if there 
     <lb/>
     were separate schools in that country before 
     <lb/>
     going to make their homes there, leaving the 
     <lb/>
     impression that they would not have gone 
     <lb/>
     in there had they not been sure that there 
     <lb/>
     were separate schools in existence. If that 
     <lb/>
     is the case, I charge the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior with having—whether deliberately 
     <lb/>
     or not, I will not say—misled the immi<lb break="no"/>grants through his immigration literature 
     <lb/>
     that he has scattered broadcast in almost 
     <lb/>
     every civilized country of the globe, among 
     <lb/>
     people whom he wished to attract to this 
     <lb/>
     country ; for I have hunted in vain for one 
     <lb/>
     single expression in that literature where 
     <lb/>
     there was any reference to a separate school 
     <lb/>
     system. On the contrary, as was shown by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) 
     <lb/>
     and the hon. member for Calgary (Mr. M. S. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy), it is distinctly stated in a pam<lb break="no"/>phlet that has been distributed that the 
     <lb/>
     schools are non-sectarian, and national 
     <lb/>
     in their character—not a word about 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. The Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     stated that on his European tour he was 
     <lb/>
     in consultation with a certain representa<lb break="no"/>tive of a foreign country who was very 
     <lb/>
     much agitated about the outcome of this 
     <lb/>
     separate school agitation in Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     the impresion he conveyed to the members 
     <lb/>
     of this House was that if there were no 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in the Northwest we would 
     <lb/>
     have very few immigrants from that coun<lb break="no"/>try. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, in view of the speech 
     <lb/>
     made by the Minister of Finance the other 
     <lb/>
     evening, I think we would all be delighted 
     <lb/>
     to hear the character of the reply he made 
     <lb/>
     to that representative of a foreign country. 
     <lb/>
     I think if the hon. gentleman sends a copy 
     <lb/>
     of his speech over to that representative it 
     <lb/>
     will convey to that gentleman a vastly dif<lb break="no"/>ferent impression from the impression he 
     <lb/>
     gave him in the reply which he gave, be<lb break="no"/>cause I am sure he did not try to convince 
     <lb/>
     that representative that they had no separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools in that country, where as his 
     <lb/>
     whole argument here was to convince us 
     <lb/>
     that there were practically no separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, that they were national schools, 
     <lb/>
     and that any difference there is would 
     <lb/>
     soon disappear. This policy, in my opinion. 
     <lb/>
     cannot be defended on legal grounds. The 
     <lb/>
     constitution of our country does not force 
     <lb/>
     us to perpetuate this system of schools con<lb break="no"/>trary to the Wishes of the people inhabiting 
     <lb/>
     that part of the Dominion. It is true that 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. leader of the government, 
     <lb/>
     when he introduced this Bill, based his sole 
     <lb/>
     argument upon the ground that he stood 
     <lb/>
     by and on the rock of the constitution, but 
     <lb/>
     by the time my hon. friend the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition had got through with his 
     <lb/>
     speech in criticism of the speech of the 
 

            <pb n="3685" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-03_Page_3685.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3685</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 3, 1905</fw> 
     

     right hon. leader of the government there 
     <lb/>
     was nothing left of that constitutional argu<lb break="no"/>ment. It was entirely demolished to the 
     <lb/>
     extent that his colleague the hon. the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance, replying to my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition, threw up his 
     <lb/>
     hands, abandoned the constitutional argu<lb break="no"/>ment and stated that he would not shield 
     <lb/>
     himself behind the constitution thereby 
     <lb/>
     giving a rebuke to his own leader; but, while 
     <lb/>
     admitting that there were no legal grounds 
     <lb/>
     for forcing these schools on the people of 
     <lb/>
     that western country, he asserted that we 
     <lb/>
     we were morally bound to perpetuate that 
     <lb/>
     system. We have had legal authorities 
     <lb/>
     quoted in this House. We have heard the 
     <lb/>
     Opinion of Mr. Christopher Robinson, who 
     <lb/>
     backed up the opinion from the legal stand<lb break="no"/>point which was given by my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition. We have had 
     <lb/>
     other gentlemen eminent in their profession 
     <lb/>
     agreeing with the same opinion. It is only 
     <lb/>
     right and proper for me to say that there 
     <lb/>
     was another hon. gentleman who particu<lb break="no"/>larly laid down a different opinion in his 
     <lb/>
     most emphatic manner and with the same 
     <lb/>
     assurance that usually characterizes all the 
     <lb/>
     utterances of that hon. gentleman in the 
     <lb/>
     House. I refer to the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Alberta (Mr. Oliver). That opinion is de<lb break="no"/>serving of all the respect it is entitled to. 
     <lb/>
     In the face of that high legal opinion I im<lb break="no"/>agined that I saw the right hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the government sitting down and penning 
     <lb/>
     a letter like another similar letter written 
     <lb/>
     to a political supporter of his within six 
     <lb/>
     months after he was called to the premier<lb break="no"/>ship. I imagine that I saw the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman writing a letter in these words: 
     <lb/>
     My Dear Oliver,—Perhaps the lieutenant 
     <lb/>
     governorship of the province of Alberta will 
     <lb/>
     be at my disposal by the 1st of July, 1905. 
     <lb/>
     If between now and then you are not ap<lb break="no"/>pointed a judge for giving that constitution<lb break="no"/>al opinion I promise to place the lieutenant 
     <lb/>
     governorship at your disposal. (Signed) 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid Laurier. It may not be a judge<lb break="no"/>ship, because I think as a usual thing they 
     <lb/>
     require a lawyer for a judgeship, but still 
     <lb/>
     there are premierships, lieutenant governor<lb break="no"/>ships and several other positions up there 
     <lb/>
     at the disposal of the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     and I will venture to say that so long as 
     <lb/>
     we have these positions dangling before 
     <lb/>
     the eyes of the hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     from the west, and especially the vacant 
     <lb/>
     portfolio of the Minister of the Interior, the 
     <lb/>
     boy who gives this Bill his thorough and 
     <lb/>
     emphatic support and swallows every clause 
     <lb/>
     that is in it, even at the expense of his con<lb break="no"/>victions, is the one who is the most likely 
     <lb/>
     to receive the plum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is a Bill which I think cannot be de<lb break="no"/>fended on the grounds of public policy. The 
     <lb/>
     whole history of such agitations as this is 
     <lb/>
     directly contrary to that contention. It is 
     <lb/>
     contrary to the spirit of provincial rights 
     <lb/>
     and an unwarrantable interference with 
     <lb/>
     matters of purely provincial concern. Where 


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3686</fw>
    

     are the gentlemen who were so loud with 
     <lb/>
     the shibboleth 'Hands of Manitoba' in 1896? 
     <lb/>
     Where are the gentlemen who were erst<lb break="no"/>while defenders of provincial rights then? 
     <lb/>
     Are these gentlemen now the defenders of 
     <lb/>
     coercion? Where are these gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     even went to the extent of doing away with 
     <lb/>
     the system of separate schools in Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     although that system had been in existence 
     <lb/>
     for over twenty years, who thought they 
     <lb/>
     were doing their duty, who thought they 
     <lb/>
     were within their jurisdiction, who denied 
     <lb/>
     the right of this government to dictate to 
     <lb/>
     the people of Manitoba what their educa<lb break="no"/>tional policy should be and who held that 
     <lb/>
     the people of Manitoba should work out 
     <lb/>
     their own salvation as far as educational 
     <lb/>
     affairs are concerned? Where are the gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who journeyed from platform to 
     <lb/>
     platform stirring up the prejudices of the 
     <lb/>
     people in that country not only against the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government, but also against the 
     <lb/>
     principle of separate schools as being ante<lb break="no"/>diluvian and contrary to western ideas? 
     <lb/>
     Where are those who even journeyed beyond 
     <lb/>
     the confines of the province of Manitoba? 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Lisgar (Mr. Green<lb break="no"/>way) was premier of the province cf Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and it was under his government that 
     <lb/>
     these schools were wiped out of existence, 
     <lb/>
     though to do him justice I must say that it 
     <lb/>
     was a stronger man who dictated this policy 
     <lb/>
     to him—the Hon. Joseph Martin, attorney 
     <lb/>
     general at that time—but still he followed 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Joseph's lead and the schools were 
     <lb/>
     abolished. Where is the hon. ex-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior, for he it was who journeyed to 
     <lb/>
     the constituency of Haldimand, travelling 
     <lb/>
     some 1,500 miles not only to gain the sym<lb break="no"/>pathy and support of the people of Haldi<lb break="no"/>mand in Manitoba's fight for provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights, but also to try and induce the elec<lb break="no"/>tors of the constituency of Haldimand to 
     <lb/>
     cast their votes against the then government 
     <lb/>
     and its representative, Dr. Montague, who 
     <lb/>
     was seeking re-election at a by-election as 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Agriculture? The hon. ex-Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior went into the constitu<lb break="no"/>ency of Haldimand and put before the people 
     <lb/>
     our separate school policy and our National 
     <lb/>
     School Act, much to the detriment of the 
     <lb/>
     former, and asked their sympathy and sup<lb break="no"/>port and votes for the then candidate who 
     <lb/>
     was opposing the government. Let their 
     <lb/>
     followers from Manitoba explain for sev<lb break="no"/>eral of them occupy seats in this House to<lb break="no"/>day who occupied seats in the local legis<lb break="no"/>lature at that time and Who then sought to 
     <lb/>
     maintain the right of the province to con<lb break="no"/>trol their educational affairs. What evil 
     <lb/>
     days must these hon. gentlemen have fallen 
     <lb/>
     upon that they are now joining hands in 
     <lb/>
     forcing upon the people of the western coun<lb break="no"/>try a school policy that may not be accept<lb break="no"/>able in the years that are to come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, there are some ex<lb break="no"/>tracts that I have culled, some choice gems 
     <lb/>
     from some of the speeches delivered by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. ex-Minister of the Interior on that

     Haldimand tour, for recollect that while he 
     <lb/>
     journeyed down to the constituency of Haldi<lb break="no"/>mand he journeyed back again minus that 
     <lb/>
     scalp which he as a western brave sallied 
     <lb/>
     forth to secure. He made a speech of a 
     <lb/>
     violent character against the schools we 
     <lb/>
     had in the province of Manitoba and also 
     <lb/>
     appealed to the sympathy of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Haldimand on the ground of provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights. I desire to read to the House a few 
     <lb/>
     of these gems from a speech delivered by 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman in the county of Haldi<lb break="no"/>mand as reported in the 'Globe.'

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. W. J. ROCHE</persName>. Mr. Speaker. Before 
     <lb/>
     you left the chair at six o'clock, I was refer<lb break="no"/>ring to the speech made by the ex-Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) at the town 
     <lb/>
     of Caledonia in the constituency of Haldi<lb break="no"/>mand in the year 1895. I shall quote from 
     <lb/>
     the report in the ' Globe' of April 15, of that 
     <lb/>
     year. I do not read these extracts from the 
     <lb/>
     speech of the ex-minister (Mr. Sifton) with 
     <lb/>
     the idea of lending my endorsation to them, 
     <lb/>
     but as one hon. member read extracts from 
     <lb/>
     the remarks of clergymen and public men 
     <lb/>
     in the United States to show they were not 
     <lb/>
     entirely satisfied with the school system of 
     <lb/>
     that country, it may be well to hear what 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman (Mr. Sifton) has to say 
     <lb/>
     about the separate schools as they existed in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. Some of these gentlemen in the 
     <lb/>
     United States, although their remarks apply 
     <lb/>
     to a condition of things said to exist over 
     <lb/>
     twenty years ago, were represented as hav<lb break="no"/>ing said that the public schools in that coun<lb break="no"/>try were hot beds of immorality. As I have 
     <lb/>
     said, I do not lend my endorsation to the 
     <lb/>
     remarks which I shall quote from the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member (Mr. Sifton), because it so happens 
     <lb/>
     that in my constituency there was not a 
     <lb/>
     single separate school existing prior to the 
     <lb/>
     abolition of separate schools in Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     and personally I cannot speak from expe<lb break="no"/>rience. We were told by a gentleman on 
     <lb/>
     the other side of the House, that the state<lb break="no"/>ment as to the clergy of the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     interfering in elections was a mere myth, a 
     <lb/>
     figment of the imagination. However, that 
     <lb/>
     may be, I shall quote from the present mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brandon, the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior and ex-attorney general of his pro<lb break="no"/>vince, as to what his opinion was. I may 
     <lb/>
     say that the hon. gentleman made this speech 
     <lb/>
     when he occupied the responsible position 
     <lb/>
     of attorney general of Manitoba, and as we 
     <lb/>
     know he has a great deal of experience in 
     <lb/>
     connection with educational affairs, because 
     <lb/>
     he told us so himself the other day. Some 
     <lb/>
     of these expressions are very harsh, but I 
     <lb/>
     must inflict them upon the House in order 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentlemen opposite may form their 
     <lb/>
     own opinion on the merits of the separate 
     <lb/>
     school system as it existed in Manitoba, from 


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3688</fw>
     

     the words of one of their own friends. Mr.

     How very solicitous the hon. gentleman

     was about precipitating on this country a 
     <lb/>
     political crisis ! He followed in the wake of 
     <lb/>
     his colleague, the Minister of Finance. That 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman was aghast at the idea of 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition being called up<lb break="no"/>on to form a government, because that gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would have to be, according to him, 
     <lb/>
     a Protestant government, and then the coun<lb break="no"/>try would go to the bow-wows entirely. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, I think that is an insult to our 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic fellow-citizens. It is an in<lb break="no"/>sult to them to imagine that the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition could not get any one of that 
     <lb/>
     faith to come in and form a government 
     <lb/>
     with him simply because he desired to leave 
     <lb/>
     to the new provinces the entire control of 
     <lb/>
     their educational system.

     The hon. member for Edmonton told us 
     <lb/>
     that all the petitions which have been com<lb break="no"/>ing here for the past month, the meetings 
     <lb/>
     that have been held, the resolutions that 
     <lb/>
     have been passed, were simply for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of creating political party capital. 
     <lb/>
     I would ask him if the Toronto ' Globe ' 
     <lb/>
     is so solicitous for the welfare of 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party that it is op<lb break="no"/>posing this Bill. I will give that news<lb break="no"/>paper the credit no matter how much 
     <lb/>
     it has tried to trim since, it did at 
     <lb/>
     one time take the proper ground and 
     <lb/>
     stand for the old landmark of provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights which Liberals advocated in the 
     <lb/>
     years gone by. Surely the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     does not mean to say that the Toronto 
     <lb/>
     ' Globe ' is animated solely with the desire 
     <lb/>
     of putting a Conservative government into 
     <lb/>
     office. The whole independent press, al<lb break="no"/>most without exception, are condemning the 
     <lb/>
     government on account of this Bill. And 
     <lb/>
     what about all these strong old time Lib<lb break="no"/>erals which the hon. member for Ottawa

     <lb/>
     life long friend ? Is he taking the public

     platform against this measure simply be<lb break="no"/>cause he is animated by a sudden zeal in

     the interests of the Conservative party ? Is 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Thomson, King's Counsel, also taking 
     <lb/>
     the platform in the interests of the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party ? And Mayor Urquhart and 
     <lb/>
     all those other gentlemen who are members 
     <lb/>
     of the Libral party—are they animated by 
     <lb/>
     a like motive ? Oh, but say some hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite, they have been misled. 
     <lb/>
     These intelligent gentlemen, equally as in<lb break="no"/>telligent as any to be found in the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     ranks, just as intelligent as the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Edmonton and the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa and the hon. member for West As<lb break="no"/>siniboia—these gentlemen we are told have 
     <lb/>
     been misled. But surely they will not 
     <lb/>
     accuse the hon. member for North Simcoe 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. McCarthy) with having been misled 
     <lb/>
     when he got up and denounced this Bill. It 
     <lb/>
     may be, Mr. Speaker, that he spoke too soon 
     <lb/>
     but he none the less denounced the measure, 
     <lb/>
     and he has always given faithful support 
     <lb/>
     to this government ever since 1896, when he 
     <lb/>
     first entered the House. Surely he is not to 
     <lb/>
     be called a renegade Liberal or even a man 
     <lb/>
     who has been misled. Again look at the 
     <lb/>
     Laurier Club, composed of some of the 
     <lb/>
     brightest minds in the city of Toronto, 
     <lb/>
     which passed resolutions condemning this 
     <lb/>
     measure. Are we to be told that that club 
     <lb/>
     was animated by a desire to benefit the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party ? Then we have the

     a resolution which was read here the other

     funds arising for school purposes—which 
     <lb/>
     includes the proceeds of the Dominion lands 
     <lb/>
     and all appropriated by the legislature— 
     <lb/>
     shall be distributed without discrimination, 
     <lb/>
     that is, shall be distributed in an equitable 
     <lb/>
     manner. It is simply a change of the word<lb break="no"/>ing without any change of the meaning, so 
     <lb/>
     far as I can see, and so far as many other 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen, much more conversant 
     <lb/>
     with the meaning of legal phraseology than 
     <lb/>
     I am, can see. But if the ex-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior takes that view, what view 
     <lb/>
     have they in the province of Quebec, as 
     <lb/>
     shown by some of their leading party jour<lb break="no"/>nals ? I will read from 'Le Canada' of a 
     <lb/>
     couple of weeks ago an article in which 
     <lb/>
     great credit is taken for the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     for standing to his guns and not compro<lb break="no"/>mising, but insisting upon obtaining for 
     <lb/>
     their people exactly what he sought to get 
     <lb/>
     in the first place :

     So, Mr. Speaker, you can exactly see the 
     <lb/>
     game. It is the old game of 1896—in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec the cry will be that Sir 
     <lb/>
     lWilfrid, one of their co-religionists and 
     <lb/>
     compatriots, has protected their rights ; he 
     <lb/>
     has not given way at all ; the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) successfully con<lb break="no"/>cealed the intended meaning of the law 
     <lb/>
     even from the expert eyes of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of «he Interior. On the other hand, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton and his colleagues from the west 
     <lb/>
    will go to the people there and point out, 
     <lb/>that the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
     <lb/>Sifton), brave man that he was, clapped a 
     <lb/>pistol to the head of his leader and com<lb break="no"/>pelled him to yield on clause 16, though 
     <lb/>the Minister of Justice had successfully 
     <lb/>deluded all the western members, yet, when 
     <lb/>the ex-Minister of the Interior appeared on 
     <lb/>the scene, his shrewd eyes detected what 
     <lb/>the Minister of Justice desired to incorpor<lb break="no"/>ate in the clause, and made them remedy 
     <lb/>it, making amendments in accordance with 
     <lb/>his views. I say it is the old game of 1896 
     <lb/>played over again—one cry in one province 
     <lb/>and an entirely different cry in another pro<lb break="no"/>vince. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, I was somewhat surprised to hear 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentlemen on the other side from 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec praising this mea<lb break="no"/>sure, considering that they were the great 
     <lb/>
     sticklers for provincial rights in days gone 
     <lb/>
     by. Only a few years ago a Bill was intro<lb break="no"/>duced in this House to create a Dominion 
     <lb/>
     medical council. The object was to allow 
     <lb/>
     our medical practitioners to appear before 
     <lb/>
     the council and boards of examiners that 
     <lb/>
     would allow them the privilege of practising 
     <lb/>
     in any province of the Dominion without 
     <lb/>
     being compelled to submit to an examina<lb break="no"/>tion in the respective provinces. One result 
     <lb/>
     of this would have been that we should have 
     <lb/>
     had the privilege of practising without re<lb break="no"/>gistration in the motherland, a privilege 
     <lb/>
     that is now denied us, because we have no 
     <lb/>
     degree for the Dominion of Canada. It was 
     <lb/>
     provided in this Bill that whenever five or 
     <lb/>
     more provinces passed legislation concurring 
     <lb/>
     with this Bill the measure should become 
     <lb/>
     law. And whence arose the opposition that 
     <lb/>
     prevented the passing of the Bill in that 
     <lb/>
     form ? Why, from these hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     from the province of Quebec, who took 
     <lb/>
     strong grounds against the measure. be<lb break="no"/>cause, as they contended, it was an invasion 
     <lb/>
     of provincial rights. They were so jealous 
     <lb/>
     of their provincial rights, they were so de<lb break="no"/>sirous that no one should practise in their 
     <lb/>
     province without passing their provincial 
     <lb/>
     examination, that they stood in the breach 


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3698</fw>
    

     and compelled the Prime Minister (Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>frid Laurier) to recede from the position he 
     <lb/>
     originally took and to cause the Bill to be 
     <lb/>
     amended so as to provide that it should not 
     <lb/>
     become law until every province in the Do<lb break="no"/>minion had passed concurrent legislation. 
     <lb/>
     And since then, it is this province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec that has stood in the breach and pre<lb break="no"/>vented this concurrent legislation being pass<lb break="no"/>ed. Every other province in the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     has either passed the legislation approving 
     <lb/>
     this Bill or has expressed its willingness 
     <lb/>
     to do so—Quebec is the only one that re<lb break="no"/>fuses. And its ground for refusal is simply 
     <lb/>
     that the Bill would interfere with their pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights. And yet this is the province 
     <lb/>
     whose representatives are refusing provin<lb break="no"/>cial rights to the new provinces in the west.

            <p>
     The hon. member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott), in the course of his speech on 
     <lb/>
     Friday evening last, took occasion to con<lb break="no"/>gratulate—and properly so—the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) upon his ex<lb break="no"/>cellent speech. The hon. member for Qu<lb break="no"/>'Appelle certainly distinguished himself, 
     <lb/>
     both in matter and in manner, and made a 
     <lb/>
     speech which was a credit to himself and 
     <lb/>
     to those who were wise to select him as 
     <lb/>
     their representative. Therefore, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for West Assiniboia was wholly 
     <lb/>
     justified in the compliment he paid. But 
     <lb/>
     before he had finished his compliment— 
     <lb/>
     though not wishing to be at all uncharitable 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. gentleman—it appeared that he 
     <lb/>
     desired to pay himself a compliment, and 
     <lb/>
     took this method of preparing that compli<lb break="no"/>ment for my hon. friend from Qu'Appelle 
     <lb/>
     and then politely handing it to himself. I 
     <lb/>
     do not know whether I have formed a

     time and again, made the most unwarranted

     personal attacks, especially upon the hon.

     member for West Toronto (Mr. Osler), who 
     <lb/>
     is to the hon. gentleman (Mr. Scott) the

     feel that the hon. gentleman has fallen far

     below the high standard which he tells us 
     <lb/>
     he assumed when he came into this House.

     of last Friday to prove the accuracy of 
     <lb/>
     my statement that the hon. gentleman has 
     <lb/>
     fallen away from the high standard which 
     <lb/>
     he says at one time was his. We who had 
     <lb/>
     the privilege of listening to the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man on Friday will realize the very severe 
     <lb/>
     and uncalled for, not to say unkind and 
     <lb/>
     utterly unwarranted, attack which he made 
     <lb/>
     upon the Prime Minister of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. He could scarcely say any<lb break="no"/>thing too bad of that hon. gentleman. He 
     <lb/>
     called him a rank partisan, and said he 
     <lb/>
     was guilty of the grossest misrepresentation 
     <lb/>
     ever indulged in in the whole Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. This hyperbole—let us call it, 
     <lb/>
     though rather a mild term to express our 
     <lb/>
     feelings—gives one an idea of how the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has fallen away from the stan<lb break="no"/>dard which, he says, was his early in his 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary career.

     But the leader of the opposition also came 
     <lb/>
     in for criticism of a most unfair kind in 
     <lb/>
     connection with his speech of last Friday. 
     <lb/>
     Not only was the hon. gentleman unfair to 
     <lb/>
     the premier of the Territories, but he was 
     <lb/>
     most unfair in garbling the utterances of 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition. The leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition had taken a certain stand on 
     <lb/>
     the land clause, he took the position that 
     <lb/>
     these lands should be handed over to the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces, that they should be admin<lb break="no"/>istered by the new provinces in the inter<lb break="no"/>est of the people residing there, and he 
     <lb/>
     took up the argument used by the leader of

     the government and some other hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on that side of the House. contend<lb break="no"/>ing that they should not hand these lands 
     <lb/>
     over, as it might interfere with the immigra<lb break="no"/>tion policy of the Dominion government. 
     <lb/>
     Touching upon that question. the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition spoke as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     lands are handed over to them they will so deal 
     <lb/>

     Now. the hon. member for West Assini<lb break="no"/>boia (Mr. Scott) left out that portion of the

     sentence completely. He started in the 
     <lb/>
     middle of a sentence, and he finished before

     the end of the sentence, finished at a comma

     and tried to create a wrong impression, en<lb break="no"/>tirely contrary to that which the hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition intended to convey to the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House. This is where the 
     <lb/>
     member for West Assiniboia began the

     it would be the task of good statesmanship to

            <p>
     Now, there is a comma, that is where the 
     <lb/>
     member for West Assiniboia stopped, and 
     <lb/>
     he did not quote the following words which 
     <lb/>
     I will now read:

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Had he quoted that last portion of the sen<lb break="no"/>tence it would have done away with the 
     <lb/>
     force of his argument. He tried to make 
     <lb/>
     out that this expression on the part 
     <lb/>
     of the leader of the opposition was 
     <lb/>
     an infringement and a gross violation 
     <lb/>
     of provincial rights. But had he in<lb break="no"/>cluded the latter expression, 'and obtain 
     <lb/>
     the consent of the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories,' of course it would have taken 
     <lb/>
     away entirely the ground for his conten<lb break="no"/>tion. And mark you, Mr. Speaker, this is 
     <lb/>
     the gentleman who is aspiring to the va<lb break="no"/>cant portfolio of the Minister of the Interior. 
     <lb/>
     The member for West Assiniboia has stated 
     <lb/>
     in this House and in public meetings that 
     <lb/>
     he was opposed to the autonomy before the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific Railway tax-exemption 
     <lb/>
     was finally settled: and I am credibly in<lb break="no"/>formed that. either at Moosejaw or Medi<lb break="no"/>cine Hat, during the last campaign, he 
     <lb/>stated that he would vote against an 
     <lb/>Autonomy Bill unless, before that mea<lb break="no"/>sure was produced, the question of the tax 
     <lb/>exemption of the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>was entirely settled, that it would be dan<lb break="no"/>gerous on the part of the Dominion to grant 
     <lb/>autonomy to the Territories before that 
     <lb/>question had been finally adjudicated by the 
     <lb/>Privy Council. Now, has that question been 
     <lb/>finally passed upon? It is true that it has 
     <lb/>passed through the courts of Manitoba, it is 
     <lb/>true that there has been an appeal to the 
     <lb/>Supreme Court, and the decision of the Man<lb break="no"/>itoba courts has been reversed; but it still 
     <lb/>has to run the gauntlet of the Privy Coun<lb break="no"/>cil, and we know how frequently Supreme 
     <lb/>Court decisions are overthrown by the Privy 
     <lb/>Council. Still this question is not settled, 
     <lb/>it is still open for decision, and the member 
     <lb/>for West Assiniboia is giving his hearty 
     <lb/>endorsation and support to this Bill in face 
     <lb/>of the pledges he made to his electors on 
     <lb/>this question.

     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway tax exemption

     <lb/>
     liable to school taxation as long as the area

     was not a province—a right of taxation which

     would not exist to-day had a province or pro<lb break="no"/>vinces been created. Until this judgment was

     If the cases were finally settled there would 
     <lb/>
     no longer be a reason for delay. Until the 
     <lb/>
     cases are finally determined, final settlement of 
     <lb/>
     the autonomy question will remain a matter of 
     <lb/>
     practical impossibility. But the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest contend that the new provinces must 
     <lb/>
     not be handicapped with any such tax exemp<lb break="no"/>tion provisions. We contend that when erect<lb break="no"/>ing the province parliament must negotiate with 
     <lb/>
     the company for abrogation of the rights to ex<lb break="no"/>emption guaranteed to it by its contract. Now 
     <lb/>
     does any sane person think that parliament is 
     <lb/>
     in as good a position to enter into negotiations 
     <lb/>
     now with the Canadian Pacific Railway Com<lb break="no"/>pany for the abrogation of the exemption rights, 
     <lb/>
     as parliament will occupy after the test cases

     The hon. gentleman was very staunch in 
     <lb/>
     the month of November, 1903, in his opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to autonomy being granted to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces at all until this Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway tax exemption case was entirely 
     <lb/>
     out of the way and settled by a decision of 
     <lb/>
     the Privy Council. To-day he is supporting 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, and that question still remains un<lb break="no"/>settled. The hon. gentleman also took strong 
     <lb/>
     grounds in days gone by in favour of one 
     <lb/>
     province. He spoke strongly in favour of 
     <lb/>
     one province, he has written strongly in 
     <lb/>
     favour of one province, and to-day he is 
     <lb/>
     voting in favour of two provinces. For he

     I may be permitted to say that I was myself 
     <lb/>
     quite strongly in favour of the proposition that 
     <lb/>
     only one province should be created ; and even 
     <lb/>
     yet, looking at the question purely from the 
     <lb/>
     local and territorial point of view, I can see no 
     <lb/>
     reason why one government, one legislature, 
     <lb/>
     one set of machinery, should not have been

     Still he is voting for a Bill that provides 
     <lb/>
     for two provinces. He also took exception 
     <lb/>
     to the boundaries: he claimed that the pres<lb break="no"/>ent eastern boundary of the district of Al<lb break="no"/>berta should have been the dividing line. 
     <lb/>
     That is not the dividing line under this Bill, 
     <lb/>
     but he is supporting the Bill with all the 
     <lb/>
     enthusiasm at his disposal. And, Mr. Speak<lb break="no"/>er, while he is doing this he is calling the 
     <lb/>
     premier of the Territories, Mr. Haultain, a 
     <lb/>
     rabid partisan because he advocates the 


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3702</fw>


     very same things, and because he has been 
     <lb/>
     consistent enough to maintain his position. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for West Assiniboia also 
     <lb/>
     took strong ground in the past in favour of 
     <lb/>
     having the land retained by the provinces 
     <lb/>
     or handed over to the provinces; he took that 
     <lb/>
     ground in the year 1901, as quoted in 'Han<lb break="no"/>sard' in the following words:

     Here was a strong expression of that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman in favour of having all the 
     <lb/>
     lands handed over to the provinces. And 
     <lb/>
     what does he give as a reason for changing 
     <lb/>
     his opinion in this regard ? He says that 
     <lb/>
     owing to his youth and inexperience he 
     <lb/>
     gave voice to opinion which was looked 
     <lb/>
     at in 1905 as an inaccuracy, that, as a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of fact these other provinces were not 
     <lb/>
     put in possession, but they merely retained 
     <lb/>
     possession of their own lands. Then, he

     says :

     The hon. gentleman evidently has not 
     <lb/>
     got over his youth or he would not play the 
     <lb/>
     part of a weathercock politician being waft<lb break="no"/>ed hither and thither by every speech that 
     <lb/>
     is made in this House. We want a strong 
     <lb/>
     man at the head of the Department of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior. We do not want a man who is 
     <lb/>
     changing his opinions every day. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman states that he has changed his 
     <lb/>
     opinion on this question and he gives as 
     <lb/>
     his reason that he was influenced by the 
     <lb/>
     speeches made by the hon. member for Ed<lb break="no"/>monton (Mr. Oliver) and the hon. ex-Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior (Mr. Sifton). Now, he has 
     <lb/>
     been speaking on public platforms in the 
     <lb/>
     past, he has been associated with his fellow 
     <lb/>
     westerners and he knew what their opinions 
     <lb/>
     were on this question. He has conversed 
     <lb/>
     with them in private and in public, but it 
     <lb/>
     only remains after these Bills are introduc<lb break="no"/>ed and after he has listened to a couple of 
     <lb/>
     speeches in this House that were probably 
     <lb/>
     repeated to him in private on many occas<lb break="no"/>ions for the hon. gentleman to change his 
     <lb/>
     opinion. Under these auspices he gave ut<lb break="no"/>terance to the following statement in this 
     <lb/>

     But I may say, that in 1901, when I made that

            <p>
     In other words the hon. gentleman went 
     <lb/>
     forth as a missionary to instruct and to 
     <lb/>
     convert the people in the eastern provinces 
     <lb/>
     to his view-point as to this land question 
     <lb/>
     with the result that the hon. gentleman was 
     <lb/>
     converted himself. He is drawing rather 
     <lb/>
     a long bow when he says that these opin<lb break="no"/>ions found no general acceptance in this 
     <lb/>
     House because my hon. friend the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition has given voice to these 
     <lb/>
     same opinions for years past. In his speeches 
     <lb/>
     in the west and in this House during all 
     <lb/>
     the years that this autonomy question has 
     <lb/>
     been discussed in parliament he has expres<lb break="no"/>sed his opinion in favour of handing these 
     <lb/>
     lands over to the provinces. If the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for West Assiniboia has not stated, 
     <lb/>
     some other hon. gentlemen have stated that 
     <lb/>
     one reason why these lands should not be 
     <lb/>
     handed over to the new provinces is that 
     <lb/>
     they might be at the mercy of land specu<lb break="no"/>lators. Fancy under provincial management 
     <lb/>
     these lands being more likely to be exploit<lb break="no"/>ed than if they were under the management 
     <lb/>
     of the ex-Minister of the Interior and his 
     <lb/>
     officials of recent years! Under provincial 
     <lb/>
     management would there have been 250,000 
     <lb/>
     acres of wheat lands handed over to the 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan Valley Land Company at $1 
     <lb/>
     an acre ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When this matter was up in the House 
     <lb/>
     for debate that hon. gentleman was forced 
     <lb/>
     to admit that 150,000 of these 250,000 acres 
     <lb/>
     had been handed over practically illegally, 
     <lb/>
     because he did not know whether the con<lb break="no"/>ditions of settlement had been complied 
     <lb/>
     with or not. He admitted that there had 
     <lb/>
     been no inspection to see whether the set<lb break="no"/>tlers were on the land or not, and when he 
     <lb/>
     was pressed further he admitted that they 
     <lb/>
     had been handed over without his know<lb break="no"/>ledge, without the knowledge of his deputy 
     <lb/>
     and without their consent and that when 
     <lb/>
     they found that out they gave orders that 
     <lb/>
     no more lands were to be handed over until 
     <lb/>
     an inspection had been made. After the 
     <lb/>
     horse was stolen they ordered the stable 
     <lb/>
     door to be locked. When pressed still fur<lb break="no"/>ther to state who had done this, what was 
     <lb/>
     his reply?—an official of the government; 
     <lb/>
     and when pressed still further to state what 
     <lb/>
     was that official's name, the ex-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior stated that he did not know. 
     <lb/>
     Fancy the responsible head of the depart<lb break="no"/>ment, responsible for all the transactions tak<lb break="no"/>ing place under his administration finding out 
     <lb/>
     that 150,000 acres of land had been illegally 
     <lb/>
     handed over to a company without comply<lb break="no"/>ing with the conditions—having beside him 
     <lb/>
     his deputy who was an official of the 
     <lb/>
     government—and never taking the trouble 
     <lb/>
     to inquire that official's name! Well, we 
     <lb/>
     are very gullible sometimes on this side 
     <lb/>
     of the House, but we are scarcely so gullible

     as to give credence to such a statement as 
     <lb/>
     that except in the parliamentary sense. 'I

     be able to explain who this official was who

     the history of any country can show as much

     find it in the ordinances. That is true : but

     <lb/>
     speak of a policy which the people of this

     country ought to be proud of and to this policy 
     <lb/>
     has to be added the statesmanlike proposals

     Mr. Scott was so strongly in favour of Mr.

     Haultain then, that he wrote and spoke 
     <lb/>
     strongly in his support. To-day, Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain maintains exactly the position he took 
     <lb/>
     in this Bill of rights of his and for which he 
     <lb/>
     received the endorsation of the electors of 
     <lb/>
     the west, but Mr. Scott is no longer sup<lb break="no"/>porting him. Which do you consider the

     rank partisan ; the man who sticks to his 
     <lb/>
     old-time policy, or the man who, because 
     <lb/>
     of party feelings has sunk his personal con<lb break="no"/>victions and his past record, and who to-day 
     <lb/>
     supports a Bill that gives two provinces in<lb break="no"/>stead of one ; that does not fix the boun<lb break="no"/>daries as the people of the Territories wished 
     <lb/>
     them to be fixed ; that refuses the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces the ownership of their public domain, 
     <lb/>
     and that takes away from these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces the control of education. As a usual 
     <lb/>
     thing, I do not read copious extracts, but I 
     <lb/>
     have on this occasion to borrow the habit 
     <lb/>
     from the member for West Assiniboia, be<lb break="no"/>cause it is only right that the members of

     This again is Mr. Scott's language. The 
     <lb/>
     other day the hon. gentleman (Mr. Scott) 
     <lb/>
     told us that he based his present action very 
     <lb/>
     largely on the fact that when the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories Act was put through the House 
     <lb/>
     in 1875, the Hon. George Brown took a cer<lb break="no"/>tain position which he proposed to follow. 
     <lb/>
     For instance, the hon. member for West 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     And George Brown who did not support the 
     <lb/>
     legislation ; what did he say ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The moment this Act passed and the North<lb break="no"/>west became part of the union, they came under 
     <lb/>
     the Union Act, and under the provisions with 
     <lb/>
     regard to separate schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the face of that language, if the late Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Brown were still alive and had a seat in this 
     <lb/>
     House and were confronting the legislation 
     <lb/>
     which we have before us, what would he do ? 
     <lb/>
     Support the protection to minority rights ? 
     <lb/>
     Certainly. That therefore should I do even if 
     <lb/>
     I might be as violent an opponent of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools as Mr. Brown was.

            <p>
     It will be noticed that the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott) speaks out for the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     minority. What rights ? The rights they 
     <lb/>
     secured under the Act of 1875. But these 
     <lb/>
     are not the rights the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Scott) is contending for, because he says 
     <lb/>
     the rights given the minority under the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1875 have been whittled away by the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial government so that with one breath 
     <lb/>
     he contradicts what he say with another. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman takes the position that 
     <lb/>
     George Brown was in favour of these rights 
     <lb/>
     that were to be maintained for all time 
     <lb/>
     once they were crystallized into law, and he 
     <lb/>
     says that he takes the same ground as 
     <lb/>
     George Brown, but as a matter of fact the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman (Mr. Scott) is only contend<lb break="no"/>ing to-day for minority rights which he says 
     <lb/>
     are far less than were given to the minority 
     <lb/>
     under the Act of 1875. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     for West Assiniboia further says :

     <lb/>
     by reason of compact—can he point to any 
     <lb/>
     province in the Dominion that has not ab<lb break="no"/>solute control over its educational system. 
     <lb/>
     If he cannot point to any other such pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and I challenge him to do so, then 
     <lb/>
     what becomes of his contention that the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces are going to be placed in the 
     <lb/>
     same full enjoyment of provincial rights as 
     <lb/>
     any other province is in the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The hon. gentleman was also inac<lb break="no"/>curate when he said that the draft Bill of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain contained provisions that would 
     <lb/>
     have perpetuated ecclesiastical schools. Well, 
     <lb/>
     the framer of that draft Bill does not agree 
     <lb/>
     with the hon. member for West Assiniboia. 
     <lb/>
     The framer of that draft Bill meant that 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act should apply 
     <lb/>
     which gives sole control to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     over educational affairs. When the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member (Mr. Scott), in order to suit his own 
     <lb/>
     party purposes, desires to read into that 
     <lb/>
     draft Bill a meaning that the framers of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill never intended it should have, he is 
     <lb/>
     taking a stand which he cannot maintain for 
     <lb/>
     one moment. Of course he is privileged to 
     <lb/>
     read into the draft Bill any ignorant mean<lb break="no"/>ing he may desire, but his doing so will not 
     <lb/>
     change the true intent of those who framed 
     <lb/>
     that clause. That clause was drafted, as I 
     <lb/>
     understand, under the guidance and direc<lb break="no"/>tion of the premier of the Territories, and 
     <lb/>
     of the present Chief Justice Sifton and his 
     <lb/>
     then deputy, the present Judge Harvey. 
     <lb/>
     These gentlemen decided that the clause 
     <lb/>
     should be drafted so that the provinces 
     <lb/>
     should have absolute control over their edu<lb break="no"/>cational affairs, and Mr. Haultain so inter<lb break="no"/>prets the clause to-day, and indeed it is 
     <lb/>
     the only sane interpretation it will hear. I 
     <lb/>
     do not wish to discuss this from a legal 
     <lb/>
     point of view, although my lay opinion might 
     <lb/>
     be equally as good as that of the member 
     <lb/>
     for West Assiniboia ; I simply give you the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the leader of the Territorial Ex<lb break="no"/>ecutive on the matter, who says that this 
     <lb/>
     draft Bill was framed in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the desire of the people of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     to control their own educational affairs, and 
     <lb/>
     that it was sent down to the Ottawa gov<lb break="no"/>ernment with that object in view. And, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, if that draft Bill had the meaning which 
     <lb/>
     the member for West Assiniboia attaches to 
     <lb/>
     it, how is it that the right hon. the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister, astute as he is, and now is it that 
     <lb/>
     the lynx-eyed Postmaster General did not 
     <lb/>
     discover such a meaning ? They are both 
     <lb/>
     legal gentlemen learned in the law, and yet 
     <lb/>
     it remained for the layman from West Assi<lb break="no"/>niboia to read into the Territorial draft Bill 
     <lb/>
     a meaning that the Prime Minister of Can<lb break="no"/>ada and the Postmaster General failed to 
     <lb/>
     see. The member for West Assiniboia has 
     <lb/>
     stated that if he were one of the minority he 
     <lb/>
     would never consent to taking out of this 
     <lb/>
     Bill the guarantee of separate schools. 
     <lb/>
     In one breath the hon. gentleman states :

     We have practically no separate schools up

     He takes exactly the opposite ground

     Finance because the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     states that if this Bill becomes law the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools, the few there are, will dis<lb break="no"/>appear. That in effect is his argument and 
     <lb/>
     that is the impression made on this House. 
     <lb/>
     But the hon. member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott) says that if this guarantee is

     cut out then the only vestige of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools which they have will disappear and 
     <lb/>
     that in the not distant future. The hon.

     gentleman has quoted very extensively from 
     <lb/>
     some comments made in the press in the

     If western members consent to and vote for

     anything less than this they are traitors to the

     <lb/>
     full provincial autonomy. Anything less than 
     <lb/>
     complete control over education and schools is 
     <lb/>
     not autonomy. . . . We want none of our 
     <lb/>
     people enslaved, but everybody free even unto 
     <lb/>
     the whole people. Sir Wilfrid proposes to put 
     <lb/>
     every citizen of the new provinces into slavery 
     <lb/>
     by not giving full provincial rights. An agi<lb break="no"/>tation for full control of education by the new

     provinces is, as we take it, an agitation for the 
     <lb/>
     freedom of Catholic and Protestant alike. We 
     <lb/>
     are not discussing the merits of separate or 
     <lb/>
     public schools, but the just right of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to deal with the question without federal

     Now Mr. Speaker, I have quoted these 
     <lb/>
     somewhat lengthy extracts to combat the 
     <lb/>
     contention of the hon. member for West 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) that the people are 
     <lb/>
     largely satisfied with the Autonomy Bill 
     <lb/>
     now engaging the attention of parliament. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman quoted from an inter<lb break="no"/>view with the Rev. Dr. Chown, in which it 
     <lb/>
     was stated that the doctor at a public meet<lb break="no"/>ing at Toronto had stated that he was pre<lb break="no"/>sent in Regina at the time word was re<lb break="no"/>ceived of the provisions of the Autonomy 
     <lb/>
     Bill and that there was not a word of dis<lb break="no"/>cussion raised about the educational clauses. 
     <lb/>
     I shall read what Dr. Chown says in a letter 
     <lb/>
     to the editor of the 'Globe' in to-night's 
     <lb/>

     To the editor of the 'Globe': I notice in 
     <lb/>
     the 'Globe's' report of the address of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Walter Scott, M.P., of Regina, made in the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons yesterday, a statement is 
     <lb/>
     attributed to me, to the effect that the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest were satisfied with the 
     <lb/>
     Laurier government's solution of the school 
     <lb/>
     difiiculty. He may have been misled by a news<lb break="no"/>paper report, but I certainly did not make 
     <lb/>
     such a statement, as I have no means of know<lb break="no"/>ing the present facts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The only public utterance I have made about 
     <lb/>
     the school question was at a meeting of the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Rights Committee in Toronto, at 
     <lb/>
     which time, speaking to a motion made by Dr. 
     <lb/>
     Bruce, to petition the House of Commons, the 
     <lb/>
     Senate and the Governor General, praying that 
     <lb/>
     no further steps be taken until the people in<lb break="no"/>terested have an opportunity of expressing 
     <lb/>
     themselves upon the issue, I said that I had 
     <lb/>
     been in the Northwest for some time during 
     <lb/>
     the election contest, and I could bear testi<lb break="no"/>mony to the fact that the school question was 
     <lb/>
     not discussed at all, and that the vote of Nov<lb break="no"/>ember last could not be taken as expressing any 
     <lb/>
     opinion upon the matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I quite agree with Mr. Scott, as reported in 
     <lb/>
     the ' Globe' of Saturday, that the school ques<lb break="no"/>tion was not an issue at all in the last elec<lb break="no"/>

     tion,' but from that fact I argued that, inas<lb break="no"/>much as it was kept in the background, the 
     <lb/>
     people interested in such a matter should be 
     <lb/>
     heard before the parliament of Canada finally 
     <lb/>
     pass upon the question. Mr. Scott argues that 
     <lb/>
     because the issue was not discussed the people 
     <lb/>
     must be satisfied with the provisions of a Bill 
     <lb/>
     of which they then had no knowledge. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     From this conclusion I must dissent, and I 
     <lb/>
     may say that, in the interests of a common, 
     <lb/>
     enlightened and progressive citizenship, I 
     <lb/>
     regret exceedingly that any school system 
     <lb/>
     which will segregate different sections of the 
     <lb/>
     population during the early years of their 
     <lb/>
     education, and give a different colouring to their 
     <lb/>
     civic and national ideals, is about to be fasten<lb break="no"/>ed upon the people yet to inhabit our magni<lb break="no"/>ficent heritable in the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe a solution of sectarian difficulties 
     <lb/>
     should be and will yet be possible, in the form 
     <lb/>
     of a system of Christian morality upon which 
     <lb/>
     all varieties of opinion may agree, to be taught 
     <lb/>
     in all the schools of the country.

     The hon. gentleman saw fit to refer to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bulyea. He wondered if Mr. Bulyea had 
     <lb/>
     been present with Mr. Haultain in his in<lb break="no"/>terviews with the leader of the opposition. 
     <lb/>
     Well, I know whereof I speak when I say 
     <lb/>
     that from the time the premier of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories came to Ottawa at the request of 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the government to discuss this 
     <lb/>
     question, until this Bill was introduced into 
     <lb/>
     this House, he absolutely refused to discuss 
     <lb/>
     it with any one, either Liberal or Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive, because, as he said, he did not think 
     <lb/>
     it would be proper to enter into a discus<lb break="no"/>sion with anybody upon this question while 
     <lb/>
     he was negotiating with the government. 
     <lb/>
     But when this Bill was brought before par<lb break="no"/>liament and its provisions made public, he 
     <lb/>
     considered he was no longer under any re<lb break="no"/>straint, and has since discussed it with 
     <lb/>
     both Liberals and Conservatives, and as 
     <lb/>
     freely, frankly and thoroughly with the one 
     <lb/>
     as with the other. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not Wish to trespass at any further 
     <lb/>
     length on the patience of the House. I 
     <lb/>
     simply desired more particularly to criticise 
     <lb/>
     the three leading features, the question of 
     <lb/>
     the boundary of Manitoba, the land ques<lb break="no"/>tion and the educational clauses. As to the 
     <lb/>
     first, I think I have convinced the House 
     <lb/>
     that the reasonable request of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba has been contemptuously treat<lb break="no"/>ed. I see that the premier of Ontario, tak<lb break="no"/>ing his cue from the right hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     speech, has filed a claim for a certain por<lb break="no"/>tion of Keewatin, and also that the new 
     <lb/>
     Quebec premier has expressed his intention 
     <lb/>
     to make a similar requisition on behalf of 
     <lb/>
     that province. It is evident that the object 
     <lb/>
     of the right hon. gentleman is being accom<lb break="no"/>plished, but in the meantime the people of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba are in a state of unrest and ex<lb break="no"/>citement. As to the land policy, in my judg<lb break="no"/>ment the government have no reasonable 
     <lb/>
     ground, either from a constitutional point of 
     <lb/>
     view or from the point of view of public 
     <lb/>
     policy, in withholding those lands from the 
     <lb/>
     province. In my opinion also, the open let<lb break="no"/>
                  
            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3712</fw>
           
     ter of the premier of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, protesting against the manner in 
     <lb/>
     which the provisions of his draft Bill were 
     <lb/>
     disregarded, cavalierly treated and passed 
     <lb/>
     over, does not contain one expression which 
     <lb/>
     any reasonable man can attribute to parti<lb break="no"/>sanship, unless it be partisan to be con<lb break="no"/>sistent. But if abandoning the very things 
     <lb/>
     which Mr. Haultain had provided for in 
     <lb/>
     his draft Bill, and which had received the 
     <lb/>
     support of the territorial assembly, and even 
     <lb/>
     that of the hon. member for West Assini<lb break="no"/>boia ; if abandoning every claim put for<lb break="no"/>ward on behalf of the Territories, be con<lb break="no"/>sistency, then I am willing to give the palm 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott). As to the educational clauses, 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion they are an interference in 
     <lb/>
     matters of purely provincial concern. I be<lb break="no"/>lieve them to be unconstitutional and im<lb break="no"/>politic. High legal authorities, such as Sir 
     <lb/>
     Louis Davies, judge of the Supreme Court, 
     <lb/>
     has declared that this parliament had not 
     <lb/>
     the right to interfere in the school policy of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories ; and should this question 
     <lb/>
     ever come up before him for adjudication, 
     <lb/>
     he would, if he desired to be consistent, feel 
     <lb/>
     bound to give an opinion in accord with the 
     <lb/>
     views he expressed in parliament. I have 
     <lb/>
     here the opinion he expressed. It has been 
     <lb/>
     quoted in this House before, but you cannot 
     <lb/>
     emphasize a good opinion too frequently. 
     <lb/>
     This is what Sir Louis Davies said in 1891, 
     <lb/>
     when the territorial charter was under con<lb break="no"/>sideration :

     that when that time comes (the time to erect

     <lb/>

     for me in dealing with the subject under 
     <lb/>
     discussion. My hon. friend started out by 
     <lb/>
     finding fault with the land policy of this

     government. But that policy, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     is not a new one. It is not a policy of to-day 
     <lb/>
     or yesterday, but one which was laid down

     by a gentleman who had about as able a 
     <lb/>
     mastery of public affairs in this country as 
     <lb/>
     any man who ever lived in it. I refer to 
     <lb/>
     the Rt. Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald, the

     greatest leader of which the party to which 
     <lb/>

     was he who laid down the land policy we

     policy my hon. friend is setting himself at 
     <lb/>
     issue with that great leader.

            <p>
     The right hon. Sir John Macdonald, in 
     <lb/>
     1870, laid down the land policy of this coun<lb break="no"/>try. In 1872 he went to the country and 
     <lb/>
     was sustained. In 1878 he was returned to 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     in the general elections of 1882, 1887 and 
     <lb/>
     1891. I should say that was a suflicient 
     <lb/>
     test of the policy of Sir John Macdonald 
     <lb/>
     so far as the land question is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     and that it is rather too late in the day now 
     <lb/>
     to declare that it is a policy that should not 
     <lb/>
     be followed in this country. A few days ago 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Foster) laid down a doctrine, which, if it is 
     <lb/>
     a wise one in regard to the matter to which 
     <lb/>
     he referred, would be equally wise here. 
     <lb/>
     Speaking of the school question, he said 
     <lb/>
     that the people of this country had recog<lb break="no"/>nized the wisdom of the policy of the Lib<lb break="no"/>eral party in 1896, and again in 1900, and 
     <lb/>
     again in 1904, and, so far as he was con<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3714</fw>
            cerned, he would not bother with the subject 
     <lb/>
     any longer, but would let well enough alone. 
     <lb/>
     I say if that was a wise policy with respect 
     <lb/>
     to the school question it is equally wise with 
     <lb/>
     respect to the land policy of Sir John Mac<lb break="no"/>donald which has been so often approved by 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country. I submit that 
     <lb/>
     not only did the country generally com<lb break="no"/>mend that policy, but the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, in which the policy was first put in 
     <lb/>
     operation, has, if I am correctly informed, 
     <lb/>
     always given a handsome majority to the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party of which Sir John Mac<lb break="no"/>donald was the head. When the land 
     <lb/>
     policy of Sir John Macdonald has been 
     <lb/>
     approved by the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     for thirty-five years, I think it comes 
     <lb/>
     —I will not say with ill grace but— 
     <lb/>
     with little force from the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. W. J. Roche) to find fault with the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laur<lb break="no"/>ier), because he continues that policy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, the hon, member for Marquette 
     <lb/>
     makes an onslaught on this government, 
     <lb/>
     and especially on the Prime Minister, be<lb break="no"/>cause he does not change the boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     the province. I understood my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Roche) to be strongly in favour of 
     <lb/>
     provincial rights and as strongly against 
     <lb/>
     anything that would interfere with those 
     <lb/>
     rights without the provinces being con<lb break="no"/>sulted. I happen to have in my hand 
     <lb/>
     the statute on this particular question 
     <lb/>
     showing that it is not open to any 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister or government to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the question exactly as he may 
     <lb/>
     think proper. I gather from what the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman (Mr. W. J. Roche) says 
     <lb/>
     that if there were a provision in this Bill 
     <lb/>
     extending the boundaries of Manitoba and 
     <lb/>
     making half a dozen other changes in the 
     <lb/>
     boundaries of Ontario, Quebec and other 
     <lb/>
     provinces, he would support it. But the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman must not forget that we have 
     <lb/>
     no powers to deal indiscriminately with the 
     <lb/>
     dividing lines between provinces. There 
     <lb/>
     is an Act of the imperial parliament regulat<lb break="no"/>ing matters of this kind; and, before we 
     <lb/>
     do anything about changing our neighbours' 
     <lb/>
     land mark, we must consider that statute 
     <lb/>
     that we may comply with it. It reads as 
     <lb/>
     follows :

     my hon. friend (Mr D. D. McKenzie) to be 
     <lb/>
     under the impression that, in order to in<lb break="no"/>corporate into the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     some portion of the territory which is now 
     <lb/>
     comprised in the Northwest Territories, it 
     <lb/>
     would be necessary to have the consent of 
     <lb/>
     the legislatures of Ontario or Quebec ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCKE4">Mr. D. D. McKENZIE</persName>. The Act says 
     <lb/>
     that, if they are likely to be affected by it 
     <lb/>
     they must be consulted. Of course, we 
     <lb/>
     must leave something for the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister to judge for himself. If, in his judg<lb break="no"/>ment, Quebec and Ontario are likely to be 
     <lb/>
     affected, he is bound to consult those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I think it is perfectly clear that it 
     <lb/>
     is not a matter that can be jumped at with<lb break="no"/>out full consideration. Though a man from 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba might say that this matter does 
     <lb/>
     not affect Quebec and Ontario, it is perfect<lb break="no"/>ly clear that the Prime Ministers of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     and Quebec do not think so, for the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Mr. W. J. Roche) tells us that 
     <lb/>
     they have filed claims with this govern<lb break="no"/>ment to be considered in the division of 
     <lb/>
     this territory. Therefore, this important 
     <lb/>
     statute clearly comes into operation here 
     <lb/>
     and its terms must be complied with. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, my hon. friend (Mr. W. J. Roche) 
     <lb/>
     has gone further, to deal with land policy. 
     <lb/>
     He finds fault with the government— 
     <lb/>
     and, consequently with all Conservative gov<lb break="no"/>ernments that have existed in this country 
     <lb/>
     up to the present time—because they bor<lb break="no"/>rowed their land policy from the United 
     <lb/>
     States. I do not think it makes much dif<lb break="no"/>ference whence we get a policy, so long 
     <lb/>
     as it is a good policy. If any rule of life 
     <lb/>
     that we follow is a good one, it is not wise 
     <lb/>
     for us to cast aside or neglect it because it 
     <lb/>
     happens to be in use in the United States. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think that any hon. gentleman in 
     <lb/>
     this House will say that the land policy of 
     <lb/>
     the United States has not been a success so 
     <lb/>
     far as immigration is concerned, or so far as 
     <lb/>
     development is concerned so far as attract<lb break="no"/>ing the people is concerned and their suc<lb break="no"/>cess after they have gone to the United 
     <lb/>
     States. I think we would be only too glad 
     <lb/>
     if we could get as many people into our 
     <lb/>
     country and as good a class as they are 
     <lb/>
     getting through the land policy they have. 
     <lb/>
     Now, it has been pointed out that the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces would do better in the handling of 
     <lb/>
     these lands than the central government. 
     <lb/>
     That may be so, but one thing is certain— 
     <lb/>
     that in the United States, if we can copy 
     <lb/>
     them, they have not followed that policy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The States have had nothing to do with 
     <lb/>
     the public domain except possibly in their 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3716</fw>
           
     early history they were formed into states, 
     <lb/>
     exactly as Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces when they came into 
     <lb/>
     the union. I think they held what lands 
     <lb/>
     they had then, except that some were 
     <lb/>
     passed over to the central government un<lb break="no"/>der certain arrangements ; but any lands 
     <lb/>
     they had acquired after the United States 
     <lb/>
     had been formed under one government, 
     <lb/>
     were held by the central government and one 
     <lb/>
     policy prevailed in respect to the whole of 
     <lb/>
     them. I submit that it is in the interests 
     <lb/>
     of this country to have one policy and one 
     <lb/>
     management of the public domain, one sys<lb break="no"/>tem in respect to immigration, and one price 
     <lb/>
     for the lands, in order to avoid as much as 
     <lb/>
     possible a conflict of management between 
     <lb/>
     half a dozen different governments.

     constitutional point with respect to which I 
     <lb/>
     took the liberty of interrupting my hon.

     friend a moment ago, I do not find in the 
     <lb/>
     statute these words to which he referred: 
     <lb/>
     ' Likely to be affected thereby.' I did not 
     <lb/>
     contradict my hon. friend, because I thought 
     <lb/>
     he would be exact in his quotation. It says :

     it, but when we are dealing with the great 
     <lb/>
     west we do not pay attention to trifling 
     <lb/>
     things. The difference is certainly very 
     <lb/>
     slight, and it was hardly worth my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's while to bother with it. It is cer<lb break="no"/>tainly clear that the intention of that sta<lb break="no"/>tute was that any province to be affected by 
     <lb/>
     the change should be consulted, that there 
     <lb/>
     should be legislation upon the subject, and 
     <lb/>
     it is only by concurrent legislation on the 
     <lb/>
     part of each government that they can deal 
     <lb/>
     with it effectively. The question would not 
     <lb/>
     be settled if we were first to start out to 
     <lb/>
     deal with it effectively. The question would 
     <lb/>
     not be settled if we were first to start out 
     <lb/>
     to deal with it without the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     others, and without that consent being ob<lb break="no"/>tained according to the statute. Although I 
     <lb/>
     may not be correct according to the very let<lb break="no"/>ter of the law, I am certainly not so far 
     <lb/>
     wrong as to justify the member from Mar<lb break="no"/>quette (Mr. W. J. Roche) in saying that we 
     <lb/>
     are violating the constitution and doing a 
     <lb/>
     whole lot of wrong things because we did 
     <lb/>
     not deal with this question the right way. 
     <lb/>
     Now I think those two points as to whe<lb break="no"/>ther it is the duty of the government to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question as a public policy for the

     whole country, or whether it is better to

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I will deal briefly with another point 
     <lb/>
     mentioned by the hon. gentleman with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the literature that was sent out 
     <lb/>
     broadcast and what it said about the char<lb break="no"/>acter of the schools. If a pamphlet that 
     <lb/>
     has been sent out lately is such as the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has stated, and I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     it is, I can only tell my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     that it is very different from some literature 
     <lb/>
     of that character that was sent out in 1881 
     <lb/>
     when the hon. gentleman's friends were lead<lb break="no"/>ing the government of this country. The 
     <lb/>
     Department of Agriculture sent out a 
     <lb/>
     pamphlet making the following reference to 
     <lb/>
     the subject of education : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The school system was based upon that of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, that is to say, that Catholics have an 
     <lb/>
     absolute control and complete direction of the 
     <lb/>
     education of their children, and that Protest<lb break="no"/>ants possess exactly the same rights. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That pamphlet was sent out in 1881 when 
     <lb/>
     Sir John A. Macdonald and his friends had 
     <lb/>
     control of the government, and when the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1875 was fresh in their minds. They 
     <lb/>
     sent this pamphlet broadcast over Europe, 
     <lb/>
     wherever immigrants could be induced to 
     <lb/>
     come to this country and settle in our North<lb break="no"/>west ; they were told that the same system 
     <lb/>
     of schools prevailed there that prevailed in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and that people of the faith of our 
     <lb/>
     Ontario friends would find there exactly the 
     <lb/>
     kind of education that is given in Ontario. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, I will proceed to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the constitutional question that is in<lb break="no"/>volved in this discussion though I will not 
     <lb/>
     presume that I can deal with it satisfactorily 
     <lb/>
     to everybody. I propose to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     subject under three different phases. First, 
     <lb/>
     I would ask what power have we in res<lb break="no"/>pect to this question ? What should we do 
     <lb/>
     with that power or how should we exercise 
     <lb/>
     it if we have any power in this matter ? 
     <lb/>
     Now the first thing I find in this constitution 
     <lb/>
     of ours states that the Dominion of Canada 
     <lb/>
     shall be united with a constitution similar 
     <lb/>
     to that and based upon the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain and Ireland. We start out 
     <lb/>
     with that declaration in our constitution, it 
     <lb/>
     is not a hard and fast constitution that is 
     <lb/>
     unbending, that we cannot change one way 
     <lb/>
     or the other ; it is a constitution similar in 
     <lb/>
     principle to that of the United Kingdom of 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain and Ireland. Those of us who 
     <lb/>
     know anything about the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain know how elastic it is, how 
     <lb/>
     it is made to suit various conditions, how it 
     <lb/>
     can be capable of taking under its folds all 
     <lb/>
     conditons of men. When we remember that 
     <lb/>
     we are attracting into our Northwest the 
     <lb/>
     very classes of people that go to make up 
     <lb/>
     the British empire we will realize at once 
     <lb/>
     that we need just such a constitution as 
     <lb/>
     that of the United Kingdom to enable us to 
     <lb/>
     deal with all these people as successfully as 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain deals with them. Now, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, we have a constitution in our hands 
     <lb/>
    that is not a hard and fast instrument, we 

<cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3718</fw>

     have to deal with certain conditions in this 
     <lb/>
     country to-day and I think it would be well 
     <lb/>
     for us to keep constantly before our minds 
     <lb/>
     that our constitution is based upon the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish constitution that is able to govern mil<lb break="no"/>lions of people in the Indies, millions of 
     <lb/>
     people in the other parts of the world, and 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of thousands if not millions of 
     <lb/>
     people in South Africa. In adjusting that 
     <lb/>
     constitution to our own conditions will 
     <lb/>
     it be said that we cannot without a wrench 
     <lb/>
     and a violation of our institutions in this 
     <lb/>
     country and the foundations of the state, 
     <lb/>
     make that constitution that is equal in 
     <lb/>
     principle to the British constitution apply 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces of the west-? Now, very 
     <lb/>
     shortly after confederation steps were 
     <lb/>
     taken to bring in the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     In order to understand this question aright 
     <lb/>
     we should follow as nearly as possible the 
     <lb/>
     steps that were taken in this connection. 
     <lb/>
     First we find the parliament of Canada pre<lb break="no"/>senting an address asking Her Gracious 
     <lb/>
     Majesty to admit Rupert's Land and the 
     <lb/>

     the following terms and conditions, being the 
     <lb/>
     terms and conditions still remaining to be per<lb break="no"/>formed of those embodied in the said second 
     <lb/>
     address of the parliament of Canada and ap<lb break="no"/>proved ot by Her Majesty as aforesaid :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. Canada is to pay to the company £300,000 
     <lb/>
     when Rupert's Land is transferred to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     These are simply the steps that have been 
     <lb/>
     taken in regard to this land—in the first in<lb break="no"/>stance the conveyance of the title to the 
     <lb/>
     land to Her Majesty, taking it back from the 
     <lb/>
     company; in the next place granting to the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada the powers they ask 
     <lb/>
     for to deal with this country, to make laws 
     <lb/>
     in respect to it and to exercise full control 
     <lb/>
     over it. Now, there is another matter of 
     <lb/>
     importance in view of the discussion which 
     <lb/>
     is now taking place in this House. What 
     <lb/>
     seems to be worrying us now is whether or 
     <lb/>
     not we have jurisdiction to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     question, whether or not we have jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion to give a constitution to these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. That is where some of our friends 
     <lb/>
     seem to find a difficulty. They say that the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty is not that they are not willing 
     <lb/>
     to extend these powers, but they question 
     <lb/>
     whether under the constitution they have 
     <lb/>
     the authority to do so. They would make 
     <lb/>
     us believe that they would be willing and 
     <lb/>
     pleased to extend these powers, but they 
     <lb/>
     say they cannot get away from the princi<lb break="no"/>ples of the constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That seems to be the position they take. 
     <lb/>
     Very shortly after confederation it became 
     <lb/>
     apparent to those governing Canada, that 
     <lb/>
     they would have to create new provinces in 
     <lb/>
     the Territories, and Sir John Macdonald was 
     <lb/>
     clear enough in his judgment and sound 
     <lb/>
     enough in his constitutional law to see that 
     <lb/>
     it would be necessary for him to get certain 
     <lb/>
     additional powers for this purpose. We 
     <lb/>
     need not speculate as to what Sir John Mac<lb break="no"/>donald wanted, because he set forth his 
     <lb/>
     wish in a letter to Lord Kimberley, then 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of State for the Colonies, in which 
     <lb/>
     he wrote that he wanted an Act confirming 
     <lb/>
     the Act of the Canadian parliament 3-3 Vic<lb break="no"/>toria, chapter 3, as if it had been passed as 
     <lb/>
     an imperial statute. He further wrote that 
     <lb/>
     he wanted authority: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     To empower the Dominion parliament from 
     <lb/>
     time to time to establish other provinces in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories with such local govern<lb break="no"/>ment, legislature and constitution, as it may 
     <lb/>
     think proper, provided that no such local gov<lb break="no"/>ernment or legislature should have greater 
     <lb/>
     power conferred upon it than the power con<lb break="no"/>ferred upon the local government and legisla<lb break="no"/>tures by the British North America Act, 1867; 
     <lb/>
     and also empowering it to grant such provinces 
     <lb/>
     representation in the parliament of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     The only limitation Sir John wanted was 
     <lb/>
     that the new provinces should be given no 
     <lb/>
     greater power than was granted to the older 
     <lb/>
     provinces at the time of confederation. If 
     <lb/>
     Sir John Macdonald wanted power simply to 
     <lb/>
     apply the British North America Act to the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces, he was clear-headed enough 
 

            <pb n="3721" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-03_Page_3721.jpg"/>
          <fw type="num">3721</fw>  <fw type="dateline">APRIL 3, 1905</fw> 
       

     to have said so, but he wanted more. It may 
     <lb/>
     be said that the Act of 1870 was modified in 
     <lb/>
     its passage through the imperial parliament, 
     <lb/>
     and that Sir John Macdonald's idea was not 
     <lb/>
     crystallized into legislation, but I have taken 
     <lb/>
     the trouble to follow the career of this Act 
     <lb/>
     in its different stages through the imperial 
     <lb/>
     parliament, and I find that it was introduced 
     <lb/>
     one day, read a second time another day, a 
     <lb/>
     third time another day, and not a single 
     <lb/>
     syllable was said about it in the House or 
     <lb/>
     in Committee of the Whole. This clearly 
     <lb/>
     shows that the imperial parliament simply 
     <lb/>
     took the Bill as it was sent to them from 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government, and put it through 
     <lb/>
     without any change. We are quite familiar 
     <lb/>
     with the Act itself, and I think that any 
     <lb/>
     ordinary man can have no difficulty in 
     <lb/>
     coming to the conclusion that it gives us 
     <lb/>
     new powers which up to that time we had 
     <lb/>
     not. It says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     The parliament of Canada may from time to 
     <lb/>
     time establish new provinces in any territories 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Reading that, with the explanation con<lb break="no"/>tained in Sir John's letter to Lord Kimber<lb break="no"/>ley, I do not think there is very much diffi<lb break="no"/>culty in concluding what power we have. 
     <lb/>
     It may be said: if the power of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion parliament to form the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Manitoba was good and absolute, 
     <lb/>
     and if there was no question about its con<lb break="no"/>stitutionality, why did the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment go to England for confirmation of the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba Act. Without setting oneself up 
     <lb/>
     as any great constitutional authority, I think 
     <lb/>
     it is perfectly plain why that happened. 
     <lb/>
     The parliament of Canada believed that it 
     <lb/>
     had no power to deal with the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     except as to the power which was delegated 
     <lb/>
     by the Orders in Council which I have read, 
     <lb/>
     and by acts which were passed subsequent to 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act of 1867. The 
     <lb/>
     Order in Council giving them power to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question was passed on the 21st 
     <lb/>
     day of June, but it will be seen that the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba Act received the assent of the 
     <lb/>
     Governor General here in Canada on the 
     <lb/>
     12th of May previously. The Act being 
     <lb/>
     passed in this House before the passage of 
     <lb/>
     the Order in Council, it might well have 
     <lb/>
     suggested itself to the law officers in Can<lb break="no"/>ada that they had no authority, and that as 
     <lb/>
     it was an important constitutional matter, 
     <lb/>
    it was better to remove any doubt by a con<lb break="no"/>firming Act. If the dates were revised ; if 
     <lb/>the Order in Council giving the parliament 
     <lb/>of Canada power to deal with this question 
     <lb/>had been passed on the 12th of May and the 
     <lb/>Manitoba Act passed on the 21st of June 
     <lb/>following, you would have heard nothing 
     <lb/>about the constitutionality of the law, but 
     <lb/>the fact that the Act was passed before the 
    

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3722</fw>
     

     Order in Council was signed by Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     created the doubt. The ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior, excellent lawyer that he is, gave 
     <lb/>
     it as his opinion (and it has not been con<lb break="no"/>tradicted), that the law officers of the 
     <lb/>
     Crown in England did not consider that a 
     <lb/>
     confirmatory Act was necessary and that 
     <lb/>
     they held there was ample power in this 
     <lb/>
     parliament to pass the Act of 1870. I sub<lb break="no"/>mit that if we had power to pass the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba Act of 1870, there is nothing in the Bill 
     <lb/>
     now before the House which takes it out of 
     <lb/>
     the category of the provisions contained in 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba Act, and which would oust us 
     <lb/>
     from our power to legislate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It may be said that there is an amend<lb break="no"/>ment in the Manitoba Act. So there is, and 
     <lb/>
     there is only an amendment in this Act. 
     <lb/>
     The power of amendment was recognized 
     <lb/>
     in the Manitoba Act, and section 2 of that 
     <lb/>
     Act simply says that the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act will be changed in such a way 
     <lb/>
     as to suit the circumstances and conditions 
     <lb/>
     existing in Manitoba. Those changes are 
     <lb/>
     contained in that Act to-day. The second 
     <lb/>
     section of the Act to-day is precisely, as 
     <lb/>
     nearly as I can read it, the same as the 
     <lb/>
     second section of the Manitoba Act of 1870. 
     <lb/>
     The Act of 1870 reads that such changes 
     <lb/>
     shall be made as are necessary to make the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act applicable to 
     <lb/>
     the conditions existing in Manitoba. That 
     <lb/>
     is not the exact wording, but that is the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of it ; it is changed to suit the 
     <lb/>
     circumstances. Now, what do we find to<lb break="no"/>day ? All that we find in the second sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the Bill which is now before the 
     <lb/>
     House is that changes will be made to suit 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances existing at the time at 
     <lb/>
     which we create another province. A great 
     <lb/>
     deal of fear seems to be expressed by some 
     <lb/>
     parties in this House that we are destroying 
     <lb/>
     the constitution, that it is an awful thing to 
     <lb/>
     make any amendment in this Act. and the 
     <lb/>
     slightest change would destroy the whole 
     <lb/>
     fabric of the constitution. Sir John Mac<lb break="no"/>donald was, I presume, as loyal to the con<lb break="no"/>stitution as any man in this country. Our 
     <lb/>
     hon. friends, at any rate, were willing to 
     <lb/>
     follow him and to endorse his views on con<lb break="no"/>stitutional matters. He proposed this 
     <lb/>
     amendment to the constitution in 1870, he 
     <lb/>
     put it through this House, he went several 
     <lb/>
     times to the country, and the electors en<lb break="no"/>dorsed himself, his constitution and his 
     <lb/>
     amendments, and nobody ever suggested 
     <lb/>
     that there was the slightest danger in the 
     <lb/>
     world in anything he did in connection with 
     <lb/>
     this bringing into effect of the provisions 
     <lb/>
     for the admission of other provinces. If it 
     <lb/>
     was all right to make these slight changes 
     <lb/>
     in 1870, to legislate for separate schools in 
     <lb/>
     1875, why is it not all right to-day to make 
     <lb/>
     slight changes in order to bring the Act 
     <lb/>
     fully and properly into effect in the western 
     <lb/>
     provinces ? The leader of, the opposition, 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     amendment in clause 109 of the British

erica Act, so far as it deals with land, deals 
     <lb/>
     with it in section 109. section 109 gives the 
     <lb/>
     land to the provinces unconditionally. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Bor<lb break="no"/>den) excellent lawyer as he is. before this 
     <lb/>
     question got to such a red heat as it is to<lb break="no"/>day, when the Bill was first introduced, sug<lb break="no"/>gested in this House. in connection with this 
     <lb/>
     land question, that it would be well to in<lb break="no"/>troduce an amendment by which, although 
     <lb/>
     the lands were given to the western pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, they would not have absolute con<lb break="no"/>trol of them ; he would have some stipula<lb break="no"/>tions and conditions placed upon the manner 
     <lb/>
     in which they would hold the land, and 
     <lb/>
     would not give them an entirely and abso<lb break="no"/>lutely free hand. If it is proper for the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition to suggest 
     <lb/>
     that there should be such an amendment, if 
     <lb/>
     it would be proper to say that we should 
     <lb/>
     put such a proviso in section 109 of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, what is the ob<lb break="no"/>jection to making slight changes in other 
     <lb/>
     parts of the Act   If we have no power to 
     <lb/>
     touch it at all, if we cannot touch it in 
     <lb/>
     reference to schools, we cannot touch it in 
     <lb/>
     reference to lands; and if we can touch it 
     <lb/>
     in reference to lands, we can touch it in 
     <lb/>
     reference to schools.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Section 109 does not 
     <lb/>
     deal with the distribution of legislative 
     <lb/>
     power. Section 109 deals with the owner<lb break="no"/>ship of lands. It is only when the land is 
     <lb/>
     vested in the provinces that the question of 
     <lb/>
     legislative power arises, so they are two

     we could not alter the distribution of legis<lb break="no"/>lative power. That is the point I made.

     cannot amend the British North America

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. As far as amending 
     <lb/>
     the Act is concerned, of course my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend knows that section 146 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act speaks of the terms and 
     <lb/>
     conditions on which provinces or territories 
     <lb/>
     may be brought in. That is one thing. But 
     <lb/>
     the distribution of legislative power is an 
     <lb/>
     other and an entirely different thing.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCKE4">Mr. D. D. MCKENZIE</persName>. If we have no

     power to amend the Act, then we cannot 
     <lb/>
     touch it; and still it was quite competent, 
     <lb/>
     within the purview and terms of section 146 
     <lb/>
     of which my hon. friend speaks, to 


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3724</fw>
          

     make terms and conditions, because that 
     <lb/>
     section of the Act contemplates two pur<lb break="no"/>poses. It contemplates the admission of 
     <lb/>
    Manitoba, British Columbia, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>and Prince Edward Island and other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, which are entities, provincial en<lb break="no"/>titles, at the time and capable of contract<lb break="no"/>ing. They were capable of going into this 
     <lb/>compact, of preparing a scheme in the shape 
     <lb/>of an address which is confirmed by Order 
     <lb/>in Council. It is quite true that they can 
     <lb/>put into it and take out of it, and slice it 
     <lb/>and form it, as it suits them, but the mo<lb break="no"/>ment it receives the sanction of the 
     <lb/>Sovereign by Order in Council, then that is 
     <lb/>an end to it. In this case, instead of a 
     <lb/>compact. we have an Act of parliament. 
     <lb/>But my hon. friend takes the position that 
     <lb/>you cannot make any change in that Act. 
     <lb/>that you must simply make the conditions 
     <lb/>which suited New Brunswick. Nova Scotia, <lb/>
Quebec and Ontario, apply to the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, because you have no sea room at 
     <lb/>all, you can do nothing. It is quite true 
     <lb/>that there was no limitation on the condi<lb break="no"/>tions which could be placed in the Order in 
     <lb/>Council, there was nothing to limit your 
     <lb/>sway in making the bargain; but will my 
     <lb/>hon. friend or his supporters submit that 
     <lb/>we have the same scope today? If they 
     <lb/>will admit that we have the saline scope 
     <lb/>to-day, that we can put in the constitution 
     <lb/>which they are making for the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces every line and every word that we 
     <lb/>could put in an Order in Council bringing 
     <lb/>in British Columbia, Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>or Newfoundland ; if we have those powers 
     <lb/>under the constitution, then we have ample 
     <lb/>powers to put all these conditions into the 
     <lb/>new constitution. Will my hon. friend tell 
     <lb/>me, or tell this House or the country. that 
     <lb/>the provisions of section 92 or section 93 of 
     <lb/>the British North America Act were binding 
     <lb/>on Prince Edward Island when it was 
     <lb/>coming in, or on British Columbia when 
     <lb/>it came in?   Nothing of the kind. They 
     <lb/>could make such provisions as they thought 
     <lb/>proper, and is it not right, when it is only 
     <lb/>this parliament that has the responsibility 
     <lb/>today—for there is no provision by which 
     <lb/>an address can come from the Territories. 
     <lb/>so that this is a one-sided negotiation, so to 
     <lb/>speak. and we take the full responsibility 
     <lb/>in this House for what this constitution 
     <lb/>will be—that we should be told that the 
     <lb/>constitution that would not stand in the 
     <lb/>way of the admission of New Brunswick or 
     <lb/>Prince Edward Island, or any other pro<lb break="no"/>vince, into confederation, must prevent us 
     <lb/>from making such terms and stipulations as 
     <lb/>we think are proper and right in bringing in 
     <lb/>new provinces from the west. I do not think 
     <lb/>that, as the leader of the opposition himself 
     <lb/>would say, it is either law or logic or sound 
     <lb/>argument to say that we have not as free 
     <lb/>a hand in making a province under the 
     <lb/>terms of the Act as we would have under 
     <lb/>the conditions which we could place in an 
     <lb/>Order in Council and in an address from an 
     <lb/>existing provincial entity. I submit. Mr.

     Speaker, that I do not think my learned 
     <lb/>
     friend has any too well answered the point 
     <lb/>
     that we have equal rights in dealing with 
     <lb/>
     the conditions under the Act as we would 
     <lb/>
     have in making an Order in Council and 
     <lb/>
     stipulating how a particular province is to 
     <lb/>
     come in. I was going to say, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     that if we wished to ascertain what powers 
     <lb/>
     the fathers of confederation thought they 
     <lb/>
     possessed, under the conditions of the con<lb break="no"/>federation, the best time for us to search 
     <lb/>
     for information on that point would be in 
     <lb/>
     1870, when the conditions of the compact 
     <lb/>
     were fresh in their minds. 
            </p>
            

            <p>
     We hear a great deal about this section 
     <lb/>
     93 giving exclusive power to the province. 
     <lb/>
     Would it not be well to look at this Act 
     <lb/>
     in the light cast upon it by some of the de<lb break="no"/>cisions of the Privy Council, and those are 
     <lb/>
     decisions which we should not lightly cast 
     <lb/>
     aside even if they do run contrary to our 
     <lb/>
     own opinion. A great many contend that 
     <lb/>
     this section 93 gives the province unlimited 
     <lb/>
     powers to deal with matters of education. 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me that our hon. friends who 
     <lb/>
     read the Act in such a light simply stop at 
     <lb/>
     the end of the first two lines : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     In and for each province the legislature may 
     <lb/>
     exclusively make laws in relation to education. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     But there are four other sections which 
     <lb/>
     these hon. gentlemen do not read at all. 
     <lb/>
     There is also a decision of the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     right in point upon that section ; and it 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that in order not to be misled 
     <lb/>
     any longer as to its full force, effect and 
     <lb/>
     meaning, it would be well to quote that de<lb break="no"/>cision. This is what the Privy Council said 
     <lb/>
     in dealing exactly with that proviso : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Before leaving this part of the case it may 
     <lb/>
     be well to notice the argument urged by the 
     <lb/>
     respondent that the construction which their 
     <lb/>
     lordships have put upon the second and third 
     <lb/>
     subsections of the section of the Manitoba Act 
     <lb/>
     is inconsistent with the powers conferred upon 
     <lb/>
     the legislatures of the provinces to exclusively 
     <lb/>
     make laws in respect to education. The argu<lb break="no"/>ment is fallacious. The power conferred is not 
     <lb/>
     absolute but limited. It is exercisable only 
     <lb/>
     subject and according to the following provision. 
     <lb/>
     The subsections which follow, whatever be 
     <lb/>
     their true construction defining the conditions 
     <lb/>
     under which alone provincial legislatures may 
     <lb/>
     legislate with reference to education and indi<lb break="no"/>cate the limitations imposed on and the excep<lb break="no"/>tions from their power to legislate exclusively, 
     <lb/>
     their right to legislate is not enjoyed properly 
     <lb/>
     speaking exclusively, for in the case specified 
     <lb/>
     in subsection 3 the parliament of Canada is 
     <lb/>
     authorized to legislate on the same subject. 
     <lb/>
     There is, therefore, no such inconsistency as is 
     <lb/>
     suggested. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That is the decision of the Privy Council. 
     <lb/>
     It shows that in the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, from cover to cover, there is no such 
     <lb/>
     thing as giving to any province the exclu<lb break="no"/>sive powers to deal with education. I take 
     <lb/>
     the responsibility of saying that there is 
     <lb/>
     not to-day such a thing in this country as 
     <lb/>
     any province dealing exclusively with edu<lb break="no"/>cation. I heard the hon. member for East 
   

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3726</fw>
       

     Grey (Mr. Sproule) asking the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) the other day whe<lb break="no"/>ther or not there was a province in the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion which had a free hand to deal with 
     <lb/>
     education. I say there is not. There are 
     <lb/>
     provinces in the Dominion to-day which are 
     <lb/>
     free to pass one Act. Nova Scotia to-day is 
     <lb/>
     perfectly free to pass an Act that will con<lb break="no"/>tain some terms in respect to the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools ; but once the Nova Scotia legisla<lb break="no"/>ture passes such an Act it cannot change 
     <lb/>
     it. Or if it should, it would be subject to 
     <lb/>
     an appeal to the government of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion for remedial legislation. Therefore it can 
     <lb/>
     well be said that there is no province in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion to-day which has this wonderful, 
     <lb/>
     absolute right to deal with the question of 
     <lb/>
     education as it sees fit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another point to which I would 
     <lb/>
     direct attention, as showing the intention of 
     <lb/>
     this part of the Confederation Act. It would 
     <lb/>
     be well for us to try and understand, with<lb break="no"/>out any haste or passion or feeling in this 
     <lb/>
     matter, how these questions were understood 
     <lb/>
     from the beginning. Some day in February, 
     <lb/>
     1867, these clauses 92 and 93 were under con<lb break="no"/>sideration in the House of Lords. Now, 
     <lb/>
     whatever feeling there may be in this House 
     <lb/>
     and country over the question, I think we 
     <lb/>
     will all admit that the House of Lords 
     <lb/>
     would approach it with a great deal of calm<lb break="no"/>ness and give it due consideration, and that 
     <lb/>
     not one of the venerable gentlemen who oc<lb break="no"/>cupy seats in that House would be in the 
     <lb/>
     slightest degree nervous about explaining 
     <lb/>
     what these clauses really meant. We find 
     <lb/>
     Lord Carnarvon dealing with this question 
     <lb/>
     calmly and judicially. As to clause 93, he 
     <lb/>
     said :

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Lastly, in the 93rd clause which contains the 
     <lb/>
     exceptional provisions to which I refer, your 
     <lb/>
     lordship will observe some rather complicated 
     <lb/>
     arrangements in reference to education. I need 
     <lb/>
     hardly say that that great question gives rise 
     <lb/>
     to nearly as much earnestness and division of 
     <lb/>
     opinion on that as on this side of the Atlantic. 
     <lb/>
     This clause has been framed after long and 
     <lb/>
     anxious controversy in which all parties have 
     <lb/>
     been represented and on conditions to which all 
     <lb/>
     had given their consent.  .    .    . The object of 
     <lb/>
     the clause is to secure to the religious minority

     in one province the same rights, privileges and 
     <lb/>
     protection which the religious minority in 
     <lb/>
     another province may enjoy. The Roman

     Catholic minority of Upper Canada, the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant minority of Lower Canada and the Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholic minority of the maritime pro<lb break="no"/>vinces will thus stand on a footing of entire

     that that was the way in which the late Sir

     John Macdonald and the framers of the

     <lb/>
     to the like extent as they apply to the several

     That is the same language which is to be 
     <lb/>
     found in the Act creating the province of 
     <lb/>
     Alberta, and there has been some talk as 
     <lb/>
     to what the effect of that Act might be on 
     <lb/>
     the educational question. I think there was 
     <lb/>
     some exception taken to the construction 
     <lb/>
     put upon the clause by my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia, which we find in the Act 
     <lb/>
     which has been submitted as a constitution 
     <lb/>
     for the new provinces by the premier, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain.

            <p>
     Now, I have read to you, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     the clause in the Manitoba Act. This is the 
     <lb/>
     corresponding clause that we find in Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain's Bill. The name of the province 
     <lb/>
     is blank, but I supply the name of Alberta:

     At this point I wish to look a little closely 
     <lb/>
     at the meaning of this language so far as 
     <lb/>
     education is concerned. Hon. members who 
     <lb/>
     are opposing the Bill and who profess to be 
     <lb/>
     particular friends of the Northwest, have 
     <lb/>
     nothing to say against this draft Act, so 
     <lb/>
     far as I can understand. They say there 
     <lb/>
     are terms in the proposed Act of the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) which bring 
     <lb/>
     the separate schools into effect in the North<lb break="no"/>west, and they declare they are not in fav<lb break="no"/>our of such a policy. At the same time, I 
     <lb/>
     do not think they have anything to say 
     <lb/>
     against this draft Act of Mr. Haultain's. 
     <lb/>
     If you examine this clause closely you will 
     <lb/>
     find what Mr. Haultain means is that what<lb break="no"/>ever is in existence in the Territories to<lb break="no"/>day will be gathered together, the whole 
     <lb/>
     business shoved back to 1867 and then 
     <lb/>
     brought in as if this was a new province. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever law you have in force in the Ter<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3728</fw>
      

     ritories to-day must be dealt with as if it 
     <lb/>
     had been a law in force in 1867, the time of 
     <lb/>
     confederation. What is the law in force in 
     <lb/>
     the Territories? Is not the Act of 1875 as 
     <lb/>
     much in force to-day as it was when it was 
     <lb/>
     passed? It has not been repealed. The 
     <lb/>
     fact that ordinances have been based upon 
     <lb/>
     it which are inconsistent with it in some 
     <lb/>
     respects or which are not as strong in the 
     <lb/>
     direction it intended as the Act itself, does 
     <lb/>
     not take away the validity of the Act. That 
     <lb/>
     Act created separate schools, and that is 
     <lb/>
     the Act which Mr. Haultain says is to be 
     <lb/>
     continued in force as if had been passed in 
     <lb/>
     1867. That is the effect of what Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain proposes, as I understand it. And while 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposed to the government 
     <lb/>
     are unwilling to take separate schools from 
     <lb/>
     us, they are ready to swallow them holus 
     <lb/>
     bolus when offered by Mr. Haultain. I am 
     <lb/>
     not finding fault with Mr. Haultain for put<lb break="no"/>ting this in the Act. I think he was doing 
     <lb/>
     the right thing in recognizing the conditions 
     <lb/>
     that existed at the time. But we must not 
     <lb/>
     claim credit for doing what we are not do<lb break="no"/>ing. Mr. Haultain and his friends claim 
     <lb/>
     credit for not recognizing the conditions in 
     <lb/>
     the west. They were going to wipe the 
     <lb/>
     whole thing off the slate, and so they claim<lb break="no"/>ed to be the friends of the Territories and 
     <lb/>
     say that we are the enemies of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. But they cannot sustain that argu<lb break="no"/>ment in the face of this draft Act, which 
     <lb/>
     has in it ever word, if not more, than we 
     <lb/>
     have in the legislation before the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have pointed out the different conditions 
     <lb/>
     which are in this Manitoba Act. It con<lb break="no"/>tains section 2, exactly like the one which 
     <lb/>
     is going through to-day. Section 26 of it 
     <lb/>
     deals with the land question; and section 
     <lb/>
     20 deals with the school question. So it is 
     <lb/>
     precisely the same as the Act now before 
     <lb/>
     us. I was pointing out—and I think it is 
     <lb/>
     necessary to point out-the ideas which pre<lb break="no"/>vail in connection with this constitution 
     <lb/>
     which was given to the Territories in 1875. 
     <lb/>
     It has been observed here by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Marquette that nothing that Alex. 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie and Edward Blake, and old men 
     <lb/>
     of that kind said should not receive very 
     <lb/>
     much attention. I do not regard Hon. Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Blake's views on constitutional ques<lb break="no"/>tions in that way. I think that Mr. Blake 
     <lb/>
     was a big man on constitutional questions 
     <lb/>
     in 1875; I think he has been a big man on 
     <lb/>
     constitutional questions every year since, 
     <lb/>
     and I believe he is a big man on constitu<lb break="no"/>tional questions to-day; and for that reason 
     <lb/>
     we ought to be very much pleased when we 
     <lb/>
     find in the books things that he said on 
     <lb/>
     questions of this kind, and we ought to be 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that what he has said on these 
     <lb/>
     questions is sound and good. This is What 
     <lb/>
     he said when this Bill of 1875 was before 
     <lb/>
     the House, when this question of forming 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     was being dealt with. It will be seen that 
     <lb/>
     the words of Mr. Blake are not the words 
     <lb/>
     of a man who thought that we were creat<lb break="no"/>

     was to be wiped off the slate when we chose

     consideration and deliberation and they must

     take care that no false steps were made in 
     <lb/>
     such a work. He did not agree with that 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman that the government ought 
     <lb/>
     to repeat his errors. The right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     had tried the institutions for the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories which he now asked the House 
     <lb/>
     to frame and for the same reason as he had 
     <lb/>
     given to-day—that it would be better for the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government to keep matters in their 
     <lb/>
     own hands and decide what was best for the 
     <lb/>
     future. He (Mr. Blake) believed that it was 
     <lb/>
     essential to our obtaining a large immigration 
     <lb/>
     to the Northwest that we should tell the people 
     <lb/>
     beforehand what those rights were to be in 
     <lb/>
     the country in which we invited them to settle. 
     <lb/>
     It was interesting to the people to know that 
     <lb/>
     at the very earliest moment there was a 
     <lb/>
     sufficient aggregate of population within a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable distance, that aggregation would 
     <lb/>
     have a voice in the self-government of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories, and he believed the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government was wise (although the measure 
     <lb/>
     might be brought down very late this session 
     <lb/>
     and it might be found impossible to give it 
     <lb/>
     due consideration) in determining in advance 
     <lb/>
     of settlement what the character of the in<lb break="no"/>stitutions of the country should be in which we 
     <lb/>
     invite people. He did not agree with the 
     <lb/>
     policy of asking people to settle in that western 
     <lb/>
     country, and tell them that a paternal govern<lb break="no"/>ment would look after them, and would give 
     <lb/>
     them such institutions as the government 
     <lb/>
     thought suitable. We had better let the people

     know their fate politically and otherwise be<lb break="no"/>fore they settle there.

     the fact that, as far as we could expect at

     In reply to him Mr. Mackenzie makes a

     and setting forth the terms of that section 
     <lb/>
     11 of the Northwest Territories Act, 1875, 
     <lb/>
     with which we are familiar. Now, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, in exercising this power I think it 
     <lb/>
     is safe for us to follow the precedents that 
     <lb/>
     have been laid down. I should think that 
     <lb/>
     the different steps that have been taken 
     <lb/>
     by the imperial government in giving us 
     <lb/>
     control over this territory, enabling us to 
     <lb/>
     make a constitution, and giving us every 
     <lb/>
     other power that they could give us in order 
     <lb/>
     to form these new countries into provinces 
     <lb/>
     and to give them constitutions, that being 
     <lb/>
     the case, it seems to me there is no question 
     <lb/>
     but that we have the power. The next ques<lb break="no"/>tion is, how are we to exercise it. I was 
     <lb/>
     pointing out that I think it is wise to exer<lb break="no"/>cise that power along the same lines as it 
     <lb/>
     was exercised by Sir John A. Macdonald 
     <lb/>
     in 1870, by Mr. Mackenzie in 1875, and by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain when he had the drafting of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill a few years ago, and as it is exer<lb break="no"/>cised to-day, by the premier of this country 
     <lb/>
     who guides us in the way in which we 
     <lb/>
     should exercise this power. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is contended that we do not grant con<lb break="no"/>stitutional freedom. This is constitutional 
     <lb/>
     freedom as it is understood by the Supreme

     ' Constitutional freedom' certainly does not 
     <lb/>
     consist in exemption from governmental inter<lb break="no"/>ference in the citizen's private affairs, in his

     it consists in the civil and political rights which

     are absolutely guaranteed assured, and guarded; 
     <lb/>
     in one's liberties as a man and a citizen—his

     Now the great difficulty seems to be why 
     <lb/>
     we must have separate schools. There are 
     <lb/>
     some people among us, and their ideas are 
     <lb/>
     deserving of every respect, who think that 
     <lb/>
     separate schools are not necessary and 
     <lb/>
     that we should not make provision for them. 
     <lb/>
     But a great many people in this country 
     <lb/>
     think they are necessary, and that being the 
     <lb/>
     case, we have to deal with circumstances 
     <lb/>
     as we find them. I heard a quotation from 
     <lb/>
    a paper to-night giving the language of some

     reverend gentleman, I think belonging to 
     <lb/>
     my own church, saying that he hoped the 
     <lb/>
     day would arrive when one common ground 
     <lb/>
     of education could be reached, and when 
     <lb/>
     some form of religion could be taught in 
     <lb/>
     the schools upon which all could agree. 
     <lb/>
     Well, Sir, if there was any hope of reaching 
     <lb/>
     that state of affairs, I would be very glad. 
     <lb/>
     But we have been nearly a hundred years 
     <lb/>
     in trying to agree upon that point, and we 
     <lb/>
     do not seem to be any nearer to it to-day 
     <lb/>
     than we were then. I find that in 1854 there 
     <lb/>
     was a separate school law in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario ; I find that they repealed it and 
     <lb/>
     in 1863 they put it again on the statute-book, 
     <lb/>
     and they now have separate schools in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario. Seeing that neither in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec nor in Ontario can the present 
     <lb/>
     system be changed, it seems to me there 
     <lb/>
     is not much hope of being able to do away 
     <lb/>
     entirely with the principle of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. Now, this very point was consider<lb break="no"/>ed by the Privy Council, as will appear on 
     <lb/>

     It is owing to religious convictions which

     As a matter of fact the objections of Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics to schools such as alone receive state 
     <lb/>
     aid under the Act of 1890 (Manitoba Act), is 
     <lb/>
     conscientious and deeply rooted. If this had 
     <lb/>
     not been so, if there had been a system of 
     <lb/>
     public education acceptable to Protestant and 
     <lb/>
     Catholic alike, the elaborate enactments which 
     <lb/>
     have been the subject of so much controversy 
     <lb/>
     and consideration would have been unnecessary. 
     <lb/>
     It is notorious that there were acute differences 
     <lb/>
     of opinion between Catholics and Protestants 
     <lb/>
     on the education question prior to 1870. This 
     <lb/>
     is recognized and emphasized on almost every 
     <lb/>
     line of these enactments. There is no doubt 
     <lb/>
     either what the points of difference were, and 
     <lb/>
     it is in the light of these that the twenty-second 
     <lb/>
     section of the Manitoba Act of 1870, which was 
     <lb/>

     urged by some people in favour of common

     schools is that they suit both alike. To

     this we cannot agree, as our Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic friends cannot accept them as doing

     Now, Mr. Speaker, there is no strong rea<lb break="no"/>son, from a presonal standpoint, why I 
     <lb/>
     should not be just as well satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     separate schools or with public schools as 
     <lb/>
     any other gentleman in this House. But 
     <lb/>
     I have this to say, that the experience of 
    

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3732</fw>
        

     many years in close touch with the public 
     <lb/>
     schools of the province from which I come, 
     <lb/>
     has taught me that there is no use in try<lb break="no"/>ing to force upon any people a system of 
     <lb/>
     education with which they are not satisfied. 
     <lb/>
     Now my own position on the question is 
     <lb/>
     this : I am in favour of the most absolute 
     <lb/>
     and thorough government supervision and 
     <lb/>
     control of all schools receiving government 
     <lb/>
     grants or municipal aid. I am strongly in 
     <lb/>
     favour of the teaching of the principles of 
     <lb/>
     the Christian religion in schools. I am 
     <lb/>
     firmly convinced, after many years of active 
     <lb/>
     experience, that the teaching of religion can<lb break="no"/>not be successfully and harmoniously con<lb break="no"/>ducted in a mixed school attended by Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholics and Protestant children to<lb break="no"/>gether. I am a firm believer in the divine 
     <lb/>
     injunction: 'Train up a child in the way 
     <lb/>
     he should go and when he is old he will not 
     <lb/>
     depart from it.' I believe it is the duty of 
     <lb/>
     the state to see that as much as possible the 
     <lb/>
     cardinal principles of the Christian religion 
     <lb/>
     are thoroughly instilled into the youthful 
     <lb/>
     minds of the nation. I believe that this all- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     important purpose can only be accomplished 
     <lb/>
     by Protestants of all classes agreeing upon a 
     <lb/>
     certain line of religious instruction in all 
     <lb/>
     Protestant Schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe that the Roman Catholics of 
     <lb/>
     Canada are doing the right thing when they 
     <lb/>
     insist upon the teaching of their children in 
     <lb/>
     the religious principles of their church. 
     <lb/>
     Our Protestant friends say that there 
     <lb/>
     is no religious teaching in our na<lb break="no"/>tional schools and it is as good for 
     <lb/>
     your children as it is for ours ; that is quite 
     <lb/>
     true, and that view is worthy of some res<lb break="no"/>pect. But, our Roman Catholic friends say: 
     <lb/>
     We know that what you say is true and we 
     <lb/>
     know that our children will not be in any 
     <lb/>
     way interfered with in the common schools. 
     <lb/>
     But that is not enough ; we want our child<lb break="no"/>ren to receive religious instructions every 
     <lb/>
     day in the school and we want those in<lb break="no"/>structions to be guided and inspired by the 
     <lb/>
     teachings of our church and we want the 
     <lb/>
     instructions imparted by a person who un<lb break="no"/>derstands and believes in them. This, as 
     <lb/>
     I understand it, is the position of our Catho<lb break="no"/>lic people in Canada and it is one, particular<lb break="no"/>ly from their standpoint, that commends it<lb break="no"/>self to me, and one which I most cheerfully 
     <lb/>
     commend to the Protestants of Canada. As 
     <lb/>
     one who has been for the last twenty years 
     <lb/>
     in close touch with the public schools of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Nova Scotia, I take the res<lb break="no"/>ponsibility of telling my Protestant country<lb break="no"/>men that they cannot be too soon in follow<lb break="no"/>ing the example of their Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     brethren in insisting upon religious teaching 
     <lb/>
     in every school of the land. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is the position which I take in respect 
     <lb/>
     to religion in the schools. I believe it is 
     <lb/>
     the proper thing to have it and if we must 
     <lb/>
     have separate schools in order to have re<lb break="no"/>ligion in the schools let us have separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. If we can have them together, all

     right, but if we cannot let us have them 
     <lb/>
     any way. What is the use of Protestants 
     <lb/>
     starving religion out of the schools and de<lb break="no"/>priving their children of religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tion for the sake of a few dollars ? Why 
     <lb/>
     should we hold out for a thing that Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics cannot and will not accept ? Is 
     <lb/>
     is not a proper thing for us as Protestants 
     <lb/>
     who have children to educate them in our 
     <lb/>
     own way? There is nothing in so far as the 
     <lb/>
     different Protestant bodies are concerned 
     <lb/>
     that will prevent them from having their 
     <lb/>
     children educated together in the same 
     <lb/>
     classes, taught by the same teachers or from 
     <lb/>
     receiving religious instructions upon grounds 
     <lb/>
     common to all Protestant bodies.

     I was talking about this amendment. A 
     <lb/>
     great deal of fault is found because we have 
     <lb/>
     this amendment. I submit that this amend<lb break="no"/>ment is not legislation of this House. It is 
     <lb/>
     legislation that was passed by the legisla<lb break="no"/>ture of the Northwest Territories. They 
     <lb/>
     are just as fully represented in their local 
     <lb/>
     House as the province of Manitoba. Accord<lb break="no"/>ing to their size and population they have 
     <lb/>
     just as many representatives in the local 
     <lb/>
     legislature of the Northwest Territories as 
     <lb/>
     any local parliament of Canada. They have 
     <lb/>
     a government, they have a premier, they 
     <lb/>
     have all the powers that a local legislature 
     <lb/>
     has except that they cannot borrow money 
     <lb/>
     and the longer that power is kept from them, 
     <lb/>
     I think, the better. This is an Act they 
     <lb/>
     have passed themselves. The Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories have passed this legislation and 
     <lb/>
     they appear to be perfectly satisfied with it 
     <lb/>
     and we have some evidence in its favour.

     <lb/>
      some extent with some of its provisions. I

     House certain provisions of the Education

     <lb/>
     is no very great justification for this letter

     which was written by a reverend gentleman 
     <lb/>
     for whom the whole country, myself

            <fw type="num">3735</fw>  
          

     kind of an Education Act for the Territories 
     <lb/>
     we are giving our sanction to in this House, 
     <lb/>
     and I shall briefly contrast some of its pro<lb break="no"/>visions with those of the Nova Scotia School 
     <lb/>
     Law. In Nova Scotia we have what is 
     <lb/>
     known as a superintendent of education 
     <lb/>
     who is an officer of the government holding 
     <lb/>
     office for life or good conduct, but in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories they have a com<lb break="no"/>missioner of education, who is a member of 
     <lb/>
     the government, responsible to the people, 
     <lb/>
     and who must go back for re-election. The 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner of Education in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories has full control of everything 
     <lb/>
     pertaining to education ; he makes regu<lb break="no"/>lations as to the competency of the teachers 
     <lb/>
     for receiving a license ; he controls their 
     <lb/>
     conduct after they are licensed ; he super<lb break="no"/>vises the manner in which they are engaged 
     <lb/>
     by the trustees ; he drafts a form of con<lb break="no"/>tract which they must sign and they cannot 
     <lb/>
     teach school for one day without having 
     <lb/>
     complied with every regulation of the Act. 
     <lb/>
     Some hon. gentlemen have tried to make 
     <lb/>
     out that the separate school is absolutely 
     <lb/>
     apart from the public school, but I wish the 
     <lb/>
     message to be carried to our friends in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia that this is an absolute mis-statement 
     <lb/>
     of the fact. The separate schools are national 
     <lb/>
     in every sense ; they have the same text 
     <lb/>
     books, the same inspection and are under 
     <lb/>
     the same supervision as the common schools. 
     <lb/>
     From nine o'clock in the morning until half 
     <lb/>
     past three in the afternoon nothing can be 
     <lb/>
     taught in these schools except the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     prescribed lessons, but by arrangement be<lb break="no"/>tween the trustees and the parents of the 
     <lb/>
     children in separate schools, there may be 
     <lb/>
     a half hour's religious instruction each day 
     <lb/>after half past three in the afternoon. I<lb/>cannot see anything wrong about giving<lb/>religious instruction in that manner ; for<lb/>my part I would like to see it the rule in<lb/>every school in the country. Again, we<lb/>are told by some hon. gentlemen, that once<lb/>we pass this Act the school system in the<lb/>Territories can never be changed, but sec<lb break="no"/>tion 52 of the School Act provides that if in<lb/>any section there is a so-called separate<lb/>school and a common school and the<lb/>people wish to change they can unite<lb/>and have the one common school. There<lb break="no"/>fore, the people can follow any school<lb/>system they please, so long as they<lb/>do not take away from the Roman<lb/>Catholic or the Protestant minority the rights<lb/>they have acquired. If the trustees of a<lb/>Catholic and Protestant school in one sec<lb break="no"/>tion are willing to have a common school<lb/>without any religious teaching in it,<lb/>there is nothing in the Act to pre<lb break="no"/>vent it. I was polnting out, Mr. Speaker,<lb/>that the rights in the matter of<lb/>education which the minority of the new<lb/>Territories will have under this legislation,<lb/>are not as extensive as the rights given<lb/>to the Protestant minority in Quebec or to<lb/>the Roman Catholic minority in Ontario.<lb/>And, in the province of Nova Scotia, although<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3736</fw>
    

we have no separate schools by law, I can<lb/>assure hon. gentlemen that the privileges<lb/>which are allowed to separate schools and<lb/>which are enjoyed by our Catholic friends in<lb/>Nova Scotia are far and above anything<lb/>which this law gives in the new provinces.<lb/>If to-day, instead of forty years ago, we<lb/>were framing a constitution for the admis<lb break="no"/>sion of Nova Scotia into the confederation,<lb/>I take the responsibility of saying that<lb/>we could not form a compact without re<lb break="no"/>cognizing the claims of our Catholic friends<lb/>in respect to this matter. Although there<lb/>is no law dealing with it, I can assure the<lb/>House that the Catholics of Nova Scotia<lb/>are not suffering any grievance in respect to<lb/>the educational laws of that province. If<lb/>it is the right of the minority in Quebec to<lb/>have a guarantee in the constitution, if it<lb/>is the right of the minority in Ontario to<lb/>have a similar guarantee, if it was the<lb/>right of the minority in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories to have a guarantee in the Act of<lb/>1875, surely it is the right of that minority<lb/>to have a like guarantee in the constitution<lb/>to-day.<lb/></p>

     In 1867, when the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     came into confederation, the Catholics of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario came to the fathers of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion with this section of the law in their 
     <lb/>
     hands :

     That is the law with which the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario came to the fathers of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion and said : Our rights must be recog<lb break="no"/>nized under that Act. And their rights 
     <lb/>
     were recognized under that Act. To-day,

     when we are making a new constitution, 
     <lb/>
     the Catholics—I suppose it is the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     who are asking for this now—come to us 
     <lb/>
     with a statute of this parliament and say : 
     <lb/>
     This is an Act which you put upon the 
     <lb/>
     statute-books by which our rights to separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools were granted in 1875, thirty 
     <lb/>
     years ago ; this has been revised and re<lb break="no"/>viewed twenty times since and it has al<lb break="no"/>ways been looked upon as a proper thing 
     <lb/>put in that law, and now we ask you <lb/>
    recognize it as fully and as completely as 
     <lb/>a similar right was recognized in 1867, when 
     <lb/> the minorities of Quebec and of Ontario 
     <lb/> came to the fathers of confederation looking 
     <lb/> for the protection of their rights. I ask 
     <lb/> you, Mr. Speaker, if it would be fair or just 
     <lb/>to say to people who have lived for thirty <lb/>years under a statute which we have given<lb/>them affording them protection, an Act<lb/>passed in 1875, to now remove the protec<lb break="no"/>tion which they have enjoyed constitution<lb break="no"/>ally for thirty years. Some one was asked<lb/>

     what right we have to suppose that the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest will not grant the 
     <lb/>
     same privileges as we would grant in the 
     <lb/>
     east. While I am not saying that they 
     <lb/>
     would not. I will say that if I were a Catho<lb break="no"/>lic living in the Northwest what has happen<lb break="no"/>ed in the past would, I think, be notice to 
     <lb/>
     me that I had not a great deal to expect in 
     <lb/>
     matters of this kind. I do not want to jar 
     <lb/>
     upon the feelings of any western man, or 
     <lb/>
     any other man, but I think that to be honest 
     <lb/>
     we should place the facts just as we find 
     <lb/>
     them. In the seventies, or perhaps in the 
     <lb/>
     eighties, a school law was passed in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba which, as far as I can learn, was per<lb break="no"/>fectly satisfactory to the Catholics and was 
     <lb/>
     a carrying out of the compact of 1870. Why 
     <lb/>
     it was so, I do not know ; but the fact is 
     <lb/>
     that it was later wiped off the statute-books, 
     <lb/>
     and there is no such thing in the statute- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     book of Manitoba to-day. It has been stated 
     <lb/>
     in this House today that a resolution has 
     <lb/>
     been twice passed in the legislature of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest asking the government to take 
     <lb/>
     away the provisions of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories Act in respect to separate schools. 
     <lb/>
     These provisions have not been taken away, 
     <lb/>
     but does anybody venture to tell me that if 
     <lb/>
     the legislature of the Northwest had the 
     <lb/>
     power to take these provisions away, it 
     <lb/>
     would not do so ? They have twice passed 
     <lb/>
     resolutions wiping off the slate. They had 
     <lb/>
     not the power to fully and effectively carry 
     <lb/>
     that out, but as far as the intention is con<lb break="no"/>cerned. it was clearly there. All doubt 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the legislature of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories is removed in that way, and doubt 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the legislature of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     is removed by the fact that three times in 
     <lb/>
     succession eiforts have been made to wipe 
     <lb/>
     off the statute-book anything which autho<lb break="no"/>rized separate schools ; and I, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     think the minority are justified in asking 
     <lb/>
     us, when granting a new constitution, to see 
     <lb/>
     that these rights which were reserved to 
     <lb/>
     them in 1875 will again be reserved to them 
     <lb/>
     under the constitution of 1905. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have spoken longer than I intended, 
     <lb/>
     but the points I wish to make are these, 
     <lb/>
     and I shall summarize them in concluding. 
     <lb/>
     In the first place, I wish to point out that 
     <lb/>
     I think that we have ample power under 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, 1867, and the Orders in Council which 
     <lb/>
     were passed to give us control over the North<lb break="no"/>west and over British Columbia in 1871, to 
     <lb/>
     grant a constitution to any new provinces 
     <lb/>
     that we might carve out of the new coun<lb break="no"/>try. I think, Sir, that we are perfectly 
     <lb/>
     safe in taking it for granted that when the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Great Britain told us that 
     <lb/>
     we could give a province a constitution, 
     <lb/>
     that that means a constitution and it means 
     <lb/>
     nothing less. To give a province a consti<lb break="no"/>tution is to give it all the machinery neces<lb break="no"/>sary to carry its affairs on as a province; 
     <lb/>
     and when, in the old days, we took in pro<lb break="no"/>vinces by Order in Council, we took them 
     <lb/>
     in on such conditions as were stipulated 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3738</fw>
       

     and agreed upon, and perhaps one hundred 
     <lb/>
     changes would be made between the com<lb break="no"/>mencement of negotiations and the final 
     <lb/>
     admission of the province. If we were 
     <lb/>
     bound down to hard and fast rules, we 
     <lb/>
     could never get a province to enter the con<lb break="no"/>federation, and the early legislators of Can<lb break="no"/>ada were not long in discovering that some 
     <lb/>
     discretionary power was needed, and Sir 
     <lb/>
     John A. Macdonald asked the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     England to give the Dominion parliament 
     <lb/>
     such power as would enable them to give the 
     <lb/>
     provinces entering confederation such con<lb break="no"/>stitution as from time to time they might 
     <lb/>
     find necessary. These constitutional powers 
     <lb/>
     were granted and exercised, and in the ex<lb break="no"/>ercise of that discretion the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada had full power to mould and shape 
     <lb/>
     the conditions of Canada and to give to 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces a constitution as much 
     <lb/>
     as possible on the lines of the old provinces, 
     <lb/>
     making such changes as were necessary to 
     <lb/>
     suit the circumstances in each case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I submit, Mr. Speaker, that we have this 
     <lb/>
     power, and that we are exercising it in the 
     <lb/>
     right direction in recognizing the circum<lb break="no"/>stances that to-day exist in that country. 
     <lb/>
     While we should give every privilege to the 
     <lb/>
     local legislature, we should carry out, in 
     <lb/>
     dealing with these new provinces, the prin<lb break="no"/>ciples that governed us in forming constitu<lb break="no"/>tions of the other provinces. It was recog<lb break="no"/>nized, as I said before, at confederation ; 
     <lb/>
     it was recognized in 1870, when the people 
     <lb/>
     who had formed confederation had every 
     <lb/>
     term and every condition of that contract 
     <lb/>
     fresh in their minds, when they had just 
     <lb/>
     returned from the conferences in England, 
     <lb/>
     when they were fresh from the conferences 
     <lb/>
     at Quebec and elsewhere, and when they 
     <lb/>
     had the whole business moulded and shaped 
     <lb/>
     in their minds, then the very first time they 
     <lb/>
     had to put it into effect they recognized the 
     <lb/>
     principle for which I am contending, and 
     <lb/>
     which is found in the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act of a few years before. As I said be<lb break="no"/>fore, it is recognized in the Act of 1875, it 
     <lb/>
     is recognized in that admirable speech of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Blake, in that speech of Alexander Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie, and in the concurrence with that 
     <lb/>
     idea of Sir John Macdonald and every mem<lb break="no"/>ber who spoke in the House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     in 1875. Finding these conditions and find<lb break="no"/>ing that it is our duty to follow them out, 
     <lb/>
     and finding that we have those powers, are 
     <lb/>
     we doing anything but what is right and 
     <lb/>
     fair when, in this slight way, we recognize 
     <lb/>
     that constitutional principle ? What are we 
     <lb/>
     doing ? We are simply adopting and mak<lb break="no"/>ing the law of the Dominion a law which 
     <lb/>
     the premier of the country with which we 
     <lb/>
     are dealing has stated is first-class legisla<lb break="no"/>tion, is legislation which was passed by the 
     <lb/>
     parliament over which he presides, and of 
     <lb/>
     which he has said that if he were a dictator 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow he would not change one line of 
     <lb/>
     it. We are putting an Act into force in this 
     <lb/>
     country which an hon. gentleman who sits 
     <lb/>
     in this House as an opponent of the gov<lb break="no"/>

ernment, would venture to say that after 
     <lb/>
     twenty-two years' experience in the west 
     <lb/>
     this school law which we find to-day 
     <lb/>
     upon the statute-books is best suited for 
     <lb/>
     the needs of that country. That is the 
     <lb/>
     law we are asked to pass. I think the 
     <lb/>
     position I take in supporting the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment is perfectly clear. I believe we 
     <lb/>
     have the power to do what we are doing, 
     <lb/>
     that in recognizing the constitutional rights 
     <lb/>
     of the people in the Northwest we are acting 
     <lb/>
     wisely, and that we could not recognize 
     <lb/>
     those rights at all and do less than we are 
     <lb/>
     doing. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PERL2">Mr. GEORGE H. PERLEY</persName> (Argenteuil). 
     <lb/>
     This matter has been so thoroughly threshed 
     <lb/>
     out, Mr. Speaker, and the hour is now so 
     <lb/>
     late that I do not propose to keep the House 
     <lb/>
     very long. After listening to the many and 
     <lb/>
     varied arguments we have heard since this 
     <lb/>
     debate began it seems to me quite evident 
     <lb/>
     that no one is absolutely certain whether 
     <lb/>
     or not this House has the power to pass this 
     <lb/>
     Bill in its present shape. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who has just spoken (Mr. McKenzie) 
     <lb/>
     claims that our constitution is as pliable 
     <lb/>
     and elastic as the British constitution, but 
     <lb/>
     I can hardly see how for a moment it can 
     <lb/>
     be maintained that a constitution, which is 
     <lb/>
     a written one, and hence bound within the 
     <lb/>
     four corners of the document, can be at all 
     <lb/>
     compared to one which has its only basis in 
     <lb/>
     practice and precedent. Our constitution 
     <lb/>
     is the British North America Act, and that 
     <lb/>
     Act I do not think we have the power to 
     <lb/>
     alter or change in any particular without 
     <lb/>
     the consent of the imperial parliament. 
     <lb/>
     After listening to the very able argu<lb break="no"/>ments which we have had pro and con con<lb break="no"/>cerning the question of jurisdiction from the 
     <lb/>
     many able lawyers who have taken part in 
     <lb/>
     this debate it seems to me that those who 
     <lb/>
     deny our power to legislate as we please re<lb break="no"/>garding the new provinces have the best of 
     <lb/>
     the argument, and I shall be surprised if 
     <lb/>
     the question of our jurisdiction is not car<lb break="no"/>ried to the Privy Council in England before 
     <lb/>
     it is finally decided. Should this happen, as 
     <lb/>
     I am afraid it will, the effect in the mean<lb break="no"/>time will be most unfortunate, for the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces will be kept in a condition of 
     <lb/>
     trouble and uncertainty until the matter is 
     <lb/>
     finally decided. In my opinion it would have 
     <lb/>
     been far better had a series of questions been 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the Supreme Court and the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council, and thus have removed by 
     <lb/>
     the highest court in the empire any doubts 
     <lb/>
     that might arise as to our powers, and as the 
     <lb/>
     creation of these new provinces was a mat<lb break="no"/>ter which has been anticipated by every<lb break="no"/>body for some years, it seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     it would have been only ordinary foresight 
     <lb/>
     and prudence on the part of this government 
     <lb/>
     to have found out in advance exactly what 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction this parliament has regarding 
     <lb/>
     these matters and thus be in a position to 
     <lb/>
     act without any uncertainty or hesitation. 
     <lb/>
     That, to my mind. would be the busi<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3740</fw>
   

     ness way of acting. and naturally that 
     <lb/>
     is the way which most commends it<lb break="no"/>self to my approval. Even now I think it 
     <lb/>
     would be better for the government to adopt   
     <lb/>
     that course, and I would consequently urge 
     <lb/>
     them strongly to withdraw the Bill and 
     <lb/>
     postpone it until next session, by which 
     <lb/>
     time we could ascertain exactly what our 
     <lb/>
     position is and thus avoid the danger of 
     <lb/>
     putting in our statutes a very important 
     <lb/>
     law which may turn out to be in many re<lb break="no"/>spects outside our jurisdiction and conse<lb break="no"/>quently waste paper. In the meantime the 
     <lb/>
     government could take advantage of the de<lb break="no"/>lay by taking up with the Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway the question of doing away with 
     <lb/>
     the exemption of that company from taxa<lb break="no"/>tion, the continuance of which is provided 
     <lb/>
     for in section 23 of the Bill: and for my part 
     <lb/>
     I know of no reason why they could not 
     <lb/>
     arrive at some equitable arrangement which 
     <lb/>
     would be satisfactory to every one and fair 
     <lb/>
     to the Canadian Pacific Railway, and which 
     <lb/>
     would leave the new provinces absolutely 
     <lb/>
     untrammelled as regards taxation. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     The chief discussion in this House and in 
     <lb/>
     the press throughout the country has been 
     <lb/>
     regarding clause 16 which deals with educa<lb break="no"/>tion. As I understand it, and as the hon. 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice has explained it, this 
     <lb/>
     clause, as amended by the government, gives 
     <lb/>
     minorities in the Northwest the same rights 
     <lb/>
     they now enjoy. Neither more nor less. 
     <lb/>
     These rights are very simple and easy to 
     <lb/>
     understand. The important sections provid<lb break="no"/>ing for these schools in the Northwest Ordi<lb break="no"/>nance are:

     In other words, all schools must be con<lb break="no"/>ducted in the same way. All the teachers 
     <lb/>
     must be equally competent, all the text books 
     <lb/>
     and teaching must be the same in all the 
     <lb/>
     schools, and all the schools must be subject to 
     <lb/>
     government supervision. Religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tion is, however, allowed for one-half hour 
     <lb/>
     of whatever kind the board of each school 
     <lb/>
     may decide. Now, Mr. Speaker, these rights 
     <lb/>
     for minorities have been in force. in much 
     <lb/>
     the same form, for many years, and thou<lb break="no"/>sands of people have settled in the North<lb break="no"/>west relying on them. I understand they 
     <lb/>
     have been perfectly satisfactory to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest, and no doubt 
     <lb/>
     would be continued in the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. were the matter left entirely 
     <lb/>
     to them. Personally, I believe it would 
     <lb/>
     be better to have all our children edu<lb break="no"/>cated together, as they would learn to 
     <lb/>
     know each other better and perhaps 
     <lb/>
     make better citizens. But I have al<lb break="no"/>ways lived in a mixed community such 
     <lb/>
     as we have in Ottawa, and I consider 
     <lb/>
     that the rights and feelings of every 
     <lb/>
     class of people should be respected, and 
     <lb/>
     that it would be impossible to carry 
     <lb/>
     on our government on any other basis 
     <lb/>
     in a country of varied races and relig<lb break="no"/>ions such as Canada possesses. I might 
     <lb/>
     add, Sir, that although the county I have 
     <lb/>
     the honour to represent is composed of every 
     <lb/>
     class, creed and nationality, I have not re<lb break="no"/>ceived a single letter or petition urging on 
     <lb/>
     me to take any particular course regarding 
     <lb/>
     this question, and I think I may, without 
     <lb/>
     laying myself open to a charge of undue 
     <lb/>
     conceit, consider this a cause of pardouable 
     <lb/>
     pride on my part as showing that the people 
     <lb/>
     of Argenteuil are willing to trust me in this 
     <lb/>
     matter. If we have any right to legislate 
     <lb/>
     at all on the subject, I am sure that none 
     <lb/>
     of my Protestant friends would object to 
     <lb/>
     our continuing in the Northwest the very 
     <lb/>
     moderate rights of education which the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic minority now has there and 
     <lb/>
     has had for so many years.

     By their speeches. hon. gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site are trying to convince the people that <lb/>the Conservatives are against the separate
<lb/>school system as it at present exists in the
<lb/>'Northwest. But, Sir, no member of the op<lb break="no"/>position has taken any such position. <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PERL2">Mr. PERLEY</persName>. My hon. friend the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition showed in a masterly argu<lb break="no"/>ment, from a constitutional and legal point 
     <lb/>
     of view, that this parliament should not 
     <lb/>
     deal with the question, but nothing that he 
     <lb/>
     said could in any way be construed into an 
     <lb/>
     objection to separate schools.  We have had  
     <lb/>
     from the hon. Minister of Justice and many 
  

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3742</fw>
          

     other lawyers a different view on the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional question from that taken by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader. According to some legal author<lb break="no"/>ities, the power to legislate regarding edu<lb break="no"/>cation lies with us only, and according to 
     <lb/>
     others we are bound by the constitution to 
     <lb/>
     provide for a system of education. I my<lb break="no"/>self believe in provincial rights, but in this 
     <lb/>
     case the question is not one of provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights, as there are yet no province in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest, but of the legal interpretation of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act, and on that 
     <lb/>
     point no one can tell which lawyer is right 
     <lb/>
     and what view the Privy Council may take. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While I think that the educational clause 
     <lb/>
     as now drafted is fair and equitable, I re<lb break="no"/>pent that, in my opinion, it would be better 
     <lb/>
     not to go on with the Bill now but let the 
     <lb/>
     government find out first where we stand 
     <lb/>
     and what our powers really are before we 
     <lb/>
     attempt to legislate. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     It seems to me that the government is very 
     <lb/>
     much to blame for the hasty and ill 
     <lb/>
     considered way in which this measure was 
     <lb/>
     brought before the House and the country. 
     <lb/>
     The right hon. Prime Minister brought in 
     <lb/>
     this Bill on the 21st of February, and the 
     <lb/>
     greater part of his speech was an elaborate 
     <lb/>
     argument in favour of separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     and was of such a nature as to arouse a 
     <lb/>
     storm throughout the country on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and to make men of strong Protestant 
     <lb/>
     views believe there must be something very 
     <lb/>
     objectionable in the Bill. You must remem<lb break="no"/>ber, Mr. Speaker, that none of us had 
     <lb/>
     seen the Bill when the right hon. Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister presented it for its first reading, 
     <lb/>
     and still his speech produced in my mind 
     <lb/>
    the impression that he expected the 
     <lb/>measure to be strongly objected to by 
     <lb/>the Protestants of this country. That is 
     <lb/>exactly what happened. Petitions began to 
     <lb/>pour in at once, and a few days afterwards 
     <lb/>the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
     <lb/>resigned his office. After that, a whole 
     <lb/>month elapsed before the modified educa<lb break="no"/>tion clause was brought in by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and this agitation throughout the 
     <lb/>country kept on growing. I believe the 
     <lb/>storm of disapproval would never have 
     <lb/>arisen if the right hon. Prime Minister had 
     <lb/>consulted with his colleagues and his fol<lb break="no"/>lowers beforehand and had provided, in the 
     <lb/>first instance, simply for schools as they 
     <lb/>exist at present in the Northwest. I have 
     <lb/>no doubt that the people will place on the 
     <lb/>shoulders of the government, where it prop<lb break="no"/>erly belongs, the blame for the unfortu<lb break="no"/>nate agitation on this question that has 
     <lb/>swept over the country.
