     I understand that this is a matter more

     <lb/>
     such conduct is inconsistent with our

     criminal law and that the hon. Minister of

     Justice should take some steps in order

     to put a stop to it. It is with that end in

     attention had not been drawn to the news<lb break="no"/>paper report which my hon. friend has just 
     <lb/>
     read to this House. But I can tell him I

     am fully in accord with him to blame such

     an unjustifiable interference by newspaper

     men in murder cases. On the other hand, 
     <lb/>
     I must remind the hon. member that the 
     <lb/>
     administration of criminal law is not 
     <lb/>
     within the jurisdiction of this parliament, 
     <lb/>
     which has no other right than to define what 
     <lb/>
     constitutes criminal offences. A prisoner 
     <lb/>
     does not come under the control of the De<lb break="no"/>partment of Justice until the jury have

     found him guilty and sentence has been

     Speaker, in resuming the debate upon what 
     <lb/>
     I hold to be the most important piece of 
     <lb/>
     legislation that has been discussed by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian parliament since confederation, I 
     <lb/>
     feel deeply the responsibility resting upon 
     <lb/>
     me both for the vote I shall give as a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this House and for the opinions I 
     <lb/>
     shall express to-day. In the course of the 
     <lb/>
     very remarkable speech in which the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister introduced this legislation over a 
     <lb/>
     month ago, I was especially struck with 
     <lb/>
     one sentence, and that sentence has remain<lb break="no"/>ed in my memory ever since. Having re<lb break="no"/>viewed the legislation through which these 
     <lb/>
     Territories had passed since their entrance 
     <lb/>
     into confederation, the Prime Minister said : 
     <lb/>
     ' Now the time has come to put upon these 
     <lb/>
     Territories the stamp of Canadian nation<lb break="no"/>ality.' It is under the light of that principle 
     <lb/>
     that I intend to carry on this discussion. 
     <lb/>
     It seems to be that, through the turmoil, 
     <lb/>
     passions and prejudices that have been 
     <lb/>
     aroused, in sincerity perhaps on the part of  
     <lb/>
     people, but surely with no other purpose on 
     <lb/>

     the part of others than to snatch at popular 
     <lb/>
     favour at the expense of the better judgment 
     <lb/>
     of the country—I say that perhaps through 
     <lb/>
     the turmoil, passions and prejudices we 
     <lb/>
     have been passing through for the last 
     <lb/>
     month, too many Canadian citizens and Ca<lb break="no"/>nadian representatives have unfortunately 
     <lb/>
     forgotten the important duty they have to 
     <lb/>
     perform, and what will be the result of that 
     <lb/>
     duty. Sir, we should not forget that those 
     <lb/>
     Territories for which we are now legislating 
     <lb/>
     will probably contain within half a century 
     <lb/>
     or a century, one-half the population of 
     <lb/>
     Canada ; therefore if we have any interest 
     <lb/>
     in what is going to be the future of our 
     <lb/>
     common land, we should be very careful of 
     <lb/>
     all the articles of this piece of legislation, 
     <lb/>
     as well as of the comments we make upon 
     <lb/>
     them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not my intention to discuss at any 
     <lb/>
     length, or even to discuss at all, the other 
     <lb/>
     features of this Bill, but this one clause so 
     <lb/>
     much commented upon—I mean the school 
     <lb/>
     question. However, I may say in passing 
     <lb/>
     that I thoroughly agree with the position 
     <lb/>
     that was taken by the government on the 
     <lb/>
     land question. Starting from the same 
     <lb/>
     point of view I have just stated, namely, 
     <lb/>
     that we must put the stamp of Canadian 
     <lb/>
     nationality on these Territories, I think it 
     <lb/>
     was the duty of the federal government 
     <lb/>
     to retain within their powers the right to 
     <lb/>
     legislate over the granting of the lands upon 
     <lb/>
     which one half of the population of Canada 
     <lb/>
     will be called upon at no distant period to 
     <lb/>
     live and to prosper. Although I have the 
     <lb/>
     greatest confidence in the public spirit and 
     <lb/>
     patriotism of the men who are now at the 
     <lb/>
     head of public affairs in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, I say that before long the time 
     <lb/>
     may come when they will not be powerful 
     <lb/>
     enough to resist the pressure of the new<lb break="no"/>comers into that country, men that have 
     <lb/>
     perhaps no interest in the unity of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     who are not attached to the soil of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     who have had no part in the past history 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, and who, therefore, by numeri<lb break="no"/>cal strength, may try to force some ob<lb break="no"/>noxious legislation on the government of 
     <lb/>
     these Territories. I say, therefore, that for 
     <lb/>
     the protection of the Northwest, for the pro<lb break="no"/>tection of the present representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest, for the protection of the states<lb break="no"/>manship of the men who are now at the 
     <lb/>
     head of affairs there, it was good policy on 
     <lb/>
     the part of the government to retain the 
     <lb/>
     control and administration of the public 
     <lb/>
     lands in the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, coming to the question that has 
     <lb/>
     occupied the field of discussion for the last 
     <lb/>
     month, I may say that I intend to discuss it 
     <lb/>
     from a threefold point of view : from the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional point of view, from the reli<lb break="no"/>gious point of view and from the national 
     <lb/>
     point of view. In doing so I shall, as it is 
     <lb/>
     my custom, express frankly and clearly 
     <lb/>
     what I believe to be true, and in doing so I 
     <lb/>
     hope that I shall not offend any man in this 
     <lb/>
     House, because every man who is attached 
     <lb/>
     to his convictions will understand that in 
     <lb/>
     this free parliament of ours every true con<lb break="no"/>
   

            <cb/>
          

     viction should be frankly and sincerely ex<lb break="no"/>pressed. I may say at once that if 
     <lb/>
     there is a regrettable feature in all this 
     <lb/>
     discussion, it is not that passions have been 
     <lb/>
     aroused, it is not that prejudices have been 
     <lb/>
     raised. I entirely agree with the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister when he says that many of the 
     <lb/>
     passions that are now aroused spring from 
     <lb/>
     one of the noblest feelings in humanity, they 
     <lb/>
     come from an exaggeration, or from a per<lb break="no"/>version, of that which constitutes the most 
     <lb/>
     stable basis of a nation, namely, attach<lb break="no"/>ment to religious creed and attachment to 
     <lb/>
     national feeling. The men who are com<lb break="no"/>mitting a crime against this nation are 
     <lb/>
     those who, having opinions of their own, 
     <lb/>
     are trying to shelter themselves under a 
     <lb/>
     constitutional pretense. The great argu<lb break="no"/>ment which is being used by the opponents 
     <lb/>
     of this measure is, I may say, the shibbo<lb break="no"/>leth of provincial rights. Now, Sir, there 
     <lb/>
     is no man in this parliament who is more 
     <lb/>
     attached to provincial rights than I am. I 
     <lb/>
     am the descendant of a race that has claim<lb break="no"/>ed provincial rights for many years, and 
     <lb/>
     just because I am a sincere adherent of 
     <lb/>
     provincial rights, I say that if provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights are going to be maintained in this 
     <lb/>
     country, they cannot be maintained on any 
     <lb/>
     sham basis, they can only be maintained on 
     <lb/>
     a basis of equal justice to every part of 
     <lb/>
     our population and every section, from the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic to the Pacific. What are pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights as they relate to the school 
     <lb/>
     question ? I am not going into an acute 
     <lb/>
     analysis of every word and every letter in 
     <lb/>
     the text of the law, though I am not afraid 
     <lb/>
     to take up the study of the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     question with any man. But I think that 
     <lb/>
     once in a while when lawyers get into a 
     <lb/>
     muddle about small points of law, some<lb break="no"/>times a cool and common sense outsider 
     <lb/>
     may throw a little light upon common 
     <lb/>
     truths that are too much forgotten by law<lb break="no"/>yers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A few days ago the Prime Minister gave 
     <lb/>
     to this House a short history of one clause 
     <lb/>
     contained in our national constitution, that 
     <lb/>
     clause relating to school matters. But to 
     <lb/>
     my mind, if I may be permitted to say so, 
     <lb/>
     when a motion was made in this House in 
     <lb/>
     1893 by the late Minister of Public Works, 
     <lb/>
     then the member for L'Islet, the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister gave a still clearer and more com<lb break="no"/>plete history of the educational policy of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, he gave us the true origin of clause 
     <lb/>
     93 of the British North America Act. What 
     <lb/>
     was that origin ? That although for a cen<lb break="no"/>tury the Protestant minority in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec had been treated, not only in the 
     <lb/>
     most just, but also in the most generous 
     <lb/>
     manner, still that minority was averse to 
     <lb/>
     joining the confederation compact unless 
     <lb/>
     their privileges and rights in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec were made absolutely secure. There<lb break="no"/>upon it was proposed that the same measure 
     <lb/>
     of guarantee which was asked by the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant minority of Quebec should be given 
     <lb/>
     to the Catholic minority in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and the other provinces. Now, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     I am bound to say that there was at that 
     <lb/>


            <pb n="3255" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3255.jpg"/>

     time something of the same feeling that 
     <lb/>
     exists now, but that feeling was frank 
     <lb/>
     enough not to take refuge in legal quibbles. 
     <lb/>
     It was stated then, as it is now outside of 
     <lb/>
     this parliament, that there should be one 
     <lb/>
     rule of justice for the Catholics and another 
     <lb/>
     rule of justice for Protestants ; that there 
     <lb/>
     should not be one law for both the Catho<lb break="no"/>lics and Protestants, but that the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     should have one law requiring them to re<lb break="no"/>spect the Protestant rights in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec. while in the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     the Catholics should rely upon the generosi<lb break="no"/>ty of the majority. Indeed, the Hon. A. T. 
     <lb/>
     Galt, then the accredited representative of 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant minority in Quebec, went to 
     <lb/>
     England to secure the adoption of clause 
     <lb/>
     93. Now, eminent legal men in this House, 
     <lb/>
     eminent jurists, have tried to make out a 
     <lb/>
     case that this clause 93 in the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act should be cut in two, and that 
     <lb/>
     wherever a Protestant province outside of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario is concerned you should read only 
     <lb/>
     the first paragraph of it, thereby giving an 
     <lb/>
     absolute freedom to the majority to do what<lb break="no"/>ever they like. I will not give you my own 
     <lb/>
     authority, I will not give you the authority 
     <lb/>
     of any man of my creed and nationality in 
     <lb/>
     opposing the proposition laid down by the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition and by Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain ; I will go to the highest authority in 
     <lb/>this empire to prove that this argument is 
     <lb/>but a sham pretense, because the opposition 
     <lb/>in this parliament is afraid on the one hand 
     <lb/>to grant justice to the minority in the west 
     <lb/>and is afraid on the other hand to state it 
     <lb/>frankly before the people of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     When the British North America Act was 
     <lb/>
     presented to the British parliament, Lord 
     <lb/>
     Carnarvon was Secretary of State for the 
     <lb/>
     Colonies and was responsible for the legis<lb break="no"/>lation as such, and Lord Carnarvon has 
     <lb/>
     given a definition of what were the 
     <lb/>
     respective powers of the federal and 
     <lb/>
     provincial authority. I respectfully beg the 
     <lb/>
     liberty of commending that opinion of Lord 
     <lb/>
     Carnarvon to the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     in this House. That hon. gentleman (Mr. R. 
     <lb/>
     L. Borden) has charged the government with 
     <lb/>
     trying to confuse the federal and the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial powers in this Bill, and throughout 
     <lb/>
     the country the press has stated that edu<lb break="no"/>cation belonged to the provinces, and that 
     <lb/>
     there was no interference of the federal 
     <lb/>
     parliament possible in educational matters, 
     <lb/>
     unless in Ontario and Quebec. It has been 
     <lb/>
     stated that the powers of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act are divided into three classes ; 
     <lb/>
     those that belong exclusively to the federal 
     <lb/>
     government in clause 91 ; those that be<lb break="no"/>long exclusively to the provinces in clause 
     <lb/>
     92 ; and those questions on which both 
     <lb/>
     the federal and provincial parliaments have 
     <lb/>
     concurrent jurisdiction. A clearer defi<lb break="no"/>nition was given in the British parliament 
     <lb/>
     when the Bill was introduced there, and I 
     <lb/>
     suppose we will all accept the good British 
     <lb/>
     theory that if there is a division of opinion 
     <lb/>
     as to the effect of a law, we must go to 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
           

     the real thought of the enacting legislature 
     <lb/>
     in order to properly understand it. Lord 
     <lb/>
     Carnarvon said in the House of Lords on 
     <lb/>
     the 19th of February, 1867, when moving 
     <lb/>
     the second reading of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act :

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>

     That classification is fourfold : First, those

     <lb/>
     the central parliament exclusively. Secondly, 
     <lb/>

     Lastly, in the 93rd clause which contains the

     exceptional provisions to which I refer, your

     lordships will observe some rather complicated 
     <lb/>
     arrangement in reference to education. I need

     hardly say that that great question gives rise

     to nearly as much earnestness and division of 
     <lb/>

     This clause has been framed after long and

     anxious controversy in which all parties have 
     <lb/>
     been represented and on conditions to which all 
     <lb/>

     It is true that the origin of that clause 
     <lb/>
     was a compact between the delegates from 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada and the delegates from Lower 
     <lb/>
     Canada, but fortunately at that time there 
     <lb/>
     were at the head of both parties in this coun<lb break="no"/>try men who had enough sense of justice to 
     <lb/>
     understand that in laying the basis of our 
     <lb/>
     confederation the result of a compact be<lb break="no"/>tween the provinces should be crystallized 
     <lb/>
     under law into a triumphant principle, and 
     <lb/>
     it was that principle which was embodied 
     <lb/>
     in this clause—not to furnish arguments to 
     <lb/>
     legal quibblers who might come thirty years 
     <lb/>
     later, but on the contrary, to lay down as 
     <lb/>
     the basis of justice in this Dominion, that 
     <lb/>
     a man, in whatever province of Canada he 
     <lb/>
     may choose his abode, can rest assured that 
     <lb/>
     justice and equality will reign and that no 
     <lb/>
     matter what the majority may attempt to

     do they cannot persecute the minority.

     Act, or to be more correct perhaps I should 
     <lb/>
     say upon the spirit of that clause, by the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba tribunal of the empire. When the

     ed by the counsel representing it was ms argu<lb break="no"/>ed by the counsel representing <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>
     as it has been argued here during this debate 
     <lb/>
     that the exceptions—or rather that the sub<lb break="no"/>sections to clause 93—applied only to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces then existing, and even only to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It 
     <lb/>
     was therefore contended that the power of 
     <lb/>
     interference that the Catholics of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     were claiming from this parliament, was 
     <lb/>
     inconsistent with provincial autonomy in 
     <lb/>
     matters of education. What was Lord Her<lb break="no"/>schel's answer to that contention in his

     judgment ? I shall read it:

     Now, Mr. Speaker, education is not the 
     <lb/>
     only subject upon which federal and pro<lb break="no"/>vincial jurisdiction come in conflict once 
     <lb/>
     in a while. The provinces have the ex<lb break="no"/>clusive right to legislate on civil matters, 
     <lb/>
     but every day we are passing laws here in 
     <lb/>
     relation to railways and in relation to bank<lb break="no"/>ing and commerce which interfere with the 
     <lb/>
     provincial powers. Where are these up<lb break="no"/>holders of provincial rights? A province in 
     <lb/>
     this fair Dominion, some three or four years 
     <lb/>
     ago, passed laws in relation to labour by 
     <lb/>
     which it endeavoured to exclude a certain 
     <lb/>
     class of people from their territory. The 
     <lb/>
     federal government disallowed that law be<lb break="no"/>cause it was against the interest of the 
     <lb/>
     British government. Where were the apos<lb break="no"/>tles of provincial rights then ? If I may say 
     <lb/>
     it, I was the only man to stand up in this 
     <lb/>
     House and proclaim that the province of 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia had a right to exclude 
     <lb/>
     Asiatic labour. Those gentlemen who seem 
     <lb/>
     to be so sincere when they claim that pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights should be the basis of our 
     <lb/>
     constitution, should not do as was done in 
     <lb/>

<cb/>

     the United States when state rights were 
     <lb/>
     invoked by men who wanted to retain on the 
     <lb/>
     fair flag of the United States the abomin<lb break="no"/>able stain ot' slavery. I say to these gen- 
     <lb/> <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>
     they want to have peace and harmony in 
     <lb/>
     this country; if they desire that every 
     <lb/>
     citizen of Canada shall feel that Canada is 
     <lb/>
     his country, then let not these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     come here and speak of provincial rights 
     <lb/>
     if their object is to make provincial rights 
     <lb/>
     an instrument of tyranny and injustice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Haultain, in his letter to the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister, has admitted frankly that section 
     <lb/>
     93 applied evidently to the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories—in fact, that the moment the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories became a province, that 
     <lb/>
     section applied mechanically from the day 
     <lb/>
     they were admitted into confederation, that 
     <lb/>
     is, in the month of July, 1870. Here again 
     <lb/>
     I find shelter for my dissent from the opin<lb break="no"/>ion of Mr. Haultain in the opinion of an<lb break="no"/>other man learned in the law—I mean Lord 
     <lb/>
     Watson, of the Privy Council. When the 
     <lb/>
     argument in the Manitoba case was pro<lb break="no"/>ceeding before the Privy Council, Lord 
     <lb/>
     Watson interrupted Mr. Cozens Hardy, one 
     <lb/>
     of the counsels in that case, and what did 
     <lb/>
     he say about the very clause so frequently 
     <lb/>
     discussed in this House—clause 146, which 
     <lb/>
     authorizes the federal government to admit 
     <lb/>
     into the union the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
    and to carve provinces out of them? He 
     <lb/>said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>The Imperial legislature in the Act of 1867 
     <lb/>left niches to be filled by other provinces. As 
     <lb/>soon as those other provinces came in they 
     <lb/>were within the terms of section 93, but I quite 
     <lb/>admit, in this case, the terms upon which Mani<lb break="no"/>toba came into the federation were settled 
     <lb/>by the Dominion parliament, otherwise they 
     <lb/>could not have exempted Manitoba from the 
     <lb/>provisions of section 93.

            <p>
     We have here the opinion of Lord Wat<lb break="no"/>son that the federal parliament acted with<lb break="no"/>in its jurisdiction when it exempted Mani<lb break="no"/>toba from all the provisions of section 93, 
     <lb/>
     that is, when it claimed for Manitoba the 
     <lb/>
     rights under section 22 of the Manitoba Act 
     <lb/>
     as opposed to section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act which departed materially 
     <lb/>
     from it. Therefore we have here the dis<lb break="no"/>sent of Lord Watson from the opinion laid 
     <lb/>
     down by Mr. Haultain and the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition that we must accept section 
     <lb/>
     93 without modification as applicable to 
     <lb/>
     these provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But, Sir, I suppose that when the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories were admitted into con<lb break="no"/>federation, the Canadian parliament meant 
     <lb/>
     what it said. I take also for granted that 
     <lb/>
     when the Imperial Order in Council was 
     <lb/>
     adopted, the imperial government knew 
     <lb/>
     what it did. Upon what terms were those 
     <lb/>
     Territories admitted? I will again read 
     <lb/>
     section 146 to show the point I want to 
     <lb/>
     make. That section says:

     Mr. Haultain's contention is that the pow<lb break="no"/>ers exercised under that Order in Council 
     <lb/>
     were provisional, and that the moment we 
     <lb/>
     pass this legislation those powers are wiped 
     <lb/>
     out and the educational provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     law of 1875 are abolished in the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
     because. he says, you could only give pro<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
          
visional powers. and the moment you create 
     <lb/>
     provincial government. the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     must have the same powers as the other  
     <lb/>provinces.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now, the history of the legislation of 
     <lb/>1875 has been given in this debate. The 
     <lb/>origin of that Act, which was introduced 
     <lb/>by Mr. Mackenzie at Mr. Blake's request, 
     <lb/>was stated in the debates of those days. 
     <lb/>Was it enacted that separate schools should 
     <lb/>exist in the Northwest Territories only for 
     <lb/>the time that they should be under our 
     <lb/>care and supervision? Was it only a pro<lb break="no"/>visional disposition ? No. Mr. Blake stated 
     <lb/>that we should avoid introducing into that 
     <lb/>new country the religious disputes that 
     <lb/>had existed in the other provinces, because 
     <lb/>the parliament of Canada wanted to in<lb break="no"/>vite Roman Catholics to settle in the 
     <lb/>Northwest Territories as freely as ally 
     <lb/>other class of people. Was it hinted 
     <lb/>that the Roman Catholic who went there 
     <lb/>to settle would have the liberty of edu<lb break="no"/>cation, as long as the provisional govern<lb break="no"/>ment existed, but that the moment this par<lb break="no"/>liament. which had given its pledge of 
     <lb/>honour that that liberty should exist for all 
     <lb/>time to come. formed a provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment. that government would be free to 
     <lb/>wipe out this privilege ? After a man had 
     <lb/>tilled the. soil for twentynfive or thirty 
     <lb/>years in the hope that his children would 
     <lb/>reap the benefit of his labour and have the 
     <lb/>same liberty that he had enjoyed, was it in<lb break="no"/>tended that the federal parliament should 
     <lb/>then say to him : 'You shall have your lib<lb break="no"/>erty no longer' and leave him at the mercy 
     <lb/>of the majority which has given evidence 
     <lb/>that it would not permit him to have that 
     <lb/>freedom ? I say that if this parliament 
     <lb/>acted in good faith in 1875—and I do not 
     <lb/>want to presume that Mr. Blake. Mr. Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie, Sir John Macdonald and Sir Alex<lb break="no"/>ander Campbell were men who did not act 
     <lb/>in good faith towards the people who would 
     <lb/>settle there—we are bound in honour, what<lb break="no"/>ever may be the text of the law or the ar<lb break="no"/>guments of quibblers—if we are not bound 
     <lb/>by a sheet of paper. we are bound by the 
     <lb/>honour of this parliament. and by the mem<lb break="no"/>ory of the men who made confederation— 
     <lb/>men like Mr. Mackenzie, Mr. Blake, Sir 
     <lb/>John Macdonald and Sir Alexander Camp<lb break="no"/>bell—to be true to the pledge they gave 
     <lb/>and to prove that those statesmen were not 
     <lb/>perjurers.

            <p>
     But how is it that Mr. Haultain and 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition, with their great 
     <lb/>
     care for provincial rights, have not a word 
     <lb/>
     to say against the maintenance of the con<lb break="no"/>tract with the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     Company which was passed by this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment ? Where are provincial rights in 
     <lb/>
     that case ? Where is the theory of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain, that everything we did before 
     <lb/>
     this was provisional, and that we cannot 
     <lb/>
     restrict the new provinces? Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain. the leader of the opposition and the

     hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule), 
     <lb/>
     are willing that we should impose on the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories for all 
     <lb/>
     time to come the incubus of that legisla<lb break="no"/>tion. If we are going outside of our powers 
     <lb/>
     in trying to maintain the Act of 1875, in the 
     <lb/>
     matter of education, how is it that we are 
     <lb/>
     acting within our powers in maintaining the 
     <lb/>
     contract with the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way as regards the taxation of property in 
     <lb/>
     those Territories ? At different intervals, 
     <lb/>
     while listening to the speech of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition on the second 
     <lb/>
     reading of this Bill, I was reminded of a 
     <lb/>
     saying of Sir Charles Tupper. And of Sir 
     <lb/>
     Charles this must be said, and I think it 
     <lb/>
     will be admitted on both sides, whatever 
     <lb/>
     may be our views regarding him in other 
     <lb/>
     respects, that he was always frank and 
     <lb/>
     outspoken. He never tried to shelter him<lb break="no"/>self behind small texts of law. I well re<lb break="no"/>member a sentence he uttered once during 
     <lb/>
     the debate on the Manitoba school question. 
     <lb/>
     Being taunted one day with not being versed 
     <lb/>
     in the law and being told that he had better 
     <lb/>
     not mix himself up with those legal texts. 
     <lb/>
     the old gentleman said : If to be a lawyer 
     <lb/>
     means that one must confine himself to texts 
     <lb/>
     of law and forget the difference between 
     <lb/>
     truth and untruth, I thank Heaven I am not 
     <lb/>
     a lawyer. Sir, at one part of the speech of 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition I was forcibly 
     <lb/>
     reminded of that declaration of his predeces<lb break="no"/>sor. It was when turning to the Orange 
     <lb/>
     section of his party—I would rather not refer 
     <lb/>
     to the fact but it was patent to everybody— 
     <lb/>
     he said : If the government will show me a 
     <lb/>
     written contract in the case of education 
     <lb/>
     such as exists in the case of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Pacific Railway, I am ready to abide by 
     <lb/>
     its maintenance. I am afraid, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     that in his study of texts and legal quibbles, 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend has forgotten one of the 
     <lb/>
     basic principles of law, and that is that the 
     <lb/>
     written document is not the contract. What 
     <lb/>
     is really the contract is the agreement en<lb break="no"/>tered into between the two parties, and the 
     <lb/>
     written document is only the evidence of 
     <lb/>
     that agreement. I will go further. Written 
     <lb/>
     contracts were invented by legislators when 
     <lb/>
     men became dishonest enough not to be 
     <lb/>
     true to their pledges and in order to guard 
     <lb/>
     against dishonesty. But if we are bound 
     <lb/>
     by our contract with the Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway, if the hon. the leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition and his followers are not strong 
     <lb/>
     enough to oppose the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way, are we not bound by a far greater 
     <lb/>
     bond to the minority in the west, if there is 
     <lb/>
     any sense of justice and honour in this 
     <lb/>
     parliament ? Are we not bound by the 
     <lb/>
     promise made by the highest statesmen of 
     <lb/>
     this country to the fathers of families who 
     <lb/>
     settled in these Territories, relying on the 
     <lb/>
     word of honour of the Canadian parliament ? 
     <lb/>
     Are we not bound in honour by the word 
     <lb/>
     given to two millions of our fellow subjects 
     <lb/>
     of His Majesty, that in those Territories, 
     <lb/>
     which were bought with their money as well 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
       

     as the money of the majority, the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the minority, the freedom of conscience of 
     <lb/>
     the minority would be respected ? This is 
     <lb/>
     a fact which should not be forgotten. With<lb break="no"/>out going again into a deep and fine study 
     <lb/>
     of the question whether those Territories 
     <lb/>
     became part of the union in 1870 or whether 
     <lb/>
     those new provinces are entering the union 
     <lb/>
     now, there is one thing we know, and that 
     <lb/>
     is that they were purchased and paid for by 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada as a whole. We know 
     <lb/>
     that every dollar which has been spent on 
     <lb/>
     the development of that country, we know 
     <lb/>
     that the millions of dollars which have been 
     <lb/>
     expended to bring foreign people into it, 
     <lb/>
     were contributed by Roman Catholics as 
     <lb/>
     well as Protestants. Now, Mr. Speaker, if 
     <lb/>
     there is one principle upon which I think we 
     <lb/>
     can safely appeal to the spirit of justice of 
     <lb/>
     any English speaking majority, it is that 
     <lb/>
     every man is equal before the collector of 
     <lb/>
     taxes. Therefore I say that when we are 
     <lb/>
     considering the rights and the law and the 
     <lb/>
     constitution, this very simple fact should 
     <lb/>
     not be forgotten. May I not go a little 
     <lb/>
     further ? May I not make a special appeal, 
     <lb/>
     not to my compatriots but to the English 
     <lb/>
     speaking majority of this parliament, to 
     <lb/>
     pause and consider a little what the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians have done for the opening up and 
     <lb/>
     development of that country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When the English settlers of His Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty were still on the banks of the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic and had not crossed the Ohio and 
     <lb/>
     the Missouri, French Canadian priests, 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian traders and settlers had 
     <lb/>
     opened up that country. I shall go further. 
     <lb/>
     If there is one thing which ought to make 
     <lb/>
     a Canadian proud of his country, it is the 
     <lb/>
     contrast between the relations that have 
     <lb/>
     existed in Canada between the white and 
     <lb/>
     the red men and those relations which have 
     <lb/>
     existed between these two races in the 
     <lb/>
     neighbouring republic. Admitting that some 
     <lb/>
     credit is due to the policy of the government, 
     <lb/>
     long before governments existed, long before 
     <lb/>
     any law was introduced into that country, 
     <lb/>
     Catholic priests had gone there ; and if those 
     <lb/>
     pioneers of Christian faith had not 200 
     <lb/>
     years ago gone into that country to preach 
     <lb/>
     the law of charity and Christian civilization, 
     <lb/>
     we would have had repeated in Canada the 
     <lb/>
     same sad lamentable story of wars between 
     <lb/>
     the white and the red man which has 
     <lb/>
     marked the history of the United States. 
     <lb/>
     The peace of this western country of ours 
     <lb/>
     has been due to the good seed of charity, 
     <lb/>
     civilization and enlightenment which was 
     <lb/>
     sown there years ago by the members 
     <lb/>
     of that hierarchy which is now trying to 
     <lb/>
     impose its will upon the tender consciences 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friend the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion and Mr. Haultain. Let me proceed 
     <lb/>
     further, and point out that in 1870 there was 
     <lb/>
     a rebellion in that country, and a rebellion 
     <lb/>
     which has been justified by history and by 
     <lb/>
     the testimony of many public men. On 
     <lb/>
     what did the government of Canada then 
     <lb/>
     rely to appease those people ? Did it rely on 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="3263" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3263.jpg"/>
          <fw type="num">3263</fw>  <fw type="num">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3264</fw>
          

     armaments and rifles ? No, it relied on 
     <lb/>
     still more effective means. Were there then 
     <lb/>
     any cries raised about the powerful domin<lb break="no"/>ation of the hierarchy ? No, the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister of that day, Sir John Macdonald, 
     <lb/>
     begged Archbishop Taché, who was then in 
     <lb/>
     Rome, for Heaven sake, to come back at 
     <lb/>
     once to Canada and establish peace in the 
     <lb/>
     Red River settlement. There is no hesita<lb break="no"/>tion to call in the hierarchy, when we can 
     <lb/>
     benefit by its aid. As the editor of ' La 
     <lb/>
     Patrie ' very happily put it the other day : 
     <lb/>
     What we are denied is not our right to pay. 
     <lb/>
     Oh, no, it is our right to have full freedom. 
     <lb/>
     Archbishop Taché acted at once on this 
     <lb/>
     appeal. He abandoned his functions at the 
     <lb/>
     Ecumenical Council at Rome and came to 
     <lb/>
     the Red River settlement, and on his way 
     <lb/>
     stopped at Ottawa to meet Sir John Mac<lb break="no"/>donald. ' Take any steps, said Sir John to 
     <lb/>
     him, to appease the Indians and the half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     breeds.' Archbishop Taché however did not 
     <lb/>
     want to impose any pledges on politicians 
     <lb/>
     which perhaps they would not be strong 
     <lb/>
     enough to keep, and all he promised the 
     <lb/>
     native population was that the division of 
     <lb/>
     their lands would be respected and that they 
     <lb/>
     would have the free exercise of their re<lb break="no"/>ligion and the schools they preferred for 
     <lb/>
     their children. What has become of those 
     <lb/>
     pledges ? The lands were divided against 
     <lb/>
     the wishes of those people and a second re<lb break="no"/>bellion took place—a rebellion which has 
     <lb/>
     been justified by no less an authority than 
     <lb/>
     Colonel Denison who will not be charged 
     <lb/>
     with disloyalty and French demagogy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What has become of the religious liberty, 
     <lb/>
     of the liberty of teaching of the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     population of the Northwest ? It has been 
     <lb/>
     abolished in Manitoba, against all pledges, 
     <lb/>
     against all words of honour ; and the author 
     <lb/>
     of that legislation can gain applause in this 
     <lb/>
     House by saying : ' If I have a title to the 
     <lb/>
     approval and support of the people of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, it is because I have gone back upon 
     <lb/>
     the pledges given in the name of the Queen 
     <lb/>
     of England to a law-abiding and peaceful 
     <lb/>
     population.' This, Mr. Speaker, is what we 
     <lb/>
     have come to. And now we are called upon 
     <lb/>
     to bow to this storm of feeling that has been 
     <lb/>
     aroused and to allow a still greater invasion 
     <lb/>
     of the rights of the people of that territory. 
     <lb/>
     It is time to face the storm. The pow<lb break="no"/>ers that have raised that storm do not de<lb break="no"/>serve that we should acknowledge their 
     <lb/>
     sovereignty. The principle of provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights is against them. The constitution 
     <lb/>
     is against them. The law is against them. 
     <lb/>
     Past pledges are against them. I will go 
     <lb/>
     further and say that a religious principle 
     <lb/>
     is at stake in this matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under the terms of the capitulation of 
     <lb/>
     Montreal, in 1760, and of the Treaty of Paris 
     <lb/>
     of 1763, the free exercise of the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     religion was promised to the settlers who 
     <lb/>
     remained in Canada. And I say that there 
     <lb/>
     is no free exercise of the Catholic religion 
     <lb/>
     unless the Catholic parent has the full right 
     <lb/>
     to give to his child the education he wishes 
     <lb/>
     to give according to his conscientious be<lb break="no"/>

     liefs. It is strange that there should exist 
     <lb/>
     in this country a prepossession in the minds 
     <lb/>
     of some people to the effect that in matters of 
     <lb/>
     education Roman Catholics have nothing to 
     <lb/>
     complain of if, in the public schools aided 
     <lb/>
     by the government, there is no sectarian 
     <lb/>
     education. As against this, let me put the 
     <lb/>
     authority, not of Roman Catholics, not of 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians, not of Canadian politi<lb break="no"/>cians, but of members of the Privy Council. 
     <lb/>
     During the appeal cases on the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     school question this argument to which I 
     <lb/>
     have referred was brought forward—that 
     <lb/>
     there was no injustice under the laws of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, that the Catholics were on exact<lb break="no"/>ly the same footing as all others with re<lb break="no"/>spect to education, because education in the 
     <lb/>
     public schools was perfectly non-sectarian. 
     <lb/>
     What did Lord Watson say about that ?

     These kind of questions were more or less 
     <lb/>
     burning questions in Great Britain about the 
     <lb/>
     year 1865 or 1866. and during the whole of that 
     <lb/>
     period, as far as my knowledge and experience 
     <lb/>
     goes, there were large classes of Protestants, 
     <lb/>
     and especially Presbyterian Protestants, who 
     <lb/>
     I am glad to see are recognized as Christians 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba, who were in favour of secular

     education, and think that religious education 
     <lb/>
     ought to be imparted in the family, or by the

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I rather think that the original idea

     a sect of people who are desirous that their 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     in their own way—a doctrinal religion ; and

     not only taught because religion is taught in

     a non-sectarian school, but, in the view of those

     who founded denominational schools originally, 
     <lb/>
     the theory was that their views of religion and 
     <lb/>
     teaching of their religion should permeate and

     run through all the education given in the 
     <lb/>

     they were distinctly Protestant in their 
     <lb/>
     character. It is true that the religious 
     <lb/>
     exercises prescribed for public schools are not 
     <lb/>
     to be distinctively Protestant, for they are to 
     <lb/>
     be 'non-sectarian,' and any parent may with<lb break="no"/>draw his child from them. There may be 
     <lb/>
     many who share the view expressed in one of 
     <lb/>
     the affidavits in Barrett's case, that there 
     <lb/>
     should not be any conscientious objections on 
     <lb/>
     the part of Roman Catholics to attend such 
     <lb/>
     schools, if adequate means be provided else<lb break="no"/>where ot giving such moral and religious train<lb break="no"/>ing as may be desired. But all this is not to

     of Roman Catholics to schools such as alone 
     <lb/>
     receive state aid under the Act of 1890 is

     Is it not a strange fact that in England, 
     <lb/>
     the centre and heart of Protestantism, where 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic population is but a mere hand<lb break="no"/>ful, where the idea of Roman Catholicism is 
     <lb/>
     generally associated in the public mind with 
     <lb/>
     the Irish land question or the agitation in 
     <lb/>
     favour of home rule for Ireland—is it not 
     <lb/>
     strange that Protestant statesmen and law<lb break="no"/>yers should have a better understanding and 
     <lb/>
     a broader view of what the rights of Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholics are than in this country, 
     <lb/>
     where Roman Catholics form two-fifths of 
     <lb/>
     the population, and where no man can point 
     <lb/>
     to an action, individual or collective, to the 
     <lb/>
     discredit of Roman Catholics so far as 
     <lb/>
     their loyalty, their observance of the law,

     or their national spirit, is concerned ?

     And this brings me to a question that 
     <lb/>
     has been lightly touched upon in this 
     <lb/>
     House by—I was going to say the yellow 
     <lb/>
     hierarchy which has been lightly touched 
     <lb/>
     upon by the hon. member for East Grey 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sproule). And—it is just as well to 
     <lb/>
     frankly admit it—this question is the very 
     <lb/>
     basis of this discussion. I wish to treat 
     <lb/>
     completely, if I can, the question of the in<lb break="no"/>fluence of the hierarchy and the alleged 
     <lb/>
     sinister motives animating the Roman Cath<lb break="no"/>olics in this House. I have referred to the 
     <lb/>
     case of Archbishop Taché in 1870. That 
     <lb/>
     was only one instance. Let us take our 
     <lb/>
     history since the beginning ; and I may say 
     <lb/>
     that when I read what is now appearing in 
     <lb/>
     the Ontario newspapers, I cannot help ask<lb break="no"/>ing myself what kind of history can be 
     <lb/>
     taught in the public schools of Ontario? 
     <lb/>
     Eleven years after this country had been 
     <lb/>
     acquired by England by treaty, when prac<lb break="no"/>tically the whole population of Canada was 
     <lb/>
     French and Catholic, when the English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking Protestant population consisted al<lb break="no"/>most wholly of a few traders in the city of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, as the House knows, some trouble 
     <lb/>
     arose in certain English—speaking Protestant 
     <lb/>
     communities to the south, and some regi<lb break="no"/>ments, entirely composed of Anglo-Saxons 
     <lb/>
     and Protestants, came to besiege Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     The Governor of that day was named Guy 
     <lb/>
     Carleton—I do not know whether his name 
     <lb/>
     is ever mentioned in the public school his<lb break="no"/>tories of Ontario. "When it was known that 
     <lb/>
     these regiments were on their way to Que<lb break="no"/>bec, Governor Carleton issued a proclama<lb break="no"/>tion requiring all those who were not loyal 
     <lb/>
     to the British Crown to leave the city, and 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
    

     calling upon those who were loyal to the 
     <lb/>
     Crown to remain and defend it. Who went 
     <lb/>
     out? Who staid in ? All the English Pro<lb break="no"/>testants leftthe city and went to the Island 
     <lb/>
     of Orleans to wait for the result. The 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians, who have been conquer<lb break="no"/>ed twelve years before, remained there and 
     <lb/>
     saved Canada to the British Crown. Mind 
     <lb/>
     you. there were among the Anglo-Saxon 
     <lb/>
     rebels men of our race and creed. There 
     <lb/>
     were French regiments in the American 
     <lb/>
     army. Appeals were made to us by men 
     <lb/>
     of our blood, men whom the French race 
     <lb/>
     had no reason to be ashamed of. Among 
     <lb/>
     them was the Marquis de Lafayette. And 
     <lb/>
     what was our answer to the Marquis de 
     <lb/>
     Lafayette? Under the guidance of that 
     <lb/>
     dominating hierarchy, we declared that we 
     <lb/>
     believed in the pledge given us by the King 
     <lb/>
     of England. We declared: The free prac<lb break="no"/>tise of our religion is guaranteed to us; 
     <lb/>
     and, so long as the King will not go back 
     <lb/>
     on us, we will never go back on him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Thirty-six years later there was another 
     <lb/>
     little disturbance between the two great 
     <lb/>
     branches of the Anglo-Saxon Protestant fa<lb break="no"/>mily. Canada was again invaded ; and re<lb break="no"/>member that in those 36 years of time, the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians had been ill-treated, their 
     <lb/>
     public men had been put in gaol because 
     <lb/>
     they wanted to have what ? The same right 
     <lb/>
     that British citizens enjoyed in any other 
     <lb/>
     part of the empire. Their bishops had been 
     <lb/>
     threatened with the same treatment if 
     <lb/>
     they still dared to appoint parish priests 
     <lb/>
     instead of allowing Governor Craig to no<lb break="no"/>minate them himself. In spite of that when 
     <lb/>
     the time of danger came, what did the rep<lb break="no"/>resentative of that obnoxious hierarchy say? 
     <lb/>
     He said: ' My brethren, it is true we have 
     <lb/>
     been ill—treated, but I still believe that the 
     <lb/>
     law of justice will be stronger with our 
     <lb/>
     King than injustice ; stand by him, be 
     <lb/>
     loyal, be constitutional and the time of 
     <lb/>
     justice will come.' The French Canadians 
     <lb/>
     fought at Chateauguay and elsewhere and 
     <lb/>
     once again contributed to save Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Twenty-five years later, the same ill-treat<lb break="no"/>ment having been carried on, some of our 
     <lb/>
     people rebelled, wrongly I think, not be<lb break="no"/>cause their case was not just, but because, 
     <lb/>
     as their leader at the time, Papineau, told 
     <lb/>
     them, the rule of any British citizen was 
     <lb/>
     to carry on constitutional agitation but to 
     <lb/>
     avoid rebellion. In any case, at the request 
     <lb/>
     of an English speaking Protestant physi<lb break="no"/>cian of the British army they rebelled in 
     <lb/>
     arms. Who stood out against the rebel<lb break="no"/>lion ? The same obnoxious representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the hierarchy who asked the French Ca<lb break="no"/>nadians to remain peaceful.

     A few years later an annexation move<lb break="no"/>ment was started in Canada. By whom ? 
     <lb/>
     By the hierarchy ? By the Jesuits ? By 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians and Catholics? No, by 
     <lb/>
     the very political fathers of the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite, because the British Crown 
     <lb/>
     at last had opened its ears to the claims of 
     <lb/>
     its French speaking subjects and was be<lb break="no"/>ginning to grant justice, and as those gen<lb break="no"/>

tlemen had been fed on injustice for years 
     <lb/>
     and years they rebelled against the Crown 
     <lb/>
     and pelted the governor because he had 
     <lb/>
     granted a measure of justice to the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians; and immediately after that they 
     <lb/>
     issued an annexation manifesto. Some 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians signed it and others were 
     <lb/>
     disposed to sign it. Again came the ob<lb break="no"/>noxious power of the hierarchy who told 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada: 'No, be true and 
     <lb/>
     loyal, the day of justice is beginning to 
     <lb/>
     dawn and it will come by and by.' Later 
     <lb/>
     on when Confederation was being discussed 
     <lb/>
     it was not, entirely acceptable to the people 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec. They had some suspicion of 
     <lb/>
     the treatment they might receive at the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the English speaking majority 
     <lb/>
     which up to that moment had not been 
     <lb/>
     such as to give them much confidence for 
     <lb/>
     the future. Again the hierarchy stood up 
     <lb/>
     and asked the people of Quebec to accept 
     <lb/>
     the compact which had been entered into. 
     <lb/>
     Has the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule) and his colleagues of the same— 
     <lb/>
     might I say hierarchy or sect? no, of the 
     <lb/>
     same, group of thought, if there is any 
     <lb/>
     thought in that group—have these gentle<lb break="no"/>men ever reflected on that point? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Heap it on strong. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. They have. I think, 
     <lb/>
     one group of allies in Quebec. There has 
     <lb/>
     been for many years past a small anti<lb break="no"/>clerical party that has been using all these 
     <lb/>
     arguments against the domination of the 
     <lb/>
     priests, against the power of the hierarchy, 
     <lb/>
     but what has been their aim and object? 
     <lb/>
     It has always been to throw down the 
     <lb/>
     British flag; and the great grievance they 
     <lb/>
     have against the bishops is that the bishops 
     <lb/>
     prevented us from joining the United States 
     <lb/>
     in 1774, again in 1812. and opposed the re<lb break="no"/>bellion of 1837, supported British supremacy 
     <lb/>
     in 1849 and induced us to accept confede<lb break="no"/>ration. When newspapers in Ontario are 
     <lb/>
     filling their sheets with attacks and insults 
     <lb/>
     on the hierarchy they are simply insulting 
     <lb/>
     the men who, for 100 years have been the 
     <lb/>
     bulwark of British government in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     If there was any sincerity in these men, 
     <lb/>
     who are the great apostles and preachers 
     <lb/>
     ot loyalty, they should feel ashamed of the 
     <lb/>
     attack they are now launching on the Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic bishops of Canada, because when 
     <lb/>
     they attack the hierarchy they attack the 
     <lb/>
     party that has always stood by the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown, that has always stood by law, that 
     <lb/>
     has always stood by the flag that has given 
     <lb/>
     us the basis of a nation in this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Coming back to the point where I left my 
     <lb/>
     argument, it is just as well to realize the 
     <lb/>
     position in which we are. When you speak 
     <lb/>
     of the liberty granted to the Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic to go into a non-sectarian school there 
     <lb/>
     is no such thing as liberty. He may abide 
     <lb/>
     by the law if he be forced to send his child 
     <lb/>
     to such a school, but his religious Iibertv is 
     <lb/>
     interfered with. When. by any measure in 
     <lb/>
     this House or in any provincial parliament 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
          

     you force a Roman Catholic to send his 
     <lb/>
     children to a non-sectarian school, you are 
     <lb/>
     committing an act of injustice just as direct, 
     <lb/>
     just as much against the conscience of the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic, as if you would force the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant minority in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec to contribute to Roman Catholic deno<lb break="no"/>minational schools. This is the position 
     <lb/>
     urged upon and this is what was acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged frankly by Lord Watson, Lord Mor<lb break="no"/>ris and Lord Herschell. May I say that 
     <lb/>
     there should be in this House a little more 
     <lb/>
     of that broad British spirit of tolerance. so 
     <lb/>
     that at last when we come to judge the 
     <lb/>
     feelings and the convictions of our fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     citizens we should not trample on their 
     <lb/>
     feelings and override their convictions—we 
     <lb/>
     should endeavour to know the convictions 
     <lb/>
     of their hearts and to learn their thoughts ? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Sir, there is no solid ground left for those 
     <lb/>who are opposing this legislation as far as 
     <lb/>school matters are concerned. There is 
     <lb/>just one ground; it may be a good one for 
     <lb/>some. but on the whole it is not a lasting 
     <lb/>one: and that is the right of might. If the 
     <lb/>rule is to be laid down that there is to be 
     <lb/>one law to protect the Protestant minority 
     <lb/>of the province of Quebec. and that the same 
     <lb/>law shall not apply to Catholic minorities 
     <lb/>elsewhere. so far, so good! But let men be 
     <lb/>strong enough to stand up here and say: 
     <lb/>'No, the Catholics of the western provinces 
     <lb/>cannot enjoy in the west what the Protes<lb break="no"/>tants enjoy in Quebec, because, on the one 
     <lb/>hand, they are Catholic and on the other 
     <lb/>land they are Protestants.' Let a states<lb break="no"/>man be strong enough to stand up in the 
     <lb/>House and say that, and he will strike the 
     <lb/>root of this question of legislation. There 
     <lb/>was only one man who came near that 
     <lb/>point, and I acknowledge his sincerity. It 
     <lb/>was the hon. member for Brandon the late 
     <lb/>Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton). 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. Sir, on this ground, I 
     <lb/>
     know my words are useless. I know that 
     <lb/>
     I probably represent the views of very few 
     <lb/>
     men in this House, but there is one thing 
     <lb/>
     I would like to impress upon the minds of 
     <lb/>
     my Protestant English speaking fellow mem<lb break="no"/>bers. It is that when one party gets up 
     <lb/>
     and says that justice cannot be done to 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholics in the Northwest and 
     <lb/>
     another party gets up and says there must 
     <lb/>
     be only a scant measure of justice because 
     <lb/>
     it cannot afford to have the people accept 
     <lb/>
     a full measure of justice, allow me to say 
     <lb/>
     that I think the good people of Ontario are 
     <lb/>
     not fairly represented in this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. Bosh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. I cannot believe 
     <lb/>
     that if any member in this House would 
     <lb/>
     go to his constituency, even the member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey (Mr. Sproule)—although I think 
     <lb/>
     the great process with that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     would be to bring his mind to the point of 
     <lb/>
     understanding the question—I do not be<lb break="no"/>

<fw type="num">3269</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 28, 1905</fw> <fw type="num">3270</fw>
     

     lieve that if any hon. member in this House, 
     <lb/>
     even if he represents the most Protestant 
     <lb/>
     constituency, would go to his county and 
     <lb/>
     say : ' Here is the treatment which is ac<lb break="no"/>corded to our fellow citizens in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, here is the treatment which 
     <lb/>
     is accorded not only under the written law 
     <lb/>
     but under the law of the humane heart of 
     <lb/>
     the French Canadians who even at the time 
     <lb/>
     when they were persecuted by the British 
     <lb/>
     Crown always gave an ample measure of 
     <lb/>
     justice to the Protestant minority. Now, we 
     <lb/>
     ask you to stand by us in giving the same 
     <lb/>
     treatment to the Catholics of the western 
     <lb/>
     provinces that the Protestants have in the 
     <lb/>
     east. We ask you to remain true to the 
     <lb/>
     pledges given to that effect by the greatest 
     <lb/>
     statesmen of this country—I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     that such language would fail to bring a fair 
     <lb/>
     reply from the good people of Ontario. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let the Liberals be true to the memory 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Blake, of Mr. Mackenzie and even 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. George Brown, because when Mr. 
     <lb/>
     George Brown made up his mind that this 
     <lb/>
     compact should be observed, he was cour<lb break="no"/>ageous enough to say that it should be ob<lb break="no"/>served in fact and for ever. So far as hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite are concerned, I do 
     <lb/>
     not wish, on an occasion like this, to speak 
     <lb/>
     from a party point of view. I may say to 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition, for whom, on 
     <lb/>
     all other questions I have had up to this 
     <lb/>
     time the greatest respect, that when I listen<lb break="no"/>ed to him the other day, I came to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that he was not speaking for 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party, he was not showing 
     <lb/>
     himself to be the heir of Sir John A. Mac<lb break="no"/>donald and Sir Charles Tupper, but he 
     <lb/>
     was only voicing the opinions of a gentle<lb break="no"/>man who was obliged to find an abode in 
     <lb/>
     the county of Carleton in order to obtain 
     <lb/>
     a seat in this House. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     is broad enough—I render him that justice— 
     <lb/>
     be is broad enough by birth, by nature and 
     <lb/>
     by education to be fair-minded, that he had 
     <lb/>
     not the courage to stand by his new flag ; 
     <lb/>
     and he felt obliged to gather up a pile of 
     <lb/>
     small documents and papers behind which 
     <lb/>
     to shelter himself in his denial of justice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have frequently been told : Why 
     <lb/>
     can't you trust the majority of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest ? Well, Sir, here again 
     <lb/>
     I must speak frankly ; and I say : No, we 
     <lb/>
     cannot. Suppose we could trust the people 
     <lb/>
     who are living there now ; is there a man 
     <lb/>
     in this House childish enough to say that 
     <lb/>
     the condition of things which exists now is 
     <lb/>
     sure to exist in the Northwest fifty years 
     <lb/>
     hence ? What will be the population up 
     <lb/>
     there ? Who knows what feelings will 
     <lb/>
     dominate the majority there ? Who knows 
     <lb/>
     but that the great majority of the people 
     <lb/>
     there will be settlers coming from a land 
     <lb/>
     where the idea, not only of non-sectarian 
     <lb/>
     schools but of Godless schools, now prevails, 
     <lb/>
     and to my mind, to the great detriment of 
     <lb/>
     the future of the republic ? Who can tell 
     <lb/>
     what the future will be ? But confining my<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
         
self entirely to a survey of past events, I 
     <lb/>
    say now that we cannot trust the present 
     <lb/>majority of the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>to stand for right and justice. Their record 
     <lb/>is before us. It is my intention to make a 
     <lb/>comparison, for the enlightenment of our 
     <lb/>friends up there, if my words can reach 
     <lb/>them, and for the enlightenment of my En<lb break="no"/>glish speaking Protestant friends in the 
     <lb/>House and out of it ; I am going to make a 
     <lb/>comparison between the history of the 
     <lb/>school legislation in the Northwest and the 
     <lb/>history of the school legislation in Quebec, 
     <lb/>and I am ready to abide by the judgment 
     <lb/>that will be passed by any fair minded man, 
     <lb/>if not by his vote, at least by his conscience. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The leader of the opposition made 
     <lb/>
     another fine legal argument to show that 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest have never 
     <lb/>
     legislated on that subject. I admit that from 
     <lb/>
     a narrow legal point of view the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest did not legislate freely, 
     <lb/>
     because they were bound by the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories Act, just as this parliament can<lb break="no"/>not legislate freely because we are bound 
     <lb/>
     by the British North America Act, and just 
     <lb/>
     as any parliament in this country is not free 
     <lb/>
     because all the powers possessed by any 
     <lb/>
     legislative body in Canada is limited by 
     <lb/>
     imperial legislation. But I presume that we 
     <lb/>
     can ascertain the feelings of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest by considering their legis<lb break="no"/>lation. In 1885, ten years after the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories Act was passed, legis<lb break="no"/>lation was enacted by the legislature which, 
     <lb/>
     within its scope, was just as free as this 
     <lb/>
     parliament. And what did they do ? As the 
     <lb/>
     ex-Minister of the Interior clearly told us the 
     <lb/>
     other day, they passed a law quite in accord 
     <lb/>
     with the letter and with the spirit of clause 
     <lb/>
     11 of the Act of 1875. They passed a law 
     <lb/>
     similar to the one we have in Quebec, a law 
     <lb/>
     by which Catholics had the management 
     <lb/>
     of their own schools, had the choice of 
     <lb/>
     their own text books, and had the right to 
     <lb/>
     have their schools inspected by men of their 
     <lb/>
     own creed—but all under government 
     <lb/>
     supervision. They enjoyed separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     not only in name but in fact, as the member 
     <lb/>
     for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) well stated the 
     <lb/>
     other day. The inspectors had to be appoint<lb break="no"/>ed by the government, but they were chosen 
     <lb/>
     by the Catholic section, just as in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec Protestant schools are in<lb break="no"/>spected by inspectors chosen by the Protest<lb break="no"/>ant section of the Board of Education. The 
     <lb/>
     books used in the separate schools of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest were also selected by the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     section, and approved by the government. 
     <lb/>
     That state of things went on for some years, 
     <lb/>
     and then, in 1892, after several other ordin<lb break="no"/>ances had been passed, the separate school 
     <lb/>
     system, as the member for Brandon stated 
     <lb/>
     the other day, was wiped out. Lately. 
     <lb/>
Mr. Haultain, who is now here claiming 
     <lb/>liberties for his people, has given utterance 
     <lb/>to his lofty opinions on this matter, he has 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="3271" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3271.jpg"/>

     said: If I were a dictator to-morrow I 
     <lb/>
     would not abolish separate schools, all I 
     <lb/>
     want is freedom for my province. But Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain never told the country of a little 
     <lb/>
     fact in his political career which I will take 
     <lb/>
     the liberty of divulging to the House. When 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Dalton McCarthy, in 1892 and in 1894, 
     <lb/>
     brought into this House a Bill to abolish 
     <lb/>
     separate schools and the French language 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories, he was acting 
     <lb/>
     upon an address voted in the legislature of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories, moved by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Cayley and seconded by Mr. Haultain. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore I think I now have the right to 
     <lb/>
     say, as claiming some liberty for the minor<lb break="no"/>ity in the Northwest, that I have no confi<lb break="no"/>dence in Mr. Haultain, who now comes 
     <lb/>
     here posing as our friend, but who was one 
     <lb/>
     of the first men to start a movement in the 
     <lb/>
     legislative assembly to abolish the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. LEIGHTON McCARTHY</persName>. Would the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman allow me ? I think he is a 
     <lb/>
     little inaccurate in stating that this was 
     <lb/>
     legislation to abolish separate schools. The 
     <lb/>
     legislation then sought was only to delegate 
     <lb/>
     to the legislative assembly the right to do 
     <lb/>
     as they saw fit ; and they will of course 
     <lb/>
     continue the separate school system if they 
     <lb/>
     so choose.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. I am glad my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend has interrupted me, because he affords 
     <lb/>
     me an opportunity of illustrating once more 
     <lb/>
     what I said a little while ago, that every 
     <lb/>
     time an act of persecution is committed, 
     <lb/>
     it is committed under a false pretense. 
     <lb/>
     Everybody knew the views of the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman—and whose views I certainly res<lb break="no"/>pect—who was so closely connected with 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. L. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy). The motion which was made 
     <lb/>
      in this House by Mr. Dalton McCarthy, and 
     <lb/>
     which he developed by a very eloquent argu<lb break="no"/>ment, was to wipe out the separate schools 
     <lb/>
     and wipe out the French language on the 
     <lb/>
     ground that there should be only one race 
     <lb/>
     and one language in this country. It is use<lb break="no"/>less to resort to legal quibbles. The purpose 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Haultain and of Mr. McCarthy was 
     <lb/>
     to abolish Catholic education and the French 
     <lb/>
     language ; they succeeded so far as the 
     <lb/>
     language is concerned, and they succeeded 
     <lb/>
     to a large extent in so far as schools are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, according to the testimony of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Brandon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is one <choice><sic>fruther</sic><corr>further</corr></choice> point I would 
     <lb/>
     like to draw to the attention of our friends 
     <lb/>
     on this side of the House. I have listened 
     <lb/>
     to the very nice words, words with which 
     <lb/>
     I agree completely, spoken to us by the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance and the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Customs ; I entirely agree with their con<lb break="no"/>ciliatory sentiments. I especially coincide 
     <lb/>
     with the Minister of Finance, who gave us a 
     <lb/>
     good illustration and a strong re-enforce<lb break="no"/>ment of the argument I have tried to make, 
     <lb/>
     when he painted the happy condition of 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
         

     things which exist in the provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island, where the majority, in or<lb break="no"/>der to do justice to their Catholic fellow 
     <lb/>
     citizens, had to grant them separate schools 
     <lb/>
     in fact. So it is not only in Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     Ontario that we have separate schools. I 
     <lb/>
     have visited the maritime provinces fre<lb break="no"/>quently, and was happy to observe the good 
     <lb/>
     relations which exist between the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics and the Protestants there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But, may I suggest to the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance, if the Roman Catholic min<lb break="no"/>ority had not developed the strength of 
     <lb/>
     numbers that it represents to-day in those 
     <lb/>
     provinces, would it be treated as it is 
     <lb/>
     treated ? We know the history of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick. I do not want 
     <lb/>
     to bring up old feuds, but I am bound to 
     <lb/>
     say, looking through the history of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Canada, that while in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec the same ample measure 
     <lb/>
     of justice was always granted to the min<lb break="no"/>ority, unfortunately in all the English speak<lb break="no"/>ing provinces there was a time when the 
     <lb/>
     passions of the majority were aroused and 
     <lb/>
     successfully aroused against the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     minority. In consequence, a feeling has 
     <lb/>
     developed—not of distrust—but a feeling 
     <lb/>
     has developed amongst us that if we want 
     <lb/>
     equality and peace to reign in this country, 
     <lb/>
     we must give to the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     majorities in the English speaking provinces 
     <lb/>
     the right to do what Sir Oliver Mowat did. 
     <lb/>
     I took an active part in two elections in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario ; I was but a boy 
     <lb/>
     at the time, but I was proud to stand by 
     <lb/>
     Sir Oliver Mowat and help in his campaign 
     <lb/>
     for justice and equality. I was living on 
     <lb/>
     the borders of the province of Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     I crossed the river of my own free will 
     <lb/>
     without being asked by anybody, without 
     <lb/>
     being known by anybody, to do what I 
     <lb/>
     could in support of the old statesman. What 
     <lb/>
     was the argument used by Sir Oliver Mo<lb break="no"/>wat? He was prudent and he knew of 
     <lb/>
     the power of the appeals made by such men 
     <lb/>
     as the member of East Grey. When the 
     <lb/>
     system of separate schools was attacked in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, Sir Oliver Mowat said. 'I shall 
     <lb/>
     not discuss the relative merits of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools and public schools ; I am not any 
     <lb/>
     partisan of separate schools ; but separate 
     <lb/>
     schools have been established in this pro<lb break="no"/>vince under law, and therefore it is use<lb break="no"/>less to agitate against the law of the land.' 
     <lb/>
     What I want is that the future rulers 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest may be put in such a posi<lb break="no"/>tion that when passions are aroused and 
     <lb/>
     prejudices fomented by such men as we 
     <lb/>
     have in this House, by such newspapers as 
     <lb/>
     we have in this country, these future rulers 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest will be in a position to 
     <lb/>
     say—when passion is too strong or when 
     <lb/>
     they are not strong enough to oppose it— 
     <lb/>
     ' What is the use ? there is a law protecting 
     <lb/>
     the minority.' I do not wish to cast any 
     <lb/>
     aspersion on the breadth of mind of any 
     <lb/>

     future statesman of Canada, but it is no 
     <lb/>
     harm for the peace of the country, it is no 
     <lb/>
     harm for the good of our land, that should 
     <lb/>
      prejudices exist between creeds and na<lb break="no"/>tionalities, every Canadian statesman, whe<lb break="no"/>ther he be weak or strong, whether he be 
     <lb/>
     popular or unpopular, can always find a 
     <lb/>
     shelter under the constitution of our coun<lb break="no"/>try and be able to point out to all men that 
     <lb/>
     there is laid down in our constitution the 
     <lb/>
     clear written principle that equal justice 
     <lb/>
     exists for all and that Catholics as well as 
     <lb/>
     Protestants have the right to live in this 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It may be said : But what is all this trou<lb break="no"/>ble about ? The minority in the west is satis<lb break="no"/>fied ; it is only the hierarchy, it is only the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec crowd who are trying to impose 
     <lb/>
     their will upon the Territories. Sir, that 
     <lb/>
     is one of the most cynical arguments that 
     <lb/>
     has been used so far. We have the testi<lb break="no"/>mony of the member for Brandon (Mr. Sif<lb break="no"/>ton), who ought to know, that when the 
     <lb/>
     ordinances abolishing separate schools were 
     <lb/>
     passed in the Northwest, a protest was 
     <lb/>
     made. The member for Brandon—I do not 
     <lb/>
     know if it was in a moment of forgetful<lb break="no"/>ness, or if it was because he also has been 
     <lb/>
     drawn into the dangerous abyss in which 
     <lb/>
     some gentlemen opposite are having such 
     <lb/>
     a fine time these days—but the member for 
     <lb/>
     Brandon said the protest came from the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic clergy and in order to con<lb break="no"/>vince us, he immediately gave the opinion 
     <lb/>
     of two of the most eminent laymen of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories ; two fathers of 
     <lb/>
     families, two representatives of the people, 
     <lb/>
     one the Lieutenant Governor to-day and 
     <lb/>
     the other a judge of the Supreme Court. 
     <lb/>
     These were the members of the hierarchy 
     <lb/>
     quoted by the hon. member from Bran<lb break="no"/>don. These gentlemen came here and they 
     <lb/>
     said: ' An injustice has been done us ; we 
     <lb/>
     are deprived of the right of giving to our 
     <lb/>
     children the education which our conscience 
     <lb/>
     binds us to give ; our money is taken for 
     <lb/>
     the support of schools we cannot attend.' 
     <lb/>
     But, they were sent away from Ottawa ; 
     <lb/>
     they were not numerous enough probably 
     <lb/>
     to obtain justice. Then they went to the 
     <lb/>
     provincial assembly and again they laid 
     <lb/>
     their case at the foot of the Crown—as the 
     <lb/>
     Crown was represented there—and again 
     <lb/>
     they were found to be too weak and too 
     <lb/>
     few. Because they did not rebel in arms, 
     <lb/>
     because they accepted the established state 
     <lb/>
     of things; a state of things which was a 
     <lb/>
     breach of the compact, a state of things 
     <lb/>
     which in the words of Sir John Thompson 
     <lb/>
     and the words of the member for Brandon, 
     <lb/>
     constituted a legal encroachment upon their 
     <lb/>
     rights; because they did not rebel in arms; 
     <lb/>
     because they followed the advice that has 
     <lb/>
     always been given by the hierarchy to the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics of this country to be peaceful ; 
     <lb/>
     now they are told : ' You are satisfied ; ask 
     <lb/>
     for nothing more because you can't expect 
     <lb/>
     it.' To my friends who are saying to us : 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
         

     'Be conciliatory ; let us cut in two what re<lb break="no"/>mains.' I shall cite a little illustration 
     <lb/>
     which may perhaps help some of them to 
     <lb/>
     realize the situation. Suppose that Canada 
     <lb/>
     stands in the position of a father having 
     <lb/>
     two sons, big Peter and little Paul. He 
     <lb/>
     gives $4 to big Peter and $2 to little Paul 
     <lb/>
     and he says : " Now, boys, agree together, 
     <lb/>
     work together, do the best you can with 
     <lb/>
     the money I gave you.' Once they are on 
     <lb/>
     the street big Peter gets after little Paul, 
     <lb/>
     beats him and takes $1.50 of his two dol<lb break="no"/>lars. These gentlemen opposite stand up 
     <lb/>
     and say : Don't tyrannize big Peter ; but 
     <lb/>
     force little Paul to give Peter the 50 cents 
     <lb/>
     he has left. And hon. gentlemen on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the House get up and say : Be con<lb break="no"/>ciliatory, take those 50 cents left to Paul, 
     <lb/>
     and divide it with big Peter, for after all 
     <lb/>
     big Peter is a good fellow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Little Paul comes 
     <lb/>
     from Nova Scotia. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. I am not going to be 
     <lb/>
     dragged into provincial limits just now. 
     <lb/>
     Now, Sir, there is another subject which is 
     <lb/>
     much talked of in the public press, but 
     <lb/>
     which has not been treated of in this House 
     <lb/>
     and I think one voice at least should be 
     <lb/>
     raised in parliament to protest against it. 
     <lb/>
     It is said : ' Admitting that the constitution 
     <lb/>
     allows you to grant separate schools to the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest, yet you should not fasten upon 
     <lb/>
     these people such a bad system of educa<lb break="no"/>tion which has made of Spain, of Italy, of 
     <lb/>
     France, of all Catholic countries, the scum 
     <lb/>
     of the earth.' And we are told : Look at 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec, look at the south 
     <lb/>
     of Ireland, a degraded population, a low- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     minded ignorant people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I propose to deal for a few moments with 
     <lb/>
     the subject of Catholic education, with what 
     <lb/>
     it has done for the world. in what way it 
     <lb/>
     has succeeded and why it has not always 
     <lb/>
     succeeded. Here again I am tempted to 
     <lb/>
     ask: What kind of history is taught in the 
     <lb/>
     public schools of this country ? I know 
     <lb/>
     as well as any man. and I have learned to 
     <lb/>
     know in the Catholic schools where I was 
     <lb/>
     educated. that there is such a thing as the 
     <lb/>
     evolution of nations, that nations in our own 
     <lb/>
     age as well as nations in the past. and as 
     <lb/>
     well as nations to come for all time. have 
     <lb/>
     and will have their periods of prosperity. 
     <lb/>
     and their days of decadence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The race from which I sprung has done 
     <lb/>
     so much for the enlightenment and civiliz<lb break="no"/>ation of this world that I can, without un<lb break="no"/>due baseness. admit that the Anglo-Saxon 
     <lb/>
     is now ahead among the nations. But I 
     <lb/>
     may remind my English speaking friends 
     <lb/>
     that three centuries before there was any<lb break="no"/>thing like English civilization, Catholic Spain 
     <lb/>
     had covered the world not only with physical 
     <lb/>
     power, but with civilization and enlighten<lb break="no"/>ment—with schools of higher education and 
     <lb/>
     primary education and with a knowledge of 
     <lb/>
     all then available sciences that no nation 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="3275" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3275.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3276</fw>
        

     has since surpassed ; and this is no dis<lb break="no"/>paragement of the English any more 
     <lb/>than the present pre-eminence of the 
     <lb/>Anglo-Saxon is a disparagement of the 
     <lb/>Spanish. May I remind my <choice><sic>Englisr</sic><corr>English</corr></choice>-speak<lb break="no"/>ing friends also that three hundred years ago, 
     <lb/>in Venice and Genoa, those Catholic-ridden 
     <lb/>states, the system of book-keeping, of stock 
     <lb/>exchange, of currency, of everything which 
     <lb/>the Anglo-Saxon is using now with such 
     <lb/>success, was practiced to an extent which 
     <lb/>brought to those little republics a degree 
     <lb/>of prosperity and civilization which, con<lb break="no"/>sidering their time and their size, has never 
     <lb/>been surpassed. I could go on with ex<lb break="no"/>amples like these ; I could make a history of 
     <lb/>the world with such examples, after the 
     <lb/>manner of a speech which was made in this 
     <lb/>House some years ago by I think my hon. 
     <lb/>friend from Victoria and Haliburton (Mr. 
     <lb/>Sam. Hughes), who began at the creation and 
     <lb/>ended with the end of the world. I 
     <lb/>will content myself with stating the 
     <lb/>truism that nations grow, develop, prosper, 
     <lb/>and then pass into oblivion. The Greeks 
     <lb/>have passed ; the Romans have passed ; the 
     <lb/>Italians and Spanish have passed. Let the 
     <lb/>Anglo-Saxon look to the Slav and the Japan<lb break="no"/>ese before he concludes that he possesses 
     <lb/>the world for ever. But this is not the point. 
     <lb/>The point is, what has Catholic education 
     <lb/>done for Catholic countries ? If our friends 
     <lb/>who are making so much noise about the 
     <lb/>corruption of Catholic countries would go to 
     <lb/>the depth of the history of those countries. 
     <lb/>they would find that their greatest time of 
     <lb/>material as well as moral prosperity co<lb break="no"/>incided with the time when the Catholic 
     <lb/>church, not dominated, but inspired those 
     <lb/>countries, and when Catholic education high 
     <lb/>or low, was given to all classes of the people. 
     <lb/>Spain began to decay when greeders in the 
     <lb/>colonies displaced the missionaries–when 
     <lb/>the King of Spain lent himself to the 
     <lb/>anti-Catholic movement which started in 
     <lb/>France and which led to the abolition of the 
     <lb/>Jesuit order. The same thing happened in 
     <lb/>France. But why not go for an example to 
     <lb/>countries which are now under Catholic 
     <lb/>influence ? The hon. member for East Grey 
     <lb/>(Mr. Sproule)—I do not know what text 
     <lb/>book he got his information from, but if it 
     <lb/>is authorized in any province, it should be 
     <lb/>taken from the schools at once—spoke of 
     <lb/>the national non-sectarian system of edu<lb break="no"/>cation carried on in Belgium. Now, Belgium 
     <lb/>is one of the most prosperous countries on 
     <lb/>earth, and there you have Catholic education 
     <lb/>right through, from the primary school to 
     <lb/>the university. But let me point to a Protest<lb break="no"/>ant nation, Germany, where thirty-three 
     <lb/>years ago the Prussians abolished Catholic 
     <lb/>education and expelled the Jesuits and other 
     <lb/>religious orders from the country. What 
     <lb/>do you see there now ? The German Em<lb break="no"/>peror, observing the progress which Catholic 
     <lb/>education has made in the empire, is turn<lb break="no"/>ing to the Catholic hierarchy and asking 
     <lb/>them to save his empire from the dangers 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
       

     of socialism. Might I refer some of our 
     <lb/>
     friends also to the comments appearing daily 
     <lb/>
     in the American papers and reviews, coming 
     <lb/>
     not from Catholic priests or bishops or 
     <lb/>
     Catholic religious orders, but from Protest<lb break="no"/>ants, eminent Protestants, men of science, 
     <lb/>
     professors of universities and statesmen, 
     <lb/>
     among a few statesmen who find their way 
     <lb/>
     to political life in the United States, who 
     <lb/>
     recognize that what must save the United 
     <lb/>
     States from the social plague which is 
     <lb/>
     going to involve all nations between the 
     <lb/>
     crushing burden of capitalism and the 
     <lb/>
     equally crushing burden of standing armies, 
     <lb/>
     is the influence of the Catholic church on the 
     <lb/>
     working classes. I am not saying this in 
     <lb/>
     disparagement of any other creed ; but, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the fact that during the past two 
     <lb/>
     months railing attacks have been made 
     <lb/>
     against the creed of two millions of the sub<lb break="no"/>jects of His Majesty in this country, I feel 
     <lb/>
     that I should stand up here and say that the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic people and the Catholic hierarchy 
     <lb/>
     will never suffer when compared with any 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     But, leaving aside foreign countries, and 
     <lb/>
     coming to my own poor province, the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, let us study for a moment 
     <lb/>
     what has been the influence of the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     church on the development of education in 
     <lb/>
     that province ? It is generally contended 
     <lb/>
     in all English-speaking provinces that we 
     <lb/>
     are—I will not say an inferior race, because 
     <lb/>
     I do not think that is accepted by a great 
     <lb/>
     number of the English-speaking people ; 
     <lb/>
     but it is very often contended that the sys<lb break="no"/>tem of education in the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     is an inferior one, and that that province has 
     <lb/>
     a greater number of illiterate people than 
     <lb/>
     any of the other provinces. It may be that 
     <lb/>
     a little insight into the history of the educa<lb break="no"/>tional system of Quebec will throw some 
     <lb/>
     light on the subject. Before the conquest, 
     <lb/>
     the French government had given lavishly 
     <lb/>
     what was necessary for the support of pub<lb break="no"/>lic education in New France. At the time of 
     <lb/>
     the cession there was necessarily a great 
     <lb/>
     disturbance of the whole system. Five years 
     <lb/>
     after the cession of Canada the Jesuit order 
     <lb/>
     was suppressed by the Pope ; and, strange 
     <lb/>
     to say, there was nobody at the time to raise 
     <lb/>
     an argument against the English govern<lb break="no"/>ment for using a papal bull. On the day 
     <lb/>
     that papal decision was registered, all the 
     <lb/>
     estates belonging to the Jesuits were seized 
     <lb/>
     by the British government. Those estates 
     <lb/>
     had been given to the Jesuits with the legal 
     <lb/>
     obligation of founding colleges and sec<lb break="no"/>ondary and primary schools ; and before 
     <lb/>
     the conquest they had established two 
     <lb/>
     colleges and a great number of primary 
     <lb/>
     schools—a greater proportion being given 
     <lb/>
     to the people of New France than were 
     <lb/>
     given in the British colonies to the south. 
     <lb/>
     After the estates of the Jesuits were seized 
     <lb/>
     by the British government, were the pro<lb break="no"/>ceeds used for the education of the people ? 
     <lb/>
     No. The Montreal College was destroyed, 
     <lb/>
     and was replaced by the Champ de Mars. 
     <lb/>

 <p>
     The Quebec College was seized and the 
     <lb/>
     pupils and professors turned out, and 
     <lb/>
     soldiers put in. For thirty years after repre<lb break="no"/>sentative institutions were given to us, we 
     <lb/>
     petitioned the British government to give 
     <lb/>
     us back those estates, not to return them to 
     <lb/>
     the Jesuits, but to use them for the purposes 
     <lb/>
     of education, and we were refused. For 
     <lb/>
     twenty-seven years we were refused any 
     <lb/>
     education law. In 1801 the government im<lb break="no"/>posed on us a system of education under the 
     <lb/>
     control of the Anglican bishop of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     through which Anglican students of theology 
     <lb/>
     were sent to all the Catholic centres with the 
     <lb/>
     avowed object—because at that time they 
     <lb/>
     had the frankness to avow the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     their operations—of turning young French 
     <lb/>
     Canadians into English—speaking Protest<lb break="no"/>ants. Naturally our people refused to send 
     <lb/>
     their children to those schools: but while the 
     <lb/>
     legislative assembly was voting money for 
     <lb/>
     educational purposes, the English governors 
     <lb/>
     handed the proceeds over to the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     schools and gave not one cent to the Catho<lb break="no"/>lics. That continued during 24 years until 
     <lb/>
     at last the legislative assembly passed a 
     <lb/>
     law which gave the Catholic church ward<lb break="no"/>ens the right to take a part of the revenues 
     <lb/>
     of their poor parish churches and devote 
     <lb/>
     it to the building and maintaining of 
     <lb/>
     their own schools. And at the same time the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant schools were kept up with the 
     <lb/>
     moneys paid by the Catholics and appro<lb break="no"/>priated by the government. That went on 
     <lb/>
     until 1841, when the two provinces of Up<lb break="no"/>per and Lower Canada became united. It 
     <lb/>
     was only then that the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     obtained its first school law. What was 
     <lb/>
     that law? It was a law which Lord Syden<lb break="no"/>ham forced upon his advisers. Under it 
     <lb/>
     the whole school system was put under the 
     <lb/>
     municipal authorities, who were appointed 
     <lb/>
     by the governor personally, and the gover<lb break="no"/>nor was careful to appoint a majority of 
     <lb/>
     English speaking Protestants to regulate 
     <lb/>
     the school system of a population, nine- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     tenths of which were French speaking 
     <lb/>
     Catholics. It was only in 1846 that we 
     <lb/>
     finally secured a system of schools satis<lb break="no"/>factory to our people. So that during 100 
     <lb/>
     years we were deprived of the right of 
     <lb/>
     using our own money for the education of 
     <lb/>
     our own people. Is it then surprising that 
     <lb/>
     there should be some people in our prov<lb break="no"/>ince to-day who can neither read or write? 
     <lb/>
     While the English speaking immigrants 
     <lb/>
     who did not profess the Catholic religion, 
     <lb/>
     found on our shores, even in the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec, a system of edu<lb break="no"/>cation suited to their consciences, under 
     <lb/>
     which their own schools were entitled to 
     <lb/>
     their proper share of the public money, and 
     <lb/>
     while these people had come from the 
     <lb/>
     British Isles or the United States, from 
     <lb/>
     countries where there was an established 
     <lb/>
     system of education which suited them, for 
     <lb/>
     a hundred years the great majority of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec were deprived of the 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of educating their children. Am 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     I not then justified in saying that if you 
     <lb/>
     will compare the results of our education, 
     <lb/>
     which is only fifty years old, with those of 
     <lb/>
     the education in the English speaking prov<lb break="no"/>inces, which practically had no beginning, 
     <lb/>
     because it was simply the continuation of 
     <lb/>
     the American and English systems, we 
     <lb/>
     have no reason to be ashamed. As far as 
     <lb/>
     higher education is concerned—and that 
     <lb/>
     education with us is entirely in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of our clergy—let me give, not my testi<lb break="no"/>mony, but that of a professor of McGill 
     <lb/>
     University, Dr. Johnstone, who some years 
     <lb/>
     ago made certain comments upon the dif<lb break="no"/>ference between the attainments of the 
     <lb/>
     pupils of McGill University who came from 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic colleges and those who came 
     <lb/>
     from the high schools. He was struck with 
     <lb/>
     the fact that there was always a prepond<lb break="no"/>erance of points secured by those who came 
     <lb/>
     from the Catholic colleges, and he said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     There was no possibility of mistaking the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     I was so struck with what appeared to be a 
     <lb/>
     marked difference between the two divisions 
     <lb/>
     of the classes that without suspecting what I 
     <lb/>
     now believe to be the true course of it, I, many 
     <lb/>
     years ago, assigned separate rows of seats in 
     <lb/>
     the lecture room to them, in order to make 
     <lb/>
     quite sure of the fact. Year after year there 
     <lb/>
     was the same invariable result.

            <p>
     May I also refer to the results of the ex<lb break="no"/>aminations carried on at the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     University, where the pupils of the Jesuits 
     <lb/>
     college of St. Boniface compete in the pro<lb break="no"/>portion of 1 to 15 or 18—three or five out 
     <lb/>
     of 80 or 100 altogether ? Those pupils 
     <lb/>
     of the Jesuits' college generally carry off 
     <lb/>
     from thirty to thirty—five per cent of the 
     <lb/>
     points and medals given. True, we are not 
     <lb/>
     now discussing higher education, but prim<lb break="no"/>ary schools. Well, if the primary school 
     <lb/>
     system be so rotten as it is said to be, sure<lb break="no"/>ly it could not send to our colleges young 
     <lb/>
     men who are so successful when they come 
     <lb/>
     into competition with the students from the 
     <lb/>
     other schools. But I look at the question 
     <lb/>
     from another point of view. Suppose there 
     <lb/>
     should be a little less book-keeping taught 
     <lb/>
     in our primary schools than is taught in 
     <lb/>
     the public schools. I lay it down as a basis 
     <lb/>
     of social law that the right to educate the 
     <lb/>
     child belongs in the first place to its par<lb break="no"/>ents; and, therefore, when the state takes 
     <lb/>
     the place of the parent, it is bound to give 
     <lb/>
     that child the same moral education which 
     <lb/>
     the father would give it in his own house. 
     <lb/>
     Secondly, the duty of the government is to 
     <lb/>
     develop law-abiding, broad-minded citizens; 
     <lb/>
     and, thirdly, to give the child school know<lb break="no"/>ledge. I claim if that rule is considered 
     <lb/>
     our system has given better results than 
     <lb/>
     any other. We never see in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec or in any part of the country in 
     <lb/>
     which Catholics can have any control, the 
     <lb/>
     display of passion and prejudice which we 
     <lb/>
     are now witnessing among those who ad<lb break="no"/>vocate public schools as against separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. We see in the outbursts to-day 
     <lb/>

     in which sectarian prejudice is appealed to, 
     <lb/>
     the result of public school education, and 
     <lb/>
     we are justified in saying that in the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Quebec, under our system, we have 
     <lb/>
     never produced any thing of the kind.

            <p>
     The Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) 
     <lb/>
     has pointed with pride to his own province. 
     <lb/>
     But there is still one province ahead 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia as far as the spirit of 
     <lb/>
     tolerance is concerned, and that is the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec. Do some of our friends 
     <lb/>
     who make so much noise about the illiter<lb break="no"/>acy and narrow mindedness of that prov<lb break="no"/>ince under priestly control, know that Low<lb break="no"/>er Canada was the first self-governing part 
     <lb/>
     of the British Empire, not excluding Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain and Ireland, where disabilities were 
     <lb/>
     removed from the Jews? We emancipated 
     <lb/>
     the Jews in the province of Quebec before 
     <lb/>
     the Catholics were emancipated in England. 
     <lb/>
     At the very time that we in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec were denied our most sacred 
     <lb/>
     natural rights, every new creed that came 
     <lb/>
     to that province was given complete civil 
     <lb/>
     and corporate powers. Presbyterians, Me<lb break="no"/>thodists, Baptists were granted by the Leg<lb break="no"/>islative Assembly of Quebec the same pow<lb break="no"/>ers to keep civil registers and act as cor<lb break="no"/>porate bodies as were given Catholics. Do 
     <lb/>
     they know that at the time when we were 
     <lb/>
     denied the right of teaching our children 
     <lb/>
     according to our conscience, we always put 
     <lb/>
     Protestant schools on the same footing as 
     <lb/>
     our own as regards the law and the con<lb break="no"/>stitution? I go further, as far as the work<lb break="no"/>ing of our system of education is concerned. 
     <lb/>
     May I refer hon. members to a speech made 
     <lb/>
    by the right hon. the First Minister in 1893 
     <lb/>in which he said in substance : ' I know that 
     <lb/>the law protects the minority in the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Quebec, but there are many ways 
     <lb/>in which an unwilling majority can evade 
     <lb/>the law—and we have evidence of that in 
     <lb/>several provinces of the Dominion. Sup<lb break="no"/>pose, for instance, the government of the 
     <lb/>province of Quebec were to abolish the 
     <lb/>Protestant section of the Council of Educa<lb break="no"/>tion. Would not that be an infamous 
     <lb/>thing which would call for redress at the 
     <lb/>hands of a federal government?' Well, that 
     <lb/>was done by the government of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories some years ago. But if it 
     <lb/>be infamous to abolish the supervision of 
     <lb/>Protestant schools by Protestants, how 
     <lb/>comes it to be perfectly proper to abolish 
     <lb/>the supervision of Catholic schools by 
     <lb/>Catholics? How can one thing be good in 
     <lb/>the west and bad in the east? How can it 
     <lb/>be just in the west and unjust in the east? 
     <lb/>If we are to make a nation of this country, 
     <lb/>surely every one will admit that the princi<lb break="no"/>ple must prevail, not in word but in fact, 
     <lb/>of equal rights and equal justice to all.

     before that letter was written. Three can<lb break="no"/>didates were in the field. The Liberal can<lb break="no"/>didate was an Irish Canadian without a 
     <lb/>
     drop of French blood in his veins. The Con<lb break="no"/>servative candidate was a Scotch Presby<lb break="no"/>terian without any trace of French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     blood. A third candidate came into the 
     <lb/>
     field and appealed to my fellow-countrymen, 
     <lb/>
     saying : ' This county is two-thirds French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian ; you should not vote for an 
     <lb/>
     Irishman or a Scotchman ; you should vote 
     <lb/>
     for me, a French Canadian.' And what 
     <lb/>
     was the result ? The French Canadian who 
     <lb/>
     appealed to racial passion in that county, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding that the voters were brought 
     <lb/>
     up under this priestly education, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing that they were educated in schools 
     <lb/>
     where they were ' taught that Protestants 
     <lb/>
     were a curse to the earth '—this French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian lost his deposit. The Irish Can<lb break="no"/>adian was elected. And the Scotch Pres<lb break="no"/>byterian received the strongest Conservative 
     <lb/>
     vote that had been cast in the county for 
     <lb/>
     years and years. And, in the city of Hull, 
     <lb/>
     Where the whole population is under ' priest<lb break="no"/>ly education,' where the teachers are not 
     <lb/>
     merely the ordinary parish priests, but 
     <lb/>
     priests who belong to the monastic orders, 
     <lb/>
     some of these ' abominable orders ' of 
     <lb/>
     which the Reverend Scott is so afraid ; in 
     <lb/>
     the city of Hull where the schools are wholly 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of friars and nuns, and where 
     <lb/>
     any man who spent his childhood there has 
     <lb/>
     received no other education than that given 
     <lb/>
     by these friars and nuns under the control 
     <lb/>
     of the hierarchy ; in that Liberal Catholic 
     <lb/>
     and French Canadian city of Hull the Scotch 
     <lb/>
     Presbyterian Conservative candidate had a 
     <lb/>
     majority of the votes. Sir, the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, where you may so frequently notice 
     <lb/>
     Protestant Englishmen elected by a French- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking majority, is the only province 
     <lb/>
     where you find such proofs of toleration 
     <lb/>
     and breadth of view. And the same 
     <lb/>
     has been true since confederation and long 
     <lb/>
     before confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, may I be allowed to speak 
     <lb/>
     of a little experience I have had in this 
     <lb/>
     relation ? It shows the working of the 
     <lb/>
     school laws in my province. There is a 
     <lb/>
     small country newspaper in the county of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec which has declared that the result 
     <lb/>
     of the separate school law in Quebec was 
     <lb/>
     to drive the Protestants out of the province. 
     <lb/>
     I refer to the Huntingdon ' Gleaner.' And 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
     <lb/>
     has re-echoed that declaration. I passed most 
     <lb/>
     of my life—and my happiest days, because 
     <lb/>
     they were before I entered public life— 
     <lb/>
     in a small village on the borders of the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa river forming one municipality of 
     <lb/>
     eight hundred souls. This village was separ<lb break="no"/>ated municipally and for school purposes 
     <lb/>
     from the parish in which it was situated 
     <lb/>
     and which also contained some eight hun<lb break="no"/>dred souls. In these two municipalities there 
     <lb/>
     were three English-speaking Protestant 
     <lb/>
     families. The father of one family was the 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
        

     head of a large lumbering firm and the 
     <lb/>
     fathers of the other two families were the 
     <lb/>
     other's clerks. These three families lived 
     <lb/>
     in the village. They organized a separate 
     <lb/>
     school under the law. Then the lumbering 
     <lb/>
     company bought immense properties in the 
     <lb/>
     parish. Under our ' priest-administered ' 
     <lb/>
     law, the Protestant ratepayers—as they 
     <lb/>
     were entitled to do by law—annexed this 
     <lb/>
     property to the village for school purposes, 
     <lb/>
     thus depriving the Catholic ratepayers of 
     <lb/>
     the parish of all the receipts of their schools 
     <lb/>
     on account of that land. But there was not 
     <lb/>
     a word of dispute. There came a time when 
     <lb/>
     the separate school was not carried on 
     <lb/>
     according to law, because, in our province 
     <lb/>
     as in others, it requires a certain school 
     <lb/>
     attendance to make a school under the law. 
     <lb/>
     There came a time when all the taxes paid 
     <lb/>
     by the Protestants went to support a school 
     <lb/>
     where there were only five or six children, 
     <lb/>
     which is only half or one-third of the num<lb break="no"/>ber required under the law. One of the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic ratepayers suggested : ' Why don't 
     <lb/>
     we abolish the separate school and get all 
     <lb/>
     that money ?' I put my foot upon the pro<lb break="no"/>position at once. I said: ' My friend, if you 
     <lb/>
     think as I do and as, I believe, the people of 
     <lb/>
     this parish and of this village do, you will 
     <lb/>
     never ask a man, rich or poor, to contribute 
     <lb/>
     a cent to the maintenance of a school system 
     <lb/>
     in which he does not believe.' And the whole 
     <lb/>
     population was with me. That whole 
     <lb/>
     ' priest-ridden population '—and they were 
     <lb/>
     poor farmers—preferred to pay twice as 
     <lb/>
     much as they otherwise would rather than 
     <lb/>
     ask these Protestant ratepayers to contri<lb break="no"/>bute, as they were legally bound to do, to 
     <lb/>
     the maintenance of any other than this 
     <lb/>
     separate school. Show me such an example 
     <lb/>
     in any of the English-speaking Protestant 
     <lb/>
     provinces of this Dominion, and I will ad<lb break="no"/>mit that the separate school system cannot 
     <lb/>
     develop a national spirit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me refer my hon. friends to the 
     <lb/>
     example of a country, that, perhaps 
     <lb/>
     above all the nations of the earth, has done 
     <lb/>
     most for the development of ideas of liberty 
     <lb/>
     and toleration : the little republic of Switzer<lb break="no"/>land. There is in Switzerland a population 
     <lb/>
     composed of three nationalities with clearly 
     <lb/>
     marked differences of religion. They have 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant Germans and the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     French and Italians. After their common 
     <lb/>
     struggle for liberty, they fought among them<lb break="no"/>selves for years and for centuries—the Ger<lb break="no"/>mans to impose the German language and 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant religion upon the others and 
     <lb/>
     the French seeking to impose the French 
     <lb/>
     language and the Catholic religion upon the 
     <lb/>
     Germans. But the day came when they 
     <lb/>
     found out that only principle under which 
     <lb/>
     they could maintain their union was that 
     <lb/>
     every man should be free to worship God in 
     <lb/>
     his own church and to educate his children 
     <lb/>
     in his own school. And upon that principle 
     <lb/>
     of toleration they have carried on their 
     <lb/>
     schools ; and to my mind, their national 
     <lb/>

     spirit is much more united, than unfortu<lb break="no"/>nately ours is at the present day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, there is one last point I wish to 
     <lb/>
     make. I contend that if we look upon 
     <lb/>
     this question from the point of view of a 
     <lb/>
     broad national ideal, not only should we 
     <lb/>
     propose the widest measure of liberty for 
     <lb/>
     the minority of the Northwest, but, even 
     <lb/>
     if it were not asked for and if we were not 
     <lb/>
     bound to give it, we should, in duty to Can<lb break="no"/>ada and to the integrity of the empire, esta<lb break="no"/>blish separate schools in the Northwest in 
     <lb/>
     the fullest sense of the word. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have stated, at the opening of my re<lb break="no"/>marks, that nobody knows what the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of that country will be fifty or one 
     <lb/>
     hundred years hence. Do you want to 
     <lb/>
     make it safely Canadian ? Do yo want to 
     <lb/>
     have there a nucleus of population whose 
     <lb/>
     only love, whose only care will be for this 
     <lb/>
     soil of ours, who will have no other devo<lb break="no"/>tion but to the future and the welfare of 
     <lb/>
     Canada ? Open the Northwest to the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian, emplant him there and 
     <lb/>
     give him all his freedom and liberty. Make 
     <lb/>
     him feel that he is at home in the west just 
     <lb/>
     as much as in the east, make him feel that 
     <lb/>
     he can have there the same religious liberty 
     <lb/>
     that he enjoys at home, and which he gives 
     <lb/>
     to his neighbour at home and you will have 
     <lb/>
     there a growing tree that will stand the 
     <lb/>
     storm, resist the influence of American ab<lb break="no"/>sorption and the development of foreign 
     <lb/>
     ideals, because the French Canadian is the 
     <lb/>
     oldest Canadian, because the French <choice><sic>Cana<lb break="no"/>adian</sic><corr>Canadian</corr></choice> has founded on the soil of our coun<lb break="no"/>try the whole of his hopes. He has aban<lb break="no"/>doned the past; he has ceased to look to any 
     <lb/>
     foreign country for the development of his 
     <lb/>
     moral and material forces and when 
     <lb/>
     you compare the past with the present, 
     <lb/>when you think that all the French Can<lb break="no"/>adians. whether living in this country un<lb break="no"/>der the British flag or in the United States 
     <lb/>under the stars and stripes, that these 3,000,<lb break="no"/>000 French Canadians are all the descend<lb break="no"/>ants of 60,000 peasants who were aband<lb break="no"/>oned on this land by the French govern<lb break="no"/>ment 150 years ago, who had been ruined 
     <lb/>by the French government, robbed by 
     <lb/>French intendants whose methods British 
     <lb/>governors faithfully followed ; when it 
     <lb/>will be remembered that those 60,000 
     <lb/>peasants, unaided by any influx what<lb break="no"/>ever of immigration and capital, have devel<lb break="no"/>oped their education, their agriculture and 
     <lb/>their trade; that they have done all they 
     <lb/>could for Canada whether in peace or war, 
     <lb/>and if you consider the point at which they 
     <lb/>started and the result they have achieved, 
     <lb/>there is no reason why any man in this 
     <lb/>House should be afraid of the hold the 
     <lb/>French Canadians may obtain in the west. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Again referring to past history might I 
     <lb/>
     once more appeal to my English speaking 
     <lb/>
     friends in this House and say to them : Do 
     <lb/>
     not trust the religious zealot. Remember 
     <lb/>
     the New England Puritan who burned 
     <lb/>
     witches 200 years ago. He condemned the 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
         

     British Government because it granted 
     <lb/>
     religious liberty to the French Canadians, 
     <lb/>
     but ten years later he rebelled against the 
     <lb/>
     British Crown and was stopped from enter<lb break="no"/>ing Canada only by the French Canadians. 
     <lb/>
     Do not trust too much to the political jingo. 
     <lb/>
     Remember 1849, when the fathers of the 
     <lb/>
     Tories wrecked the parliament buildings 
     <lb/>
     and rotten-egged the governor for giving 
     <lb/>
     freedom to all. I simply say this and I 
     <lb/>
     leave my friends with these words : Be 
     <lb/>
     just to the French Canadians. That is all 
     <lb/>
     1 ask. I do not ask you to be generous, 
     <lb/>
     if the state of mind of your province has 
     <lb/>
     not yet been brought up to the state of 
     <lb/>
     mind that we have in Quebec. If you can<lb break="no"/>not afford to be generous, all I ask you is 
     <lb/>
     to be just. Give us the same rule that we 
     <lb/>
     have given you, do for us what we have 
     <lb/>
     done for you and trust the French Can<lb break="no"/>adians under the guidance of that hier<lb break="no"/>archy which has stood for British connec<lb break="no"/>tion in the past. The French Canadian's 
     <lb/>
     heart is generous, his heart is grateful and 
     <lb/>
     he will never forget what you have done. 
     <lb/>
     But on the other hand—and in this I am 
     <lb/>
     not uttering any threat—I regret every time 
     <lb/>
     I go back to my province to find developing 
     <lb/>
     that feeling that Canada is not Canada for 
     <lb/>
     all Canadians. We are sometimes in Quebec 
     <lb/>
     accused of being provincialists. We are 
     <lb/>
     not provincialists by nature. We have 
     <lb/>
     stood for the defence of the whole soil of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and have contributed our share for 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of the whole of Canada. But 
     <lb/>
     after such examples as we have had in 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, in Manitoba, and the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, after such attempts 
     <lb/>
     as were made in Ontario itself where we 
     <lb/>
     were preserved only because there was a 
     <lb/>
     text of law, we are bound to come to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that Quebec is our only country 
     <lb/>
     because we have no liberty elsewhere. I 
     <lb/>
     do not say that we are treated as slaves ; 
     <lb/>
     but we are proud enough and I contend 
     <lb/>
     that we have rendered service enough to 
     <lb/>
     claim at the hands of the majority of this 
     <lb/>
     country not only such treatment as you 
     <lb/>
     would grant to a good natured inferior be<lb break="no"/>ing, but such treatment as I think we, as 
     <lb/>
     your brethren, are entitled to receive at 
     <lb/>
     your hands. If you do that, if you are just 
     <lb/>
     and just without quibbling, just and just 
     <lb/>
     without trying to take with one hand what 
     <lb/>
     you give with the other, I say : Trust 
     <lb/>
    the French Canadian in the west or in the 
     <lb/>east. trust the French Canadian anywhere 
     <lb/>in Canada ; he will be true to you, true to 
     <lb/>the British Crown, if you do not expel from 
     <lb/>his mind the belief that Canada is a free 
     <lb/>country and that the British Crown is in 
     <lb/>this country the protector of equal justice 
     <lb/>and equal law. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:BLAI1">Mr. RICHARD BLAIN</persName> (Peel). I do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to follow the very lengthy ad<lb break="no"/>dress of the hon. member for Labelle 
     <lb/>

     other portions of Canada are quite well 
     <lb/>
     aware that the hon. gentleman has been de<lb break="no"/>livering this same lecture in different parts 
     <lb/>
     of Canada for several years past. While I 
     <lb/>
     do not wish to make any comparisons, for I 
     <lb/>
     do not think it is the duty of a member of 
     <lb/>
     parliament, living in a country of this kind, 
     <lb/>
     to make too many comparisons between the 
     <lb/>
     different nationalities of this country, may 
     <lb/>
     I be permitted after the reference that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend (Mr. Bourassa) has made to the 
     <lb/>
     narrowness of the English-speaking people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada to say that I come from the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario. We had a general 
     <lb/>
     election for the local legislature there a few 
     <lb/>
     weeks ago and I might say to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend that the city of Toronto sent a Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic representative to that legislature 
     <lb/>
     and that Roman Catholic has the hon<lb break="no"/>our of a seat in Mr. Whitney's cabinet 
     <lb/>
     at this moment. And may I be permitted 
     <lb/>
     to remind my hon. friends of the French 
     <lb/>
     nationality that for the first time in the 
     <lb/>
     history of the province of Ontario your own 
     <lb/>
     town, Mr. Speaker, has been recognized by 
     <lb/>
     the putting into office of the Hon. Dr. 
     <lb/>
     Rheaume, Minister of Public Works in 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Whitney's cabinet. And of course I 
     <lb/>
     need not refer to my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     South Toronto (Mr. Claude Macdonell), who 
     <lb/>
     sits on this side of the House, as 
     <lb/>
     another example of the generosity of the 
     <lb/>
     English speaking people of that important 
     <lb/>
     province, I was a little interested to hear my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend (Mr. Bourassa) dealing with 
     <lb/>
     those legal questions and I thought I would 
     <lb/>
     look up the history of the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     to see what knowledge he had to bring to 
     <lb/>
     bear in competition with that of the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden). I 
     <lb/>
     find on examination that my hon. friend had 
     <lb/>
     one special Act of parliament passed in his 
     <lb/>
     own province of Quebec to permit him to 
     <lb/>
     study law in that province. Then on fur<lb break="no"/>ther examination, I find another special 
     <lb/>
     Act of parliament passed for the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman to allow him to pass an examination 
     <lb/>
     that he has never yet passed and he has not 
     <lb/>
     to this date practised law in his own pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and yet my hon. friend will put his 
     <lb/>
     opinion on these legal questions in competi<lb break="no"/>tion with the opinion of the distinguished 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden). 
     <lb/>
     On February 21, the right hon. the Prime

     Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) intro<lb break="no"/>duced the two Bills that are to constitute 
     <lb/>
     new provinces in what is now known as the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories. The right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman gave to the House a very lengthy 
     <lb/>
     history of different matters in connection 
     <lb/>
     with those Bills. I have here Bill (No. 
     <lb/>
     69) 'An Act to establish and provide for the 
     <lb/>government of the province of Alberta,' 
     <lb/>  Clause 12 of the Act reads:

     I may be permitted briefly to refer to Bill

     No. 70 to establish and provide for the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the province of Saskatchewan. 
     <lb/>
     The same number of representatives, 25, 
     <lb/>
     are to be elected in that province; the same 
     <lb/>
     number of senators, four, are to be appoint<lb break="no"/>ed to the senate of Canada, with the pri<lb break="no"/>vilege of parliament increasing the number 
     <lb/>
     to six. The capital of the province is to be 
     <lb/>
     Regina; and this Act also is to come into 
     <lb/>
     force on the 1st of July next. I will now 
     <lb/>
     give the areas in square miles of the various

            <p>
     I wish now to point out the financial as<lb break="no"/>sistance that is to be given to these two 
     <lb/>
     new provinces. This, briefly, is the sub<lb break="no"/>stance of some clauses in the Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, when the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     introduced this Bill he expressed some sur<lb break="no"/>prise at the references made by newspapers 
     <lb/>
     and by some distinguished gentlemen in 
     <lb/>
     this country. Of course the people of Can<lb break="no"/>ada everywhere were very much interested 
     <lb/>
     in the introduction of these Bills. This 
     <lb/>
     question had been up for consideration in 
     <lb/>
     this parliament. Indeed, the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition had moved a resolution in the 
     <lb/>
     session of 1903 and again in 1904 in favour 
     <lb/>
     of absolute provincial autonomy being given 
     <lb/>
     to these Territories, unrestricted right to 
     <lb/>
     deal with every thing of a provincial char<lb break="no"/>acter. That was the policy of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion in this House in the sessions or 1903 
     <lb/>
     and 1904. May I be permitted to tell the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman what was the chief reason 
     <lb/>
     for the adverse newspaper comment and 
     <lb/>
     criticism which he has read from distingu<lb break="no"/>ished men in this country ? It is because 
     <lb/>
     they had known the stand the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman had taken in 1896 on this educa<lb break="no"/>tional or religious question. The people did 
     <lb/>
     not distrust the right hon. gentleman, they 
     <lb/>
     never thought for a moment that he would 
     <lb/>
     go back on his record of 1896, and venture 
     <lb/>
     to introduce into this House certain clauses 
     <lb/>
     in the Autonomy Bills which would stir up 
     <lb/>
     religious strife in this country. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     he had at his back the whole Canadian peo<lb break="no"/>ple; he had not only the confidence of the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party, but the confidence of a great 
     <lb/>
     number of Liberal-Conservatives in this 
     <lb/>
     country, many of whom voted for him in 
     <lb/>
     1896 on this very question. So, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, the right hon. gentleman would 
     <lb/>
     not have far to go to find a reason why 
     <lb/>
     the newspapers and leading gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who had supported him in 1896 were 
     <lb/>
     very much surprised to find that he had 
     <lb/>
     now changed his policy in regard to pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights. Some hon. gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     have spoken from the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House ventured to say that those who 
     <lb/>
     have criticised this Bill are not well ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with the question. Well, that may 
     <lb/>
     be the case as to some of the criticisms, but 
     <lb/>
     I do not think the right hon. gentleman or 
     <lb/>
     any member of his government would say 
     <lb/>
     this applies to all the criticisms that have 
     <lb/>
     been offered to the educational clauses in 
     <lb/>
     these Bills. I have here a protest from the 
     <lb/>
     Presbyterian body. I am glad to see my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the Minister of Customs, who 
     <lb/>
     as I am informed is a distinguished member 
     <lb/>
     of that denomination, in his seat. I will 
     <lb/>
     read this protest from the Presbytery of 
     <lb/>
     Guelph: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     Another protest against the Educational Pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the Autonomy Bill.

            <p>
     A meeting of the Guelph Presbytery was held 
     <lb/>
     in Melville church, Fergus, to-day. The follow<lb break="no"/>ing resolution was moved by Major Hood,

     Guelph, seconded by Rev. Mr. Horne, Elora : 
     <lb/>
     The Presbytery of Guelph, representing a large 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
           

     portion of the counties of Waterloo, Wellington 
     <lb/>
     and Halton, hereby presents its strong protest 
     <lb/>
     to the parliament of Canada against the educa<lb break="no"/>tional clauses of the Provincial Autonomy Bills 
     <lb/>
     now before the House for consideration. The 
     <lb/>
     presbytery regrets that any attempt is being 
     <lb/>
     made to debar a free people from the exercise 
     <lb/>
     of their constitutional prerogative, the right to 
     <lb/>
     decide for themselves the character of their 
     <lb/>
     school system. It is the conviction of the pres<lb break="no"/>bytery that should the proposed legislation be<lb break="no"/>come law it would involve the new provinces in 
     <lb/>
     perpetual racial and sectarian discord, which 
     <lb/>
     would be a most serious obstacle to the future 
     <lb/>
     prosperity and happiness of the people. Be<lb break="no"/>lieving that the placing of such an Act on the 
     <lb/>
     statute book would be a misuse of the powers 
     <lb/>
     of the federal government, members of the 
     <lb/>
     presbytery pledge themselves to do all in their 
     <lb/>
     power to oppose and prevent such proposed in<lb break="no"/>vasion of provincial rights, and most respect<lb break="no"/>fully urge the government and both Houses to 
     <lb/>
     grant to the two new provinces complete con<lb break="no"/>trol over their educational system.

     I have here a statement by a gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who stands at the head of the Presbyterian 
     <lb/>
     Church in the province of Ontario, and who 
     <lb/>
     spoke at a mass meeting in Toronto, in 
     <lb/>
     Massey Hall, on March 20. I refer to Rev. 
     <lb/>
     Dr. Milligan, moderator of the Presbyter<lb break="no"/>ian Church, who declares: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     That, believing in a commonwealth with equal 
     <lb/>
     rights for all and favours for none, and be<lb break="no"/>lieving that a great crisis had arisen in the 
     <lb/>
     national history, demanding united and patriotic 
     <lb/>
     action by every citizen, irrespective of creed or 
     <lb/>
     politics. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The premier's policy in the present issue, he 
     <lb/>
     continued, had come to him like a clap of 
     <lb/>
     thunder from a clear sky. It was a direct con<lb break="no"/>troversion of the attitude taken in 1896. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Wherever one party had privileges at the ex<lb break="no"/>pense of another there could never be peace. 
     <lb/>
     Let there be no restrictions imposed on the 
     <lb/>
     new west, but one common brotherhood and one 
     <lb/>
     common school system. He noted that the 
     <lb/>
     federal separate school legislation in regard to 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and Quebec was in the nature of an 
     <lb/>
     exception, and he urged the fallacy of the argu<lb break="no"/>ment which sought to make this exceptional 
     <lb/>
     case apply to all the provinces.

     I think, Mr. Speaker, that statement 
     <lb/>
     voices the views of all the Presbyterians 
     <lb/>
     in Canada-or, to be more correct, of nearly 
     <lb/>
     all the Presbyterians in Canada, who be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the government are now invad<lb break="no"/>ing provincial rights in attempting to fasten 
     <lb/>
     upon the new provinces a dual system of 
     <lb/>
     education.

     make laws in relation to education, subject to 
     <lb/>
     the right of the Dominion parliament when ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to in a specific case to enact remedial 
     <lb/>
     legislation ; and the imperial Amending Act of 
     <lb/>
     1871 empowers the Dominion parliament to es<lb break="no"/>tablish new provinces, and to define the consti<lb break="no"/>tution thereof, but prohibits such parliament 
     <lb/>
     from ever afterwards altering such constitu<lb break="no"/>tion ; 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
        

     And whereas, the Bill establishing the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan pro<lb break="no"/>poses to make the maintenance of a separate 
     <lb/>
     school system a permanent constitutional obli<lb break="no"/>gation of these new provinces, thus depriving 
     <lb/>
     them of their full provincial rights and fettering 
     <lb/>
     their whole future educational development ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And whereas, the introduction at any time of 
     <lb/>
     such a question into federal politics is calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to awaken ill-feeling on a subject in re<lb break="no"/>gard to which the Canadian people are pecul<lb break="no"/>iarly sensitive ; and more especially at this 
     <lb/>
     time, since no intimation was given to the elec<lb break="no"/>torate prior or during the recent general elec<lb break="no"/>tions that it was intended in connection with 
     <lb/>
     the granting of autonomy to the Territories to 
     <lb/>
     impose any such fetters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Therefore this meeting of Baptist citizens re<lb break="no"/>spectfully protest against the proposed legis<lb break="no"/>lation, and expresses the hope that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment may so modify its Bills as to leave the 
     <lb/>
     determination of their future educational policy 
     <lb/>
     to the free action of the new provinces.

            <p>
     Honoured Sir,—The assembled ministers of 
     <lb/>
     the Methodist church of Toronto, in their re<lb break="no"/>gular meeting on Monday morning, March 13, 
     <lb/>
     1905, unanimously beg to advise you as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That we view with alarm the introduction in<lb break="no"/>to the Autonomy Bill of that clause relating 
     <lb/>
     to separate schools against the wishes and 
     <lb/>
     contrary to the vehement protests of the 
     <lb/>
     peoples most deeply affected in the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our position is clear and firm that the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of education is purely and entirely a pro<lb break="no"/>vincial matter, as defined by the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, and should be left to the ex<lb break="no"/>clusive authority of the provinces to deter<lb break="no"/>mine.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We therefore most respectfully urge the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and both Houses of parliament to 
     <lb/>
     grant to the two new provinces full provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights, and to each complete control of its 
     <lb/>
     educational system. By so doing these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces will develop a true, healthy, self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     governing citizenship, which will be an element 
     <lb/>
     of strength to the Dominion.

     At a meeting of the Executive Committee of

            </p>

            <p>

     This is a voice from the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's own party in the city of Toronto. 
     <lb/>
     The right hon. gentleman might issue the 
     <lb/>
     writ for an election in Centre Toronto and 
     <lb/>
     test the question. Then we would see 
     <lb/>
     whether or not this Reform Association ex<lb break="no"/>presses the views of the people regardless of 
     <lb/>
     politics in that great city. I am reading 
     <lb/>
     these extracts because I think they are 
     <lb/>
     stronger than any statement I could make 
     <lb/>
     to show why the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     were aroused when the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     introduced this measure. The Toronto 
     <lb/>
     'Globe' of March 8, 1905, has a long article 
     <lb/>
     which I will not stop to read. It is well 
     <lb/>
     known throughout the country that the Tor<lb break="no"/>onto 'Globe' is very much opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     educational clauses in the Bill, and in this 
     <lb/>
     article it warns the government not to force 
     <lb/>
     them through parliament. Then, I have a 
     <lb/>
     heading of the Toronto 'News' of March 
     <lb/>
     14, and continued from day to day: 'A 
     <lb/>
     Free West, A Common School, Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Rights and Religious Equality.' With that 
     <lb/>
     I may give a statement from the editor of 
     <lb/>
     this important and valuable independent

     men throw up their farms and leave a province 
     <lb/>
     where they have no cause of complaint ? Let 
     <lb/>
     Sir Wilfrid explain this—the extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     spectacle of a people abandoning the land of 
     <lb/>
     their birth, to which they are bound by every 
     <lb/>
     tie of affection and patriotism, to seek new 
     <lb/>
     homes in the United States, for the proportion 
     <lb/>
     has been trifling who have gone to our North<lb break="no"/>west. What is it they find under an alien flag 
     <lb/>
     they could not in the province of Quebec ? We 
     <lb/>
     want no rhetorical generalities, no vapouring 
     <lb/>
     about justice and toleration. Here is a plain 
     <lb/>
     problem—Why are the Protestant farmers of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec going away ? Do men 
     <lb/>
     flee a province where they have no cause of 
     <lb/>
     complaint ?

            </p>

            <p>
     There is no more saddening aspect in the 
     <lb/>
     condition of our province than the groups of 
     <lb/>
     Protestant children to be found here and there 
     <lb/>
     all over it destitute of the means of acquiring 
     <lb/>
     the elements of education, and threatening us 
     <lb/>
     with a coming generation of Protestant farmers 
     <lb/>
     as ignorant as Russian moujiks. This is a fruit 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools. If we had national schools, 
     <lb/>
     instead of sectarian schools, no child in the 
     <lb/>
     province would be without opportunity to learn 
     <lb/>
     to read and write. Another consequence of 
     <lb/>
     these sectarian schools should never be lost 
     <lb/>
     sight of, and that is, where Protestant farmers 
     <lb/>
     are few  to have a school, they are taxed to 
     <lb/>
     support Catholic schools, which, sometimes, 
     <lb/>
     have as their teachers nuns and Christian 
     <lb/>
     brothers. There are hundreds of Protestant

     (Mr. Bourassa) against the Orange Associa<lb break="no"/>tion of Canada. That association does not 
     <lb/>
     require any defence at my hands. But when 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman thought it his duty to 
     <lb/>
     cast reflection upon the Orange Association, 
     <lb/>
     already numbering about 400,000 members, 
     <lb/>
     and those not now affiliated, I thought that 
     <lb/>
     some slight reference to the association, 
     <lb/>
     though it may seem a littly beside the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, may be in order. I turn up the 
     <lb/>
     Act to incorporate the Grand Orange Lodge 
     <lb/>
     of British America, which was assent<lb break="no"/>ed to on April 24th, 1890. Among the names 
     <lb/>
     of the corporators are those of the late 
     <lb/>
     Hon. N. Clarke Wallace, the late Edward 
     <lb/>
     F. Clarke and other leading men. I have 
     <lb/>
     looked very briefly over the clauses of this 
     <lb/>
     Act of incorporation of the Grand Orange 
     <lb/>
     Lodge of British America to see if any 
     <lb/>
     special favours had been given to the asso<lb break="no"/>ciation by this parliament. I find that no 
     <lb/>
     special favours were given—this is simply a 
     <lb/>
     Bill permitting the members of the associa<lb break="no"/>tion to organize, to hold property and to 
     <lb/>
     take care of their own rights, and to extend 
     <lb/>
     those rights to every other loyal citizen 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, whatever his creed may be. 
     <lb/>
     And I have here a copy of the Orange con<lb break="no"/>stitution, which I will be glad to send to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa), 
     <lb/>
     for evidently he has not looked into this 
     <lb/>
     document before venturing upon the state<lb break="no"/>ments which he made this afternoon. This 
     <lb/>
     constitution is open to every man in Can<lb break="no"/>ada, and from beginning to end there is no 
     <lb/>
     clause in it that interferes with the rights 
     <lb/>
     and privileges of any class of people in this 
     <lb/>
     country. I think it does not come with a 
     <lb/>
     good grace from the hon. gentleman to cast 
     <lb/>
     reflection upon this important body. Other 
     <lb/>
     references were made to the Orange Associ<lb break="no"/>ation a few days ago, one by the right hon.

     for East Grey (Mr. Sproule), who holds the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     Association in Canada, felt it to be his duty 
     <lb/>
     to sound a note of warning to the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     people, and he issued this letter and sent it

            </p>
   
            <p>
     We believe an effort is about to be made to 
     <lb/>
     impose separate schools for all time on the 
     <lb/>
     people of the new provinces, now being estab<lb break="no"/>lished in the Northwest Territories. It be<lb break="no"/>hooves every lover of liberty, and especially 
     <lb/>
     every Orangeman, to lend a helping hand, to 
     <lb/>
     prevent this injustice being perpetrated on a 
     <lb/>
     liberty-loving people. Being comparatively 
     <lb/>
     weak and helpless they must largely depend 
     <lb/>
     on others to fight their battles for them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The effort made in 1896 to compel Manitoba to 
     <lb/>
     grant separate schools nearly drove the people 
     <lb/>
     of that province into rebellion, and had it not 
     <lb/>
     been abandoned, would doubtless have resulted 
     <lb/>
     in serious consequences. In view of this, is it 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     not little short of criminal folly to attempt to 
     <lb/>
     deprive the people of these new provinces of 
     <lb/>
     the right to control their own educational 
     <lb/>
     affairs as to them seems best. I would suggest 
     <lb/>
     that every member of our order lend a helping 
     <lb/>
     hand to prevent this outrage by writing or wir<lb break="no"/>ing and getting others to do so as well, the 
     <lb/>
     member for his constituency to oppose any 
     <lb/>
     legislation or enactment for that purpose. If 
     <lb/>
     we speak out freely and do our duty no govern<lb break="no"/>ment would dare to disobey our request. Bre<lb break="no"/>thren, let us do our duty ; also get accompany<lb break="no"/>ing blank petitions signed by all friendly to our 
     <lb/>
     cause, giving name and occupation in every 
     <lb/>
     case, and forward to me to House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     post office, Ottawa, at earliest possible date.

     I was wondering what the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men representing western constituencies 
     <lb/>
     would think about that clause, a clause 
     <lb/>
     which says that the provincial governments

     of those two territories cannot control their 
     <lb/>
     lands, but that the lands shall be con<lb break="no"/>trolled by the parliament sitting at Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
     1 therefore looked up the records of some 
     <lb/>
     of these hon. gentlemen. The hon. member

     I may say that I have had a long acquaint<lb break="no"/>ance with Mr Haultain, and I am quite satis<lb break="no"/>fied that he is able to protect himself ; and 
     <lb/>
     from my more brief acquaintance with the 
     <lb/>
     members of the present government, I believe 
     <lb/>
     they are able to take their own part, and that

     The House will bear in mind that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain had submitted a proposition for 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy to the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who leads the government, and in that 
     <lb/>
     proposition he said he would ask that the 
     <lb/>
     lands be retained to the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment and the hon. member for Alberta said 
     <lb/>
     that he had entire confidence in Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain, that he would take care of himself and 
     <lb/>
     his provinces. I was a little surprised the 
     <lb/>
     other evening when the hon. gentleman ad<lb break="no"/>dressed the House on these Bills that he 
     <lb/>
     should say nothing or almost nothing about 
     <lb/>
     the land. It is a well known fact that the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who have been representing the 
     <lb/>
     western constituencies in this House for sev<lb break="no"/>eral years stated in this House on more than 
     <lb/>
     one occasion that the lands should be vested 
     <lb/>
     in the provincial governments. I shall read 
     <lb/>
     from the remarks of Mr. Davis, an hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who represented Saskatchewan 
     <lb/>
     in the last parliament, but who has now 
     <lb/>
     gone to the Senate. At page 13896 of the

     ' Hansard' 1903, he made this statement :

     I have taken the liberty of boiling down the

     <lb/>
     what Mr. Haultain asks this House to give him, 
     <lb/>
     if we are prepared to give provincial autonomy. 
     <lb/>
     He wants first all the public lands. The leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition said he was prepared to sup<lb break="no"/>port that part of the proposition. I am glad 
     <lb/>
     to see that he has approached the matter in 
     <lb/>
     that spirit. We in the west would like to see

     That was the statement of an hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who represented a western constit<lb break="no"/>uency. We have another statement from an 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman who represented West As<lb break="no"/>siniboia in the last parliament and who is 
     <lb/>
     also in this parliament (Mr. Scott). Indeed 
     <lb/>
     it is said by some Ottawa newspapers, that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman is about to go into the 
     <lb/>
     position lately given up by the hon. member

     Minister of the Interior in the government. 
     <lb/>
     I shall read to the House what he said on 
     <lb/>
     this land question, because he has been bub<lb break="no"/>bling over in support of these Bills. On

     would permit him to make a statement of

     saying: Do no give us the lands, leave them

     That was a suggestion to the leader of

     the Conservative government, then in power, 
     <lb/>
     to leave Manitoba alone, Manitoba could take 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     change in the hon. the Postmaster General. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend from Labelle made some re<lb break="no"/>ference to separate schools, pointing out the 
     <lb/>
     splendid educational system in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, a system that, he said, turned out 
     <lb/>
     first-class students, who were the pride and 
     <lb/>
     admiration of the people of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec. I would not venture to put my opin<lb break="no"/>ion against that of the hon. gentleman ; 
     <lb/>
     but I will quote the opinion of a gentle<lb break="no"/>man who occupied a high position in his 
     <lb/>
     own province, an opinion which I find quot<lb break="no"/>ed in the ' Hansard' of 1896, page 2768. I 
     <lb/>
     will read an extract from the report of the 
     <lb/>
     Superintendent of Education for that pro<lb break="no"/>vince for the year 1895, as published in the

     the slow increase in efficiency is due to the

     apathy of most of the members of the school

     board—too many of whom are unable to read— 
     <lb/>
     to the indifference of parents, to the miserable 
     <lb/>
     salaries paid to teachers, which make it diffi<lb break="no"/>cult to obtain competent ones.  .  .   . In one 
     <lb/>
     district, another inspector declares, where 166 
     <lb/>
     schools were in operation, 38 teachers were 
     <lb/>
     without certificates, and 66 the year before. 
     <lb/>
     .    .    . Most of the teachers are entirely ignor<lb break="no"/>ant of the first principles of pedagogics, have 
     <lb/>
     no system in their work, and content them<lb break="no"/>selves by making their pupils learn their books 
     <lb/>
    by rote.  .    .    . The pupils recite their lessons 
     <lb/>fairly well, but without understanding their 
     <lb/>meaning.  .  .    . As it is declared that the 
     <lb/>average salary to teachers is, in some districts, 
     <lb/>$108 for ten months work, and as some must get 
     <lb/>considerably less than this, and as these 
     <lb/>small wages are not always promptly paid, it 
     <lb/>is not difficult to understand what is behind the 
     <lb/>teacher's indifference.  .    .    . To put it briefly, 
     <lb/>the people, in too many cases, do not appre<lb break="no"/>ciate their duty to their children in the way of 
     <lb/>education. They are content to fit them to be

     These gentlemen differed from their col<lb break="no"/>leagues on important questions and resigned 
     <lb/>
     their positions in the cabinet ; they thought 
     <lb/>
     their differences were sufficient to justify 
     <lb/>
     them in resigning from the government. I 
     <lb/>
     have very little to say about these hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen, they are not in the House, and there<lb break="no"/>fore I will not say much about them. I 
     <lb/>
     will say, however, that the people of Can<lb break="no"/>ada were disappointed in that these gentle<lb break="no"/>men, after having left the government, did 
     <lb/>
     not go into the country and defend their 
     <lb/>
     principles which they considered were in the 
     <lb/>
     best interests of the people of this country. I 
     <lb/>
     think it was their duty to go before the elec<lb break="no"/>tors and endeavour to uphold their views. 
     <lb/>
     But these hon. gentlemen did not do 
     <lb/>
     that. We have had another resignation 
     <lb/>
     within the past few days in the case of the 
     <lb/>
     late Minister of the Interior, who left the 
     <lb/>
     government upon this school question. He 
     <lb/>
     just stepped outside the cabinet, some peo<lb break="no"/>ple say he is going back into it. I know 
     <lb/>
     nothing about that ; if he does, some hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the other side will be very 
     <lb/>
     much disappointed, I am sure. The people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada expect better things from the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member from Brandon (Mr. Sifton). He 
     <lb/>
     had been fighting in opposition to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in his own province of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     and he came down to Ottawa and entered 
     <lb/>
     the government of the right hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     In the preparation of these Bills, he says 
     <lb/>
     he was not consulted on the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses. Well, I have not much sympathy 
     <lb/>
     with the hon. gentleman on that point. He 
     <lb/>
     had been taking an active part in the pre<lb break="no"/>paration of the western country for pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy. When the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man knew that these Bills were coming 
     <lb/>
     up to be considered in this House, it was 
     <lb/>
     his duty, as a representative of the North<lb break="no"/>west, to see to it that the educational clauses 
     <lb/>
     were such as would be satisfactory to the 
     <lb/>
     western people, and if they were, I think 
     <lb/>
    they would satisfy his own views too. But 
     <lb/>he left them alone. He had entire confi<lb break="no"/>dence in the right hon. gentleman. But 
     <lb/>the right hon. gentleman rather disappoint<lb break="no"/>ed him, because he introduced the Bill be<lb break="no"/>fore the Minister of the Interior came back. 
     <lb/>Then when he looked at the clauses he 
     <lb/>said: I will leave the government. But 
     <lb/>the other night he gave an exhibition of 
     <lb/>coming back. He condemned the separate 
     <lb/>school clauses of the Bill, he says that sep<lb break="no"/>arate Schools were a bad thing in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba, and he did not support 
     <lb/>them very earnestly on the floor of the 
     <lb/>House the other evening. But. he says. 
     <lb/>rather than shake up this government any 
     <lb/>
    

            <pb n="3303" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3303.jpg"/>

     more, rather than that this government 
     <lb/>
     should be defeated at the polls, I will set 
     <lb/>
     aside my principles of a lifetime, I will 
     <lb/>
     let the educational clause go as it is, and 
     <lb/>
     allow this government to fasten separate 
     <lb/>
     schools upon western Canada for all time 
     <lb/>
     to come; I will sacrifice every principle 
     <lb/>
     which has been dear to me for the last fif<lb break="no"/>teen years in order to preserve the govern<lb break="no"/>ment from defeat. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, for myself, I am absol<lb break="no"/>utely opposed to fastening separate schools 
     <lb/>
     on these two new provinces. I believe it 
     <lb/>
     would be in the best interests of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Canada that only one educational 
     <lb/>
     system should prevail in that western coun<lb break="no"/>try, and that that system should receive 
     <lb/>
     every dollar of public money and all the 
     <lb/>
     revenues from the public school lands in or<lb break="no"/>der to make it a perfect system. I would 
     <lb/>
     open the door to every nationality, and al<lb break="no"/>low every child to receive the same uniform 
     <lb/>
     education. This is the policy I am here to 
     <lb/>
     support. The people are not so much 
     <lb/>
     interested in what we are saying upon 
     <lb/>
     this question, because it is an old ques<lb break="no"/>tion and one that has been debated for 
     <lb/>
     many years, but the people of Canada are 
     <lb/>
     interested in how we vote. and for my part 
     <lb/>
     I will vote against the government in res<lb break="no"/>pect to this educational clause. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Only? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BLAI1">Mr. BLAIN</persName>. Not only, because I am op<lb break="no"/>posed to the land clauses and I believe that 
     <lb/>
     the people of western Canada can take care 
     <lb/>
     of their own lands better than the federal 
     <lb/>
     government. I would vote to postpone 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy for five or even ten 
     <lb/>
     years rather than fasten for all time on the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces a dual school system, both 
     <lb/>
     systems receiving public aid and sharing 
     <lb/>
     in the revenue from the public school lands. 
     <lb/>
     That is my position. I would rather vote 
     <lb/>
     for an increased subsidy from this govern<lb break="no"/>ment to western Canada for five or even ten 
     <lb/>
     years yet to come than I would record my 
     <lb/>
     vote to take away the rights of the people 
     <lb/>
     of that western country to deal with their 
     <lb/>
     education as they see fit. That is my policy 
     <lb/>
     and I have nothing to add to and nothing 
     <lb/>
     to detract from what I have said. I am in 
     <lb/>
     favour of absolute provincial rights for 
     <lb/>
     western Canada in all matters. The people 
     <lb/>
     of that country are the sons and daughters 
     <lb/>
     of the people of older Canada, living there 
     <lb/>
     With the people who are coming from 
     <lb/>
     foreign countries, and I am anxious that 
     <lb/>
     their children shall have the best education 
     <lb/>
     that can be given them. I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     in dividing the school money (part of it 
     <lb/>
     going to the separate school system and 
     <lb/>
     part of it to the national school system.) 
     <lb/>
     I do not believe they can perfect these two 
     <lb/>
     educational systems in that way. If the 
     <lb/>
     people of the west wish to do so then 
     <lb/>
     let them be responsible for it themselves. 
     <lb/>
     For my part I do not wish to take the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility of recording my vote to fasten 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
      

     this separate school system upon them. I 
     <lb/>
     have, therefore, much pleasure in support<lb break="no"/>ing the amendment moved by the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition which reads :

     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX</persName> (Solicitor 
     <lb/>
     General). Mr. Speaker, I have listened 
     <lb/>
     with much pleasure to the able speech de<lb break="no"/>livered by my hon. friend from Peel (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Blain), and if I had not been within the pre<lb break="no"/>cincts of parliament when he was reciting 
     <lb/>
     all the protests which have been sent from 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario and elsewhere, I 
     <lb/>
     would have thought that I was present at 
     <lb/>
     a church meeting and not in a legislative 
     <lb/>
     chamber. Listening to my hon. friend re<lb break="no"/>citing the protests from the Presbyterians, 
     <lb/>
     the Baptists, the Congregationalists and the 
     <lb/>
     Methodists, uttered as they were in his own 
     <lb/>
     sweet voice, I thought we were listening to 
     <lb/>
     a preacher and not to a parliamentarian. 
     <lb/>
     The thought crossed my mind, that if we in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec are to be accused of 
     <lb/>
     being priest-ridden, my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Blain, well deserves the compliment of be<lb break="no"/>ing himself ridden by some of the ministers 
     <lb/>
     of the dissenting sects. Let me tell my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend further, that if there came from the 
     <lb/>
     pulpits and from religious bodies in On<lb break="no"/>tario and other provinces protests against 
     <lb/>
     the educational clauses of this Bill, I can 
     <lb/>
     appeal to him to point to one speech, one 
     <lb/>
     word, one sentence delivered by a member 
     <lb/>
     of that fearful Quebec hierarchy. Not one 
     <lb/>
     word, not one phrase, not one sentence of 
     <lb/>
     protest was uttered in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec for or against the educational clauses. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. What about the pe<lb break="no"/>titions? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. I will explain the origin 
     <lb/>
     of those petitions. In this matter, the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party has played the same 
     <lb/>
     old double game it played years ago 
     <lb/>
     when it stirred up the feelings of the 
     <lb/>
     austere Protestants in Ontario and the 
     <lb/>
    ultramontane element in the province 
     <lb/>of Quebec. When petitions were, so 
     <lb/>to speak, commanded from the Orange 
     <lb/>lodges by the member, from East Grey, at 
     <lb/>the same time an order was given by the 
     <lb/>Conservative organization in Montreal to 
     <lb/>get protests from some of the counties in 
     <lb/>Quebec. We presented these petitions to 
     <lb/>parliament, as it was the right of the peti<lb break="no"/>tioners to ask us, but we said we were not 
     <lb/>responsible for them. My hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>Blain) stated this afternoon that the right 
     <lb/>hon. the Prime Minister had obtained power 
     <lb/>in 1896 by riding the Catholic horse in the 
     <lb/>province of Quebec, and he told us that if 
     <lb/>the Liberal party were in power to-day it 
     <lb/>
 

            <pb n="3305" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3305.jpg"/>

     was due to its alliance with the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     clergy in that province. Sir, the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman ought to know better; he ought to 
     <lb/>
     know that during the elections of 1896 in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec, every Liberal can<lb break="no"/>didate was asked by his Conservative op<lb break="no"/>ponent to choose between the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     church and the leader of the Liberal party, 
     <lb/>
     and in spite of the hurricane of protests 
     <lb/>
     which came from sone presbyteries and 
     <lb/>
     some pulpits the candidates of the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party in Quebec stood to their guns and 
     <lb/>
     won the battle.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My hon. friend (Mr. Blain) quoted not 
     <lb/>
     only the opinions of some clergymen in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and other provinces, but he also re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the defection of the Toronto 
     <lb/>
     ' Globe. I, have been a reader of the 
     <lb/>
     ' Globe ' for many years ; every Liberal 
     <lb/>
     in this country is proud of the great Liberal 
     <lb/>
     organ in the province of Ontario, and I, for 
     <lb/>
     one deeply regret the defection of the 
     <lb/>
     ' Globe ' on this question. I regret that it 
     <lb/>
     forgets what the policy of George Brown did 
     <lb/>
     for the Liberal party. The Toronto 'Globe' 
     <lb/>
     should remember that the policy of George 
     <lb/>
     Brown on certain questions, kept the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party out of office for a quarter of a cen<lb break="no"/>tury. But I must say this to the credit of 
     <lb/>
     the Toronto ' Globe': Though it fought the 
     <lb/>
     government and is still fighting the govern<lb break="no"/>ment on the educational clauses of this Bill, 
     <lb/>
     it has made no wild appeals such as those 
     <lb/>
     made by my hon. friend from South York 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. W. F. Maclean) in his paper. The 
     <lb/>
     Toronto ' Globe ' has discussed fairly the 
     <lb/>
     question from its own point of view. It 
     <lb/>
     has appealed to its own readers who belong 
     <lb/>
     to the school of George Brown, and it has 
     <lb/>
     loyally severed its connection with the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on this question. But what has 
     <lb/>
     been the policy pursued by my hon. friend, 
     <lb/>
     the editor of the Toronto ' World.'

     <lb/>
     I have been a journalist myself, and I have 
     <lb/>
     read his paper for many years ; I have fol<lb break="no"/>lowed his career in this House very closely; 
     <lb/>
     and I say to him that he would not dare to 
     <lb/>
     utter before me, eye to eye, what he has 
     <lb/>
     published in his paper since the biginning 
     <lb/>
     of this debate.

            <p>
     The hon. member for Peel (Mr. Blain) 
     <lb/>
     quoted from the Huntingdon ' Gleaner,' 
     <lb/>
     which he said was a leading Liberal organ 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec. I admit that 
     <lb/>
     the editor of the Huntingdon ' Gleaner ' 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Robert Sellar, is an old journalist. 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
   

     He resides in the county of Huntingdon, a 
     <lb/>
     county where the French Canadians and 
     <lb/>
     Catholics form nearly a majority of the 
     <lb/>
     electors, and elect Protestant members. 
     <lb/>
     During the last election they elected 
     <lb/>
     an Irish Protestant. Mr. Robert Sellar is 
     <lb/>
     an intelligent man, an honest and pious 
     <lb/>
     man ; but, Sir, he is a doctrinaire. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend who is ready to accept the statement 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Robert Sellars, whom he does not 
     <lb/>
     know ; who is ready to accept the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the Huntingdon ' Gleaner ' which 
     <lb/>
     he does not read once a year, because the 
     <lb/>
     paper has but a limited circulation in the 
     <lb/>
     county of Huntingdon, should, instead of 
     <lb/>
     accepting blindly such statements, look 
     <lb/>
     around him and ask his friend the member 
     <lb/>
     for the county of Huntingdon (Mr. Walsh), 
     <lb/>
     and his friend the member for the county of 
     <lb/>
     Sherbrooke (Mr. Worthington), and my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend who represents St. Antoine division 
     <lb/>
     of Montreal (Mr. Ames), and my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     who represents Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron), 
     <lb/>
     and my hon. friend from Jacques Cartier 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Monk), to read the article referred to 
     <lb/>
     and he will learn then whether it is true or 
     <lb/>
     not that the French Canadian majority in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec is driving away the 
     <lb/>
     English-speaking minority.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Might I say this to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member, that I remember distinctly 
     <lb/>
     that some years ago an application was 
     <lb/>
     made to the government of the day—and 
     <lb/>
     two maps were brought here showing how 
     <lb/>
     the country had been peopled with English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking people years ago and the condition 
     <lb/>
     it was in then—to lend or grant them money 
     <lb/>
     enough to take them to the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, because they were becoming so few 
     <lb/>
     that it was utterly impossible for them to 
     <lb/>
     keep up their schools and churches and to 
     <lb/>
     have English-speaking communities, as they 
     <lb/>
     had before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. My hon. friend has not 
     <lb/>
     made even a point. Does he for one mo<lb break="no"/>ment believe that the French Canadians in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec are driving away 
     <lb/>
     the English-speaking Protestant minority ? 
     <lb/>
     Does he believe that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. If the hon. member will 
     <lb/>
     allow me to explain, I say I believe it—not 
     <lb/>
     that they are driving them away offensively, 
     <lb/>
     by any means ; but here is the system that 
     <lb/>
     was represented to us : that whenever a 
     <lb/>
     farm was offered for sale, or a farmer was 
     <lb/>
     at all willing to sell, a French Canadian was 
     <lb/>
     prepared to buy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Will hon gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     extend to me that courtesy which I always 
     <lb/>
     extend to them ? Not that the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians were desirous of getting the farms 
     <lb/>
     at less than their value ; but it was said 
     <lb/>
     that they were always ready to buy, and 
     <lb/>
     that they had a fund at their disposal to 
     <lb/>

     buy out the English-speaking farmers. They 
     <lb/>
     could get money at a very low rate of in<lb break="no"/>terest—

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. The hon. gentleman re<lb break="no"/>fers to a fund. What fund is that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. A fund supplied by the 
     <lb/>
     church.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That may be something 
     <lb/>
     laughable, or it may be something absurd. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Will the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Now, the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     made it a point to interrupt me repeatedly 
     <lb/>
     when I was up before. I simply made the 
     <lb/>
     request to be allowed to explain. Then it 
     <lb/>
     was said that the farm was purchased— 
     <lb/>
     why ? For this reason, that as soon as the 
     <lb/>
     farm got into the hands of a Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     it was subject to the tithes which the church 
     <lb/>
     could collect, and thus became a supporter 
     <lb/>
     of the church ; but that so long as it was 
     <lb/>
     owned by a Protestant, it was not a sup<lb break="no"/>porter of the church. Therefore there was 
     <lb/>
     a strong inducement for the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     to purchase it. It was said that a fund 
     <lb/>
     was raised by the church for this purpose— 
     <lb/>
     not improperly at all—and that one farm 
     <lb/>
     after another was taken over in that way 
     <lb/>
     until the English-speaking population got to 
     <lb/>
     be so few that they were unable to keep up 
     <lb/>
     their schools and churches, and these were 
     <lb/>
     closed ; the people had no community of in<lb break="no"/>terest amongst themselves because they 
     <lb/>
     could not keep up their schools, their child<lb break="no"/>ren were raised in ignorance ; and this ap<lb break="no"/>plication was made to the government for 
     <lb/>
     assistance or for a loan to enable a number 
     <lb/>
     of these people to go to the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. That is the explanation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>.  Mr. Speaker, you have 
     <lb/>
     there an evidence of the ignorance—the 
     <lb/>
     honest ignorance, I must say—of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend. I appeal to his neighbour, my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Beauharnois, to my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Jacques Cartier, to my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from St. Antoine, to my hon. friend from the 
     <lb/>
     county of Huntingdon, where the Hunting<lb break="no"/>don 'Gleaner' is published, and I ask them 
     <lb/>
     to stamp at once such statement as arrant 
     <lb/>
     nonsense. To think that the church, which 
     <lb/>
     is greatly indebted in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, and which is even borrowing money 
     <lb/>
     from English insurance companies and Eng<lb break="no"/>lish banks, has a fund to buy farms from 
     <lb/>
     the English-speaking people of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, why ! it is simply preposterous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I wish to say— 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Sit down. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Is that the tolerance that 
     <lb/>
     is extended to a member who wishes to 
     <lb/>
     say a word on behalf of Protestantism in 
     <lb/>
     this country ? I treat those hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
        

     with respect and am entitled to expect a 
     <lb/>
     like return from them. I rise to say that 
     <lb/>
     the Huntingdon ' Gleaner' gives an account 
     <lb/>
     of the very same thing described in the 
     <lb/>
     letter I read. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FISH2">Mr. FISHER</persName>. It is altogether astray. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Peel (Mr. Blain) quoted some of the authori<lb break="no"/>ties against this measure, and did not fail 
     <lb/>
     to mention the name of Mr. Haultain. I 
     <lb/>
     have very much respect for the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Northwest Territories. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain is a talented young statesman 
     <lb/>
     from the west. He has been in Ottawa a 
     <lb/>
     few weeks, and no doubt feels compelled 
     <lb/>
     to speak in accord with the Tory press, 
     <lb/>
     because he is also a Tory statesman. During 
     <lb/>
     the last elections he took a very prominent 
     <lb/>
     and active part against this government 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories. Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     is therefore bound to be against the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. But there is another gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     accompanied Mr. Haultain on his mission 
     <lb/>
     to the Ottawa government. We saw him 
     <lb/>
     on the floor of this House when this Bill 
     <lb/>
     was introduced. I refer to Mr. Bulyea. I 
     <lb/>
     understand that Mr. Bulyea gave an ex<lb break="no"/>pression of his opinion to the Toronto 
     <lb/>
     press not long ago, and when I compare the 
     <lb/>
     statements of Mr. Haultain with those of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bulyea, I find that they differ toto 
     <lb/>
     coelo. Mr. Haultain has taken this govern<lb break="no"/>ment to task on the educational clauses, the 
     <lb/>
     land clauses and on the division of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, But Mr. Bulyea declares, speaking 
     <lb/>
     for his province and himself, that he is per<lb break="no"/>fectly satisfied with the measure as present<lb break="no"/>ed by the government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, the question now before the House 
     <lb/>
     and the country marks an epoch in the 
     <lb/>
     history of Canada. It deserves our best 
     <lb/>
     attention and all our solicitude, as it is 
     <lb/>
     surrounded with immense difficulties. I 
     <lb/>
     must crave the indulgence of the House 
     <lb/>
     during the few remarks I will offer, re<lb break="no"/>membering always that the more conten<lb break="no"/>tious an issue is the more it must be ap<lb break="no"/>proached in a spirit of conciliation and toler<lb break="no"/>ance, and I earnestly hope that not one 
     <lb/>
     word, not one sentence, will fall from my 
     <lb/>
     lips that will in the least offend even the 
     <lb/>
     most sturdy opponent of the measure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As to the principle of autonomy, I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe that there is in the House one dis<lb break="no"/>senting voice. From every part of Canada 
     <lb/>
     the birth of the twin provinces has been 
     <lb/>
     hailed with joy ; nay, more, with a legiti<lb break="no"/>mate pride. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Northwest Territories are the crea<lb break="no"/>tion of the Canadian commonwealth. They 
     <lb/>
     are its offspring. The fathers of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion were not satisfied with the union of 
     <lb/>
     the different British colonies scattered from 
     <lb/>
     one end of the continent to the other. They 
     <lb/>
     thought—and wisely so—that the immense 
     <lb/>
     prairies extending from the great lakes to 
     <lb/>
     the Rocky mountains should also be includ<lb break="no"/>ed in the Dominion, so as to unite, under the 
     <lb/>
     British flag, all the territories extending 
     <lb/>
     from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They did 
     <lb/>

     not hesitate to pledge the credit of the coun<lb break="no"/>try to what was then considered a huge 
     <lb/>
     amount of money—but which has since been 
     <lb/>
     found to be but a trifling sum—in order to 
     <lb/>
     secure for Canada that great lone land, 
     <lb/>
     known only in those days from the early 
     <lb/>
     pioneers, from the missionaries, from the 
     <lb/>
     voyageurs and the trappers of the Hudson 
     <lb/>
     Bay Company. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, the more we study the history of 
     <lb/>
     confederation the more we appreciate the 
     <lb/>
     spirit which guided its fathers. They were 
     <lb/>
     nation-builders, the men who sat at the con<lb break="no"/>ference of Quebec. Their vision of the 
     <lb/>
     future extended much beyond the union of 
     <lb/>
     the four original provinces. They foresaw 
     <lb/>
     that, in the years to come, the existence of 
     <lb/>
     a great Canadian nation. under the aegis of 
     <lb/>
     British monarchical institutions was not 
     <lb/>
     only a dream, but a striking reality ; aye, 
     <lb/>
     even by the side of by far the greatest of 
     <lb/>
     all modern and ancient republics. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before I proceed any further, let me ex<lb break="no"/>press the hope that the day is not far dis<lb break="no"/>tant when the last link will be added to 
     <lb/>
     the chain of Canadian provinces by the 
     <lb/>
     entry of Newfoundland into confederation. 
     <lb/>
     More so, now that the vexed French shore 
     <lb/>
     dispute has been settled between England 
     <lb/>
     and France. It seems to me that nothing 
     <lb/>
     stands in the way to prevent the union of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland with the Dominion on fair 
     <lb/>
     terms. The public men of both countries 
     <lb/>
     would indeed be remiss to their duty if 
     <lb/>
     they did not grapple and overcome the ob<lb break="no"/>jections or the difficulties which have been 
     <lb/>
     raised in the past whenever the question 
     <lb/>
     was brought up for discussion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I said, a moment ago, the granting of 
     <lb/>
     autonomy to the Northwest Territories has 
     <lb/>
     been received with favour by the country 
     <lb/>
     at large. Long ago, it was felt, that if 
     <lb/>
     ever the tide of immigration would turn 
     <lb/>
     our way it would never recede. The tide 
     <lb/>
     is on us—more especially since the last five 
     <lb/>
     or six years—and from all parts of the 
     <lb/>
     world, immigration is pouring so to say, 
     <lb/>
     towards the new promised land of western 
     <lb/>
     Canada. With a population of half a mil<lb break="no"/>lion inhabitants ; with the expectation of 
     <lb/>
     doubling that figure before many years have 
     <lb/>
     elapsed ; having fairly passed the period of 
     <lb/>
     infancy, it was but just and fair that the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories should be given the 
     <lb/>
     full control of their local government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I insist however on two points : 1. The 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories have been acquired 
     <lb/>
     by Canada,—they are our creation ; 2. 
     <lb/>
     Whilst in the case of Canada, the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion was framed by the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, in the present instance, with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the Northwest Territories, their consti<lb break="no"/>tution is framed by the Canadian parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. It seems to me that at this stage 
     <lb/>
     of the debate, it is well to bear in mind 
     <lb/>
     those two peculiar features of the situation. 
     <lb/>
     Though not eternal, constitutions are not 
     <lb/>
     by any means of a transitory nature. They 
     <lb/>
     are framed to be permanent—as permanent 
     <lb/>
     as human institutions can possibly be. I 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     therefore quite understand the keen and 
     <lb/>
     lively interest which the two Bills now un<lb break="no"/>der consideration, have aroused from one 
     <lb/>
     end of the country to the other. I less 
     <lb/>
     understand, however, the sentiment of bit<lb break="no"/>terness which, of latter days, they have so 
     <lb/>
     intensely developed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I do not intend to discuss the several 
     <lb/>
     clauses contained in the Bill. The masterly 
     <lb/>
     effort of the right hon. the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     House, when he introduced this measure, 
     <lb/>
     has made our task an easy one indeed—I 
     <lb/>
     will confine myself to the land question 
     <lb/>
     and the school question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I wish, however, before taking up those 
     <lb/>
     two features of the Bill, to say a word or 
     <lb/>
     two concerning the division of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories into two provinces. This is 
     <lb/>
     one of Mr. Haultain's grievances-but from 
     <lb/>
     all appearances, it seems to be a personal 
     <lb/>
     grievance. Is it because, as future premier 
     <lb/>
     of one of the provinces, he will command less 
     <lb/>
     influence ? That, I would not venture to 
     <lb/>
     say. But be it a personal grievance or not, 
     <lb/>
     the fact remains that the division of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories into two provinces is 
     <lb/>
     in accord with public opinion all over Can<lb break="no"/>ada. Sir. we are legislating for the future 
     <lb/>
     whilst Mr. Haultain—if his views on this 
     <lb/>
     question were adopted—would bind us to 
     <lb/>
     the present only. Moreover, we live in a 
     <lb/>
     confederation. Should not the history of 
     <lb/>
     other confederacies be an object lesson to 
     <lb/>
     us? The danger may be remote, but do 
     <lb/>
     you not agree with me, Mr. Speaker, that 
     <lb/>
     by carving two provinces out of that im<lb break="no"/>mense western territory, the balance of 
     <lb/>
     power is more equally, more equitably dis<lb break="no"/>tributed as among all the others ? At the 
     <lb/>
     time of the first republic of France, a great 
     <lb/>
     orator, Vergniaud, said of the French re<lb break="no"/>volution that it resembled Saturn devouring 
     <lb/>
     his own progeny. Sir, I am not a pessi<lb break="no"/>mist, but I fear that the very reverse would 
     <lb/>
     likely happen, if we did create one huge 
     <lb/>
     province extending from Manitoba to the 
     <lb/>
     Rockies; in this instance the child abnor<lb break="no"/>mally overgrown, would soon devour his 
     <lb/>
     father. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. gentlemen opposite and the Con<lb break="no"/>servative press throughout the Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     have been very loud in their protests against 
     <lb/>
     the clause of the Bill which vests in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion the property of the public lands 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories. 'Why is the 
     <lb/>
     west deprived of its birthright'? is the 
     <lb/>
     question put by those who, by all means, 
     <lb/>
     are bound to find fault with this measure. 
     <lb/>
     'Why not treat the west as well as the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces'? Sir, such appeals may 
     <lb/>
     perhaps stir up the feelings of those who 
     <lb/>
     do not know under what peculiar and ex<lb break="no"/>ceptional circumstances the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories entered confederation. But surely, 
     <lb/>
     they cannot and will not bias the judgment 
     <lb/>
     of any of the hon. gentlemen who sit in this 
     <lb/>
     House. True it is. that the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act stipulates that each province 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="3311" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3311.jpg"/>

     is vested with the property of its lands. 
     <lb/>
     Such has been the case with Ontario, Que<lb break="no"/>bec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Bri<lb break="no"/>tish Columbia. But one must remember 
     <lb/>
     that when they entered into confederation, 
     <lb/>
     each of these provinces had the property of 
     <lb/>
     its lands. They were independent colonies 
     <lb/>
     and they exercised a sovereign power over 
     <lb/>
     their Crown lands. Nearly all their re<lb break="no"/>venues have since been derived from that 
     <lb/>
     source. Their right was inalienable and 
     <lb/>
     they stipulated in 1867, that they would 
     <lb/>
     continue to exercise it. Quite different in 
     <lb/>
     the case with the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     At the time of confederation, the delegates 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces inserted a clause in the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act by which they 
     <lb/>
     empowered the Dominion to purchase from 
     <lb/>
     the Hudson Bay Company—then suzerain 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories—all this vast tract of 
     <lb/>
     country. The purchase was made in 1870, 
     <lb/>
     and the price paid by the Dominion to the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson Bay Company amounted to £300,<lb break="no"/>000. Out of that domain, was first carved 
     <lb/>
     the province of Manitoba, but, with the ex<lb break="no"/>ception of the swamp lands, all the public 
     <lb/>
     lands of the new province remained the 
     <lb/>
     property of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. Would my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lemieux) allow me to ask him a question ? 
     <lb/>
     If the land in the Northwest remains vested 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion, why was it necessary in 
     <lb/>
     the case of Manitoba to put a special pro<lb break="no"/>vision in the Bill creating that province to 
     <lb/>
     reserve the lands of that province ? It 
     <lb/>
     does not seem to have been necessary, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the hon. gentleman's argument. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. It was to avoid litiga<lb break="no"/>tion. The province of Manitoba might 
     <lb/>
     have said : We must be treated as the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces have been treated ; the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces have their public lands and 
     <lb/>
     we must have our public lands. Therefore 
     <lb/>
     there was a special enactment in the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1870, that Manitoba should not have its 
     <lb/>
     lands but that these should remain vested 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We were told the other day by the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the House how Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald refused the request of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     when in 1884 that province raised a claim 
     <lb/>
     to the property of her public lands. The 
     <lb/>
     same policy has been followed with regard 
     <lb/>
     to every new state entering the American 
     <lb/>
     union. It seems to me therefore that we 
     <lb/>
     would not have been justified to adopt a 
     <lb/>
     different policy with regard to the two new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Their territory covers in round 
     <lb/>
     figures a total area of 345,000,000 acres— 
     <lb/>
     one-third of which has already been re<lb break="no"/>served or sold. We must deduct from that 
     <lb/>
     total area, the land grants made to railway 
     <lb/>
     companies by the Conservative administra<lb break="no"/>tions, the Indian reserves, the timber limits, 
     <lb/>
     the school lands, the Hudson bay lands, and 
     <lb/>
     the homesteads already taken, which leaves 
     <lb/>
     a balance of about 225,000,000 acres. Sir, 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
         

     I claim that this domain is the property 
     <lb/>
     of the whole Dominion of Canada. Ad<lb break="no"/>ministered by Canada since 1870, it has 
     <lb/>
     added not a little burden to the public ex<lb break="no"/>chequer. We had to pay the cost of two 
     <lb/>
     rebellions and besides, we have—in order 
     <lb/>
     to maintain law, peace and order—equipped 
     <lb/>
     a corps of mounted police, which has pat<lb break="no"/>rolled the west and afforded ample protec<lb break="no"/>tion against the Indians and the rough 
     <lb/>
     element. Again, the Dominion has spent 
     <lb/>
     millions to advertise and settle the west. 
     <lb/>
     We have subsidized the vast system of rail<lb break="no"/>ways which is now netting so rapidly the 
     <lb/>
     prairies from north to south, from east to 
     <lb/>
     west. The Canadian Pacific Railway and 
     <lb/>
     the Grand Trunk Pacific are in a sense 
     <lb/>
     national highways, but who will deny that 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories are not the most 
     <lb/>
     interested in their completion ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     All this vast expenditure has enhanced 
     <lb/>
     the value of the Northwest Territories and 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion has yet to draw the interest 
     <lb/>
     to which any creditor is entitled on an in<lb break="no"/>vestment. Would it be fair, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     to divest ourselves of our lands, under such 
     <lb/>
     circumstances ? Would not that policy be 
     <lb/>
     inopportune and unwise? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. My hon. friend will 
     <lb/>
     of course remember, and he will pardon me 
     <lb/>
     for interrupting, that this is exactly the 
     <lb/>
     argument which was made fifty or sixty 
     <lb/>
     or seventy years ago in Great Britain as 
     <lb/>
     a reason for not handing over to the people 
     <lb/>
     of the various provinces the control of their 
     <lb/>
     lands and their minerals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. Yes, it is always well 
     <lb/>
     to borrow from Great Britain. Sir, I have 
     <lb/>
     read some very wild statements in the 
     <lb/>
     press, concerning this question of public 
     <lb/>
     lands. Having myself been a journalist ; 
     <lb/>
     far be it from my mind to minimize the 
     <lb/>
     influence of the press—but it thus happens 
     <lb/>
     that sometimes the press finds grievances 
     <lb/>
     which are more imaginary than real. Some 
     <lb/>
     people have that weakness ;—they are happy 
     <lb/>
     —yet a grievance heretofore unsuspected 
     <lb/>
     comes to them as a relief. Let me, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, answer some of the statements 
     <lb/>
     made in favour of entrusting the lands to 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces. First, it must be admit<lb break="no"/>ted that a revenue had to be provided to 
     <lb/>
     run the machinery of the local government. 
     <lb/>
     This is what is being done by granting a 
     <lb/>
     subsidy in lieu of lands. Is this subsidy 
     <lb/>
     a fair equivalent for the public lands sur<lb break="no"/>rendered to us ? In order to answer this 
     <lb/>
     question, one must bear in mind the follow<lb break="no"/>ing facts. The lands are not sold by the 
     <lb/>
     federal government, but are given away as 
     <lb/>
     an inducement to the settlers. Suppose the 
     <lb/>
     lands were left to the now provinces, would 
     <lb/>
     they depart from the policy of free grants 
     <lb/>
     to the settlers ? I assume that they would 
     <lb/>
     —in all wisdom—continue the issuing of 
     <lb/>
     free grants. Thus, the revenue which other<lb break="no"/>wise would accrue from the sale of these 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="3313" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3313.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3313</fw>
            <fw type="dateline">MARCH 28, 1905</fw> 

            <fw type="num">3314</fw>
         

     lands, would amount to nothing—with per<lb break="no"/>haps the exception of very limited receipts 
     <lb/>
     arising from stumpage dues or timber limits 
     <lb/>
     and royalties on coal lands. Let us suppose, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, that the lands would be vest<lb break="no"/>ed in the new provinces. What would hap<lb break="no"/>pen ? One of two things would have to be 
     <lb/>
     done—either issue free grants to the settlers 
     <lb/>
     or sell the lands. In the first instance, i.e., 
     <lb/>
     issuing free grants, the provinces would 
     <lb/>
     get no revenue. In the second instance, i.e. 
     <lb/>
     selling the lands, true they would derive 
     <lb/>
     a revenue from the sales, but at the same 
     <lb/>
     time, they would fatally restrain and check 
     <lb/>
     the growth of population. On the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     the continuation of the free grants system 
     <lb/>
     will, by increasing the population increase 
     <lb/>
     also the annual payments made by the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government. The actual revenue 
     <lb/>
     which the Dominion government draws 
     <lb/>
     from the Northwest Territories is derived 
     <lb/>
     mainly from (a) homesteading fees and from 
     <lb/>
     (b) royalties on coal mines—but without 
     <lb/>
     worrying the House with figures, we may 
     <lb/>
     take it as granted that this revenue is quite 
     <lb/>
     insignificant compared to the cost of survey<lb break="no"/>ing, settling and administering the lands. 
     <lb/>
     I say, Sir, that if these lands were in the 
     <lb/>
     future ofiered for sale, instead of being 
     <lb/>
     free, the Dominion government would hardly 
     <lb/>
     be justified in maintaining as it does, a cost<lb break="no"/>ly scheme of immigration at the general 
     <lb/>
     expense of the country, which would chiefly 
     <lb/>
     benefit the land speculators of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I claim, Sir, that the new provinces have 
     <lb/>
     received a generous, a liberal treatment 
     <lb/>
     at the hands of their government. The 
     <lb/>
     financial clauses of the Bill bear evidence 
     <lb/>
     of our generosity. What do they receive 
     <lb/>
     besides their autonomy? Each province 
     <lb/>
     at the very start-off will have in addition 
     <lb/>
     to the usual federal subventions, an income 
     <lb/>
     in lieu of its lands of $375,000. This amount 
     <lb/>
     will grow with the growth of population to 
     <lb/>
     $502,500 when either of the provinces has 
     <lb/>
     400,000 souls ; to $750,000 when it has 1,200,<lb break="no"/>000 souls, and when it exceeds that number, 
     <lb/>
     the payment will reach $1,125,000 yearly. 
     <lb/>
     In addition, interest will be paid on swamp 
     <lb/>
     lauds Valued at $4,250,000 which will in<lb break="no"/>crease eventually to a capital amount of 
     <lb/>
     $7,500,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Moreover, the Dominion will—and this 
     <lb/>
     fact should not be overlooked—still main<lb break="no"/>tain our corps of mounted police in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories—a maintenance which 
     <lb/>
     entails an annual cost of $300,000. Sir, I 
     <lb/>
     will not begrudge the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     the happy circumstances under which they 
     <lb/>
     assume their Political autonomy. This is 
     <lb/>
     not the time—and it is not in my nature to 
     <lb/>
     be envious. The prosperity, the happiness 
     <lb/>
     of my neighbour rejoices me; it never 
     <lb/>
     saddens me. But may I not pause for a 
     <lb/>
     moment and remind the House that the 
     <lb/>
     older provinces might well envy the fortune 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta and Saskatchewan? They, of 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
   

     their own volition, acquired the great lone 
     <lb/>
     land in 1870; they—patrlotically—pledged 
     <lb/>
     their credit for the construction of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Pacific Railway; they unreservedly 
     <lb/>
     launched themselves into a vast scheme of 
     <lb/>
     colonization in order to settle the prairies, 
     <lb/>
     Yet today, after thirty-five years of sacri<lb break="no"/>fices, saddled with their own obligations, 
     <lb/>
     cheerfully assess themselves again, to endow 
     <lb/>
     generously their two younger associates, in 
     <lb/>
     order to complete the gigantic work of con<lb break="no"/>federation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again I say that I do not begrudge the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories their good fortune. 
     <lb/>
     The ideal which we, as Canadians, pursue 
     <lb/>
     in this North American continent is too 
     <lb/>
     noble, too exalted, not to call for some 
     <lb/>
     sacrifices. The game is well worthy of the 
     <lb/>
     stake; the aspirations of Canada call 
     <lb/>
     forth our common efforts; the task of to<lb break="no"/>day is not unbecoming the attainments of 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow. In the language of the poet: 
     <lb/>

            </p></quote>

            <p>I have now reached, Sir, the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses of the Bill—which, in the present 
     <lb/>
     instances, might well be termed the crucial 
     <lb/>
     clauses if one can judge by the storm— 
     <lb/>
     nay, by the tornado they have raised in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. Political agitation is always 
     <lb/>
     fraught with danger even ina country where 
     <lb/>
     one race alone is dominant, but, Sir, far 
     <lb/>
     more dangerous is a religious agitation in 
     <lb/>
     a country like Canada, where two races 
     <lb/>
     and two creeds are staring at each other. 
     <lb/>
     Experience has taught us how easy it is to 
     <lb/>
     inflame religious passions and how difficult 
     <lb/>
     to quell them. Yet, it seems as if this sad 
     <lb/>
     experiment was to be renewed periodically 
     <lb/>
     in this fair land of ours. As a Canadian, I 
     <lb/>
     deplore the intolerant spirit which of late 
     <lb/>
     has pervaded spheres, where one would ex<lb break="no"/>pect Christian charity, broad-mindedness, 
     <lb/>
     tair-play, to inhabit. After the bitterness 
     <lb/>
     displayed from one end of the country 
     <lb/>
     to the other on this school question, after 
     <lb/>
     the abuse heaped upon one particular class 
     <lb/>
     of His Majesty's loyal subjects, I fear 
     <lb/>
     not to say, Sir, that unless reason and wise 
     <lb/>
     counsels prevail, the future of this con<lb break="no"/>federation is doomed and the cause of union 
     <lb/>
     buried for ever. Well might we apply to the 
     <lb/>
     present situation the prophetic word of 
     <lb/>
     Thlers when the 2nd empire was on the eve 
     <lb/>
     of crumbling to pieces : Il n'y a plus qu'une 
     <lb/>
     seule faute à commettre ........ 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I fail to understand, Sir, why the edu<lb break="no"/>cational clauses have roused such anger 
     <lb/>
     amongst men who, by their calling in life, 
     <lb/>
     should be specially guarded against any 
     <lb/>
     display of temper. I quite agree with you 
     <lb/>
     that there are firebrands who delight in see<lb break="no"/>ing the country ablaze, but I am not refer<lb break="no"/>ring to the professional demagogues. I am 
     <lb/>
     addressing myself to that honest yet credu<lb break="no"/>lous class of people, whose sleep is haunted 
     <lb/>
     by nightmares, and who—once led astray— 
     <lb/>

     talk of rebellion instead of constitution. And 
     <lb/>
     yet, Sir, that matter or rather this difficulty 
     <lb/>
     is purely a constitutional one. It is in the 
     <lb/>
     light of our constitution that the question 
     <lb/>
     must be examined. To look at it from any 
     <lb/>
    other point of view is to err and to quibble. 
     <lb/>According to the British North America Act 
     <lb/>has the minority in the Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies any rights to a system of separate 
     <lb/>schools ? This is, in my judgment the only 
     <lb/>question to be decided. But before I answer 
     <lb/>it, let me, Sir, add a few missing links to 
     <lb/>a chapter of the history of the Northwest 
     <lb/>Territories. I do so, in no hostile spirit, 
     <lb/>I am only refreshing the memory of some 
     <lb/>Canadians who are too apt to forget. Sir, 
     <lb/>in the early part of the 18th century—nay 
     <lb/>even in the 17th century, the explorers of 
     <lb/>the Northwest were men of my race. La 
     <lb/>Verendrye and his sons, were the first 
     <lb/>Europeans who climbed up the Rocky moun<lb break="no"/>tains. The French missionaries soon found 
     <lb/>their way towards those distant lands to 
     <lb/>preach the Gospel to the Indian tribes. The 
     <lb/>fur traders, the voyageurs, the trappeurs 
     <lb/>and coureurs des bois followed—filling the 
     <lb/>early history of these vast domains with 
     <lb/>their adventurous yet heroic exploits. Not 
     <lb/>a river, not a lake, not a hill, not a valley 
     <lb/>that was not discovered by them. One has 
     <lb/>only to read carefully the deed of transfer 
     <lb/>of Ruperts land to Canada in 1870, to realize 
     <lb/>that nearly all the posts of the Hudson 
     <lb/>Bay Company, in the far west, bear most 
     <lb/>picturesque French names. After the con<lb break="no"/>quest, when the Hudson Bay company took 
     <lb/>full possession of that immense territory, 
     <lb/>the French Canadian element continued to 
     <lb/>be an important factor in the affiairs of the 
     <lb/>west. So much so, that the Bishop of 
     <lb/>Quebec, whose diocese included all British 
     <lb/>North America decided to send missionaries 
     <lb/>in those distant regions. By referring to 
     <lb/>the archives of the Quebec Archbishopric, 
     <lb/>one will see that in 1818, the first school in 
     <lb/>the Northwest Territories was established 
     <lb/>at the request of Monseigneur Plessis, Sir 
     <lb/>John Cope Sherbrooke was then our Gover<lb break="no"/>nor and it is under his protection that the 
     <lb/>three missionaries sent by Monseigneur 
     <lb/>Plessis entered the Northwest. The instruc<lb break="no"/>tions of Governor Sherbrooke, given in writ<lb break="no"/>ing, are well worth reading.

     there as marauders. The object of their

     Now, before I refer to the legislation of 
     <lb/>
     1871 and 1875, let me examine this section 
     <lb/>
     93 of the British North America Act. First 
     <lb/>
     of all. I would like to say that the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the government has been taunted 
     <lb/>
     by many hon. gentlemen opposite and by the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative press throughout the country, 
     <lb/>
     because, forsooth, he had given us a page 
     <lb/>
     of history in explaining to the House, as 
     <lb/>
     he did on the 21st February last, when he 
     <lb/>
     introduced this measure, how that clause 
     <lb/>
     came to be inserted in the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. Now, it is usual, when we 
     <lb/>
     have legislation of a somewhat complicated 
     <lb/>
     character, as this is, to go to the root of that 
     <lb/>
     legislation and to inquire under what cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances it was enacted. There is, there<lb break="no"/>fore, nothing extraordinary in the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. leader of the government 
     <lb/>
     should have explained the peculiar circum<lb break="no"/>stances under which that clause 93 was en<lb break="no"/>acted. In the case of the St. Catharines 
     <lb/>
     Milling and Lumber Company versus the 
     <lb/>
     Queen, Mr. Justice Strong, in giving his 
     <lb/>
     judgment, used these words :

     Sir Oliver Mowat was defending the rights

     Therefore, I say that the right hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of this government was right in going back 
     <lb/>
     to the history of confederation, to the origin 
     <lb/>
     of clause 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, in order that he might the better 
     <lb/>
     interpret it as the basis of the present mea<lb break="no"/>sure. We know, from the history he gave 
     <lb/>
     this House, that if clause 93 was embalmed 
     <lb/>
     in the constitution of this country it was at 
     <lb/>
     the request of the Protestant minority of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. Now, Sir, I may 
     <lb/>
     say at once that it was not necessary to 
     <lb/>
     embalm that principle of religious equality 
     <lb/>
     in the constitution. If we examine the 
     <lb/>
     words of Sir John Rose, in the confedera<lb break="no"/>tion debates, one may easily see that the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant minority of the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec did not require the enactment of clause 
     <lb/>
     93 in the British North America Act. Here 
     <lb/>
     is the statement made by Sir John Rose :

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     Now, we the English Protestant minority of

     right of separate education we have, was ac<lb break="no"/>corded to us in the most unrestricted way 
     <lb/>
     before the union of the provinces, when we 
     <lb/>
     were in a minority and entirely in the hands

     of the French population. We cannot forget 
     <lb/>
     that in no way was there any attempt to pre<lb break="no"/>vent us educating our children in the manner

     <lb/>
     untrue to what is just, if I forgot to state that 
     <lb/>
     the distribution of state funds for educational 
     <lb/>
     purposes was made in such a way as to cause

     That was the statement made by Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Rose at the time of confederation. There<lb break="no"/>fore, I say that in the light of this testimony 
     <lb/>
     it was not even necessary for the minority 
     <lb/>
     to exact the enactment of that clause 93. 
     <lb/>
     Nevertheless, Sir A. T. Galt, in fulfilment of 
     <lb/>
     the pledge given to the Protestant minority 
     <lb/>
     of Lower Canada, went to London and had 
     <lb/>
     that clause inserted in our constitution. 
     <lb/>
     Now, the first question which presents itself 
     <lb/>
     is that which has been treated this after<lb break="no"/>noon by my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bourassa), namely, does this clause 93 apply 
     <lb/>
     to Quebec and Ontario only, or does it apply 
     <lb/>
     to all the provinces ? My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Labelle has cited the opinion of Lord Car<lb break="no"/>narvon. I will not weary the House by 
     <lb/>
     giving the quotation again, but I will only 
     <lb/>
     quote a few words. Lord Carnarvon, in 
     <lb/>
     1866, used the following language :

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The object of this clause is to secure to the

     It is not so—on the contrary, it is limited.

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
       By this section 146 the Dominion was to take 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Newfoundland, Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island and British Columbia, and also it 
     <lb/>
     was assumed Rupert's Land and the Northwest

     Territories would be acquired, and would be 
     <lb/>
     ultimately divided into provinces, just as the 
     <lb/>
     Northwestern Territories had been divided into 
     <lb/>
     states. And provision was made for taking in 
     <lb/>
     these various provinces, and accordingly they

     were taken in, British Columbia first, if my 
     <lb/>
    memory serves right, in 1871, and then Prince  
     <lb/>Edward Island. This clause (section 93) was 
     <lb/>made applicable to British Columbia and Prince 
     <lb/>Edward Island, but in neither of these provinces 
     <lb/>were there any denominational rights, nor has 
     <lb/>it been so pretended, in respect of schools to

     And now, as to the contention that sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 applies only to the four original 
     <lb/>
     provinces, or, as some contend, only to the 
     <lb/>
     two provinces of Ontario and Quebec, let 
     <lb/>
     me state what occurred in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island. That province came 
     <lb/>
     into confederation in the year 1873. Al<lb break="no"/>though the delegates met at Charlottetown, 
     <lb/>
     although they had debated the union in 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, yet in 1867 that 
     <lb/>
     province declared that she would not join 
     <lb/>
     confederation, and she did not join at that 
     <lb/>
     date. Before 1873, there had existed in 
     <lb/>
     that province a system of public schools. 
     <lb/>
     and side by side with it had grown 
     <lb/>
     up a system of separate schools. There 
     <lb/>
     were French schools in several parishes, 
     <lb/>
     and in 1875 an Act was passed by 
     <lb/>
     the local legislature of Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land, abolishing the separate schools system. 
     <lb/>
     An appeal was made to the Governor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral in Council. On that appeal it was ad<lb break="no"/>mitted by the appellants, the Roman Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic minority, and by the respondents, 
     <lb/>
     the local legislature, that although Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island had joined confederation 
     <lb/>
     only in 1873, clause 93 applied, and the late 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Rodolphe Laflamme, who was then 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice, submitted a lengthy re<lb break="no"/>port, in which he said that clause 93 could 
     <lb/>
     not be of any avail to the minority in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Prince Edward Island, because 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
         

     the system of separate schools had grown up 
     <lb/>
     illegally by the side of the public schools 
     <lb/>
     system. There was no legislation to war<lb break="no"/>rant it, and therefore clause 93 could be of 
     <lb/>
     no avail.

            <p>
     But we are told by Mr. Haultain and a 
     <lb/>
     portion of the press that what may apply 
     <lb/>
     to a province does not apply to a territory. 
     <lb/>
     This is indeed a very fine and very subtle 
     <lb/>
     distinction. Mr. Haultain's objection is 
     <lb/>
     not serious. That it is only sophistry is 
     <lb/>
     quite obvious. In 1871, doubts had arisen  
     <lb/>
     as to the right of the federal parliament to 
     <lb/>
     establish provinces out of the Territories ad<lb break="no"/>mitted in the union. The imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment then passed a statute amending the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act in order to re<lb break="no"/>move any such doubts. What does section 
     <lb/>
     2 of that Act declare ? Our parliament was 
     <lb/>
     authorized

      I claim that by the clear and concise en<lb break="no"/>actment I have just quoted, ample authority 
     <lb/>
      was given this parliament to frame a con<lb break="no"/>stitution for the Territories. Mr. Haultain's 
     <lb/>
     interpretation of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act is this one : He wishes to date the en<lb break="no"/>try into confederation of the two new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces back to July 15, 1870—because, for<lb break="no"/>sooth, at that time there was no system of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools established by law—such 
     <lb/>
     as there is under the law of 1875 and un<lb break="no"/>der the ordinances 29, 30, 31. As section 
     <lb/>
     93 of the British North America Act does 
     <lb/>
     not mention Territories, but provinces. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain concludes that it cannot benefit 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces. But the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     cannot alter facts. Territories were ad<lb break="no"/>mitted in the union in 1870. But in 1905 we 
     <lb/>
     admit provinces—according to section 2 of 
     <lb/>
     the imperial statute of 1871. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is only this year that this Bill will be 
     <lb/>
     in force; it is only on the first of July next 
     <lb/>
     that the Northwest Territories will join the 
     <lb/>
     union as provinces, and therefore the legis<lb break="no"/>lation enacted in 1875 by this parliament 
     <lb/>
     granting a system of separate schools, can 
     <lb/>
     be retained by the present legislation. I 
     <lb/>
     could cite the ablest authorities on the Am<lb break="no"/>erican constitution, Cooley, Randolph Tuck<lb break="no"/>er, Sutherland, and others, to show that 
     <lb/>
     when the Territories are acquired they do 
     <lb/>
     not become states, and so it is with our own 
     <lb/>
     Territories. When they were purchased by 
     <lb/>
     Canada they did not become full-fledged pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. And how did these Territories come 
     <lb/>
     into Canada ? We are aware that there was 
     <lb/>
     some doubt expressed as to the validity of 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1870. Some people believed that 
     <lb/>
     we could not carve provinces out of these 
     <lb/>
     Territories, and therefore Sir John Macdon<lb break="no"/>ald, who was Prime Minister, applied to 
     <lb/>
     the imperial authorities to have the legis<lb break="no"/>lation of 1870 confirmed by an imperial 
     <lb/>
     statute. It is well to refer to the memoran<lb break="no"/>

     Sir, if there is a redeeming feature in the

     present debate for the partisans of the sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools system, it is the fact that in 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain, in the mother country, there 
     <lb/>
     is also a system whereby denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools are state aided. Yes, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     in England, the country wherefrom we bor<lb break="no"/>rowed our parliamentary institutions; in 
     <lb/>
     England, wherefrom we borrowed a constitu<lb break="no"/>tion; in England, minorities enjoy their full 
     <lb/>
     liberty in matters of education. I, a Can<lb break="no"/>adian and a Roman Catholic, am proud to 
     <lb/>
     cite this example of tolerance given by our 
     <lb/>
     mother country. I ask my friend from Grey 
     <lb/>
     would he be in Canada less generous, less 
     <lb/>
     tolerant than the average English Protestant 
     <lb/>
     in England ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I need not refer at any length to the 
     <lb/>
     history of the school question in England. 
     <lb/>
     But I may say at the outset that the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the House is not the only 
     <lb/>
     statesman who has had to face grave dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties with regard to an Educational Bill. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, the greatest of all modern British 
     <lb/>
     statesmen has also had his hours of anxiety 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
          

     when in 1870 he attempted to legislate up<lb break="no"/>on a similar question. Mr. Gladstone lost 
     <lb/>
     many a warm friend, many a firm support<lb break="no"/>er, when he introduced the Educational 
     <lb/>
     Bill of 1870. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For years, I might say for centuries, 
     <lb/>
     there had been in England a system of na<lb break="no"/>tional schools. But there were many sects, 
     <lb/>
     many creeds in England, and it was felt 
     <lb/>
     that it would be a violation of the principle 
     <lb/>
     of religious liberty if the dissenters were 
     <lb/>
     forced to send their children to schools, 
     <lb/>
     the religious teaching of which was not in 
     <lb/>
     conformity with their views. So, by the 
     <lb/>
     side of national schools, grew up a system 
     <lb/>
     of voluntary schools—that is to say, sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools—where the dissenters of all 
     <lb/>
     sects and denominations sent their child<lb break="no"/>ren. The secular teaching did not differ 
     <lb/>
     much from that of the national schools; but 
     <lb/>
     the religious teaching given the children 
     <lb/>
     was in accordance with the tenets of the 
     <lb/>
     parents' faith. Catholics, Wesleyans, Quak<lb break="no"/>ers established all over the realm voluntary 
     <lb/>
     schools. So much so, that a time came 
     <lb/>
     when more children frequented the volun<lb break="no"/>tary schools than the national schools. The 
     <lb/>
     board schools were state aided; the volun<lb break="no"/>tary schools were self-sustaining. There 
     <lb/>
     were in England, as there are in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, partisans of the neutral school. There 
     <lb/>
     were also men who thought that the child<lb break="no"/>ren had a right to a religious teaching ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the religious belief of their par<lb break="no"/>ents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Such was the opinion of Mr. Gladstone. 
     <lb/>
     Such was also the opinion of Lord Salis<lb break="no"/>bury. Let me quote, Mr. Speaker, the opin<lb break="no"/>ion of those two great British statesmen.

     Sir, as I said a minute ago, the first im<lb break="no"/>portant Bill in relation to education in 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain was introduced in 1870. For 
     <lb/>
     the first time parliament passed a measure 
     <lb/>
     making provision for a 'sufficient, efficient 
     <lb/>
     and suitable' elementary education; but 
     <lb/>
     mark well, it was understood that the work 
     <lb/>
     of efficient voluntary schools should not be 
     <lb/>
     hampered, but that their efforts should be 
     <lb/>
     supplemented. In those days there were 
     <lb/>
     men like my hon. friend from Grey who 
     <lb/>
     opposed denominational Schools. Here is 
     <lb/>
     the answer which Mr. Gladstone gave to 
     <lb/>
     their opposition: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Can it be said that the prevalence of denom<lb break="no"/>inationalism in those schools at the present 
     <lb/>
     moment is generally felt to be a grievance ? 
     <lb/>
     On the contrary, is it not the case that every<lb break="no"/>body and every section are telling us con<lb break="no"/>tinually that the religious difficulty directly 
     <lb/>
     you came to practice becomes insignificant, 
     <lb/>
     and that it is a difficulty made for parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and for debate rather than on which 
     <lb/>
     would be felt within the walls of the schools ? 
     <lb/>
     Now I come to denominational, or as I shall 
     <lb/>
     call them, voluntary schools and if I am told 
     <lb/>
     that an overwhelming majority of voluntary 
     <lb/>
     schools are denominational, I think I can draw 
     <lb/>
     a lesson from that fact, which is that it shows 
     <lb/>
     what a powerful agency we have to do our bid<lb break="no"/>ding, to perform much of our work for us, if 
     <lb/>
     only we will not obstruct it. We are as much 
     <lb/>
     convinced as he is that with respect to these 
     <lb/>
     voluntary schools, the duty of the state is to 
     <lb/>
     make use of them for the purposes of secular 
     <lb/>
     instruction which they give, but to hold itself 
     <lb/>
     entirely and absolutely detached from all re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility with regard to their religious teach<lb break="no"/>ing. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     This was, Sir, the opinion of Mr. Glad<lb break="no"/>stone with regard to denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools. But I explained a moment ago, 
     <lb/>
     though the voluntary schools were toler<lb break="no"/>ated—they were self-sustaining, whilst the 
     <lb/>
     other schools were state aided. I shall not 
     <lb/>
     refer to the school legislation which since 
     <lb/>
     1870 was passed by the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. I come immediately to the Edu<lb break="no"/>cation Act of 1902, an Act passed by the 
     <lb/>
     Balfour government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Balfour has himself, in a few words 
     <lb/>
     described what reforms were brought about 
     <lb/>
     by the Bill : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Our reform, if it is to be adequate, must, in 
     <lb/>
     the first place, establish one authority of 
     <lb/>
     education—technical, secondary, primary—pos<lb break="no"/>sessed of powers which may enable it to 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
      

     provide for the adequate training of teachers, 
     <lb/>
     &amp;c. In the second place, I conclude that this 
     <lb/>
     one authority for education, being, as it is, 
     <lb/>
     responsible for a heavy cost to the ratepayers, 
     <lb/>
     should be the rating authority of the district. 
     <lb/>
     In the 3rd place, I lay down that the voluntary 
     <lb/>
     schools must be placed in a position in which 
     <lb/>
     they can worthily play their necessary and in<lb break="no"/>evitable part in the scheme of national educa<lb break="no"/>tion.

            <p>
     Therefore, Mr. Speaker, the object, one 
     <lb/>
     of the objects of the Bill was to include in 
     <lb/>
     the national school system the voluntary 
     <lb/>
     schools. The Bill became law and to-day, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, you have in England, a system of de<lb break="no"/>nominational state-aided schools. Of course, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, this law gave rise to a great 
     <lb/>
     opposition amongst a certain class of peo<lb break="no"/>ple. In England, as in Canada, the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment lost many of its friends. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Balfour and his colleagues were assailed. 
     <lb/>
     They were denounced as being ' under the 
     <lb/>

     You have, Sir, in the few lines I have

     just read, an idea of the campaign of vitu<lb break="no"/>peration to which the government was sub<lb break="no"/>jected in England. I find in those im<lb break="no"/>passionate appeals, a certain relationship

     on one side as of an antiquated pattern and

     <lb/>
     education, the normal machinery for education 
     <lb/>
     required alike by the parent and by the com<lb break="no"/>munity, is the voluntary school. I do not say

     there ought not to be—I have no attack to 
     <lb/>
     make on—a school board system. We require 
     <lb/>
     to deal with these questions, one who 
     <lb/>
     will look at them from a broader standpoint, 
     <lb/>
     who will feel that, outside the question of 
     <lb/>
     grants and the question of classes there are 
     <lb/>
     other issues to be decided, other interests to 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     Education Minister as but very imperfectly 
     <lb/>
     accomplished if he does not do all in his power 
     <lb/>
     to foster every influence which may mould, not 
     <lb/>
     merely the children committed to his care, not 
     <lb/>
     merely these subjects of secular learning— 
     <lb/>
     which may not advance their happiness in life 
     <lb/>
     —but these larger questions, the sense of these

     greater issues, necessary, as I must firmly

     believe, to the well-being of every community

     It seems to me, Sir, that the opinions of 
     <lb/>
     the leaders of public opinion in the British 
     <lb/>
     empire have on such a grave issue, more 
     <lb/>
     weight than that of the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     from East Grey (Mr. Sproule).

            <p>
     But, Sir, my friend from Grey (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule) has triumphantly referred to France 
     <lb/>
     in his address of Thursday last. Church 
     <lb/>
     schools have been abolished in France, ex<lb break="no"/>claimed my friend, because forsooth they 
     <lb/>
     had produced illiterates, and to remedy 
     <lb/>
     that state of things the government has 
     <lb/>
     established a system of neutral schools. 
     <lb/>
     True it is, Sir, that in France the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is seeking to suppress denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools. But What has been the result ? 
     <lb/>
     Does not my hon. friend read the papers ? 
     <lb/>
     The government which suppressed the 
     <lb/>
     schools, which exiled the religious orders, 
     <lb/>
     denounced the Concordat—that government 
     <lb/>
     has been also suppressed, yes suppressed 
     <lb/>
     after many a tumult, many an uprising of 
     <lb/>
     all liberty-lovers in France. The movement 
     <lb/>
     against that act of the French government 
     <lb/>
     was not started by the illiterates ; it was 
     <lb/>
     organized by whom ? By members of the 
     <lb/>
     Academie Francaise, by men like Francois 
     <lb/>
     Coppée, Jules Lemaitre, Brunetiere—by men 
     <lb/>
     of all parties, of all creeds; aye, by free 
     <lb/>
     thinkers, by French Protestants like Mons. 
     <lb/>
     de Pressense, one of the most eminent 
     <lb/>
     French writers of the day. These men are 
     <lb/>
     all united, and they have published a mani<lb break="no"/>festo protesting against the policy of the

     from Grey that he is greatly mistaken if he 
     <lb/>
     really believes that the denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools in France have produced a race of 
     <lb/>
     illiterates. Surely, Mr. Speaker, the land of 
     <lb/>
     Racine, of Moliere, of Corneille, of Bossuet, 
     <lb/>
     is not a land of illiterates ? Surely the 
     <lb/>
     schools and the lycees which have produced 
     <lb/>
     men like Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Thiers 
     <lb/>
     and Guizot, were not mere hotbeds of ignor<lb break="no"/>ance and cretinism ! The hon. gentleman, in 
     <lb/>
     his endeavour to give the public schools a 
     <lb/>
     superiority over the denominational schools, 
     <lb/>
     might have spared his French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     friends in the House his untimely refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the so-called illiteracy of French<lb break="no"/>men. For my part, Sir, I am a British sub<lb break="no"/>ject, and an admirer of the British institu<lb break="no"/>tions. I may add that, politically speaking, 
     <lb/>
     I am more at home in London than in Paris 
     <lb/>
     —that my ideals in politics are at West<lb break="no"/>minster, not at the Palais Bourbon ; yet no 
     <lb/>
     one will ever deny—I for one will never do 
     <lb/>
     so—that in literature and in fine arts, France 
     <lb/>
     is second to no other nation in the world. 
     <lb/>
     But if France is still, at the beginning of 
     <lb/>
     this twentieth century, the leading nation of 
     <lb/>
     the world in the field of literature and fine 
     <lb/>
     arts, she has nothing to regret of the teach<lb break="no"/>ings given to her sons in the old church

     Reference has been made during this de<lb break="no"/>bate to the American settlers in the west. 
     <lb/>
     We are told that we must have public 
     <lb/>
     schools, because the settlers happen to 
     <lb/>
     come from across the boundary line, where 
     <lb/>
     a system of public schools exists. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, we must ignore the spirit and the 
     <lb/>
     letter of our constitution because the Ameri<lb break="no"/>cans are coming to our country. I shall 
     <lb/>
     not discuss the school system as it exists 
     <lb/>
     in the United States, but I have enough 
     <lb/>
     pride in the institutions of my country to 
     <lb/>
     believe that our system is not inferior to 
     <lb/>
     theirs. I have enough patriotism to stand 
     <lb/>
     by the rights of a Canadian minority, even 
     <lb/>
     if it does not suit the American settlers. 
     <lb/>
     And I am amazed, Sir, to see the ultra

     <lb/>

     state of the union. I do not object to that ; 
     <lb/>
     but, in the name of common sense and for 
     <lb/>
     our own dignity, let us not trample upon 
     <lb/>
     our own constitution because it happens to 
     <lb/>
     please these people.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, it has been suggested in the course 
     <lb/>
     of this debate that the Northwest Act of 
     <lb/>
     1875 provided only for a temporary state 
     <lb/>
     of things. There is no such declaration in 
     <lb/>
     the Act. Let me say, Sir, that the men who 
     <lb/>
     enacted that law had taken part in the 
     <lb/>
     battle for confederation. They knew what 
     <lb/>
     had been the stumbling block of the union 
     <lb/>
     and what compromise had been reached. 
     <lb/>
     They, therefore, deliberately pledged the 
     <lb/>
     faith, the honour of parliament, that as 
     <lb/>
     long as there would be a Catholic minority 
     <lb/>
     in the west it would be entitled to its 
     <lb/>
     schools. Thirty years have elapsed since 
     <lb/>
     1875. The separate school system has been 
     <lb/>
     adopted, and to-day we are told that those 
     <lb/>
     who have settled in the west with that 
     <lb/>
     guarantee should do without it. The Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1875 was passed under Mr. Mackenzie's 
     <lb/>
     government, and it was supported by Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Macdonald. It was amended in 1882 
     <lb/>
     under a Conservative administration, and 
     <lb/>
     the separate school system was maintained. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Remember, Mr. Speaker, that in the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish empire, if there was some sympathy for 
     <lb/>
     the Uitlanders, it was because it was as<lb break="no"/>serted that President Kruger had not kept 
     <lb/>
     faith with them. In 1880 President Kruger 
     <lb/>
     went to London, and he then invited immi<lb break="no"/>gration to the Transvaal, promising the im<lb break="no"/>migrants full citizenship. I have read 
     <lb/>
     several books on the South African war, 
     <lb/>
     and in them I found that the chief cause 
     <lb/>
     of the war was the lack of faith of Kruger 
     <lb/>in his stringent naturalization laws. Sir, 
     <lb/>laws concerning education are also with us 
     <lb/>fundamental laws. We enjoy religious 
     <lb/>liberty in Canada. Religious education is 
     <lb/>to a large degree considered essential by 
     <lb/>Roman Catholics. Why then should we 
     <lb/>deprive them of their right to schools ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, we are told, those of us 
     <lb/>
     who favour this measure, that we should 
     <lb/>
     trust the western people. Such is the lan<lb break="no"/>guage of the 'Globe', such is the language 
     <lb/>
     of the Toronto 'News.' For my part, I 
     <lb/>
     would trust, and I do trust, the western 
     <lb/>
     people as well as the eastern people ; but 
     <lb/>
     the present issue has been made a religious 
     <lb/>
     one. The protests which have been made 
     <lb/>
     from the pulpit, the petitions which have 
     <lb/>
     been sent to this House, all bear the mark 
     <lb/>
     of religion. We have had petitions from 
     <lb/>
     the Orange Order, from the Baptists, the 
     <lb/>
     Presbyterians, the Methodists ; and there 
     <lb/>
     is between the opponents of the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools and the opponents of the public 
     <lb/>
     schools such a wide breach that, if left to 
     <lb/>
     the popular vote in the west, it would be 
     <lb/>
     impossible to bridge the difficulty. Those 
     <lb/>
     who sincerely believe in the separate school 
     <lb/>
     system would soon come to grief, because 
     <lb/>
     their opponents are unquestionably the 
     <lb/>
     majority. Besides the opposition to the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools seems to be doctrinal, and 
     <lb/>
     I do not see how you could reconcile both 
     <lb/>

     Having those figures in hand, I find that 
     <lb/>
     there is a majority against the system of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools of 11,955 in comparing the 
     <lb/>
     relative strength of the two factions. Under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances, and in the interest of 
     <lb/>
     peace and harmony, do you not believe that 
     <lb/>
     it is far better to settle the difficulty at once, 
     <lb/>
     by an honourable compromise satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     to all those who believe in moderation and 
     <lb/>
     fair-play ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have been told the other day by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) 
     <lb/>
     that the Catholics of the United States were 
     <lb/>
     paying something like fifty million dollars 
     <lb/>
     per year, in order to have their separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. Is it not far better to enact the 
     <lb/>
     present legislation, which, although giving 
     <lb/>
     the minority their right to religious teaching 
     <lb/>
     of their own, brings their schools to the 
     <lb/>
     standard of the public schools system in 
     <lb/>
     secular matters ? If you were to refuse 
     <lb/>
     them what they are getting by the ordin<lb break="no"/>ances, they would be left to their own pri<lb break="no"/>vate resources ; they would be self-sustain<lb break="no"/>ing. How could they compete with the 
     <lb/>
     state-aided public schools ? What interest 
     <lb/>
     have you to starve them ? Surely the half 
     <lb/>
     hour of religious instruction should not de<lb break="no"/>bar the Catholics from government assist<lb break="no"/>ance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I ask any fair-minded Protestant if he 
     <lb/>
     believes, in his heart and conscience, that 
     <lb/>
     my son can be taught history, for instance, 
     <lb/>
     in the same book as his son ? Is it possible 
     <lb/>
     for an honest Protestant and an honest 
     <lb/>
     Catholic to think alike, and to see in the 
     <lb/>
     same light any of the historical events con<lb break="no"/>nected with say, the Reformation, Mary 
     <lb/>
     Stuart, Henry VIII, Queen Mary, John Knox 
     <lb/>
     or Thomas Beckett ? Are there not, on such 
     <lb/>
     questions, deep differences which it is al<lb break="no"/>most impossible to reconcile ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are told that this legislation is an 
     <lb/>
     infringement on what is called provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights. As a consistent Liberal, I claim 
     <lb/>
     myself to be an upholder of such rights. 
     <lb/>
     After the battles fought by the late Sir 
     <lb/>
     Oliver Mowat and by the Hon. Edward 
     <lb/>
     Blake, we on this side of the House cannot 
     <lb/>
     but defend the rights of the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     But, as I have already demonstrated, the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the provinces are clearly defined 
     <lb/>
     by section 92 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act. Section 93 gives also the federal par<lb break="no"/>liament a jurisdiction on matters of educa<lb break="no"/>tion. At the time of the Equal Rights move<lb break="no"/>ment, when parliament was asked too to dis<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
        
allow the Jesuits' Estate Act, we too invoked 
     <lb/>
     provincial rights, and we were answered 
     <lb/>
     by the late leader of that campaign, the late 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Dalton McCarthy, as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The worship of what was called local auton<lb break="no"/>omy, which some gentlemen have become ad<lb break="no"/>dicted to, is fraught, I venture to say, with 
     <lb/>
     great evils to this Dominion. Our allegiance 
     <lb/>
     is due to the Dominion of Canada. The separa<lb break="no"/>tion into provinces, the right of local self-gov<lb break="no"/>ernment which we possess, is not to make us 
     <lb/>
     less citizens of the Dominion, is not to make us 
     <lb/>
     less anxious for the promotion and welfare of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, and it is no argument to say 
     <lb/>
     that, because a certain piece of legislation is 
     <lb/>
     within the power of a local parliament, there<lb break="no"/>fore the legislation is not to be disturbed. By 
     <lb/>
     the  same Act of parliament by which the 
     <lb/>
     power is conferred upon the local legislature, 
     <lb/>
     the duty and power—because where there is 
     <lb/>
     a power there is a corresponding duty—are cast 
     <lb/>
     upon the Governor in Council to revise, and re<lb break="no"/>view, the Acts of the legislative bodies. If you 
     <lb/>
     are to say that because a law has been passed 
     <lb/>
     within the legislative authority of the province, 
     <lb/>
     therefore it must remain, we can easily see, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, that before long these provinces, instead 
     <lb/>
     of coming nearer together, will go further and 
     <lb/>
     further apart. We can see that the only way 
     <lb/>
     of making a united Canada, and building up a 
     <lb/>
     national life and sentiment in the Dominion, is 
     <lb/>
     by seeing that the laws of one province are not 
     <lb/>
     offensive to the laws and institutions, and it 
     <lb/>
     may be to the feelings, of another—I will go so 
     <lb/>
     far as to say that they must be to some extent 
     <lb/>
     taken into consideration.

            <p>
     I have quoted the above extract in order 
     <lb/>
     to show that the principle of provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights is not always adhered to by those 
     <lb/>
     who are quite ready, when circumstances 
     <lb/>
     arise, to invoke it. Let me, however, give 
     <lb/>
     the opinion on this subject of one of the 
     <lb/>
     fathers of confederation. In an address to 
     <lb/>
     his constituents, October, .1864, Sir A. T. 
     <lb/>
     Galt said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     It was clear that in confiding the general 
     <lb/>
     subject of education to the local legislatures, 
     <lb/>
     it was absolutely necessary it should be ac<lb break="no"/>companied with such restrictions as would pre<lb break="no"/>vent injustice in any respect from being done 
     <lb/>
     to the minority. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now this applied to Lower Canada, but it 
     <lb/>
     also applied, with equal force, to Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada and the other provinces, for in Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada there was a Protestant minority, and in the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces a Catholic minority. The same 
     <lb/>
     privileges belong of right here, as belonged to 
     <lb/>
     the other right elsewhere. There could be no 
     <lb/>
     greater injustice to a population than to com<lb break="no"/>pel them to have their children educated in a 
     <lb/>
     manner contrary to their own religious belief.

            <p>
     Therefore, I say, Sir, that I am within 
     <lb/>
     the scope of provincial rights in asking that 
     <lb/>
     this parliament should protect the minority 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest. But, there is some<lb break="no"/>thing else than provincial rights. We, the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party, stand for provincial rights. 
     <lb/>
     That was the policy of our old leader, Alex<lb break="no"/>ander Mackenzie; it was the policy of Sir 
     <lb/>
     Oliver Mowat; it was the policy of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Edward Blake. It is still the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party. But, Sir, with provincial 
     <lb/>

     rights there are other rights which are 
     <lb/>
     under the care and protection of the Reform 
     <lb/>
     party. These are the rights of the min<lb break="no"/>ority of whom Mr. Edward Blake once 
     <lb/>
     said in this House that it should be given 
     <lb/>
     not only a fair measure, but an abun<lb break="no"/>dant, an overheaping measure of justice. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, I shall not refer to the hierarchy 
     <lb/>
     and the Quebec ecclesiastics. I think this 
     <lb/>
     question has been threshed out in the mas<lb break="no"/>terly speeches of both my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) and of my friend 
     <lb/>
     from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). I do not wish 
     <lb/>
     to pose as the defender of the Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic clergy in this House. As a Liberal, I 
     <lb/>
     have, during the few years that I have 
     <lb/>
     been in public life felt at times the inter<lb break="no"/>ference of the clergy in politics. I will 
     <lb/>
     say nothing however in condemnation of 
     <lb/>
     the clergy of my province, as they acted 
     <lb/>
     within their rights as citizens, but I can say 
     <lb/>
     this, that the history of the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     clergy in this country is its best vindication. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) 
     <lb/>
     recalled what has taken place in 1774 and 
     <lb/>
     in 1812. I will invite the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who spoke the other day, the member from 
     <lb/>
     East Grey (Mr. Sproule) to come to Mon<lb break="no"/>treal. I shall ask him to pass with me 
     <lb/>
     along Notre Dame street at the seminary 
     <lb/>
     of St. Sulpice. He will see there, an old 
     <lb/>
     gate and an old sun dial. I will remind him 
     <lb/>
     that in 1774 the American rebels despatched 
     <lb/>
     to Montreal a young ecclesiastic, who later 
     <lb/>
     on became Bishop of Baltimore. That young 
     <lb/>
     ecclesiastic passed under that historic gate 
     <lb/>
     in order to ask the old French priests, the 
     <lb/>
     Sulpicians, to induce their flocks to join the 
     <lb/>
     American rebels. Sir, what was the answer 
     <lb/>
     given by the superior of the Sulpicians ? 
     <lb/>
     There at that very gate near the old sun 
     <lb/>
     dial ? Carroll, who had been despatched 
     <lb/>
     here by Lafayette and Washington was 
     <lb/>
     answered by the old superior that he could 
     <lb/>
     not stay one hour more in the country, 
     <lb/>
     that he would not be allowed to induce the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians to become rebels to His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty's government. This is only one of 
     <lb/>
     the chapters of the history of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic clergy in my province.

     Blake the words uttered by the Archbishop 
     <lb/>
     of Canterbury who visited this Dominion 
     <lb/>
     last fall. Speaking in Quebec in that old 
     <lb/>
     church of the Recollets, now the Anglican 
     <lb/>
     cathedral of Quebec, the Primate of England 
     <lb/>
     said :

     But you, who know far better than I the 
     <lb/>
     varied story of Quebec, are recalling to-day the 
     <lb/>
     earlier memories which—in a larger than any 
     <lb/>
     technical sense—gave imperishable consecra<lb break="no"/>tion to this place, which links it back along a 
     <lb/>
     chain of quite peculiar pathos, and interests to 
     <lb/>
     the work done centuries ago by members of 
     <lb/>
     the fraternity of St. Francis of Assisi, and 
     <lb/>
     along with them for a little while, at least, to 
     <lb/>
     the devoted men who, in a very different 'so<lb break="no"/>ciety,' a society whose very name became a 
     <lb/>
     catchword for a policy of behaviour which we 
     <lb/>
     condemn—did yet show to the whole world an 
     <lb/>
     example of missionary enthusiasm and a steadi<lb break="no"/>ness of persevering faith in face of persecution 
     <lb/>
     and suffering which, while the world standeth, 
     <lb/>
     will encircle with a halo of glory, the memory 
     <lb/>
     of the Jesuit missionaries of 250 years ago. In 
     <lb/>
     the words of the foremost historian of the col<lb break="no"/>onial church—a historian of whose staunch Pro<lb break="no"/>testantism none can make question—at every 
     <lb/>
     season and in every place the unwearied French 
     <lb/>
     missionary was seen winning his way to the 
     <lb/>
     Red man's home. Sometimes lost amid the 
     <lb/>
     trackless snow or forests, at other times hur<lb break="no"/>ried in his light canoe down some fearful 
     <lb/>
     rapid, he perished and was never heard of 
     <lb/>
     more. Of some, the tidings came that they had 
     <lb/>
     met with death more terrible than this, tor<lb break="no"/>tured by every art of savage cruelty, burnt or 
     <lb/>
     scalped or starved or mutilated in every limb. 
     <lb/>
     Yet none quailed or faltered. New men in<lb break="no"/>stantly pressed on. As we mark the stead<lb break="no"/>fastness of the faith which animated the hearts 
     <lb/>
     of Goupil and Jogues, and Lalement, and Bre<lb break="no"/>boeuf and Daniel in their martyrdom, we feel

     importance to be considered in the discus<lb break="no"/>sion of this Bill. There is just one matter 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="3333" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3333.jpg"/>

     to which I wish to refer in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     insinuation that Mr. Haultain does not re<lb break="no"/>present the views of the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, nor the views of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial government. The hon. the Solicitor 
     <lb/>
     General (Mr. Lemieux) has seen fit to state 
     <lb/>
     that the letter signed by Mr. Haultain was 
     <lb/>
     not assented to by his colleague, Mr. Bulyea, 
     <lb/>
     and that therefore it did not represent the 
     <lb/>
     views of the Territorial government. Now, 
     <lb/>
     I assume that the same reason would apply 
     <lb/>
     if we should say that this Bill was introduc<lb break="no"/>ed by the right hon. First Minister without 
     <lb/>
     the consent of the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton). Let me ask the Solicitor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral to point out one fact of one protest 
     <lb/>
     in that letter signed by Mr. Haultain, that 
     <lb/>
     is not borne out by the draft of the Bill 
     <lb/>
     which he submitted to this House in Dec<lb break="no"/>ember, 1901, and to which the legislative 
     <lb/>
     assembly at Regina had given their ap<lb break="no"/>proval. That was their mandate, that was 
     <lb/>
     their case ; and until the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man can point to something in that letter 
     <lb/>
     which is not borne out by that draft Bill, 
     <lb/>
     then I would consider that the insinuation 
     <lb/>
     is not worthy of any further reply. If the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman is looking for some members 
     <lb/>
     of the Territorial government who have been 
     <lb/>
     false to their trust, he certainly cannot 
     <lb/>
     point his finger to Mr. Haultain. Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain needs no recommendation in the west, 
     <lb/>
     nor does he in Ottawa. He has been deal<lb break="no"/>ing with the federal government, and it is 
     <lb/>
     in your judgment as to how he has labour<lb break="no"/>ed to secure the rights of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     west. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, I was somewhat surprised to 
     <lb/>
     hear the Solicitor General revive the old 
     <lb/>
     contention that the federal government had 
     <lb/>
     purchased the Northwest Territories. We are 
     <lb/>
     advised to-day that we were not only pur<lb break="no"/>chased for the general benefit of Canada, but 
     <lb/>
     also that we were discovered by a French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian. I think if he will look into the 
     <lb/>
     records he will find that that argument was 
     <lb/>
     abandoned many years ago. In 1885 the 
     <lb/>
     strongest position this government would 
     <lb/>
     take was that they had a large pecuniary 
     <lb/>
     interest in that country, and that is the posi<lb break="no"/>tion they did take. Let me ask the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to answer a couple of questions 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the purchase to which he has 
     <lb/>
     referred. Let me ask him to explain to this 
     <lb/>
     House when the Bill comes up for discus<lb break="no"/>sion of the clauses seriatim in committee, 
     <lb/>
     if that money was paid as the purchase 
     <lb/>
     price of these lands, why was not the deed 
     <lb/>
     of surrender made to the people who paid 
     <lb/>
     the money ? Again, let him explain why, 
     <lb/>
     if this land was purchased for the general 
     <lb/>
     benefit of the Dominion and to be held 
     <lb/>
     for the benefit of the Dominion, a large part 
     <lb/>
     of that land was included in the area hand<lb break="no"/>ed over to the province of Quebec in the 
     <lb/>
     year 1898 ? All we desire in this matter 
     <lb/>
     is to be treated as our other fellow-citizens 
     <lb/>
     are treated throughout the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
       

     Canada. Let me also say in passing that 
     <lb/>
     the Solicitor General can produce no docu<lb break="no"/>ment which will show that £300,000 were 
     <lb/>
     paid as a purchase price for the land. That 
     <lb/>
     money was paid to get rid of a trading 
     <lb/>
     monopoly, and, as he says, it has been 
     <lb/>
     a very bad investment. But I would like 
     <lb/>
     to direct him to the debate of 1869, where 
     <lb/>
     he will see that the increase in customs 
     <lb/>
     and excise duties more than doubled the 
     <lb/>
     amount of interest on this £300,000 that was 
     <lb/>
     paid for the release of the land. I would 
     <lb/>
     also point out that the purchase of these 
     <lb/>
     rights opened a field for the trade of 
     <lb/>
     eastern manufacturers which has been worth 
     <lb/>
     ten times, or a hundred times, the money 
     <lb/>
     that has been paid for it. Now, he seems 
     <lb/>
     to think that this administration has some 
     <lb/>
     claim or title upon that land because they 
     <lb/>
     have expended a certain sum of money upon 
     <lb/>
     it. He says that it has cost us a couple of 
     <lb/>
     rebellions, and that we have been obliged to 
     <lb/>
     keep up the mounted police. Well, on the 
     <lb/>
     same reason I assume that the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     own part of the province of Ontario for the 
     <lb/>
     cost of the battle of Queenston Heights. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I regret that this government has 
     <lb/>
     seen fit to place restrictions upon the edu<lb break="no"/>cational freedom of the new provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     do not fail to realize the importance of 
     <lb/>
     that question, I do not desire to belittle it 
     <lb/>
     for one moment. But I regret that this 
     <lb/>
     discussion should take place at this parti<lb break="no"/>cular time, when our boundaries are being 
     <lb/>
     fixed, when our political status is being 
     <lb/>
     determined, questions of the most vital im<lb break="no"/>portance to us that are liable to be lost 
     <lb/>
     sight of in the excitement of this racial 
     <lb/>
     and religious question. As representing a 
     <lb/>
     western constituency, I do not relish being 
     <lb/>
     ushered into confederation under such cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, circumstances that have been 
     <lb/>
     created by this government without any 
     <lb/>
     demand, without any complaint, and with<lb break="no"/>out any doubt expressed by the minority 
     <lb/>
     in that country in the spirit of fairness 
     <lb/>
     of the local government when they come to 
     <lb/>
     deal with this question of education. I 
     <lb/>
     speak of course subject to correction. The 
     <lb/>
     right hon, the First Minister, when intro<lb break="no"/>ducing this Bill referred to certain threat<lb break="no"/>ening letters ; perhaps if these letters were 
     <lb/>
     produced we would see where this agita<lb break="no"/>tion originated. Now, I do not intend to go 
     <lb/>
     into this educational question at any length. 
     <lb/>
     I have had occasion to observe that it is 
     <lb/>
     likely to receive very careful nursing from 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen on both sides of this House. 
     <lb/>
     I intend, however, to deal with it before 
     <lb/>
     I take my seat. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I desire particularly at this time to dir<lb break="no"/>ect the attention of the House to some fea<lb break="no"/>tures in this Bill which are liable to be lost 
     <lb/>
     sight of in the excitement which surrounds 
     <lb/>
     the discussion of the educational question. 
     <lb/>
     First of all let me refer to a statement made 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for Edmonton (Mr. Oli<lb break="no"/>ver) a few evenings ago. To my mind it 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="3335" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3335.jpg"/>
          <fw type="num">3335</fw>  <fw type="num">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3336</fw>
          

     goes directly to the principle of the Bill 
     <lb/>
     which we are discussing. In order that I 
     <lb/>
     may not misquote the hon. gentleman I will 
     <lb/>
     read what he said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I represent a section of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories and I say that the people 
     <lb/>
     or the Northwest Territories have never asked 
     <lb/>
     for provincial autonomy. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, I do not know who 
     <lb/>
     represents the people of the Territories the 
     <lb/>
     better, the thirty-five representatives in the 
     <lb/>
     local legislature at Regina or the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who represents Edmonton. I do 
     <lb/>
     not know what he means by stating that 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     never asked for provincial autonomy. I 
     <lb/>
     would remind him of the fact that on July 
     <lb/>
     20, 1900, an address was sent to this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment by the legislative assembly at Re<lb break="no"/>gina, and that on December 7, 1901, a draft 
     <lb/>
     Bill was prepared to which reference has 
     <lb/>
     been made and the terms of which were 
     <lb/>
     familiar to the thirty-five local representa<lb break="no"/>tives at Regina. In the year 1901, the Board 
     <lb/>
     of Trade of Edmonton, the town the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Mr. Oliver) lives in, passed a 
     <lb/>
     resolution asking that the Territories be 
     <lb/>
     created into two provinces. On April 2, 
     <lb/>
     1902, the Eastern Assiniboia Liberal Asso<lb break="no"/>ciation met at Indian Head and passed 
     <lb/>
     similar resolutions. I am not quite sure, 
     <lb/>
     but I have a suspicion that the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) was 
     <lb/>
     present at that meeting in company with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bulyea. In 1902, there was a local 
     <lb/>
     election in the Territories, and in the plat<lb break="no"/>form put forward by Mr. Haultain there 
     <lb/>
     were these two planks : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     1. Equal rights with all the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. Control of the public domain in the west. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These are the matters that the government 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories are now fighting for and these 
     <lb/>
     are the matters upon which your judgment is 
     <lb/>
     invited in my appeal to you for re-election in 
     <lb/>
     the legislature. A similar appeal has been 
     <lb/>
     made in every constituency in the country by 
     <lb/>
     every candidate whose election will give sup<lb break="no"/>port to the government at this particular 
     <lb/>
     period in the history of the Territories. The 
     <lb/>
     issue is plain ; it is for the people of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories to decide. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     The election took place and the result of 
     <lb/>
     that election demonstrated that Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain and his supporters represented public 
     <lb/>
     opinion in the Territories on the question 
     <lb/>
     of provincial autonomy. I find that four 
     <lb/>
     resolutions have subsequently been passed 
     <lb/>
     by the territorial assembly demanding the 
     <lb/>
     provincial status ; I find also that the very 
     <lb/>
     strongest advocate of the stand taken by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain, was, up to a short time ago, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Scott). He complimented Mr. Haultain on 
     <lb/>
     the stand he had taken in asking for pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy, but a short time after<lb break="no"/>wards the hon. member (Mr. Scott) changed 
     <lb/>
     his opinion, and assigned as a reason for 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
      

     delay that litigation was now pending as to 
     <lb/>
     the exemption of the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way from taxation, and he held it would 
     <lb/>
     be folly for the government to put through 
     <lb/>
     a Bill leaving that matter an open question. 
     <lb/>
     But to-day, the hon. member (Mr. Scott) is 
     <lb/>
     supporting a Bill which contains a clause 
     <lb/>
     continuing that exemption for ever. I also 
     <lb/>
     find that on April the 3rd, the Prince Al<lb break="no"/>bert Board of Trade passed a resolution de<lb break="no"/>claring that the government should grant 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy. On March the 3rd, 
     <lb/>
     there was a similar resolution from the 
     <lb/>
     Calgary Board of Trade. On March 25th, 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative convention at Moosejaw at 
     <lb/>
     which there were over 200 delegates, some 
     <lb/>
     of whom came 700 miles to attend, passed 
     <lb/>
     a resolution declaring in favour of the im<lb break="no"/>mediate granting of full provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy including the ownership of the public 
     <lb/>
     lands, mines and minerals. I also find that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver), 
     <lb/>
     speaking on October 13, 1903, used these 
     <lb/>
     words : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I would wish to point out to the hon. members 
     <lb/>
     and to the gentlemen on both sides, that it is 
     <lb/>
     not we who are objecting to provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy. We are asking provincial autonomy, but 
     <lb/>we want it on certain terms.

            <p>
     In January, 1904, the Liberal convention 
     <lb/>
     in nominating a candidate for Southern Al<lb break="no"/>berta, passed a resolution in favour of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy. On September 29 last, 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. the First Minister wrote to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain promising that if his govern<lb break="no"/>ment were returned to power they would 
     <lb/>
     immediately take into consideration the 
     <lb/>
     question of granting provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     to the Territories. I may point out that 
     <lb/>
     seven of the Liberal candidates were re<lb break="no"/>turned to this House, and not one of these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, so far as I know, has been in<lb break="no"/>structed by his constituents to repudiate 
     <lb/>
     the pledge given to the people by the Lib<lb break="no"/>eral leader. I say, Sir, that the resolution 
     <lb/>
     I have read, asking that the mines, lands 
     <lb/>
     and minerals be left to the provinces, re<lb break="no"/>presents the true sentiment of the people of 
     <lb/>
     the west. They have the conviction that 
     <lb/>
     they are entitled to have in the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernment the administration of the mines, 
     <lb/>
     lands and minerals in their territory, and 
     <lb/>
     without that they will not be satisfied. The 
     <lb/>
     only argument which I have heard present<lb break="no"/>ed in support of the overturning of the 
     <lb/>
     principles of the union, is that there might 
     <lb/>
     be a conflict between the local and federal 
     <lb/>
     authorities, and that the federal government 
     <lb/>
     might not be able to carry on its immi<lb break="no"/>gration policy. That argument was used 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for Brandon (Mr. Sif<lb break="no"/>ton), but he has not always thought that 
     <lb/>
     way because in the province of Manitoba in 
     <lb/>
     days gone by he contended for full provin<lb break="no"/>cial rights and he advocated handing over 
     <lb/>
     the lands to his province ; later on he <choice><sic>advi<lb break="no"/>cated</sic><corr>advocated</corr></choice> handing over the school lands as well. 
     <lb/>

     The hon. member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) 
     <lb/>
     seemed to fear greatly that if the control of 
     <lb/>
     the public domain should be given to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, the provinces would use the lands for 
     <lb/>
     revenue and would not settle the outlying 
     <lb/>
     districts. Well, Sir, I am not so willing 
     <lb/>
     as he is to suspect the foresight and busi<lb break="no"/>ness-like management of the local assembly. 
     <lb/>
     That assembly has undertaken no function 
     <lb/>
     up to date that the people of that country 
     <lb/>
     would consent to have abrogated, and the 
     <lb/>
     enlargements heretofore made in the pow<lb break="no"/>ers of the local assembly have been amply 
     <lb/>
     justified by the results. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) also entertained 
     <lb/>
     a different view of this question in days 
     <lb/>
     gone by, and on the 24th of July, 1884, he 
     <lb/>
     moved in the local legislature a resolution 
     <lb/>
     which expressed his views at that date, and 
     <lb/>
     which are not his views of to-day. He 
     <lb/>
     tells us that the lands might be exploited 
     <lb/>
     by the people of the west, but let me ask 
     <lb/>
     him if the people of the west are not the 
     <lb/>
     most interested in the proper administration 
     <lb/>
     of these lands, and do they not realize that 
     <lb/>
     by settling these lands they would be en<lb break="no"/>hancing the value of their heritage. For 
     <lb/>
     my part, Sir, I am not prepared to say that 
     <lb/>
     if the immigration policy were handed over 
     <lb/>
     to the local government, they would con<lb break="no"/>tinue the present system in its entirety. I 
     <lb/>
     do not know that a large expenditure out 
     <lb/>
     of the immigration vote for campaign liter<lb break="no"/>ature would be carried on ; I do not know 
     <lb/>
     that the large army of officials now in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest would be continued in office, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not know that the local govern<lb break="no"/>ment would hand over its lands in blocks 
     <lb/>
     of 250,000 acres at one dollar an acre. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are told now, Sir, and it is common 
     <lb/>
     report throughout the country, that the 
     <lb/>
     duties of the Department of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     have become too onerous for one man. We 
     <lb/>
     were told that the ex-minister (Mr. Sifton) 
     <lb/>
     was so broken down in health that he of 
     <lb/>
     all men was unable to attend the conference 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the granting of autonomy to 
     <lb/>
     the Territories. Is not this a very good 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to relieve the Department of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior of some of its work, and of 
     <lb/>
     handing over to the local administration of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories the control of the pub<lb break="no"/>lic lands, a right which is enjoyed by 
     <lb/>
     every other province but one in this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     All that we have heard from the ex-Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior is that there would be a 
     <lb/>
     conflict; but that will not satisfy the people 
     <lb/>
     of the west. They want some more satis<lb break="no"/>factory reason, in view of the attitude 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. gentleman assumed in days 
     <lb/>
     gone by. They will not endure in silence 
     <lb/>
     the withholding of their public lands. I 
     <lb/>
     doubt if some of the other Liberal members, 
     <lb/>
     in view of the statements which they have 
     <lb/>
     made in days gone by, will get up in this 
     <lb/>
     House and make the declaration that the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories are 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
      

     not fit to be entrusted with the same mea<lb break="no"/>sure of self-government that is enjoyed by 
     <lb/>
     the various provinces of this Dominion. If 
     <lb/>
     they do, I think we on this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House will have some reason to congratu<lb break="no"/>late ourselves on the manner in which they 
     <lb/>
     will be received by the people of that coun<lb break="no"/>try after such a declaration. In view of 
     <lb/>
     the statements that have been made, I 
     <lb/>
     think it is only fair to this House and to 
     <lb/>
     the people of that country that these hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen should give the grounds for the 
     <lb/>
     conclusions at which they have arrived. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>The hon. the Solicitor General was very 
     <lb/>pleased to exalt and extol the British con<lb break="no"/>stitution. He thought very much of the 
     <lb/>British constitution in certain respects; but 
     <lb/>if the British constitution applies in one 
     <lb/>direction, why should it not apply in the 
     <lb/>other ? If we are going to follow the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish constitution in respect of education, 
     <lb/>why should we depart from it in regard to 
     <lb/>the important matter of the control of the 
     <lb/>public domain? Are hon. gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site, in withholding from the new provinces 
     <lb/>the control of the public domain, following 
     <lb/>the British colonial policy ? What was 
     <lb/>that policy ? It is perhaps unnecessary for 
     <lb/>me to state to the House that the original 
     <lb/>idea of the British statesmen was to con<lb break="no"/>trol the lands in the colonies; but when 
     <lb/>they tried to put that idea into practice, 
     <lb/>they had to abandon it for a better policy, 
     <lb/>namely, that the people on the spot were 
     <lb/>best qualified to manage their own lands, 
     <lb/>and that was the policy they adopted. They 
     <lb/>felt that with local representation the man<lb break="no"/>agement of the lands would be better looked 
     <lb/>after. Is that principle not equally applic<lb break="no"/>able to-day? Here we have a territory two 
     <lb/>thousand miles away, represented in this 
     <lb/>House by only ten members. If those 
     <lb/>lands are handed over to the local govern<lb break="no"/>ment, there will be fifty members looking 
     <lb/>after their management in the interest of 
     <lb/>the people; and if mistakes or jobbery are 
     <lb/>liable to happen, are these not more likely 
     <lb/>to be detected by governments represent<lb break="no"/>ing fifty members than by a government 
     <lb/>representing only ten ? I say that to 
     <lb/>withhold from the provinces the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of their own lands is directly con<lb break="no"/>trary, not only to British colonial policy, 
     <lb/>but to the spirit of confederation. When 
     <lb/>confederation was formed, what was the 
     <lb/>arrangement made between the various 
     <lb/>provinces ? Was it not that each province 
     <lb/>retained the right to administer the public 
     <lb/>domain, while the customs and excise du<lb break="no"/>ties were surrendered to the Dominion ? 
     <lb/>That was the policy carried out with regard 
     <lb/>to Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>Brunswick. Then, in what spirit are these 
     <lb/>provinces being created to-day ? I take it 
     <lb/>that it is under section 146 of the British 
     <lb/>North America Act, which especially pro<lb break="no"/>vides that the admission shall be ' subject 
     <lb/>to the provisions of this Act.' The spirit is 
     <lb/>also in section 109, if the letter is not, un<lb break="no"/>

     At page 16 of the debates of 1869, Mr.

     Edward Blake made the following state<lb break="no"/>ment in opposing a resolution to admit 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into the union and to pay 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland $150,000 a year in lieu of its 
     <lb/>
     lands :

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     He was very strongly opposed to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion acquiring the Crown lands of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, and he has as strongly objected to New<lb break="no"/>foundland being deprived of its Crown lands. 
     <lb/>
     He commended the policy of the framers of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution in leaving to each of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     the control of their own public lands. This 
     <lb/>
     was from the Canadian point of view. Then as 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland the arrangement was equally 
     <lb/>
     objectionable : (1) Its distance from the seat 
     <lb/>
     of government (2) and its small representation 
     <lb/>
     in parliament would lead to an unsatisfactory 
     <lb/>
     management. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The local government would be deprived of 
     <lb/>
     the control of these lands, which might by it

     <lb/>
     year and taking her lands, and giving $150,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year and leaving her her lands, he would will<lb break="no"/>ingly vote for the latter (hear, hear). These

     That is a statement which I desire to im<lb break="no"/>press upon the members of this House in

     <lb/>
     Mr. Blake regarded them in 1869.

     But, Mr. Speaker, if there can be any 
     <lb/>
     doubt at all as to what was in the minds of 
     <lb/>
     those gentlemen at that day, I will refer 
     <lb/>
     to another statement which was made on 
     <lb/>
     June 10 in the same debate by Mr. Alex<lb break="no"/>ander Mackenzie. Mr. Blake had made 
     <lb/>
     his argument first, and had been twitted by 
     <lb/>
     the members of the government for voting 
     <lb/>
     to pay money to the Hudson Bay Company. 
     <lb/>
     If there could be anything plainer or clearer 
     <lb/>
     as to what was in their minds at that time, 
     <lb/>
     it would be hard to find it. Mr. Mackenzie 
     <lb/>
     said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The Minister of Public Works, and the pre<lb break="no"/>mier said they were surprised that the member 
     <lb/>
     for West Durham should object to our acquir<lb break="no"/>ing the public lands of Newfoundland after 
     <lb/>
     voting for the acquisition of lands in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There was (a) difference between the two 
     <lb/>
     cases, in the Northwest Territories there were 
     <lb/>
     at present no constituted authorities as there 
     <lb/>
     were in Newfoundland, and it would not be

     pretended that after a government was estab<lb break="no"/>lished in the Northwest Territories we would 
     <lb/>
     administer its lands from Ottawa.

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     That statement to my mind is most signi<lb break="no"/>ficant because it was made in the year 1869, 
     <lb/>
     the very year when the surrender was 
     <lb/>
     taken from the Hudson Bay Company ; and 
     <lb/>
     I am sure that the First Minister and the 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General will pardon the more ob<lb break="no"/>scure members from the west if we venture 
     <lb/>
     to differ from them in opinion, backed as 
     <lb/>
     we are by the statements of these men at 
     <lb/>
     the very time the contract went through. 
     <lb/>
     These were the views that prevailed at 
     <lb/>
     that time ; and in the consideration of this 
     <lb/>
     question we look to our fellow-citizens in 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces to admit our right to be 
     <lb/>
     put on an equal footing with them and be 
     <lb/>
     given the administration of our own public 
     <lb/>
     domain. I have shown what the arrange<lb break="no"/>ments were when the four original provinces 
     <lb/>
     entered confederation. Let us trace what 
     <lb/>
     the subsequent arrangements were in the 
     <lb/>
     case of those provinces which entered later. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     British Columbia, which entered in 1870, 
     <lb/>
     was a colony entitled to its public lands, 
     <lb/>
     and not only has it control of its lands, but 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion pays it annually the sum of 
     <lb/>
     $100,000 for a twenty mile strip through 
     <lb/>
     the Rocky Mountains that was alienated 
     <lb/>
     for railway purposes. Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land entered in 1873, and I think at that 
     <lb/>
     time her Crown lands were in such a shape 
     <lb/>
     that an annual grant of $45,000 was given 
     <lb/>
     her in lieu thereof. Manitoba is the one 
     <lb/>
     exception. That province was not allowed 
     <lb/>
     to retain its public lands, and hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite take glory in the fact that 
     <lb/>

     the arrangement with Manitoba was made 
     <lb/>
     by their predecessors. They are willing to 
     <lb/>
     shield themselves behind the example of 
     <lb/>
     their predecessors in some things, but see 
     <lb/>
     how different were the circumstances in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba then as compared with what they 
     <lb/>
     are to-day in the Territories. In Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     in the year 1870, there were only 12,000 peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and it was perhaps prudent to with<lb break="no"/>hold from that mere handful of people, un<lb break="no"/>accustomed to self-government, living on 
     <lb/>
     the banks of the Red river, their right to 
     <lb/>
     administer their public lands, but the condi<lb break="no"/>tions which then existed no longer remain 
     <lb/>
     nor do they exist in the new provinces about 
     <lb/>
     to be established. Whereas in Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     you had only 12,000 people in 1870, you have 
     <lb/>
     in the Territories to-day, if we are to be<lb break="no"/>lieve the Minister of the Interior (Mr Sifton)  
     <lb/>
     a population of 500,000 people, and a popu<lb break="no"/>lation accustomed to all the responsibilities 
     <lb/>
     that go with self-government. But fourteen 
     <lb/>
     years later, when the same party was in 
     <lb/>
     power, the government of Manitoba came 
     <lb/>
     down to this parliament and asked to be 
     <lb/>
     given control of its public lands and its 
     <lb/>
     petition was refused. True the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba agreed to waive her claim to the 
     <lb/>
     public lands in consideration of an annual 
     <lb/>
     payment of $100,000. But it was her pri<lb break="no"/>vilege to do that, and that does not form a 
     <lb/>
     precedent to be followed in this case. Be<lb break="no"/>sides hon. gentlemen opposite have been 
     <lb/>
     holding themselves out as nation builders 
     <lb/>
     and carefully avoiding any errors into which 
     <lb/>
     previous governments have fallen, as all 
     <lb/>
     government must fall sometimes. But can 
     <lb/>
     any man, I ask, look into the negotiations 
     <lb/>
     which have taken place between Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     and the federal government, and say that 
     <lb/>
     the policy followed was a wise one ? Look at 
     <lb/>
     the negotiations which have taken place at 
     <lb/>
     frequent intervals between that province 
     <lb/>
     and the administration at Ottawa, and you 
     <lb/>
     will find that the result of that policy has 
     <lb/>
     been continued dissatisfaction and continued 
     <lb/>
     agitation for better terms. Look at what 
     <lb/>
     has taken place. It is a record of almost 
     <lb/>
     annual pilgrimages from Manitoba to Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa for better terms. In 1876 her subsidy 
     <lb/>
     was increased to $90,000. In 1879 it was 
     <lb/>
     increased to $105,653. Again in 1882, she 
     <lb/>
     came knocking at the federal door, and her 
     <lb/>
     subsidy was increased to $215,000. In 1885 
     <lb/>
     she was still given further assistance. She 
     <lb/>
     was given swamp lands, 150,000 acres for 
     <lb/>
     a university, $100,000 a year in lieu of pub<lb break="no"/>lic lands, and a per capita grant on a basis 
     <lb/>
     of population of 150,000. But that was not 
     <lb/>
     the end. In 1898 further application was 
     <lb/>
     made and she was given a cash grant to 
     <lb/>
     construct the government house, and in 1899 
     <lb/>
     she was given better lands in exchange for 
     <lb/>
     the swamp lands. These are only a few of 
     <lb/>
     the begging trips of Manitoba ; and I ask : 
     <lb/>
     Is it good policy, is it wise administration 
     <lb/>
     to keep the provincial government at the 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         

     mercy of the federal ? I submit, Sir, that to 
     <lb/>
     the province of Manitoba as well as to 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces should be given the right 
     <lb/>
     to administer the public domain within her 
     <lb/>
     borders. Speaking for my own constituency, 
     <lb/>
     I believe that a majority of the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories would be willing to take up 
     <lb/>
     the case of Manitoba and make the fight 
     <lb/>
     together, and I believe that at no distant 
     <lb/>
     day, when we receive the representation in 
     <lb/>
     this House to which we are entitled, we will 
     <lb/>
     be here in such numbers as to justify us 
     <lb/>
     in insisting upon equal rights with the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces to administer the public domain 
     <lb/>
     within our respective borders. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have heard a great deal about repre<lb break="no"/>sentations with regard to educational mat<lb break="no"/>ters which were made to certain people 
     <lb/>
     when they went out to that country. I have 
     <lb/>
     seen pamphlets in circulation claiming pro<lb break="no"/>tection for a certain class in matters of edu<lb break="no"/>cation and in matters of religious teaching 
     <lb/>
     on the ground that they went into that coun<lb break="no"/>try relying on the protection of a certain 
     <lb/>
     clause in the constitution. But let me ask 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite under what promise 
     <lb/>
     did the hardy pioneers go into that country? 
     <lb/>
     Under what constitution did these men go 
     <lb/>
     into that country and enhance the value of 
     <lb/>
     those one time unoccupied lands by their 
     <lb/>
     energy, thrift and enterprise? Is there any 
     <lb/>
     difference in that respect between that part 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion and any other part? When 
     <lb/>
     people went out to that part of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion did they give up any portion of their 
     <lb/>
     birthright, and is it right, when they take 
     <lb/>
     up the burden of a province, that they 
     <lb/>
     should start out in confederation as a prov<lb break="no"/>ince on any less advantageous terms than 
     <lb/>
     any other province ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But what is the real reason why these 
     <lb/>
     public lands are being retained by this 
     <lb/>
     government and withheld from the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies ? Is it because the governments of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories are not capable of giving an 
     <lb/>
     honest administration ? No, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     that is not the reason. We have in that 
     <lb/>
     country to-day a large population accustom<lb break="no"/>ed to self-government, and no one has as 
     <lb/>
     yet ventured to sugest the merest suspicion 
     <lb/>
     against the competency of the people in 
     <lb/>
     the Territories to manage their own public 
     <lb/>
     affairs in their own public interests. That 
     <lb/>
     is not the reason, but the reason is that the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa administration realizes that as long 
     <lb/>
     as it can retain the immense army of officials 
     <lb/>
     which it has up there now, it will have 
     <lb/>
     under its control a great machinery for 
     <lb/>
     securing votes. That is the difficulty in the 
     <lb/>
     way of giving up the lands and no matter 
     <lb/>
     what party may be in power, there will 
     <lb/>
     always be the danger of its making an 
     <lb/>
     improper use of its machinery, because 
     <lb/>
     the recent experience we have had up 
     <lb/>
     there is not such as to allay our appre<lb break="no"/>hensions in that regard. That this objec<lb break="no"/>tion is a serious one cannot be denied and 
     <lb/>

     such experience as we have recently had

     apprehension, and I assert, Sir, without fear

     Now, coming to the educational clause, I

     desire to examine these clauses for a few

     minutes. Before I proceed to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Borden) from its merits, I wish to 
     <lb/>
     direct my attention to the speech made a 
     <lb/>
     few evenings ago by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Edmonton (Mr. Oliver). He claimed that 
     <lb/>
     the clause inserted in Mr. Haultain's draft 
     <lb/>
     Bill was identically the same as that of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill now before the House, so far as the 
     <lb/>
     educational question is concerned. And, 
     <lb/>
     for fear of misquoting him, let me give his 
     <lb/>
     own words as found at page 3163 of ' Han<lb break="no"/>sard ' :

     But I find that section 3 of this draft Bill,

            <cb/>
     

     peated in 1903—is almost word for word with 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of the Autonomy Bill which is before

     Now, before this matter could be dis<lb break="no"/>cussed, or even fairly understood, I presume, 
     <lb/>
     it would be necessary to make sure that we 
     <lb/>
     realize the difference between 'continue' and 
     <lb/>
     ' perpetuate.' Does the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Edmonton propose that creating new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in the Northwest, we should get 
     <lb/>
     along without any law at all until the legis<lb break="no"/>lature can meet ? Surely not. And this 
     <lb/>
     section 3 simply perserves for the time be<lb break="no"/>ing the laws in existence on the 1st of 
     <lb/>
     July next. A section similar to this has 
     <lb/>
     been put in every law creating a province, 
     <lb/>
     simply to provide a body of laws until the 
     <lb/>
     legislature can meet and pass laws to con<lb break="no"/>tinue the laws that have been handed over 
     <lb/>
     or repeal or amend them. Yet, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Edmonton tries to construe this 
     <lb/>
     Bill as simply giving to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest what they asked for in their 
     <lb/>
     draft Bill. But I have already indicated 
     <lb/>
     the difference—we may have asked for it 
     <lb/>
     for the time being; but we do not ask to 
     <lb/>
     have the present system of schools per<lb break="no"/>petuated or the power to repeal the exist<lb break="no"/>ing system taken away. We have a law 
     <lb/>
     with regard to brands. Does the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Edmonton want to discontinue that 
     <lb/>
     and have no law? We have a law with 
     <lb/>
     regard to bulls. If there was a law 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest with regard to strikes, no 
     <lb/>
     doubt the hon. member for Edmonton would 
     <lb/>
     like to have it kept on the statute-book 
     <lb/>
     until the legislature could meet and pass 
     <lb/>
     such a law. He says also :

     And the hon. member for Edmonton sup<lb break="no"/>ported that. So did the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Assiniboia (Mr. Turriff), then a member 
     <lb/>
     of the assembly. Thus they prayed this 
     <lb/>
     administration that everything that had to 
     <lb/>
     do with education should be shut out of the 
     <lb/>
     law, which would leave the province a free 
     <lb/>
     hand with the matter of education. In 
     <lb/>
     view of that point, I think that hardly all 
     <lb/>
     the facts were stated by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Oliver) when he said that there was 
     <lb/>
     no feeling in the Northwest with regard to 
     <lb/>
      this Bill and no objection taken to it. If 
     <lb/>
     the prayer of the petitions had been granted, 
     <lb/>
     I think these gentlemen would have been 
     <lb/>
     in nearly the same position as the amend<lb break="no"/>ment of the leader of the opposition would 
     <lb/>
     place them in. Apparently, their opinions 
     <lb/>
     have changed. But it did not stop at the 
     <lb/>
     point I have indicated. In the following 
     <lb/>
     session of the legislative assembly, they 
     <lb/>
     repeated their prayer. And the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Edmonton and the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Assiniboia supported that contention, 
     <lb/>
     that education should be left entirely to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Now, apparently, they have 
     <lb/>
     changed their mind as they did with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the land policy. Now, Mr. Speaker, in 
     <lb/>
     proceeding to discuss these educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses of these Bills, I cannot say that I 
     <lb/>
     shall be able to show, but shall contend, 
     <lb/>
     that the amendments presented to this 
     <lb/>
     House to-day do not differ in the slightest 
     <lb/>
     degree from the original Bill as brought 
     <lb/>
     down. But, before I proceed to discuss 
     <lb/>
     the amendment and the original Bill let 
     <lb/>
     me point out the contrast between the posi<lb break="no"/>tion taken by the right hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     government and the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, the hon. member for Brandon (Mr.

            <p>The right hon. the First Minister has said 
     <lb/>in introducing the Bill that it was obliga<lb break="no"/>tory upon this government to preserve cer<lb break="no"/>tain rights and conditions which by reason

     <lb/>should misquote him I shall read what he 
     <lb/>said. These rights and conditions are in<lb break="no"/>violable because they are given under the 
     <lb/>Act of 1875, and he says:

     <lb/>
     that these rights which were created should 
     <lb/>
     be guaranteed to the minority. But the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member from Brandon (Mr. Sifton) has en<lb break="no"/>deavoured to show that there is a vast dif<lb break="no"/>ference between the rights of the minorities 
     <lb/>
     under the Act of 1875 and their right to-day 
     <lb/>
     under local ordinances. He said that under 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1875 the minority were entitled 
     <lb/>
     to and were given a complete dual system. 
     <lb/>
     This is what he says on page 3239:

     This system went on for some time in the

     <lb/>
     interfere and to curtail the privileges of the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. This curtailment proceeded 
     <lb/>
     from time to time until the year 1892 when 
     <lb/>
     what was known as the dual system was entirely 
     <lb/>
     swept away and that system which we have in

     So there is a vast difference in the views

     taken by the right hon. the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     and the member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton). 
     <lb/>
     There is a vast difference between the rights 
     <lb/>
     conferred under the Act of 1875 and under 
     <lb/>
     the ordinances according to the member for 
     <lb/>
     Brandon. The hon. member for Brandon 
     <lb/>
     has compared these rights and further says 
     <lb/>
     that these rights were conferred under the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1875 and that the local ordinances 
     <lb/>
     curtailing them were unconstitutional and 
     <lb/>
     ultra vires. He will not consent to the pre<lb break="no"/>servation of the conditions which are in<lb break="no"/>violable, but he will agree to perpetuate the 
     <lb/>
     curtailed rights, although he intimated that 
     <lb/>
     such an invasion was an illegal and uncon<lb break="no"/>

     There is the opinion of the hon. member

     for Brandon (Mr. Sifton), that when the 
     <lb/>
     local ordinances abolished these rights they 
     <lb/>
     went beyond the power given to them under 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1875. Upon that point Sir John

     Now, there is the position. The First Min<lb break="no"/>ister insists upon the inviolability of that 
     <lb/>
     Act. The ex-Minister of the Interior finds 
     <lb/>
     that under the Act the minority were en<lb break="no"/>titled to a complete dual system. This was 
     <lb/>
     taken away by an ordinance. If they had 
     <lb/>
     the right to have them then they have the 
     <lb/>
     right now in spite of any ordinances to 
     <lb/>
     the contrary. I propose a little further on 
     <lb/>
     to deal with that section which specifically 
     <lb/>
     continues these rights of the minority in 
     <lb/>
     force in that country. The position then 
     <lb/>
     is this, that the Prime Minister repudiates 
     <lb/>
     his speech and accepts a vioation of the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1875 and accedes to a proposition to 
     <lb/>
     perpetuate a violation of the inviolable. 
     <lb/>
     There is the position between the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister and the hon member for Brandon 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton). 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But let us examine into these clauses for 
     <lb/>
     a moment, and we shall see just who has 
     <lb/>
     been making a compromise, who has been 
     <lb/>
     giving away his rights or his religious opin<lb break="no"/>ions. I find that the objections of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) are, first, 
     <lb/>
     that he objects to subsection 2 of section 
     <lb/>
     16, and it is on account of this clause he 
     <lb/>
     says that he resigned, because he says that 
     <lb/>
     in that all the evils which he has dilated 
     <lb/>
     upon existed under the Act of 1875 in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. I wish to make myself clear, but I 
     <lb/>
     am not going to be dragged into the discus<lb break="no"/>sion of the merits or demerits of a separate 
     <lb/>
     school system. That is a matter of which 
     <lb/>
     I know nothing, and I am simply taking the 
     <lb/>
     argument and citing the cases cited by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite who have had more 
     <lb/>
     experience in dealing with these systems 
     <lb/>
     than I have had. He says that he objects 
     <lb/>
     to subsection 2 of section 16 because in that 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
      

     all the evils he has dilated upon exists, and 
     <lb/>
     he has persuaded the First Minister to ac<lb break="no"/>cept a proposition that in his opinion has 
     <lb/>
     eliminated all the essential characteristics 
     <lb/>
     of a separate school system. What does 
     <lb/>
     subsection 2 of section 16 to which he makes 
     <lb/>
     objection contain? It says:

     He takes the comprehensive word 'edu<lb break="no"/>cation' and tries to read into that that there

     was some risk and danger of endowing a 
     <lb/>
     Catholic university, ignoring altogether the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the general word education is 
     <lb/>
     followed afterwards by the particular words 
     <lb/>
     'separate schools and public schools,' so he 
     <lb/>
     creates a man of straw in this so-called

     <lb/>
     demolish it. I submit that it is based upon 
     <lb/>
     a fallacious construction of that clause to 
     <lb/>
     which he raises his objection. Now, what 
     <lb/>
     are his other objections and why did he 
     <lb/>
     resign ? Now, he objects to endowing a 
     <lb/>
     separate university, he objects to ear-mark<lb break="no"/>ing the public land fund. But what does 
     <lb/>
     the amendment do ? Does it not create and 
     <lb/>
     endow schools from the same funds ? Does 
     <lb/>
     the amendment make any distinction be<lb break="no"/>tween these two sections? Now, let us 
     <lb/>
     deal with the position as it is. How does 
     <lb/>
     the amendment change the Bill, if it changes 
     <lb/>
     it at all ? I desire to point out that if the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the minority to separate schools 
     <lb/>
     were created under the Act of 1875, and if 
     <lb/>
     they were entitled under it to a complete 
     <lb/>
     dual system, then I say that under the 
     <lb/>
     amendment exactly the same state of affairs 
     <lb/>
     will prevail. Let me read subsection 1 of 
     <lb/>
     the amended section :

            <p>
     Now, in that section is everything that 
     <lb/>
     is included in the Act of 1875, which gives 
     <lb/>
     these people the right to separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     and which gives them the rights the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brandon dilated upon a few days 
     <lb/>
     ago, Therefore, I take the position that 
     <lb/>
     there is not the slightest difference to-day 
     <lb/>
     between the amended Bill and the Bill that 
     <lb/>
     was originally presented to this House. 
     <lb/>
     Now an attempt was made by the Minister 
     <lb/>of Customs, who is not in his seat, and by 
     <lb/>a number of other gentlemen, to show that 
     <lb/>all the amendment gives to these local leg<lb break="no"/>islatures is the power to give a half hour's 
     <lb/>religious instruction at the end of the day. 
     <lb/>Now, Sir, there is nothing in these ordin<lb break="no"/>ances which pares down the rights given to 
     <lb/>them under section 41, so far as I have been 
     <lb/>able to find, except to designate at what 
     <lb/>time this religious teaching shall take place. 
     <lb/>They have attempted to make this House 
     <lb/>believe that under this amendment it is 
     <lb/>not possible to have a dual system of text 
     <lb/>books, a dual system of inspection, but 
     <lb/>that everything given under the Act of 1875 
     <lb/>is preserved by the introduction of section 
     <lb/>41 in chapter 29.  Now, this amendment, 
     <lb/>which they argue will preserve to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of that country what they have got to<lb break="no"/>day, simply continues the law, it does not 
     <lb/>continue the administration. The dual sys<lb break="no"/>tem of text books, the dual inspection and 
     <lb/>all that is a matter of administration. 
     <lb/>Therefore, if the argument of the member 
     <lb/>for Brandon is sound that the action of 
     <lb/>the local legislation in paring down the 
     <lb/>rights these people had under the Act of 
     <lb/>1875 was ultra vires, then any Order in 
     <lb/>Council which was passed by the commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of education would be equally ultra 
     <lb/>vires. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Then the minority, under this section 41 
     <lb/>
     which gives them the rights they had under 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1875, and which are preserved 
     <lb/>
     to them under this amendment, would be 
     <lb/>
     able to demand that these rights be en<lb break="no"/>forced.

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. My hon. friend is mistaken. 
     <lb/>
     One of the conditions that was pared down 
     <lb/>
     was the existence of dual management and 
     <lb/>
     dual boards, one board managing the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic schools, and the other 
     <lb/>
     board managing the public schools.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. McCARTHY</persName>. Is that not un<lb break="no"/>der the regulations of the Commissioners of 
     <lb/>
     Education ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Certainly not, it is a pro<lb break="no"/>vision of the ordinance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. McCARTHY</persName>. I differ from 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman entirely and I want 
     <lb/>
    to impress upon the House the fact that 
     <lb/>this amended Act continues these ordinan<lb break="no"/>ces only, and it does not continue the 
     <lb/>administration of them ; and if the Com<lb break="no"/>missionser of Education passes certain 
     <lb/>Orders in Council which contravene the 
     <lb/>rights given under section 41, then this 
     <lb/>Order in Council will be just as much ultra 
     <lb/>vires and unconstitutional as the ordinances 
     <lb/>that were passed paring down the Act of 
     <lb/>1875.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCKE4">Mr. D. D. McKENZIE</persName>. How does the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman suppose that the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of these new provinces would formulate 
     <lb/>
     and try to pass ordinances that will be be<lb break="no"/>yond the terms of the constitution ? The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman makes the statement that 
     <lb/>
     ordinances ultra vires of the constitution 
     <lb/>

     will be passed. If the hon. gentleman is 
     <lb/>
     making a legal argument. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     know what authority he has for saying 
     <lb/>
     that they will go beyond their rights in 
     <lb/>
     chapters 29 and 30 ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. I do not think it is very 
     <lb/>
     difficult to understand the argument of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend (Mr. M. S. McCarthy). He 
     <lb/>
     says that if the ordinances were invalid we 
     <lb/>
     are validating these ordinances now, but 
     <lb/>
     we are not validating the Order in Council 
     <lb/>
     passed by the Commissioner of Education 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories, and conse<lb break="no"/>quently the invalidity of the ordinances 
     <lb/>
     still remains. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Could they not have passed 
     <lb/>
     identical Orders in Council, which will be 
     <lb/>
     validated under this Bill ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. That is another thing ; he 
     <lb/>
     speaks of the Orders in Council that have 
     <lb/>
     been passed.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS2">Mr. DUNCAN ROSS</persName>. If the contention 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentleman (Mr. S. M. McCarthy) 
     <lb/>
     is right, surely we are leaving it to the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial government to pass these Orders in 
     <lb/>
     Council. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. McCARTHY</persName>. Does not the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman see that if anything were done 
     <lb/>
     by ordinance or by Order in Council paring 
     <lb/>
     down the rights under the Act of 1875, then, 
     <lb/>
     if the hon. member for Brandon is correct, 
     <lb/>
     it would be equally ultra vires and could 
     <lb/>
     be set aside. If he cannot see that, I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry for him. Under the conditions ex<lb break="no"/>isting to-day the Commissioner of Education 
     <lb/>
     can go back and establish a dual system of 
     <lb/>
     inspection and a dual system of text books. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Certainly.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. McCARTHY</persName>. Then if you are 
     <lb/>
     protecting the rights of the minority, why 
     <lb/>
     not protect the rights of the majority ; you 
     <lb/>
     say that all you want is what you have to<lb break="no"/>day. I am assuming that all the rights 
     <lb/>
     created under the Act of 1875 are preserved 
     <lb/>
     in section 41 ; and that being so, what 
     <lb/>
     would a stranger coming into this House 
     <lb/>
    think of the picture that has been presented 
     <lb/>to us by some gentlemen on the other side 
     <lb/>of the House ? I repeat that I know nothing 
     <lb/>of the separate school system, of its merits 
     <lb/>or demerits. What I know of it has come 
     <lb/>from hon. gentlemen opposite. The Minister 
     <lb/>of Finance, although he declared himself 
     <lb/>opposed to separate schools, has gone on 
     <lb/>record with the statement that he will sup<lb break="no"/>port this Bill. I quote from ' Hansard ' :

     I take these words to mean nothing else 
     <lb/>
     than that he is supporting this legislation 
     <lb/>
     because it is going to kill the very thing 
     <lb/>
     that it is intended to create. I have spent 
     <lb/>
     some time of my life in the study of law, 
     <lb/>
     and that class of legislation is new to me. 
     <lb/>
     I do not know what name to call it, but 
     <lb/>
     if it were not unparliamentary I would 
     <lb/>
     suggest that it is boomerang legislation. 
     <lb/>
     something that comes back, something that 
     <lb/>
     has an opposite effect to that intended. 
     <lb/>
     And what can we say of the posi<lb break="no"/>tion taken by the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance. He says that he wants sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools abolished, but in his mind 
     <lb/>
     the longest way round is evidently the short<lb break="no"/>est way home. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton) claims to have a great experience 
     <lb/>
     in matters of education, and, speaking of 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1875, which I contend is con<lb break="no"/>tinued in section 41, he says :

     schools or clerical controlled schools. That was

     the system that was built up under this Act of

     1875. It went on for some time. It was exactly

     the same system—I do not know as to the

     <lb/>
     in principle it was the same system we had in

     Manitoba up to the year 1890, when it was

     Now, Sir, we have the opinion of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) that the 
     <lb/>
     systems are identical. We have his view, 
     <lb/>
     the correctness of which I do not know, as 
     <lb/>
     to the efficiency of the system in Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     We have also the hon. member for Lisgar 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Greenway), in his election address in 
     <lb/>
     July, 1892, appealing to the people of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba for a further return to office, one of 
     <lb/>
     the grounds which he strongly urges being 
     <lb/>
     that his government had abolished the dual 
     <lb/>
     system. I may state to the House that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman has not deputed me to 
     <lb/>
     state what his views are ; we have been 
     <lb/>
     anxious for him to speak for himself. I 
     <lb/>
     find that among those supporting him on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion, were : Mr. Clifford Sifton of 
     <lb/>
     Brandon; Mr. Burrows of Dauphin ; Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Jackson of Selkirk, and Mr. Crawford of 
     <lb/>
     Portage la Prairie, all of whom sit in this 
     <lb/>
     House to-day. If these hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     have assigned to that system its true char<lb break="no"/>acter, I can only take the position that no<lb break="no"/>thing but absolute freedom in this matter 
     <lb/>
     of education can satisfy the people of the 
     <lb/>
     west. They should be left free to legislate 
     <lb/>
     in years to come and to profit by the ex<lb break="no"/>perience of the past. If the present system 
     <lb/>
     proves to be satisfactory, if it can be pre<lb break="no"/>served ; if the time comes when it does 
     <lb/>
     not prove satisfactory, the people of the 
     <lb/>
     west desire to have reserved the right to 
     <lb/>
     repeal it. I desire to point out to this 
     <lb/>
     House that the people of that country have 
     <lb/>
     never had an opportunity of deciding upon 
     <lb/>
     that question for themselves. They differ 
     <lb/>
     from a colony. They are not coming into 
     <lb/>
     this confederation with a separate school 
     <lb/>
     system that they have chosen for them<lb break="no"/>selves ; but I believe that if this adminis<lb break="no"/>tration had trusted the people of the west 
     <lb/>
     any rights possessed by minorities there 
     <lb/>
     would have been respected. I am not here 
     <lb/>
     to say that that system would be abolished, 
     <lb/>
     if we had the power, on the second day of 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
       

     July; but what I plead for on behalf of 
     <lb/>
     those provinces is that they be allowed to 
     <lb/>
     legislate in that matter as they see fit, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the experience they have had.

            <p>
     In 1875, when the Act to which so much 
     <lb/>
     reference has been made was passed, there 
     <lb/>
     were only 500 people living there ; and the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of Finance, a few evenings 
     <lb/>
     ago, stated that he never would be a party 
     <lb/>
     to the passing of an Act to override a local 
     <lb/>
     ordinance or local statute—that would be a 
     <lb/>
     gross interference with provincial rights. 
     <lb/>
     But to my mind there is not a very great 
     <lb/>
     distinction between overriding an Act in ex<lb break="no"/>istence to-day, and picking out of our or<lb break="no"/>dinance a certain portion and saying that 
     <lb/>
     suits us, and we will adopt it so that you 
     <lb/>
     cannot repeal it for all time to come. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that the one is no greater in<lb break="no"/>fringement or invasion than the other. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of Finance holds up as a 
     <lb/>
     model of tolerance the province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, which I have no doubt is all that 
     <lb/>
     he claims for it ; but it did not strike me 
     <lb/>
     that the attitude he took in passing legisla<lb break="no"/>tion which was going to kill what it was 
     <lb/>
     going to create was a very tolerant atti<lb break="no"/>tude. I think I can say for my own con<lb break="no"/>stituents that they will exercise as much 
     <lb/>
     tolerance and give as much fair-play to 
     <lb/>
     the minority in that country as any class 
     <lb/>
     of people that can be found in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     If you come with me to the foot-hills of the 
     <lb/>
     Rocky Mountains, you will find there public 
     <lb/>
     school boys from Eton, Harrow and Char<lb break="no"/>terhouse ; Cheltenham and Clifton in city 
     <lb/>
     of Calgary ; those for whom I can claim 
     <lb/>
     just as much intellect and spirit of fairness 
     <lb/>
     as can be found in the people of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia.  
     <lb/>

            <p>
     I have been surprised to hear the state<lb break="no"/>ment made by some people that many im<lb break="no"/>migrants have come into that country on 
     <lb/>
     the faith of that Act of 1875, or of these 
     <lb/>
     ordinances existing in the Territories at pre<lb break="no"/>sent. Well, Mr. Speaker, while I believe 
     <lb/>
     that the people of that country are as good 
     <lb/>
     and as law-abiding as they are anywhere 
     <lb/>
     else, I am convinced that it is not the con<lb break="no"/>dition of the schools out there which has 
     <lb/>
     attracted the young men to it. What has 
     <lb/>
     attracted immigration is the land and the 
     <lb/>
     great possibilities in that country, and 
     <lb/>
     the settler always knows that if the edu<lb break="no"/>cational facilities do not suit him, he is 
     <lb/>
     at liberty to return home again. If you 
     <lb/>
     will take the statements issued by the land 
     <lb/>
     agent giving replies to the many inquiries 
     <lb/>
     sent to them, you will not find in any one 
     <lb/>
     of them any reference to the schools, sep<lb break="no"/>arate or otherwise, which is most convinc<lb break="no"/>ing proof that the school question has no<lb break="no"/>thing to do with the influx of settlers. Let 
     <lb/>
     me also point out that if people are com<lb break="no"/>ing into that country under misrepresenta<lb break="no"/>tions regarding the schools, then the liter<lb break="no"/>ature issued by the Department of the In<lb break="no"/>terior must be misleading because it states 
     <lb/>

     the schools out there are non- sectarian and 
     <lb/>
     national. In this connection, I would also 
     <lb/>
     draw attention to the fact that the great 
     <lb/>
    mass of immigration to-day is from the 
     <lb/>United States, where there are no separate 
     <lb/>schools. Therefore, the argument that cer<lb break="no"/>tain people have come out there by virtue 
     <lb/>of representations regarding a system of 
     <lb/>separate schools, is not borne out by facts.  
     <lb/>The hon. the Minister of Finance stated 
     <lb/>that he would be quite willing to accept the 
     <lb/>views of seven out of the ten representa<lb break="no"/>tives coming from the Territories. Let me 
     <lb/>congratulate him and the government on 
     <lb/>their change of front, because they have not 
     <lb/>always been ready to accept these views. 
     <lb/>If they had, we would like to know whe<lb break="no"/>ther the seven gentlemen from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories are responsible for this 
     <lb/>legislation, because it is generally under<lb break="no"/>stood that they stood out against it until it 
     <lb/>was amended. But if there are seven gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen from the Territories who say that 
     <lb/>the people out there are satisfied with a sep<lb break="no"/>arate school system and want that system 
     <lb/>to be continued and are in favour of having 
     <lb/>the right to establish any system they please 
     <lb/>taken from them, let me tell you that that 
     <lb/>has not always been the case, because the 
     <lb/>hon. members from Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) 
     <lb/>and East Assiniboia (Mr. Turriff) voted in 
     <lb/>the local legislature up there to cut out 
     <lb/>everything in the Act of 1875 after the 
     <lb/>word ' education,' which would have the 
     <lb/>effect of handing that matter entirely over 
     <lb/>to the local legislature. I would also sug<lb break="no"/>gest that if the government desire to feel 
     <lb/>the pulse of the people on the question, let 
     <lb/>them open up a constituency there and 
     <lb/>appeal to the electors. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     I see that the hour is getting late and 
     <lb/>
     I do not desire to trespass too much upon 
     <lb/>
     the time of this House, but there are cer<lb break="no"/>tain matters which I feel bound to bring 
     <lb/>
     to its attention; and if I am transgressing 
     <lb/>
     the time allotted a new member, I shall 
     <lb/>
     only have to appeal to the indulgence of 
     <lb/>
     the House and point to the fact that there 
     <lb/>
     are none but new members on the Conser<lb break="no"/>vative side from the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     There are certain other important features 
     <lb/>
     in this Bill to which I wish to refer. There 
     <lb/>
     is first the placing of the boundary line 
     <lb/>
     at the fourth meridian. A few days ago 
     <lb/>
     I called attention to a resolution passed at 
     <lb/>
     a public meeting in the town of Medicine 
     <lb/>
     Hat which pointed out the objections to this 
     <lb/>
     line. My hon. friend from Brandon (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton) let the cat out of the bag the other 
     <lb/>
     day when he said he was of the opinion 
     <lb/>
     that the dividing line should be sixty miles 
     <lb/>
     further east. Thus we see the disadvan<lb break="no"/>tage of not having in this cabinet a repre<lb break="no"/>sentative from the west. I was accused 
     <lb/>
     of having indulged in ill-natured criticism 
     <lb/>
     the other day when I said that the minister 
     <lb/>
     who was in charge of the Territories should 
     <lb/>
     have been consulted, but I certainly did 
     <lb/>
     not intend to make any ill-natured reflec<lb break="no"/>
    

            <cb/>
        

     tion, and shall continue to call the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the government at every opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     the injustice they are inflicting on the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories in not filling the vacant portfolio. 
     <lb/>
     To-day we are in this position that there 
     <lb/>
     is not a man in the cabinet west of the 
     <lb/>
     city of London, Ont., except one, and that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is only half in. And the result 
     <lb/>
     of having no man in the cabinet charged 
     <lb/>
     with the supervision of the task of dividing 
     <lb/>
     that country has been that local interests 
     <lb/>
     have been allowed to prevail. The boun<lb break="no"/>daries have been fixed to suit particular 
     <lb/>
     localities without regard to the ranching 
     <lb/>
     industry or anything else. It will be found, 
     <lb/>
     on examining the map published by the De<lb break="no"/>partment of the Interior, that only a very 
     <lb/>
     small amount of the ranching country re<lb break="no"/>mains to-day in the eastern province, and 
     <lb/>
     the danger will be that the ranching indus<lb break="no"/>try, which is a very important one, will 
     <lb/>not be sufficiently represented in the local 
     <lb/>House to have its interests properly looked 
     <lb/>after. That industry in the eastern prov<lb break="no"/>ince will be a mere side issue. Take, for 
     <lb/>instance, the difficulties which will probably 
     <lb/>arise out of conflicting branding laws. That 
     <lb/>may seem a very small matter to the man 
     <lb/>in the east, but it is very important to the 
     <lb/>west. The other day it was pointed out, 
     <lb/>in the discussion of an Order in Council 
     <lb/>passed by the Department of Agriculture, 
     <lb/>that 411,000 cattle, were treated under that 
     <lb/>order in an area practically abutting this 
     <lb/>dividing line. The badge of ownership to-day 
     <lb/>in that country is the brand, and the result 
     <lb/>of drawing this line and so splitting up 
     <lb/>the ranching country will be a conflict 
     <lb/>of brands. One province may or may 
     <lb/>not enact a branding law. One province 
     <lb/>may declare that cattle and horses not 
     <lb/>branded may be sold irrespective of the 
     <lb/>owner, and you will have a conflict in that 
     <lb/>way, whereas if the line went a little bit 
     <lb/>further east, where the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior says it should go, that difficulty 
     <lb/>would not arise and you would include 
     <lb/>practically all the ranching country in the 
     <lb/>western province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Again, one province may adopt a free open 
     <lb/>
     range, while the other may make restric<lb break="no"/>tions. We have the same difficulty to-day 
     <lb/>
     on the international boundary, although 
     <lb/>
     there is the same grazing country on the 
     <lb/>
     boundary as we have at the dividing line 
     <lb/>
     of the two provinces, and although we have 
     <lb/>
     customs officers and the mounted police who 
     <lb/>
     assist in keeping matters in order. Yet dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties have always arisen. Another dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty we are creating is that you will leave 
     <lb/>
     such a very little portion of the irrigated 
     <lb/>
     land in the eastern province that it will be 
     <lb/>
     hardly worth while passing legislation 
     <lb/>
     respecting it. While that difficulty may 
     <lb/>
     be got over by the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill under which the matters are left 
     <lb/>
     with the federal administration. But, if I 
     <lb/>
     understood the ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
   

            <pb n="3357" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3357.jpg"/>

     (Mr. Sifton) correctly, he stated that it was 
     <lb/>
     only for the time being that this was going 
     <lb/>
     to be retained, but that in time to come, 
     <lb/>
     after certain international difficulties had 
     <lb/>
     disappeared this jurisdiction would be hand<lb break="no"/>ed back to the provinces. As the dividing 
     <lb/>
     line runs now the area of the two provinces 
     <lb/>
     will show a considerable difference. As I 
     <lb/>
     figure it the area of the eastern province 
     <lb/>
    will be 258,400 square miles and that of the  
     <lb/>western province 249,600, or a difference of 
     <lb/>8,800 square miles. So, this line must have 
     <lb/>been crowded west for some purpose and 
     <lb/>perhaps I may be able to point out before 
     <lb/>I sit down what that was for. I desire 
     <lb/>also to call attention of the advisability of 
     <lb/>including in the new provinces the great 
     <lb/>northern country. I pointed out that no 
     <lb/>man in the west but would hope that their 
     <lb/>great expectations would be realized, yet 
     <lb/>to-day in view of what the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>has said we cannot consider that an agri<lb break="no"/>cultural country. I have already shown 
     <lb/>that the census of 1901 shows that the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of Athabaska was 242 white people, 
     <lb/>2,395 half-breeds and 3,700 Indians, and 
     <lb/>262 unspecified. Now, there may have been 
     <lb/>people who have gone in there since 1901, 
     <lb/> but there are also people who have come 
     <lb/>out. To my mind the very best evidence 
     <lb/>that there is not much permanent settle<lb break="no"/>ment in that country is seen in looking at 
     <lb/>the map published by the Department of 
     <lb/>the Interior only a year ago. We find that 
     <lb/>land does not appear to have been surveyed. 
     <lb/>There may have been preliminary surveys, 
     <lb/>but from the map as it stands, we do not 
     <lb/>find any township subdivisions. And a man 
     <lb/>cannot go very far wrong in saying that 
     <lb/>there will not be much permanent settle<lb break="no"/>ment where there is no assurance of title. 
     <lb/>Settlers do not squat to-day in advance 
     <lb/>of survey. And the conditions of the coun<lb break="no"/>try are not such as will make the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration cheaply handled by the provincial 
     <lb/>government. It is not that the people of 
     <lb/>the new provinces are desirous of shirking 
     <lb/>the duties of administering it, but the dis<lb break="no"/>trict to the north of the provinces will be 
     <lb/>still under Dominion administration. It 
     <lb/>would cost practically very little to admin<lb break="no"/>ister this through the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The questions that will arise will 
     <lb/>be mainly interprovincial. Take the 
     <lb/>regulation and preservation of the fur 
     <lb/>trade, for instance. Suppose that one 
     <lb/>province establishes a certain close sea<lb break="no"/>son for certain animals while the other 
     <lb/>does not ; and the Dominion government 
     <lb/>may have a different law with regard 
     <lb/>to the same matter further north. If the 
     <lb/>inland fisheries are handed over to the new 
     <lb/>provinces, the same difficulty is likely to 
     <lb/>arise in regard to these–there will be the 
     <lb/>same conflict of jurisdiction. I have spoken 
     <lb/>of the boundaries not having been fixed 
     <lb/>with a view to economical and efficient ad<lb break="no"/>ministration. It seems to me that political 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
      

     considerations have had a great deal to do 
     <lb/>
     with the making of the eastern boundary. 
     <lb/>
     If we look at the map and see the dividing 
     <lb/>
     line ; it will be found, if you take the 
     <lb/>
     Rocky Mountains out of the western province, 
     <lb/>
     the western province is practically a triangle 
     <lb/>
     with the apex at the south. And, if you 
     <lb/>
     look at the election returns, you will find 
     <lb/>
     that the south elects two Conservatives and 
     <lb/>
     the north two Liberals. Now, I submit, in 
     <lb/>
     all fairness, that considerations of this kind 
     <lb/>
     should not interfere when you are creating 
     <lb/>
    limits to provinces for all time to come. It 
     <lb/>seems to me that the fathers of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion sat down in a spirit of give and take 
     <lb/>and tried to make a compact free from po<lb break="no"/>litical consideration ; and I think that is an 
     <lb/>example that might well be followed. The 
     <lb/>result of making these boundaries for the 
     <lb/>western province is that the further north 
     <lb/>you go the greater the Liberal majority. 
     <lb/>And that is the reason why the line is fixed 
     <lb/>sixty miles west of where the hon. member 
     <lb/>for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) thinks it ought to 
     <lb/>be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     There is only one other question I wish 
     <lb/>
     to refer to for a moment, and it is the selec<lb break="no"/>tion of the provisional capital. The First 
     <lb/>Minister when he introduced the Bill stated 
     <lb/>that this was a matter that gave them 
     <lb/>some trouble, but they looked at the map 
     <lb/>and selected the centre. Well, if that is the 
     <lb/>principle that governed and they are select<lb break="no"/>ing the centre, why did they not select Ath<lb break="no"/>abaska Landing, for that is the centre and 
     <lb/>it would be more convenient for the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of Athabaska to whom I referred a 
     <lb/>few moments ago. If he wishes to consider 
     <lb/>the convenience of the people let him take 
     <lb/>a point half way between Edmonton and 
     <lb/>any point on the main line of the Canadian 
     <lb/>Pacific Railway, and he will find in the 
     <lb/>southern portion there are constructed 980 
     <lb/>miles of railway, and in the northern only 
     <lb/>150 miles. I introduced the deputation 
     <lb/>from Calgary who interviewed the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the government and asked 
     <lb/>them to select a non-competitive point as 
     <lb/>the provisional capital.  They suggested 
     <lb/>the selection of Medicine Hat, Banff, 
     <lb/>Lethbridge, Macleod, Red Deer or any 
     <lb/>other point that would be near the 
     <lb/>centre of trade and the centre of popula<lb break="no"/>tion, and that would meet the convenience 
     <lb/>of the people whose business called them 
     <lb/>to the capital and the convenience of the 
     <lb/>members of the first legislature. But, for 
     <lb/>some reason, I cannot say what, the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment has seen fit to select the point at 
     <lb/>the end of railway construction and away 
     <lb/>from what I hope to be able to show when 
     <lb/>the clause comes up in committee is the 
     <lb/>centre of trade and the centre of population. 
     <lb/>If it is the convenience of the people that 
     <lb/>is being considered, I would ask the First 
     <lb/>Minister to look at the map again and to 
     <lb/>look at the distribution in the local House 
     <lb/>for Alberta. In the local House there are 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="3359" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-28_Page_3359.jpg"/>
          <fw type="num">3359</fw>  <fw type="num">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3360</fw>
          

     35 representatives; 14 of these come from 
     <lb/>
     Alberta and of these Alberta constituencies 
     <lb/>
     only three, and but a small portion of these 
     <lb/>
     three, run north of Edmonton, while 11 are 
     <lb/>
     south of Edmonton. I must ask the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister to again look at the map if the 
     <lb/>
     convenience of the people is being consulted. 
     <lb/>
     But, in conclusion, let me say that I desire 
     <lb/>
     to congratulate the government for being 
     <lb/>
     original for once, because surely if the con<lb break="no"/>venience of the people had been consulted 
     <lb/>
     in the choice of a site for the capital it 
     <lb/>
     would have been placed at the centre of 
     <lb/>
     population and trade. The  government's 
     <lb/>
     manner of selecting a central point is an 
     <lb/>
     original one. The method adopted in this 
     <lb/>
     case would not have led the people of On<lb break="no"/>tario to select Toronto instead of Whitefish 
     <lb/>
     or some other point on Lake Superior, the 
     <lb/>
     people of Quebec to select Quebec, the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Manitoba to select Winnipeg, or the 
     <lb/>
     people of British Columbia to select Vic<lb break="no"/>toria on Vancouver Island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is but one other question on which 
     <lb/>
     I wish to touch, that is the financial terms. 
     <lb/>
     I am glad in that to be able to agree with 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver). 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me that in discussing these terms 
     <lb/>
     it is not fair to make comparisons with the 
     <lb/>
     terms of eastern provinces. The conditions 
     <lb/>
     are altogether different. In the west school 
     <lb/>
     houses and roads have to be provided, mat<lb break="no"/>ters which are done in Ontario and Quebec 
     <lb/>
     by local taxation which it is practically 
     <lb/>
     impossible to do in that country by reason 
     <lb/>
     of the great distances. The financial terms 
     <lb/>
     in comparison with those granted to the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces are none too generous, and 
     <lb/>
     the development of that country is proceed<lb break="no"/>ing at such a rate that it is impossible for 
     <lb/>
     us to sit here and calculate what its future 
     <lb/>
     needs will be.

     knows, in the Criminal Code of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     1892, it is provided that there shall be an 
     <lb/>
     appeal from any judgment or any verdict 
     <lb/>
     given by any court of criminal jurisdiction, 
     <lb/>
     whether this court has an inferior or a 
     <lb/>
     superior jurisdiction in criminal matters. 
     <lb/>
     If hon. gentlemen will look up articles 742, 
     <lb/>
     743 and 782, they will see that there is an 
     <lb/>
     appeal from any verdict or judgment given 
     <lb/>
     by a court having superior jurisdiction in 
     <lb/>
     criminal matters. There is an appeal in 
     <lb/>
     cases of jury trial, summary trial and 
     <lb/>
     speedy trial, whether the case is proceeded 
     <lb/>
     with under articles 742, 743 or 782, or under 
     <lb/>
     articles 659, 765, 782, 783 or 842 of the Crimi<lb break="no"/>nal Code. Then, in cases of summary con<lb break="no"/>viction, under article 879, there is an ap<lb break="no"/>peal under certain conditions and in accord<lb break="no"/>ance with certain formalities. All the liti<lb break="no"/>gants who have had anything to do with 
     <lb/>
     the application of the Canada Temperance 
     <lb/>
     Act have been complaining about the denial 
     <lb/>
     of an appeal. This feature of the law is 
     <lb/>
     enacted in section 119 of chapter 106 of the 
     <lb/>
     Revised Statutes of Canada as amended by 
     <lb/>
     the Act 51 Victoria, chapter 34. We 
     <lb/>
     think, and everybody thinks, that it is most 
     <lb/>
     unfair and unjust that the right of appeal 
     <lb/>
     which is given under the criminal law in 
     <lb/>
     any case should have been denied under 
     <lb/>
     section 119 of the Canada Temperance Act. 
     <lb/>
     Even in a case of summary conviction, in 
     <lb/>
     which the accused is condemned to pay a 
     <lb/>
     fine of $5 or go to jail for one day, he has 
     <lb/>
     the right of appeal, while, on the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     under section 119 he has no such right of 
     <lb/>
     appeal in most cases, though he may have 
     <lb/>
     been fined heavily or condemned to a long 
     <lb/>
     imprisonment. We desire this amendment 
     <lb/>
     so that the law giving the right of appeal 
     <lb/>
     in ordinary cases shall be made applicable 
     <lb/>
     to the Canada Temperance Act. Moreover, 
     <lb/>
     by this amendment, we wish that no liti<lb break="no"/>gant having to appear either before a 
     <lb/>
     criminal court or a civil court, be denied 
     <lb/>
     that useful remedy, the British writ of 
     <lb/>
     ' certiorari.'

     Motion agreed to, and Bill read the first

     time.
