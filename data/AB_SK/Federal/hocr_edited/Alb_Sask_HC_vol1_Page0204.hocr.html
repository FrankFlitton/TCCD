<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> very well consider carefully our ﬁnancial
<br />
position in undertaking to spread. civiliza- <br />
tion and improvement over these very much <br />
vaster areas under our conditions. We <br />
knew that we must have the means or we <br />
cannot have the success. We must have <br />
the means with which to build roads, to <br />
provide schools, to take care of all these <br />
requirements of civilization which fall to <br />
the lot of the provinces ; and without those <br />
means, without that money, if we cannot <br />
go forward as provinces, we had better not <br />
undertake the responsibility of it. We ﬁnd <br />
that in the condition in which we are at <br />
the present time the Territories receive a <br />
matter of nearly a million and a quarter <br />
dollars of. revenue from this Dominion, or <br />
of subsidy, in the place of a provincial sub- <br />
sidy. Outside of that, there are expendi- <br />
tures which, in the provinces, are borne <br />
out of the provincial funds, but which, so <br />
far, have come out of the Dominion treasury, <br />
and which aggregate something like half a <br />
million dollars. At the present time, con- <br />
sidering the Territories as a province, we <br />
are receiving as a subsidy from the Do-<br />
minion treasury, a matter of a million and <br />
three-quarters <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> money. Now,
compare that <br />
with the subsidy received by any of the <br />
other provinces. We ﬁnd that Ontario re- <br />
ceives a subsidy of a little less than a mil- <br />
lion and a half, Quebec a little over a mil- <br />
lion, Nova Scotia under half a million, New <br />
Brunswick under half a million, Manitoba <br />
a little over halt a million, British Colum- <br />
bia $300,000 and Prince Edward Isﬂand <br />
$200,000, the two larger of these with popu-<br />
lations inﬁnitely greater than that of the <br />
Northwest Territories. As I said, in the <br />
Northwest Territories we are not receiving <br />
more money than is necessary for the <br />
development and improvement of the <br />
country. Out of the money that we <br />
are receiving, and which bulks so large, <br />
comparatively as current <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditure,</span>
<br />
has to be provided a great deal of what <br />
would ordinarily be considered capital ex- <br />
penditure. Surely it was reasonable on <br />
our part to say that, considering the sub- <br />
sidies given to the provinces, considering <br />
that these subsidies are based on population <br />
very largely, considering the needs of that <br />
great western country in the immediate <br />
future, considering further that our popu- <br />
lation was increasing so rapidly and <br />
that, with the increase of population, <br />
we could claim continually more fav- <br />
ourable ﬁnancial terms, we had everything <br />
to gain by waiting for provincial autonomy <br />
and nothing to lose. I will not trouble the <br />
House to evidence that fact by comparing <br />
the terms demanded by the Northwest gov- <br />
ernment itself in 1901 and again in 1903. <br />
Because this government did not grant to <br />
the Northwest Territories the autonomy <br />
that was asked for in 1901, in the space of <br />
fourteen months they had made something <br />
like a quarter of a million dollars a year. I <br />
thought if we could, by waiting a matter of <br />
fourteen months, increase our annual <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. OLIVER. I believe the government <br />
of the Territories has made certain demands <br />
for provincial autonomy. I have shown the <br />
House how wise these demands were by <br />
comparing the demand of one year with the <br />
demand of the succeeding year. I am not <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible</span> for what the
government of the <br />
Northwest Territories have done. I repre- <br />
sent a section of the people of the North-<br />
west Territories, and I say that the people <br />
of the Northwest Territories have never <br />
asked for provincial autonomy. However, <br />
if it seems good to the parliament of Canada <br />
and to the government of this Dominion to <br />
organize these Territories into provinces and <br />
to give them fair and reasonable ﬁnancial <br />
consideration, certainly we are not the peo- <br />
ple to refuse that consideration or to refuse <br />
those reasonable ﬁnancial terms. We be- <br />
lieve that the terms which have been offer- <br />
ed, and which are contained in the Autonomy <br />
Bills, are fair and reasonable ﬁnancial <br />
terms, are such as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> can
conscientiously <br />
afford to accept, and such as will be a bene- <br />
ﬁt to the people of those Territories, and <br />
will tend to the improvement of the coun- <br />
try. We would be doing less than our duty ; <br />
we would be poor friends of our Dominion, <br />
if we willingly accepted anything short of <br />
a liberal allowance for provincial purposes <br />
in these Territories. As the ex-Minister of <br />
the Interior has said, it is on the develop- <br />
ment of these Territories that the prosperi- <br />
ty of this whole Dominion depends. He <br />
would be the worst friend the Dominion had, <br />
who would prevent the progress of civiliza- <br />
tion in these provinces by stinting the means <br />
whereby that can be obtained. I shall not <br />
go into a comparison with the subsidies <br />
which are given the other provinces, ex- <br />
cept to repeat that the conditions in the <br />
Territories are so different from those in the <br />
other provinces—such a small population <br />
