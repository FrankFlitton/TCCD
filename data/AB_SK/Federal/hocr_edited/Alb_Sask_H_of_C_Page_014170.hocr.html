               particular time, which he calls—improperly 
               <br />
               I think—the union, he is obliged under the 
               <br />
               constitution to provide in the Bills now be- 
               <br />
               fore us for the continuation of the system 
               <br />
               of separate schools. Now, my understanding 
               <br />
               of the constitution is that subsections 2 and 
               <br />
               3 of clause 93 of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act was intended to apply to provinces that 
               <br />
               had provincial autonomy before entering 
               <br />
               the union. Even at the time of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion there were provinces, Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island and British Columbia, which did not 
               <br />
               then enter the union, but which have entered 
               <br />
               since. Had either of these had a system of 
               <br />
               separate schools before entering the union, 
               <br />
               these subsections of clause 93 would apply, 
               <br />
as it applied also to Ontario and Quebec. 
               <br />
But these subsections do not apply in 
               <br />
               the case before us at all. Because, these 
               <br />
               provinces are being carved out of territory 
               <br />
               that is already in the union, and never had 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy, but has had only such 
               <br />
               legislative authority as was delegated by 
               <br />
               this parliament under laws made in 1875 
               <br />
               and later. The contention of the First 
               <br />
               Minister, as I have said, is that because 
               <br />
               they have separate schools we must per- 
               <br />
               petuate that system. But is that the con-

               tention of the Finance Minister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Field-

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">FIELDING.</span> I thought I had dealt

               ed to-day. I need not ask the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance how long he has taken to analyze 
               <br />
               this Bill and reach the conclusion he has

               reached? We were told he did not see in the

               light in which he now sees it until a short 
               <br />
               time ago. He may claim to be excused on

               schools and allow the provinces to legislate
