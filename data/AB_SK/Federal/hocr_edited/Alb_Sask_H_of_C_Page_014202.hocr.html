goes to prove that interpretation and there <br />
is no other interpretation possible because <br />
anybody who takes the trouble to read <br />
from end to end the ordinances of the <br />
Northwest Territories in respect to schools <br />
must arrive necessarily at that- conviction. <br />
I do not know what distinction there <br />
would be between what are called separate <br />
schools and public schools. They are not <br />
separate schools in the sense that we or- <br />
dinarily understand the term. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. MONK. They are not denomination- <br />
al schools; certainly not. So, I do not see <br />
in the last enactment that there is any con- <br />
cession—very far from it. I think the last <br />
amendment goes perhaps a little farther <br />
than the original enactment which caused <br />
so much excitement because it deﬁnes more <br />
clearly what the privileges of the separate <br />
schools are. They were not deﬁned at all <br />
in the original enactment. It deﬁnes them <br />
by reference to the chapters of the North- <br />
west Ordinances where they are fully ex- <br />
plained so that it deﬁnes more clearly these <br />
privileges and it may be argued that it se- <br />
cures to the separate schools the right <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
<br />
religious instruction. I am not just sure <br />
under the ﬁrst enactment it would not have <br />
been possible to say in the Northwest Ter-<br />
ritories: You have the right to separate <br />
schools, that is granted, you will have them <br />
but you have no right even to the half hour <br />
of religious instruction because it is not <br />
laid down in the bond. It is not in the <br />
Dominion enactment and we will withdraw <br />
that right from you. This enactment goes <br />
a little farther because it refers to the or- <br />
dinance which secures the right of religious <br />
instruction. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Will you just allow me to say one word <br />
in regard to What has been referred to by <br />
my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bouras- <br />

Bill <br />

I may go a step farther. That section forms <br />
part of the constitution, it is true, but I <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> perience of Manitoba. Surely no case of <br />
any province could be presented in which <br />
greater precautions had been taken than <br />
were taken at the time of the creation or <br />
Manitoba for the maintenance of the <br />
rights of the minority. Everybody <br />
knows what happened. I will not re- <br />
peat the story of that unfortunate affair, <br />
but, as a matter of fact, by legislation of <br />
the province, the rights of the minority were <br />
taken away. They were taken away after. <br />
every assurance had been given to that <br />
minority that their rights would be preserv- <br />
ed. There never was anything to my mind <br />
more unworthy than the action of the Mani- <br />
toba legislature in abolishing its legislative <br />
council, and at the time of that abolition <br />
giving the minority who helped to put <br />
through that abolition, every possible assur- <br />
ance that honourable men could give that <br />
at no time would their privileges be inter-<br />
fered with. They were taken away. The <br />
minority carried their claims before the <br />
courts. Ultimately, after an endless liti- <br />
gation, the highest court in the realm de- <br />
clared that they had a right to redress. <br />
That judgment of the Privy Council render- <br />
ed years ago remains, as the members of. <br />
this House know, unsatisﬁed to this day. <br />
Does that not give to those whose mission <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perhaps</span> more particularly it is
to secure <br />
the rights of the minority in these new <br />
provinces, the right to take every imagin- <br />
able precaution in order that those rights <br />
should be maintained even in the North- <br />
west? And I say this with due regard <br />
ts the people of the Northwest, because I <br />
have implicit conﬁdence in that population. <br />
I hope on this occasion at any rate that <br />
conﬁdence will not be misplaced. I know <br />
the disposition of the people who inhabit <br />
that large territory. They are generous, <br />
they are broad-minded, and I have every <br />
conﬁdence—because, as any educationist <br />
knows, everything depends on the way in <br />
which an education law is administered— <br />
that they will treat that minority with <br />
justice. But we must admit that after the <br />
Act of 1875 had been passed, and after the <br />
Act of 1880 had been passed, the North- <br />
west legislature did confer rights <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span>
<br />
the minority—gave them a council of public <br />
instruction, gave them certain rights with- <br />
out which up to the present it has been <br />
considered impossible, by the minority, to <br />
carry on Catholic education, and they had <br />
the use of the French language. These <br />
things have been taken away, and, in reality <br />
as was said yesterday, what we are endea- <br />
vouring to preserve for them is merely the <br />
right to the material separation of schools, <br />
the right to be exempt from double taxa- <br />
tion in educational matters, to which Catho- <br />
lics are subject all over the United States, <br />
and the right to that half-hour of religious <br />
instruction at the end of the day which <br />
exists in the Northwest for all denomina- <br />
tions alike, I am happy to say, because I am <br />
