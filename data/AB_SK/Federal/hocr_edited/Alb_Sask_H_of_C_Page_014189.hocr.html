               <br />
               other gentlemen to whom my hon. friend 
               <br />
               has alluded, I was against the coercion of 
               <br />
               Manitoba; I said it would be an infringe- 
               <br />
               ment of provincial rights why? Because 
               <br />
               I did not sympathize with the minority '? 
               <br />

               No. Why. then '? For the same reason that 
               <br />
               actuated the other gentlemen and actuated 
               <br />
               the Liberal party. It 'had been declared 
               <br />
               by the court of last resort, the Judicial Com- 
               <br />
               mittee of the Privy Council, that, as it 
               <br />
               seemed to the minority in that province, 
               <br />

               their rights had been abrogated by the Bill 
               <br />
               that had been passed by the Manitoba le— 
               <br />
               gislature, but that nevertheless the Manito— 
               <br />
               ba legislature had acted within its powers, 
               <br />
               that, acting within its powers, it must be 
               <br />
               the judge, and that therefore it was inex- 
               <br />

               pedient and would be against provincial 
               <br />
               rights, to pass a law in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the </span>Dominion 
               <br />
               parliament which. would set aside, override, 
               <br />
               super-cede, legislation passed by a provin- 
               <br />
               cial legislature which was entirely within 
               <br />

               its competence. That, Sir, was the reason 
               <br />
               we opposed interference. Now, I have not 
               <br />
               read what I said on that occasion, if it is 
               <br />
               recorded anywhere; I have not had time. 
               <br />
               I have not even read the utterances of other 
               <br />
               gentlemen, as some of the hon. gentlemen 
               <br />

               opposite have done; but if there are any 
               <br />
               recorded utterances of mine, I have no 
               <br />
               doubt that they will be found to be in the 
               <br />
               direction in which I have spoken. That 
               <br />
               position I took, and for that position I con- 
               <br />
               tended; and in supporting this Bill, am I 
               <br />

               taking back anything I said at that time? 
               <br />
               Am I in a position different from what I 
               <br />
               was in at that time ? Am I now an oppon- 
               <br />
               ent of provincial rights? Am I now sup— 
               <br />
               porting the Bill to override an enactment 
               <br />
               passed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> a legislature having full compe- 
               <br />

               tence to pass that enactment? Nothing of 
               <br />
               the kind. There is no such proposition; 
               <br />
               the cases are not parallel. Find the strong- 
               <br />
               est utterance you can, made by any mem- 
               <br />
               ber of the Liberal party in defence of the 
               <br />
               provincial rights of Manitoba and the deci- 
               <br />

               sion of the Privy Council, and you will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               it none too strong, unless it was couched in 
               <br />
               offensive language, as I trust none was. 
               <br />
               But to claim, as we heard it claimed this 
               <br />
               afternoon, that the present measure is an 
               <br />
               invasion of provincial rights, is something 
               <br />

               that I cannot understand. What law of the 
               <br />
               Territories that are about to become pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are we seeking to override ? It is 
               <br />
               said : you are passing a law—which is true. 
               <br />
               But what law of the Territories are we 
               <br />
               passing a law to do away with?

               government, and the members of the North- 
               <br />

               <br />
               it ? No; simply to continue it. Talk about 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain not having been consulted. 
               <br />

               He says he was consulted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twice:</span> but 
               <br />
               if he had never been consulted, if no North-

               <br />
               west Territories than their own legislation ? 
               <br />
               It may be said that Mr. Haultain has stated 
               <br />
               that he thinks this question should be left 
               <br />
               to the provincial legislature. But, if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">corr-</span>

               to the legislatures of the provinces when 
               <br />
               constituted, would they change the law ? 
               <br />
               His answer was, if I remember rightly  
               <br />
               ‘If I were a dictator to-morrow, I would 
               <br />
               not change it.’ Yet these gentlemen talk

               about provincial rights being invaded by 
               <br />

               <br />
               say that the law passed by the Territories 
               <br />
               provides for separate schools—and so it does. 
               <br />
               And this Dominion parliament in 1875 said 
               <br />

               that there should be privileges given to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minorities,</span> whether Protestant or Catholic, 
               <br />
               in the country to form separate schools if 
               <br />
               they so desired.
