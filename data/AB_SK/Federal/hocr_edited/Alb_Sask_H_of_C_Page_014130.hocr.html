<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> But a strange thing happened in the
legis- <br />
lature of Canada. It was at the time when <br />
we had a representation from Lower Canada <br />
and a representation from Upper Canada. <br />
A similar Bill was introduced immediately <br />
for the province of Upper Canada. This was <br />
strongly resisted and so strongly was it re- <br />
sisted that the two Bills were withdrawn. <br />
Thereupon Mr. Galt resigned his position <br />
as a member of the government of the day <br />
because he had not been able to improve <br />
the situation of the minority to which he <br />
belonged by legislation before the Act of <br />
confederation came into operation. Then <br />
what took place ? Of course, there was a <br />
great deal of commotion at that time and <br />
the Protestant minority of Quebec felt <br />
disinclined to enter confederation unless <br />
their rights were secured as they thought <br />
they ought to be secured. Mr. Galt was <br />
appointed to go to England with Sir John <br />
Macdonald, Sir Geo. Cartier and others in <br />
order to frame the Act which was to be the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> of Confederation. At that
time the <br />
  'Montreal Gazette' was the principal as to- <br />
day it is the most important organ of the <br />
Conservative party. It spoke for Mr. Galt <br />
and on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">24th</span> October, 1866,
the ‘Mon- <br />
treal Gazette’ contained the following <br />
article : <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_8" title="bbox 228 1318 952 1348">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> We have much pleasure in announcing that <br />
during the recent protracted sittings of the <br />
cabinet at Ottawa, the subject of the position <br />
of the Lower Canada education question was <br />
very fully considered. The ministry were, we <br />
understand. desirous that Mr. Galt should be <br />
appointed as a delegate to represent the in- <br />
terests of the British population, but that gen- <br />
tleman felt that he could not accept unless he <br />
was assured as to the views of the government <br />
on the points that so seriously concern his <br />
countrymen and co-religionists, and which so <br />
deeply roused their feelings. We are informed <br />
that the ministry entirely satisﬁed Mr. Galt of <br />
their determination to give practical effect to the <br />
pledges given in parliament, and the gentleman <br />
has in consequence accepted the appointment <br />
of delegate for the express purpose of watching <br />
over these important interests, as well as of <br />
lending his aid to the consummation of the <br />
measure of confederation. <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_10" title="bbox 196 1379 954 2278">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> We feel that our Protestant friends may
rest <br />
assured that the man who resigned the honours <br />
and emoluments of office on this question will <br />
not, as a delegate, be found wanting to his <br />
trust as their representative. And we hail with <br />
great satisfaction the approaching settlement <br />
of a question which might have been fraught <br />
with so much danger to the kindly and cordial <br />
relations which have of late so happily sub- <br />
sisted between the people of different races and <br />
creeds in Canada. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Galt went to England as a delegate. <br />
We know as a matter of history that he <br />
contributed to the drafting of section 93 <br />
of the British North America Act, and those <br />
of us who have read Mr. Pope’s book upon <br />
the debates preliminary to confederation <br />
know that as a matter of history the 3rd <br />
and 4th subsections of section 93, the sub- <br />
sections which give the right of appeal, are <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_14" title="bbox 982 279 1746 623">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> even in his own handwriting. Therefore it
<br />
is to him that we have section 93 in its <br />
present form. As to that let me call the <br />
attention of the House to another extract <br />
from the ‘Montreal Gazette’ of March 2nd, <br />
1867. Either that day or the day before <br />
the ‘Montreal Gazette’ had published the <br />
whole text of the Bill which afterwards <br />
bcame the Confederation Act and it accom- <br />
panied this with the following comment: <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_15" title="bbox 979 639 1744 1874">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Few questions have excited a more lively
in- <br />
terest in this country than the education of <br />
children in public schools, or, perhaps, it would <br />
be more accurate to say, the appropriation of <br />
taxation for that purpose. We need not repeat <br />
the particulars of the agitation on the subject, <br />
which commenced with the promulgation of the <br />
resolutions of the conference of Quebec, and re- <br />
sulted in Mr. Galt resigning his seat in the <br />
cabinet. The short of the story is, all this led <br />
to an agreement on the part of the Canadian <br />
government to advise Her Majesty’s ministers <br />
to insert in the Union Bill the provisions with <br />
which the public are, undoubtedly, already <br />
aware. That was the agreement to which we <br />
referred, in October last, as having been satis- <br />
factory to Mr. Galt, and on the strength of <br />
which he consented to become a delegate to <br />
London. The public may ﬁnd in these provi- <br />
sions in the Bill the proof of the statement <br />
made by us, which some of our contemporaries, <br />
without any evidence, undertook to call in ques- <br />
tion. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Before the question of confederation was <br />
mooted, the constant cry on the part of a por- <br />
tion of Lower Canada Protestant minority, was: <br />
give us the same privileges as those enjoyed <br />
by the Upper Canada minority. Well, the Bill <br />
as it stands, in terms, provides that the min- <br />
ority in Lower Canada shall have precisely the <br />
same privileges as the minority in Upper Can- <br />
ada. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> And further, that the minorities in all
the <br />
provinces shall have the right of appeal to the <br />
general parliament. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Bill, in this form, undoubtedly, in
our <br />
opinion, will become the fundamental law of the <br />
country, forming a part of its political consti- <br />
tution ; and that, as such, it must be accepted. <br />
It affords essential guarantees as well in im- <br />
mediate practice as in ultimate resort. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_16" title="bbox 983 1898 1772 2604">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Well Sir, Mr. Galt was too great a man <br />
not to stipulate for other minorities that <br />
which he was stipulating for the minority <br />
to which he belonged. Mr. Galt was not <br />
satisﬁed to have these guarantees under the <br />
constitution simply for the minority of <br />
Quebec, but he put them in the terms which <br />
I read a monment ago so that they could <br />
apply to any minority in any province under <br />
any condition under which a system of <br />
separate schools exist. It is in obedience to <br />
that order of the constitution that we have <br />
inserted the clause which I read a moment  <br />
ago. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now, Sir, a word as to the changes we
have <br />
made in that clause. I stated the other day <br />
that we proposed to make a change and we <br />
have given notice of an amendment which <br />
we intend to move to clause 16. What is <br />
the reason of this change ? It is a fair ques- <br />
tion to ask and a question to be answered. <br />
