<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> right to formulate an enactment in the <br />
creating statue to say that the province or <br />
its municipalities that may in future exist <br />
shall not tax the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway <br />
Company. That is an interference with <br />
that provision of the Confederation Act con- <br />
tained in section 92 which gives the pro- <br />
vinces absolute and exclusive control over <br />
municipalities. It is an interference with <br />
section 92 which says that the province shall <br />
have the right to raise money by direct tax- <br />
ation within its limits. I do not say for in-<br />
stance that the Canadian Paciﬂc Railway <br />
has not any valid defence to offer to any ex-<br />
actions that may be made by the province <br />
or by municipalities within that province. <br />
There may be a defence, although the ques- <br />
tion is certainly one that admits of much <br />
doubt. But in my understanding of the <br />
constitution, we have no power by positive <br />
enactment to say to the new province: <br />
Here are two powers which you have under <br />
section 92, the power of taxing directly, and <br />
the absolute control over municipalities, <br />
but you shall not exercise these powers in <br />
either case with respect to this particular <br />
company. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BELCOURT.</span>
It seems to me the <br />
point to decide is the jurisdiction of this <br />
parliament concerning lands contained in <br />
the Bills now under consideration. I would <br />
like to know from my hon. friend exactly <br />
what his legal view is. I understood him <br />
to say, in reply to my question, that the <br />
provision in the Manitoba Act with reference <br />
to lands, by which the control of these lands <br />
was retained in the Dominion government, <br />
was ultra vires, but that that defect was <br />
cured by the Confederation Act. of 1871, <br />
section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> which he read to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> I <br />
would like to know whether, in the opinion <br />
of my hon. friend, the amendment of 1871 <br />
has had the effect of amending the British <br />
North America Act of 1867 generally or <br />
only with reference to Manitoba, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particular</span>-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ly </span>as regards lands? <br />

it has amended the <br />
Confederation Act, no doubt; it has added <br />
powers in order to define more clearly our <br />

the ques- <br />
tion has never arisen before the courts as <br />
to the validity of our enactment with regard <br />
to lands in Manitoba. <br />

whether, in the opinion of the hon. gentle-<br />

British North <br />
America Act of 1867 have been extended by <br />
the provisions of 1871. not only with re- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. MONK. I think section 2, which is <br />
the basis of our powers under which we <br />
are acting now, is an addition. a further ex- <br />
tension of what is contained in section 148 <br />
of the Confederation Act. There is an in- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> friend means. Now, Mr. Speaker, I wish to
<br />
be brief, and I ﬁnd it is very difﬁcult. I <br />
am arriving at the point I wish to make <br />
with reference to the Educational Act. I <br />
have wandered away from it in order to <br />
give the House a better understanding of <br />
my opinion of these Acts, since we are on <br />
the second reading. and it will save me the <br />
trouble of explaining my views at a later <br />
stage. I hope that is the view which will <br />
prevail. I would like to point out, as a mem- <br />
ber from the province of Quebec, that it <br />
would be a great calamity indeed if the <br />
Minister of Justice and the government did <br />
not arrive at a conclusion that it is neces- <br />
sary to modify that section which has re- <br />
gard. for instance, to the lands. I do not <br />
see, looking upon it as a question of policy. <br />
what we have gained in the province of Que- <br />
bec, and in the older provinces generally, <br />
by this enormous indemnity we are under- <br />
taking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> pay the new provinces
of the <br />
Northwest for their lands. As I understand <br />
it they have a legal claim to these lands. <br />
They are better able to administer them <br />
than we are here in Ottawa. They are on <br />
the spot, they know the necessities of their <br />
province, they have every interest in ad- <br />
ministering them with care, because these <br />
lands are their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principal</span> asset.
and they are <br />
the best judges of the requirements of their <br />
province in respect to the lands. As to us <br />
in the province of Quebec, why, Sir. we have <br />
over 25.000000 acres of good land for settle- <br />
ment, which we are trying to settle, which <br />
we are doing our best to settle. Instead <br />
of devoting all our energies and all our <br />
moneys and public resources to settle the <br />
lands in our own province, under the terms <br />
of the constitution. we are going to pay <br />
millions of dollars to keep a hold on the <br />
lands of the Northwest, which properly be- <br />
long to our sister provinces. That is the <br />
way I understand this clause, and I hope it <br />
will be reconsidered. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now, Sir, taking the views which I have <br />
offered to the House, being my own humble <br />
interpretation of the constitutional Act, I <br />
have entertained no doubt at any time that <br />
section 93 of the Act applies to this territory <br />
which we are to-day erecting into provinces. <br />
In section 93. as we all know, there was a <br />
protection for the rights of the minority in <br />
those new provinces. I assume that. but <br />
is it the case? Eminent lawyers, men <br />
whose authority on constitutional matters <br />
is far greater than my own, do not assent <br />
to this view. They do not think that sec- <br />
tion 03 applies to these new provinces. which <br />
is a proof. if proof was required at all, that <br />
lawyers, like doctors, will disagree on con- <br />
stitutional points particularly. There is no <br />
set of cases coming before our courts where <br />
we have had a more uniform spectacle of <br />
disagreement among our judges than con- <br />
stitutional cases. Therefore, I say there is <br />
a grave doubt in my own mind as to whether <br />
section 93 applies. If it does not apply, then <br />
what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guarantee.</span> what security
has the <br />
minority of these two provinces on enter- <br />
ing confederation ? If it applies. if that <br />
