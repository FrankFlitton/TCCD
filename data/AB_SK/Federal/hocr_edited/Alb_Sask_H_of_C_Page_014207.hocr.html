<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Northwest Territories. The discussion has
<br />
gone even farther, and it has been time and <br />
again written and said that those in this <br />
House who defend the rights of the min-<br />
ority are under clerical inﬂuence, are acting <br />
under the dictation of the hierarchy, what- <br />
ever that may mean. What is the meaning <br />
of these insinuations ? If they were utter- <br />
ed once or twice. if they appeared, so to <br />
speak, by accident, one would be prepared to <br />
treat <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them with</span> the tolerance
which must <br />
necessarily be the quality of a public man <br />
if he wishes to live. But it has been so <br />
often stated that those who in this House <br />
adopt the view which I adopt are under <br />
the domination of the clergy, that I wish at <br />
any rate for my part, to enter my protest <br />
against that insinuation. There is no foun- <br />
dation for that accusation, and those who <br />
make it know not of what they speak. I <br />
say, I come to this House to fulfil my <br />
duty to my country without any control over <br />
me of priest or bishop or anybody else. That <br />
control I have never admitted, and that <br />
control never existed. As a matter of fact, <br />
I venture to say, the clergy in my province <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“do</span> not exercise any control upon
the de- <br />
cision of public questions and the votes <br />
which we give in this House. That control <br />
does not exist ; it is a ﬁgment of the mind. <br />
And, when men take the trouble to write <br />
in newspapers—not to speak in the irrita- <br />
tion of the moment, but to write deliberately <br />
—that those who are in my position in <br />
this House are under outside control, are, <br />
so to speak, led by extraneous inﬂuences, <br />
they are casting upon us a libel which we <br />
do not deserve. I venture to say there is <br />
not a voter in the Dominion of Canada who <br />
would be more free from clerical inﬂuence <br />
than the average voter of the province of <br />
Quebec. Priests exercise no inﬂuence in <br />
these matters. They refrain from action in <br />
them. And they could not interfere with the <br />
exercise of the franchise. Take the case <br />
of my own county; I verily believe that <br />
if the parish priests of my county—and <br />
they are respectable men—were to unite to <br />
secure my election, I would lose my deposit. <br />
They do not interfere in elections; they <br />
scarcely vote. I am prepared to admit <br />
that there are isolated cases where a clergy- <br />
man, not of my own denomination only, but <br />
of other denominations as well, has inter- <br />
fered. What has been the consequence in <br />
Quebec Where these isolated cases have oc- <br />
curred ? They have led to lawsuits and to <br />
the ﬁnal departure of the parish priest from <br />
the charge of the parish—that has been the <br />
history of such cases. As a matter of <br />
fact I repeat there is no man who would <br />
resent more promptly (and I could give <br />
numberless examples of it) any interfer- <br />
ence by the priest with the exercise of the <br />
franchise than would the average voter of <br />
the province of Quebec. And, as a public <br />
man, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> that everybody is in the same <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> position of independence that I am in my-
<br />
self. I would like to see anybody be he <br />
priest or bishop, interfere with me in the <br />
exercise of my functions in this House. I <br />
thought it necessary to make this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">declara-</span>
<br />
tion, because, these things being so often <br />
repeated it becomes essential that they <br />
should be denied. As to the boring under- <br />
ground of the black-robed men who are all <br />
the time acting by hidden, obscure, mys-<br />
terious conspiracies upon members of parlia- <br />
ment, upon the electors in general—all this <br />
is nothing but a chimera. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Speaker, I have ﬁnished. I do not <br />
wish to go one step farther, but you will <br />
allow me in closing to quote the last sen- <br />
tence of Mr. Balfour’s speech upon the Edu- <br />
cation Bill : <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> No other scheme—be it what you like—will <br />
give to the educational evils of this country the <br />
complete, radical, and ﬁnal cure which this Bill <br />
will give. I count upon the support of our <br />
countrymen to enable us to close for ever these <br />
barren controversies which for too long have <br />
occupied our time, and in the interests alike <br />
of parental liberty and of educational efﬁciency <br />
to terminate the present system of costly con- <br />
fusion. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> If I quote these sentences it is because <br />
they express <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> far better, far
loftier lan- <br />
guage than I can command my own view in <br />
regard to these questions in general. If I <br />
could have my wish in the forming of these <br />
two new provinces, it would be that in the <br />
conduct of public affairs, particularly in <br />
the treatment of the minority—which, prac- <br />
tically whatever we may enact, is entirely <br />
conﬁded to the generosity of the majority— <br />
they may have men to lead the destinies <br />
of these two great provinces according to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> example of these great
statesmen of <br />
England. <br />
