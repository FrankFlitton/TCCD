<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> law we gave them in 1875 they established
<br />
a system of schools, is not that system of <br />
schools as dear to them as if they had been <br />
erected into provinces ?  If they have ac- <br />
quired rights thereby, are not those rights <br />
as sacred as if they had been erected into <br />
provinces ? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now Sir, it seems to me that this argu- <br />
ment cannot bear examination. But if we <br />
are to take some of the newspaper articles <br />
and some of the speeches I have read, what <br />
is the supreme reason and argument that <br />
is advanced why this principle of the con- <br />
stitution should not apply to the Territories? <br />
It is because parliament is omnipotent, it <br />
is because parliament is not bound to res- <br />
pect the acts of a former parliament, it is <br />
because the parliament that was elected in <br />
November, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1904,</span> is not to be
bound by the <br />
parliament which sat in this House in 1875. <br />
Well, Sir, if that view is to be taken, if we <br />
are to say that parliament is supreme, I <br />
have nothing more to say. Parliament is <br />
supreme indeed, parliament is supreme, and <br />
may even go to the length of disobeying <br />
the moral laws which bind all governments <br />
and all men. It is open to any man to <br />
break his word, it is open to any man to <br />
violate his engagement, it is open to any <br />
man to trample under foot his plighted <br />
troth. Now if it is open to any man to <br />
do that, it is also open to an assembly of men; <br />
and if it be the view that parliament is not <br />
bound by the acts of any preceding parlia- <br />
ment, that parliament may violate its <br />
plighted troth, then we have a double op- <br />
portunity on this occasion to signalize our- <br />
selves, because not only can we remove <br />
from the minority the system of separate <br />
schools which they have had for many <br />
years, but we can correct another invasion <br />
of provincial rights which is far more reach- <br />
ing than the violation of provincial rights <br />
in the matter of education.  If it be true <br />
that in 1875, parliament introduced separate <br />
schools into the Northwest Territories and <br />
gave to the minority the privilege of those <br />
schools, it is equally true that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
year <br />
1881 this parliament for ever abbreviated the <br />
powers of those new provinces in the mat- <br />
ter of taxation ; it is equally true that in <br />
1891 this parliament decreed by an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span>
<br />
passed here, passed against the protest of <br />
the minority in that parliament, decreeing <br />
for all time to come, not for one year only, <br />
or ten years, or one generation, but for all <br />
time to come, that the Canadian Paciﬁc <br />
Railway and all stations, station grounds, <br />
workshops, buildings, yards and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other</span>
pro- <br />
perty, rolling stock and appurtenances re- <br />
quired and used for the construction and <br />
working thereof, and the capital stock of <br />
the company, should for ever be free from <br />
the power of taxation by those provinces. <br />
It was decreed also that no municipal body <br />
created by the provinces <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could</span>
levy tax- <br />
ation upon the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, <br />
its stock, its buildings, its workshops and its  <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> capital stock. Sir, is not that an
invasion <br />
of provincial rights far more reaching in <br />
its consequences than the invasion of pro- <br />
vincial rights which is complained of in the <br />
matter of education ? But does anybody in <br />
this House think of removing from the <br />
Canadian Paciﬁc Railway the powers and <br />
immunities which have been granted to <br />
that company? Does anybody in this House <br />
think for a moment of giving to those new <br />
provinces the power to levy taxation upon <br />
the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No,</span>
we <br />
respect our engagements. Then I ask if <br />
we respect our engagements in the one case, <br />
why should we not respect our engagements <br />
in the other case? <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> But Sir, that is not all. I ﬁnd no better
<br />
testimony in favour of the principle which <br />
is embodied in this Bill than the letter <br />
which was written to me some days ago <br />
by Mr. Haultain, Premier of the Northwest <br />
Territories ; I want no better testimony of <br />
the soundness of the position which we <br />
have taken than the ipsissima verba con- <br />
tained in Mr. Haultain’s letter, and which I <br />
will read to the House. <br />
</p>

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_10" title="bbox 955 1221 1717 1426">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The territory included within the
boundaries <br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> proposed provinces was
‘ admitted <br />
into the union ’ on July 15, 1870, and imme- <br />
diately upon the creation of these provinces <br />
the provisions of section 93 of the British North <br />
America Act, 1867, become, as a matter of in- <br />
defeasible right, a part of their constitution. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_11" title="bbox 957 1453 1719 1686">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> That is to say, as a matter of ‘indefea- <br />
sible right’ the provision of section 93 of <br />
the British North America Act becomes part <br />
of the constitution of the Northwest Terri- <br />
tories. Now, let me repeat, what is the <br />
disposition of section 93 of the British North <br />
America Act : <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_12" title="bbox 952 1719 1716 1983">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> In and for each province the legislature
may <br />
exclusively make laws in relation to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">educa-</span>
<br />
tion, subject and according to the following <br />
provision :—  <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 1.  Nothing in any such law shall
prejudicially <br />
affect any right or privilege with respect to <br />
denominational schools which any class of <br />
persons have by law in the province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span>
the <br />
union. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_13" title="bbox 956 2012 1718 2623">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Therefore, if I understand the English <br />
language, it means this, according to Mr. <br />
Haultain’s own admission, that in this mat- <br />
ter of education the rights and privileges <br />
of the minority are secured against any <br />
prejudicial legislation which might be pass- <br />
ed. Now, Sir, there is this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span>
be- <br />
tween Mr. Haultain and myself with regard <br />
to this point. Mr. Haultain argues that <br />
this section 93 applies automatically, that <br />
this House has nothing to do but simply to <br />
admit the province and immediately it be- <br />
comes subject to section 93 ; whereas the <br />
position we take is while the provision is <br />
embodied in section 93 it has to be intro- <br />
duced legislatively by this parliament into <br />
the constitution of the Northwest Terri- <br />
tories. <br />
