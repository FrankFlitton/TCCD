            tice and the establishment of the Police<lb/>Force in the North-West Territories. He<lb/>stated that the object of this Bill was to<lb/>amend only two clauses, 26 and 25 of the<lb/>existing law. These two clauses were re<lb break="no"/>enacted almost entirely with the addition<lb/>of some provisions respecting desertions,<lb/>which were not made an offence in the<lb/>present Act and there was no provision<lb/>for the punishment of deserters. The<lb/>present Bill made desertion an offence<lb/>punishable by fine. Under the present<lb/>law the Commissioner alone had the power<lb/>of punishing offences. By the present<lb/>Bill it was proposed to extend that Bill to<lb/>the Assistant Commissioner and other<lb/>officers in command, so that any command<lb break="no"/>ing officer in an isolated position would<lb/>have the same power as the Commissioner<lb/>in relation to the offences mentioned in<lb/>the Act. The second clause of this Bill,<lb/>amending Section 25 of the present act,<lb/>provided that any deserter found in any of<lb/>the Provinces might be sued, fined and<lb/>imprisoned for his offence.<lb/>
