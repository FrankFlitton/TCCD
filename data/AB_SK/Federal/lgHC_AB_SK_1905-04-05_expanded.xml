<!-- GL, 2017-10-24, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

<!--<p>
     lature together and test the feeling of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories on this 
     <lb/>
     question. If he calls the legislature to<lb break="no"/>gether, either as it stands at present, or with 
     <lb/>
     the vacant seats filled, I venture to say that 
     <lb/>
     he will not have a majority when he tries 
     <lb/>
     to make a party question out of this matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. SPROULE. Could not the hon. gen- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tlemen's friends make a better test than 
     <lb/>
     that by appointing a Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior and sending him back for re-election ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. TURRIFF. The hon. the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister said the other day in my hearing that 
     <lb/>he would appoint a Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>within three months ; and when that time  
     <lb/>comes, if he chooses one of the members 
     <lb/>from the Northwest Territories and he goes 
     <lb/>back for re-election, I promise you that, 
     <lb/>whoever he may be, he will come back here 
     <lb/>with a larger majority than he had on the 
     <lb/>3rd of November last. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPROULE. Let them hold this Bill 
     <lb/>
     until that election takes place, and see what 
     <lb/>
     the public sentiment is in the west. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. TURRIFF. Do not be a bit alarmed 
     <lb/>
     about it ; you will get plenty of it before 
     <lb/>
     you are through. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPROULE. The storm centre of 
     <lb/>
     alarm is further west to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. TURRIFF. We heard a great deal 
     <lb/>
     of talk like this in connection with the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk Pacific. We were told in my consti<lb break="no"/>tuency that we were not going to be able 
     <lb/>
     to save our deposit ; but what was the re<lb break="no"/>sult ? Seven of the Liberal members on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the House from the Northwest have 
     <lb/>
     each an average majority of over 1,200 
     <lb/>
     votes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I would ask 
     <lb/>
     our hon. friends on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House to drop this agitation. Come down 
     <lb/>
     to common sense, and let us deal with the 
     <lb/>
     Bill that is now before parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPROULE. Would it not be well 
     <lb/>
     to give that advice to the Toronto ' Globe ' ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. TURRIFF. Let us get on with the 
     <lb/>
     work of the country. Let us start these 
     <lb/>
     new provinces without hampering them 
     <lb/>
     with an agitation such as hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite are trying to work up. Instead of 
     <lb/>
     that, let us leave them to devote their time 
     <lb/>
     and energies to developing the great natural 
     <lb/>
     resources that Providence has blessed them 
     <lb/>
     with, and in a short time you will see them 
     <lb/>
     two of the greatest and most populous, 
     <lb/>
     liberal and broad-minded provinces that ex<lb break="no"/>ist in the Canadian confederacy. 
     <lb/>

     Mr. URIAH WILSON moved the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment of the debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. FIELDING. In assenting to the mo<lb break="no"/>tion, I should like to be permitted to make 
     <lb/>
     a remark. Although we have had numerous 
     <lb/>
     speeches on this question, I am advised that 
     <lb/>
     there are still more numerous speeches to 
     <lb/>
     follow, a very large number of members 
     <lb/>

            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     desiring to address the House. If that be 
     <lb/>
      the fact, we are likely to have a protracted 
     <lb/>
      debate even under the best conditions, and I 
     <lb/>
     'think it will be necessary for us to work a 
     <lb/>
     little harder and sit a little later. There<lb break="no"/>fore, I hope that if a motion like this is 
     <lb/>
     hereafter made at this early hour, it may 
     <lb/>
      not be pressed, but we may sit a little later 
     <lb/>
     and get the debate finished. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Motion agreed to, and debate adjourned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     On motion of Mr. Fielding, House adjourn<lb break="no"/>ed at 11.20 p.m.

<p>
     Mr. R. L. BORDEN. Might I inquire 
     <lb/>
     whether the letter of the 23rd of February, 
     <lb/>
     which I observe in the public press, is in<lb break="no"/>cluded in the document brought down ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir WILFRID LAURIER. No; I shall 
     <lb/>have to refer to that in a moment. In mak<lb break="no"/>ing this motion, I desire to make a state<lb break="no"/>ment. I desire at this moment to call the
<lb/>attention of the House to a state<lb break="no"/>ment which was published this morn<lb break="no"/>ing in the newspapers of the city, <lb/>and which I understand has been published
<lb/>in all the press of Canada. This statement
<lb/>is made by Mr. Rogers, a member of the
<lb/>Manitoba government, concerning the action
<lb/>taken by myself and by my colleagues upon
<lb/>an application made some time ago by the
<lb/>government of the province of Manitoba,
<lb/>under instructions from the legislature of
<lb/>that province, for an extension of its boun<lb break="no"/>daries. I may say at once that it will be
<lb/>my duty, so far as the action of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is concerned in this matter, to give
<lb/>the statement a direct, an absolute and a
<lb/>categorical denial. In order that there may
<lb/>be no misunderstanding, I think it is better
<lb/>that I should read to the House, and there<lb break="no"/>fore place upon the records, the statement
<lb/>of Mr. Rogers, as I find it in the 'Citizen.'
<lb/>It is as follows:<lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     On February 13, we received a formal invita<lb break="no"/>tion by telegraph from Sir Wilfrid to come 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa as soon as convenient. We left on 
     <lb/>
     February 14 and arrived on the afternoon of 
     <lb/>
     the 16th, when we received a letter from Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid at the Russell House saying that he 
     <lb/>
     would be pleased to meet us at his oflice at 
     <lb/>
     mid-day on Friday, the 17th. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During that interview we presented the 
     <lb/>
     claims of the province as urgently and strongly 
     <lb/>
     as possible. In reply Sir Wilfrid said that if 
     <lb/>
     we would be good enough to remain in Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     for three or four days he would again send 
     <lb/>
     for us and would then be in a position to give 
     <lb/>
     us an answer.

     In three days' time,on February 20,a letter was 
     <lb/>
     received from Monseigneur Sbarretti, asking for 
     <lb/>
     a conference. This invitation was accepted and 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency then presented the following 
     <lb/>
     memorandum, remarking that if we would 
     <lb/>
     place this on the statute-book of our province 
     <lb/>
     it would greatly facilitate an early settlement 
     <lb/>
     of our mission, the fixing of our boundaries, 
     <lb/>
     which would be extended to the shores of 
     <lb/>
     Hudson bay. His Excellency further added 
     <lb/>
     that our failure to act in the past had preju<lb break="no"/>diced our claim for extension westward. The 
     <lb/>
     following is a copy of His Excellency's memo<lb break="no"/>randum, containing the proposed amendment to 
     <lb/>

     DELAYING WITH A PURPOSE. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Notwithstanding Sir Wilfrid's invitation and 
     <lb/>
     our interview, followed by his promise of which 
     <lb/>
     he was reminded by our letter, strange to 
     <lb/>
     say, up to this very hour we have had no reply 
     <lb/>
     to ours of February 23. What more natural 
     <lb/>
     conclusion can be arrived at than that Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid is simply killing time and making 
     <lb/>
     pretexts in order that the polite invitation 
     <lb/>
     of Monseigneur Sbarretti could be acted upon 
     <lb/>
     by Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this way, of course, Sir Wilfrid thinks 
     <lb/>
     he can secure a political advantage for his 
     <lb/>
     friends in this province. This is a palpable 
     <lb/>
     political trick, which he is quite capable of 
     <lb/>
     undertaking, with the view to force the local 
     <lb/>
     government to do something which would be 
     <lb/>
     resented by the people and by this means he 
     <lb/>
     hopes to reinstate his Liberal friends in power 
     <lb/>
     here. I, for one, promise to take no chances in 
     <lb/>
     allowing Sir Wilfrid or any person else to take 
     <lb/>
     advantage of us by any underhanded scheme 
     <lb/>
     of this sort. All I ask is that every citizen of 
     <lb/>
     the province should have an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     expressing his opinion by his vote as a protest 
     <lb/>
     against continued delay. I deny the right of 
     <lb/>
     Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Monseigneur Sbarretti 
     <lb/>
     to undertake to mix up the matter of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools with that of the extension of our bound<lb break="no"/>aries, and I am sure that in so doing they do not 
     <lb/>
     reflect the wishes of either Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     or Protestants in the province. It ill-be<lb break="no"/>comes the ' Globe ' to make this charge against 
     <lb/>
     the government of Manitoba, when the only 
     <lb/>
     persons affected are Sir Wilfrid and Monsei<lb break="no"/>gneur Sbarretti. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     LAURIER'S DOUBLE-DEALING. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We have no desire in Manitoba for double- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     dealing about this or any other question. This. 
     <lb/>
     however, appears to be a favourite course of 
     <lb/>
     Sir Wilfrid. For example, in 1896 he signed an 
     <lb/>
     official statement declaring himself to be en<lb break="no"/>titled to credit for the final settlement of the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba school question, while immediately 
     <lb/>
     following we find from the correspondence 
     <lb/>
     brought down in the parliament of Canada the 
     <lb/>
     following extract from a letter to Cardinal 
     <lb/>
     Rampolla, which he has never denied: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     ' It is desirable, if not necessary, that the 
     <lb/>
     mission of Monseigneur Merry Del Val should 
     <lb/>
     be renewed or rather continued, and that he 
     <lb/>
     should be present in the midst of us for a more 
     <lb/>
     or less prolonged time as the accredited re<lb break="no"/>presentative of the Holy See.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It will be remembered that Monseigneur 
     <lb/>
     Merry Del Val was appointed Papal delegate 
     <lb/>
     by His Holiness the Pope on the petition of Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid and forty odd members of the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada. The petition was presented to 
     <lb/>
     His Holiness by Mr. Fitzpatrick and further 
     <lb/>
     urged by the Canadian legal representative in 
     <lb/>
     London, England, Charles Russell, who was 
     <lb/>
     afterwards instructed to go to Rome as Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid's representative, and who, on November 
     <lb/>
     26, 1897, addressed the following to Cardinal 
     <lb/>
     Rampolla, secretary of state to the Pope. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="3837" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-05_Page_3837.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3837</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 5, 1905</fw> <fw type="num">3838</fw>
           


 <p>
        'I have just arrived at Rome once more at the 
     <lb/>
     urgent request of the Catholic members of the 
     <lb/>
     government and parliament of Canada. My 
     <lb/>
     instructions enjoin me to again renew to Your 
     <lb/>
     Eminence the desire which I  had already the 
     <lb/>
     honour to express to you, that His Holiness 
     <lb/>
     will be pleased to nominate a permanent dele<lb break="no"/>gate to Canada as representative of His Holi<lb break="no"/>ness who would reside on the spot but would 
     <lb/>
     be outside all local interests.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         So that by this plain arrangement a dele<lb break="no"/>gate was appointed who was regarded as 
     <lb/>
     necessary on account of differences of opinion 
     <lb/>
     which existed at that time between Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     and certain of his following as to his official 
     <lb/>
     signed statement declaring he was a party to 
     <lb/>
     the final settlement of the Manitoba school 
     <lb/>
     question. Here again, we have the hand of Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid engaged in double-dealing in this mat<lb break="no"/>ter as is evidenced by his assurance to Cardi<lb break="no"/>nal Rampolla through Mr. Russell, the Can<lb break="no"/>adian legal representative, who wrote to His 
     <lb/>
     Eminence as follows, presenting Sir Wilfrid's 
     <lb/>
     side of the case at Rome: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         We do not solicit His Holiness to sanction 
     <lb/>
     as perfect the concessions obtained, but that in 
     <lb/>
     His wisdom he will be pleased to regard them 
     <lb/>
     as a beginning of justice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         Now, this to my mind is conclusive that Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid in  combination with Monseigneur 
     <lb/>
     Sbarretti had hoped by their present course to 
     <lb/>
     carry out the promise given through their accre<lb break="no"/>dited representative, Mr. Charles Russell, in this 
     <lb/>
     underhand way. In view of the foregoing, 
     <lb/>
     I am sure that Sir Wilfrid Laurier owes it to 
     <lb/>
     the people of this province to at once give a 
     <lb/>
     reason why we are not entitled to im<lb break="no"/>mediate consideration and action other than 
     <lb/>
     the flimsy excuse which he has already himself 
     <lb/>
     created in his invitation to Mr. Whitney to ad<lb break="no"/>vance a claim to some portion of Keewatin 
     <lb/>
     which did not form part of old Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         It is certainly idle for any person to assume 
     <lb/>
     that Monseigneur Sbarretti, occupying the posi<lb break="no"/>tion he does, would press me to make the sug<lb break="no"/>gestion of terms and conditions which he did 
     <lb/>
     without the full knowledge and consent of Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid and his colleagues. And on the other 
     <lb/>
     hand Sir Wilfrid's attitude carries with it 
     <lb/>
     evidence of a full knowledge of arrangement, 
     <lb/>
     as is evident by his creation of excuses for 
     <lb/>
     delay as well as his failure to give reason or 
     <lb/>
     cause for same, and further by his unfairness 
     <lb/>
     in bringing down one side of the case and at<lb break="no"/>tempting to secure a prejudicement from the 
     <lb/>
     people without their having Manitoba's reply 
     <lb/>
     to his minute of council of March 21, which 
     <lb/>
     was received by this government on March 28 
     <lb/>
     and replied to on March 31. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
          Can you give us your reply for publication ? 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers was asked. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         No, because it can only be made public 
     <lb/>
     through the usual channel, that of being laid 
     <lb/>
     on the table of the House and Sir Wilfrid is 
     <lb/>
      at perfect liberty and should do this at once. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
         Before I proceed any further, I may say 
     <lb/>
     at once, referring to the whole tenor of 
     <lb/>
     this document, that in so far as there is 
     <lb/>
     a charge that there was an understanding 
     <lb/>
     between Monseigneur Sbarretti and my<lb break="no"/>self to have the school question considered 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the extension of the 
     <lb/>
     boundaries of Manitoba, there is not a sha<lb break="no"/>dow nor a tittle of  truth in it. Mr. Rogers 
     <lb/>
     uses this language : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <cb/>
          
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

         I assert that if Mr. Rogers states that 
     <lb/>
     Monseigneur Sbarretti did press him to 
     <lb/>
     make the suggestion of terms and 
     <lb/>
     conditions which he says Monseigneur 
     <lb/>
     Sbarretti  did with my knowledge, he 
     <lb/>
     states something which is not in ac<lb break="no"/>cordance with truth. If that has taken 
     <lb/>
     place it has taken place wholly without my 
     <lb/>
     knowledge and without my participation, 
     <lb/>
     and I never heard of it in any way what<lb break="no"/>ever until last Saturday, when the matter 
     <lb/>
     was brought to my notice by a telegram 
     <lb/>
     from the Toronto ' Globe.' Then Mr. Rogers

         On Monday last, which was the 3rd of 
     <lb/>
     April, I brought down to this House a re<lb break="no"/>turn to an address moved for some time ago 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for Marquette (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Roche), asking for copies of all correspon<lb break="no"/>dence that had taken place between the 
     <lb/>
     government of Manitoba and this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on the subject of the exten<lb break="no"/>sion of the boundaries of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     The last paper upon  this return was 
     <lb/>
     the acknowledgment of the receipt of our 
     <lb/>
     reply to the prayer of the Manitoba govern<lb break="no"/>ment. We have received since that time a 
     <lb/>
     further rejoinder by Manitoba to our reply. 
     <lb/>
     We did not bring it down on Monday with 
     <lb/>
     the return, because we had not then re<lb break="no"/>ceived it. It arrived at the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     office only yesterday. I at once gave orders 
     <lb/>
     to the clerk of the Privy Council to have 
     <lb/>
     it prepared for presentation to the House 
     <lb/>
     and I have to-day laid it on the table of 
     <lb/>
     the House. In all this there was no evi<lb break="no"/>dence of any intention to conceal anything. 
     <lb/>
     There was nothing to conceal, this was a 
     <lb/>
     public document. Then I see by the corre<lb break="no"/>spondence that the order of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     government was passed on the 31st of 
     <lb/>
     March, which was last Friday. It was 
     <lb/>
     sent to us on the following day, Saturday. 
     <lb/>
     It could not therefore get here until yes<lb break="no"/>terday morning, and as soon as it was re<lb break="no"/>ceived by us, as I said a moment ago, I 
     <lb/>
     gave instructions to have it prepared and 
     <lb/>
     laid on the table of the House, so as to 
     <lb/>
     form part of the correspondence which the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country have a right to have 
     <lb/>
     before them. Now, I pass to another state<lb break="no"/>ment of Mr. Rogers :

     —February 20, a letter was received from His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency, Monseigneur Sbarretti, asking for a 
     <lb/>
     conference. This invitation was accepted, and 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency then presented the following 
     <lb/>
     memorandum, remarking that if we would place 
     <lb/>
     this on the statute-book of our province that 
     <lb/>
     it would greatly facilitate an early settlement 
     <lb/>
     of our mission, the fixing of our boundaries, 
     <lb/>
     which would be extended to the shores of Hud<lb break="no"/>son bay. His Excellency further added that 
     <lb/>
     our failure to act in the past had prejudiced 
     <lb/>
     our claim for extension westward.

     According to this statement, it appears 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Rogers and Mr. Colin Campbell, 
     <lb/>
     who were the delegates of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     government, had a conference with Mon<lb break="no"/>seigneur Sbarretti, the Papal ablegate, 
     <lb/>
     There has been a rumour in the press—not 
     <lb/>
     in the press, but at all events, about the 
     <lb/>
     corridors of this House—that this confer<lb break="no"/>ence had been brought about by means of 
     <lb/>
     one of my colleagues. I have to say to 
     <lb/>
     the House, and I have the authority of my 
     <lb/>
     colleague for this, that there never was any 
     <lb/>
     conference brought about by him between 
     <lb/>
     the delegates and Monseigneur Sbarretti, 
     <lb/>
     and I have to make the further statement 
     <lb/>
     that neither myself nor any of my col<lb break="no"/>leagues were the intermediaries between 
     <lb/>
     Monseigneur Sbarretti and the delegates of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. If there has been such a con<lb break="no"/>ference how it came about I cannot say. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps Monseigneur Sbarretti may have 
     <lb/>
     had previous communication with these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen; I do not know. Perhaps he 
     <lb/>
     knew them and perhaps that is the reason 
     <lb/>
     why he called upon them to have a con<lb break="no"/>ference. At all events, it is no concern of 
     <lb/>
     mine. I know nothing, and I never knew 
     <lb/>
     anything of it until this day, nor did the 
     <lb/>
     government. What conversation took place 
     <lb/>
     between the papal ablegate, Mr. Rogers 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Colin Campbell I do not know. 
     <lb/>
     This is a question, perhaps, as to which 
     <lb/>
     there may be something later on; I do not 
     <lb/>
     know. But, I take the statement as I find 
     <lb/>
     it here, and upon this statement I have the 
     <lb/>
     right to make some comments which may 
     <lb/>
     throw some light, perhaps, on what has 
     <lb/>
     taken place. Mr. Rogers says that the

     Well, Sir, I cannot conceive how the papal

     <lb/>
     that the failure of the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     to amend the School Act prevented the ex<lb break="no"/>tension of its boundaries westward and 
     <lb/>
     that if such had been done it would have 
     <lb/>
     facilitated this extension. I cannot con<lb break="no"/>ceive how it is possible that such a state<lb break="no"/>ment could have been made, considering the 
     <lb/>
     fact that since the month of July, 1896. 
     <lb/>
     when we came into office, up to the month of 
     <lb/>
     January, 1905, we never received from the 
     <lb/>
     government of Manitoba a communication 
     <lb/>
     asking for the extension of the boundaries 
     <lb/>
     of that province. There may have been re<lb break="no"/>solutions passed by the legislature, asking 
     <lb/>
     for the extension of their boundaries; I do 
     <lb/>
     not know. I am told that there have been, 
     <lb/>
     and I have seen in the press that resolu<lb break="no"/>tions were passed in 1901. that resolutions 
     <lb/>
     were passed also, as I understand, in 1902, 
     <lb/>
     and resolutions were passed, I know, in 
     <lb/>
     1905. In 1905, these resolutions were fol<lb break="no"/>lowed by executive action, they were called 
     <lb/>
     to our attention, but neither in 1901 nor 
     <lb/>
     in 1902, were these resolutions passed by 
     <lb/>
     the legislature of Manitoba, followed by 
     <lb/>
     executive action or called to the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the government of Canada. This morn<lb break="no"/>ing, when I read the interview with Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers, I asked myself if my memory was 
     <lb/>
     at fault, and if there had been any com<lb break="no"/>munication sent to us, which, in the multi<lb break="no"/>tude of things with which we are called 
     <lb/>
     upon to deal, I might have forgotten. I in<lb break="no"/>quired of my colleagues if they had any 
     <lb/>
     recollection of any such communication be<lb break="no"/>ing sent to us, and they all answered me 
     <lb/>
     they had no such recollection. I then in<lb break="no"/>quired from the clerk of the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     if there was anything in the archives of 
     <lb/>
     the department which would show that 
     <lb/>
     any such communication had been received 
     <lb/>
     by us, and I received this memorandum 
     <lb/>
     from the clerk of the Privy Council.

     took place between Mr. Colin Campbell and

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     On February 13th we received a formal in<lb break="no"/>vitation by telegraph from Sir Wilfrid Laurier

     to come to Ottawa as soon as convenient. We 
     <lb/>
     left on February 14th and arrived on afternoon 
     <lb/>
     of the 16th, when we received a letter from

     is not in accordance with the truth, but 
     <lb/>
     it is not the whole truth. It leaves the 
     <lb/>
     impression that we took the initiative of our 
     <lb/>
     own accord to have these gentlemen come 
     <lb/>
     from Manitoba to discuss that matter with 
     <lb/>
     us, whereas the truth is, that we simply 
     <lb/>
     responded to an invitation which came to 
     <lb/>
     us from the government of Manitoba. I have 
     <lb/>
     brought here the whole correspondence 
     <lb/>
     which has taken place upon this subject. I 
     <lb/>
     stated a moment ago that from the month of

     had not received a communication from

     That was on the 16th of February, and

     on the following day accordingly, there 
     <lb/>
     took place at my office the interview with 
     <lb/>
     the delegates from Manitoba. There had 
     <lb/>
     been a subcommittee of the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     appointed to receive the delegates, and the 
     <lb/>
     ministers present on that occasion were, 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice, the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral and myself ; I think the Secretary of

     quite sure.

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>
     During that interview we presented the claim

     would be good enough to remain in Ottawa for

            <p>
     As to the latter statement I am sorry 
     <lb/>
     to say that my memory is not in accordance 
     <lb/>with the memory of Mr. Rogers. I do not 
     <lb/>want to make any imputation, but I flatter 
     <lb/>myself that I have a pretty good memory 
     <lb/>and my memory is corroborated by that 
     <lb/>of my colleagues. What took place was 
     <lb/>this : We heard the petition presented 
     <lb/>to us by the delegates from Manitoba. Mr. 
     <lb/>Rogers was the spokesman. I do not think 
     <lb/>Mr. Campbell said anything at all, but if 
     <lb/>he did he took a very indifferent part in 
     <lb/>the discussion which was mainly carried 
     <lb/>on by Mr. Rogers. He presented to us a 
     <lb/>repetition of all the claims which are 
     <lb/>advanced in the state paper now on the 
     <lb/>table of the House. He asked that the 
     <lb/>

     boundaries of the province should be ex<lb break="no"/>tended westward, northward and eastward— 
     <lb/>
     westward, that it should have a part of the 
     <lb/>
     new province of Saskatchewan, a part of 
     <lb/>
     the districts of Assiniboia and Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan ; northward, that they should have the 
     <lb/>
     territory towards the north, and eastward 
     <lb/>
     towards Hudson Bay. I may say at once 
     <lb/>
     that we discussed this at some length, in 
     <lb/>
     fact at  considerable length. When Mr.  
     <lb/>
     Rogers advanced the claim on behalf of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, that its  boundaries should be ex<lb break="no"/>tended westward and include part of the 
     <lb/>
     present districts of Assiniboia and Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan, we presented to Mr. Rogers what 
     <lb/>
     seemed to be a very strong objection to 
     <lb/>
     that. We told Mr. Rogers in fact : that 
     <lb/>
     this  claim had been considered by the 
     <lb/>
     government of Sir John Macdonald in 1884 
     <lb/>
     and had not been granted ; that the reasons 
     <lb/>
     which existed in  1884 for refusing the pray<lb break="no"/>er of Manitoba were far stronger to-day  
     <lb/>
     than they were then : that at that time 
     <lb/>
     that part of the  Territories was in its 
     <lb/>
     infancy, but that at present it had 
     <lb/>
     a considerable population, as advanc<lb break="no"/>ed as the population of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     That there was the objection further : 
     <lb/>
     that the legislature of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies had protested against its being 
     <lb/>
     annexed to Manitoba, and therefore we did 
     <lb/>
     not see how it was possible to grant that 
     <lb/>
     part of the prayer of the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. With regard to the northern portion 
     <lb/>
     of the district of Saskatchewan, we said 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Rogers and to his colleague, Mr. 
     <lb/>
      Campbell : we do not know that there is 
     <lb/>
     any objection to granting you the upper 
     <lb/>
     portion of the district of Saskatchewan ; 
     <lb/>
     it is true that we understand there is an 
     <lb/>
     objection raised, but it is a question which 
     <lb/>
     can be discussed later on ; at all events, 
     <lb/>
     we do not intend to introduce this part of 
     <lb/>
     the territory of Saskatchewan into the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces and we had better leave it 
     <lb/>
     for further discussion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         When it came to a discussion on the ex<lb break="no"/>tension of the boundary eastward, towards 
     <lb/>
     Hudson Bay, my colleague the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General, who was with me then, at once 
     <lb/>
     took strong objections to that claim of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. He stated that in his opinion it 
     <lb/>
     would not be fair to the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     that that claim should be considered unless  
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario had an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to discuss it with the province of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     That was on the 17th of February. I do 
     <lb/>
     not remember that I said to Mr. Rogers and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Campbell that if they were to wait for 
     <lb/>
     some days we would again send for them 
     <lb/>
     and be in a position to give them an answer. 
     <lb/>
     What I distinctly remember stating, as it 
     <lb/>
     was my duty to do, was that their represen<lb break="no"/>tations would be  brought to the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the Council, and that probably they would 
     <lb/>
    get an answer at an early date. More 
     <lb/>than this I do not remember stating, 
     <lb/>and I do not think I did. The two 
     <lb/>Bills for the creation of the provinces of 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     Saskatchewan and Alberta were introduced 
     <lb/>
     on  the following Tuesday, the 21st of Feb<lb break="no"/>ruary. Both Mr. Rogers and Mr. Campbell 
     <lb/>
     were present on the floor of this House and 
     <lb/>
     heard the statement I then made. That 
     <lb/>
     statement was that I had the authority of 
     <lb/>
     my colleagues  to say that we could not see 
     <lb/>
     our way to extend the boundaries of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba westward, for the 
     <lb/>
     reasons which I have just given, that we had 
     <lb/>
     reserved the northern portion of the district 
     <lb/>
     of Saskatchewan for future action, and that 
     <lb/>
     with regard to extending the boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba to Hudson Bay we were of opin<lb break="no"/>ion that the province of Ontario and the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec should be consulted. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers heard this statement, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, knew what was the policy of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on that question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         This shows one thing, that this policy of 
     <lb/>
     ours was settled then and there, without in<lb break="no"/>terference from anybody, without participa<lb break="no"/>tion by anybody. We settled our own busi<lb break="no"/>ness according to our lights. We told the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba that we could not ex<lb break="no"/>tend its boundaries westward for the rea<lb break="no"/>sons we gave, and on that decision we 
     <lb/>
     took our stand before this House and main<lb break="no"/>tained it. But we stated we were prepared 
     <lb/>
     to consider the claim of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba for extension northward towards 
     <lb/>
     Hudson Bay in connection with the claims 
     <lb/>
     of the new province of Saskatchewan and 
     <lb/>
     the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Since 
     <lb/>
     that time we have embodied these views in 
     <lb/>
     a Minute of Council, which has been com<lb break="no"/>municated to the Manitoba government. 
     <lb/>
     There is no difference between the Minute 
     <lb/>
     of Council and the statement I made on the 
     <lb/>
     floor of this House on the 21st of February 
     <lb/>
     except this, that in the Minute of Council. 
     <lb/>
     after having given the matter due considera<lb break="no"/>tion, we take the view that there is no rea<lb break="no"/>son for calling the province of Quebec to 
     <lb/>
     that conference, because it is not sufficient<lb break="no"/>ly interested in the matter; but we declare 
     <lb/>
     our readiness, immediately after the creat<lb break="no"/>ion of the new provinces, to have a confer<lb break="no"/>ence, in which the provinces of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, Ontario and Manitoba will be repre<lb break="no"/>sented. That is the position in which the 
     <lb/>
     matter now stands.

         My hon. friend the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion has called my attention to a letter of

     Mr. Rogers of the 23rd of February. That 
     <lb/>
     letter is not in the interview as reported

          Sir,—As we find it necessary to leave Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow, we desire to refer to our interview 
     <lb/>
     of Friday, the  17th, respecting Manitoba's claim

     for extension of her boundaries westward and 
     <lb/>
     northward, when you were good enough to sug<lb break="no"/>gest that if we would come here for two or

     three days you would be in a position to give 
     <lb/>
     us an answer respecting same. Up to the pre<lb break="no"/>sent, however, we have heard nothing further

     ment on Tuesday last, when introducing your 
     <lb/>
     Autonomy Bills, which we presume represents 
     <lb/>
     your fixed and final decision as to westward 
     <lb/>
     boundary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In view of Manitoba's very strong claims, as 
     <lb/>
     presented to you in the memorial unanimously 
     <lb/>
     passed by our legislature, and supported and 
     <lb/>
     supplemented in our interview, we must enter, 
     <lb/>
     on behalf of the province, our firm protest 
     <lb/>
     against your decision in refusing to grant the 
     <lb/>
     prayer of our request, extension of our boun<lb break="no"/>daries westward, and exceedingly regret that 
     <lb/>
     apparently local considerations have deprived 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba of what she rightfully regards as a 
     <lb/>
     most just claim. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Respecting extension northward, we most re<lb break="no"/>spectfully urge it on you that this should en<lb break="no"/>gage your consideration and attention during 
     <lb/>
     the present session. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We, of course, most emphatically deny the 
     <lb/>
     right of Quebec and Ontario having further to 
     <lb/>
     say in respect to the extension of our boundar<lb break="no"/>ies north to James bay, or that they could ad<lb break="no"/>vance any claim worthy of consideration that 
     <lb/>
     would necessitate delay in attaching this terri<lb break="no"/>tory immediately to Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     we regard this as exclusively a matter for 
     <lb/>
     settlement between our government and Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. We sincerely trust that upon further con<lb break="no"/>sideration you may see your way clear to grant 
     <lb/>
     the request we make on behalf of a united pro<lb break="no"/>vince.

     My hon. friend the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion asked me a moment ago why this let<lb break="no"/>ter was not included in the correspondence 
     <lb/>
     that has been brought down. The answer 
     <lb/>
     is, that I have not received that letter. It 
     <lb/>
     is not of very great consequence in view of 
     <lb/>
     the facts. It is simply a letter of protest ; 
     <lb/>
     it adds nothing at all to the facts; but I 
     <lb/>
     did not receive it. This morning I asked 
     <lb/>
     my secretary to search and see whether or 
     <lb/>
     not it had been received. I have no re<lb break="no"/>membrance of having received it and it is 
     <lb/>
     not on file. I have brought everything that 
     <lb/>
     there is on file on this question. Moreover, 
     <lb/>
     I do not think it matters very much whether 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers wrote or did not write that let<lb break="no"/>ter, in view of the interview he gave and 
     <lb/>
     which was published in the 'Citizen' of the 
     <lb/>
     20th of February last upon this very point. 
     <lb/>
     In that interview Mr. Rogers stated to the 
     <lb/>
     reporter: 
     <lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>

     Mr. Rogers was present on the floor of 
     <lb/>
     this House on the 21st of February and 
     <lb/>
     heard me state the decision of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and therefore there was not much 
     <lb/>
     occasion for him to write two days later 
     <lb/>
     asking for a decision. But this point is of 
     <lb/>
     no consequence. I mention it simply as a 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     reason why the letter was not included in

            <p>
     I have only one word more to say about 
     <lb/>
     the extraordinary interview of Mr. Rogers. 
     <lb/>
     I will read again a statement of Mr. Rogers 
     <lb/>
     which appears in the 'Citizen' under the 
     <lb/>
     heading 'Laurier's Double Dealing.' Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers says: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

           <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> <p>
     We have no desire in Manitoba for double 
     <lb/>
     dealing about this or any other question. This, 
     <lb/>
     however, appears to be a favourite course of Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid. For example, in 1896 he signed an 
     <lb/>
     official statement declaring himself to be en<lb break="no"/>titled to credit for the final settlement of the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba school question, while immediately 
     <lb/>
     following we find from the correspondence 
     <lb/>
     brought down in the parliament of Canada the 
     <lb/>
     following extract from a letter to Cardinal 
     <lb/>
     Rampolla, which he has never denied. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     I have only two observations to make on 
     <lb/>
     this. I do not know to what Mr. Rogers 
     <lb/>
     refers when he says that I signed an official 
     <lb/>
     statement declaring myself to be entitled 
     <lb/>
     to credit for the final settlement of the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba school question. It is not of any con<lb break="no"/>sequence, but I do not know what Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers means when he says that. In the 
     <lb/>
     statement immediately following, the im<lb break="no"/>pression is conveyed that the Canadian gov<lb break="no"/>ernment brought down correspondence be<lb break="no"/>tween the government of Canada and Cardi<lb break="no"/>nal Rampolla. There is no such thing in 
     <lb/>
     fact. The government of Canada never had 
     <lb/>
     any correspondence with Cardinal Rampolla 
     <lb/>
     and never brought down any correspon<lb break="no"/>dence, because there was none to bring 
     <lb/>
     down. What is true is that in 1896 my 
     <lb/>
     self and several of my co-religionists, hav<lb break="no"/>ing some difficulties in our own church, ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to the authorities of our own church 
     <lb/>
     to settle them. There was nothing more 
     <lb/>
     than that. We did it, not as a government, 
     <lb/>
     but simply as men belonging to the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic church. We had trouble over mat<lb break="no"/>ters of ecclesiastical policy, and we ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to the supreme arbiter in our church 
     <lb/>
     to determine these matters. There was 
     <lb/>
     nothing more or less. On this occasion I 
     <lb/>
     have nothing more to say, but I thought that 
     <lb/>
     under the circumstances I owed it to myself 
     <lb/>
     and the House simply to make a statement 
     <lb/>
     of the facts as they are. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. I simply wish 
     <lb/>
     to supplement briefly some of the remarks 
     <lb/>
     that have fallen from my right hon. leader. 
     <lb/>
     The communication from Mr. Rogers con<lb break="no"/>tains a statement to the effect that at the 
     <lb/>
     invitation of His Excellency Monseigneur 
     <lb/>
     Sbarretti, he waited upon him, and that on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion the Papal ablegate said that 
     <lb/>
     if they would make some concessions, the 
     <lb/>
     mission of the Manitoba representatives 
     <lb/>
     would likely be successful. That mission 
     <lb/>
     was for the purpose of having the bound<lb break="no"/>aries of that province extended to the shores 
     <lb/>
     of Hudson bay. It was suggested that the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty in the way of Manitoba securing 
     <lb/>
     the extension could, in some way or other he 
     <lb/>
     removed if some concessions were made by

     the Manitoba government on the school 
     <lb/>
     question. To that point I wish to address 
     <lb/>
     myself for a moment. I was requested by 
     <lb/>the First Minister to attend the meeting of<lb/>the 17th of February at which were present<lb/>the gentlemen named by him. I did not<lb/>know before going the object of the meeting.<lb/>I was aware that the Manitoba government<lb/>had sent to this administration a memorial<lb/>requesting, among other things, the exten<lb break="no"/>sion of its boundaries northward to Hudson<lb/>bay. The words of the memorial are liter<lb break="no"/>ally 'northward to Hudson bay.' I attend<lb break="no"/>ed that meeting and there were present Mr.<lb/>Colin Campbell, Mr. Rogers, the premier and<lb/>perhaps the Minister of Justice.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. The Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice was not present, so far as my 
     <lb/>
     recollection goes, during the time I was 
     <lb/>
     there. A few minutes after I arrived Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers,—who was the only minister from 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba who spoke—explained that his 
     <lb/>
     government desired the extension of the 
     <lb/>
     boundaries of Manitoba easterly to the Hud<lb break="no"/>son bay and northerly. The memorial said 
     <lb/>
     northerly, and when he explained that they 
     <lb/>
     desired an extension easterly to Hudson bay, 
     <lb/>
     so as to include territory at the mouth of the 
     <lb/>
     Churchill river and the Nelson river, I at 
     <lb/>
     once observed that he was asking to extend 
     <lb/>
     the territory of Manitoba easterly in a direc<lb break="no"/>tion which would perhaps interest the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario as well. Up to that mom<lb break="no"/>ent, when it was only proposed, so far as 
     <lb/>
     the memorial went, to extend Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     northerly,—although they may have intended 
     <lb/>
     north easterly to come out at Hudson bay— 
     <lb/>
     it did not occur to me that the desire was to 
     <lb/>
     go to the mouths of those two rivers. There<lb break="no"/>fore so soon as that object was known to 
     <lb/>
     me, I said that the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     would have the right to be heard before we 
     <lb/>
     could adjudicate upon that point or form 
     <lb/>
     any opinion upon it. Mr. Rogers took the 
     <lb/>
     ground that the province of Ontario had no 
     <lb/>
     right or claim to any territory lying north 
     <lb/>
     of that province and adjacent to Mani<lb break="no"/>toba's easterly limit, and therefore had no 
     <lb/>
     right to be heard. I controverted that view 
     <lb/>
     and explained that I could not agree to it. 
     <lb/>
     He said if you will allow me I can satisfy 
     <lb/>
     you that Ontario has no right to be heard. 
     <lb/>
     I replied that it would be a waste of time 
     <lb/>
     to try and convert me on that point and 
     <lb/>
     that, speaking as a minister from the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario, I must insist upon that 
     <lb/>
     province being heard before this question 
     <lb/>
     is gone into. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I did not succeed in influencing the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba representatives and I turned to the 
     <lb/>
     premier and informed him that, as a min<lb break="no"/>ister coming from Ontario, I was not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to discuss these questions affecting 
     <lb/>
     the rights of Ontario until the government of 
     <lb/>
     that province was present and could sub<lb break="no"/>mit its case. Upon that statement I with<lb break="no"/>drew from the meeting, and I am told 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     that the claim for extension to Hudson bay         
     <lb/>then and there ceased for the time being.<lb/>I take the ground to-day, as a minister from<lb/>Ontario, without expressing any opinion as<lb/>to how the territory should be divided, that<lb/>our province is entitled to an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to present its case before the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada deals with it. In my opin<lb break="no"/>ion it is quite possible to make a fair dis<lb break="no"/>tribution, so that Ontario may be able to<lb/>acquire a deep sea harbour and Manitoba<lb/>be similarly equipped on the Hudson bay.<lb/>Our territory extends to James bay but I be-<lb break="maybe"/>leive James bay is shallow and not suitable<lb/>ocean navigation, whereas when you<lb/>go to the west coast of Hudson bay, you<lb/>have two possible ports, one at the mouth<lb/>of the Nelson river, which with dredging<lb/>may be made a very good sea harbour, and<lb/>it might be regarded by the two provinces <lb/>as a fair division of territory if Manitoba<lb/>were given a harbour at the mouth of the <lb/>Churchill river and Ontario at Nelson<lb/>river. That was the idea that went through<lb/>my mind when I heard of this claim ; and so<lb/>far as the Papal Ablegate is concerned, the<lb/>statement made in this newspaper is the <lb/>first intimation I have that he took any part<lb/>in the adjustment of the boundaries of On<lb break="no"/>tario. Long before the interview in question,<lb/>I had given, so far as a minister from On<lb break="no"/>tario could do so, a decision as the atti<lb break="no"/>tude I assumed on that question, and that<lb/>was that until the province of Ontario could<lb/>be heard, no conclusion could be come to.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. R. L. BORDEN (Carleton, Ont.) I 
     <lb/>
     have very little to say in respect of what 
     <lb/>
     has fallen from the Prime Minister. I am 
     <lb/>
     glad to know that the Prime Minister to-day 
     <lb/>
     has not adhered to that reticence which has 
     <lb/>
     characterized him on similar occasions in 
     <lb/>
     the immediate past, and I suppose that it 
     <lb/>
     might be fair to assume, that if he had 
     <lb/>
     as good a case with respect to the ignoring 
     <lb/>
     of his Minister of the Interior and his Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance in regard to important 
     <lb/>
     measures as that which he has made to<lb break="no"/>day, with regard to the matter with which 
     <lb/>
     he has dealt, he would have given us an 
     <lb/>
     explanation that has not yet been made 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the introduction of this 
     <lb/>
     Bill without even consultation with these 
     <lb/>
     two gentlemen. It is gratifying to 
     <lb/>
     know that although two members of 
     <lb/>
     his own government could not be con<lb break="no"/>sulted with regard to the provisions of 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, the Postmaster General has been 
     <lb/>
     so strenuous in his advocacy of the rights 
     <lb/>
     of his province of Ontario that the minis<lb break="no"/>ters of that province had to be consulted. 
     <lb/>
     However, there is an old proverb that cha<lb break="no"/>rity well understood begins at home, and 
     <lb/>
     possibly the rights of ministers to be heard 
     <lb/>
     with regard to important matters to be 
     <lb/>
     dealt with by parliament may be extended 
     <lb/>
     not only to the provincial ministers of On<lb break="no"/>tario, but to ministers of this very adminis<lb break="no"/>tration.

            <p>
     I do not know anything about the letter 
     <lb/>
     of the 23rd of February which has been re<lb break="no"/>ferred to to-day except that I received a 
     <lb/>
     telegram only this morning from the at<lb break="no"/>torney general of Manitoba, who evidently 
     <lb/>
     had observed that this letter had not been 
     <lb/>
     included in the documents brought down, 
     <lb/>
     and he asked me to mention the matter to 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister and to see that it was 
     <lb/>
     brought down with the other documents. 
     <lb/>
     That is the only knowledge I have with 
     <lb/>
     regard to it and it is quite evident that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers and Mr. Campbell were thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     under the impression that that letter had 
     <lb/>
     not only been sent, but had been received 
     <lb/>
     by the Prime Minister. Assuming that that 
     <lb/>
     letter was written and should have been 
     <lb/>
     received it seems to bear out very strongly 
     <lb/>
     the view which Mr. Rogers had expressed 
     <lb/>
     in the interview alluded to by the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister. He says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir, as we find it necessary to leave Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     to-morrow, we desire to refer to our interview 
     <lb/>
     of Friday, the 17th, respecting Manitoba's 
     <lb/>
     claim for extension of her boundaries westward 
     <lb/>
     and northward, when you were good enough 
     <lb/>
     to suggest that if we would come here for two 
     <lb/>
     or three days you would be in a position to 
     <lb/>
     give us an answer respecting same. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     They remained here not only two or three 
     <lb/>
     days, but as the letter shows until the 23rd 
     <lb/>
     of February, and they departed without re<lb break="no"/>ceiving any answer or any intimation 
     <lb/>
     beyond that. But they received an intima<lb break="no"/>tion from His Excellency Monseigneur Sbar- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     retti which has been dealt with by the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister and by Mr. Rogers in his 
     <lb/>
     interview. As to that I have nothing to 
     <lb/>
     say to-day nor have I anything to say 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the whole situation, although 
     <lb/>
     it may afford an opportunity for a little 
     <lb/>
     more debate later on. It seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     the explanation of the Prime Minister which 
     <lb/>
     has been made in consequence of the inter<lb break="no"/>view with Mr. Rogers might well have been 
     <lb/>
     made at some earlier date. My right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) is surely not 
     <lb/>
     unaware that in two very important jour<lb break="no"/>nals, one of which at least is in very close 
     <lb/>
     touch with the administration and is sup<lb break="no"/>posed to have been controlled up to a day 
     <lb/>
     or two ago by a very prominent member of 
     <lb/>
     this administration, this very reason has 
     <lb/>
     been put forward. I would think that when 
     <lb/>
     a distinct rumour of that kind is heralded 
     <lb/>
     throughout the length and breadth of this 
     <lb/>
     country it might have been well for the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister at an earlier date to take 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity of contradicting that which 
     <lb/>
     he has so strongly contradicted to-day. He 
     <lb/>
     knows that every prominent journal in Can<lb break="no"/>ada has published words which are to be 
     <lb/>
     found in the Northwest ' Review,' in the 
     <lb/>
     later part of February or early in March 
     <lb/>
     and which are as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Two days after the ' Telegram ' had trumpet<lb break="no"/>ed abroad the Hon. Robert Rogers' great hopes 
     <lb/>
     for the western extension of Manitoba, the 
     <lb/>
     same wise and prophetic journal deplores the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     fact that there will be no such extension in 
     <lb/>
     any direction. But it omits to give the reason 
     <lb/>
     thereof. The only obstacle to the territorial 
     <lb/>
     expansion of our province is its iniquitous and 
     <lb/>
     cruel school system. Not even the wildest cor<lb break="no"/>ner of any unorganized territory will consent to 
     <lb/>
     saddle itself with such a tyranny. Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     must be content to remain small and mean so 
     <lb/>
     long as it maintains its small and mean school 
     <lb/>
     policy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is a pretty direct statement. In so 
     <lb/>
     many words it says that until Manitoba al<lb break="no"/>ters its schools policy it shall not have its 
     <lb/>
     boundaries extended in any direction. That 
     <lb/>
     or a similar statement in the press was 
     <lb/>
     brought to the attention of the House and 
     <lb/>
     my right hon. friend paid some attention to 
     <lb/>
     it then, but did not pay attention to it in 
     <lb/>
     this connection. I have observed his words 
     <lb/>
     carefully. He said there was no intention on 
     <lb/>
     the part of this administration to attempt 
     <lb/>
     any remedial legislation with respect to 
     <lb/>
     schools in Manitoba, but I did not observe in 
     <lb/>
     my right hon. friend's remarks on that oc<lb break="no"/>casion any suggestion that the statement I 
     <lb/>
     have read was absolutely without founda<lb break="no"/>tion, may I observe to the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman that it might have been better 
     <lb/>
     in the interests of the whole country that 
     <lb/>
     some such utterance as that which he has 
     <lb/>
     made to-day should have been made in con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the statement in the press to 
     <lb/>
     which I have referred ? In a journal, con<lb break="no"/>trolled as it is said—I know not with what 
     <lb/>
     truth—by a member of the administration 
     <lb/>
     until within the last two or three days, the 
     <lb/>
     same statement is made in very specific 
     <lb/>
     language, and it is right to observe also 
     <lb/>
     that this journal claims to be the special 
     <lb/>
     mouthpiece of the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). He has disclaimed 
     <lb/>
     that and I accept his disclaimer to the full. 
     <lb/>
     He says he is not interested in that journal. 
     <lb/>
     but the journal itself declares that it is the 
     <lb/>
     organ of the Liberal party, and that it is 
     <lb/>
     under the direction and absolute control of 
     <lb/>
     Sir Wilfrid Laurier. That journal has said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The school legislation of the little pro<lb break="no"/>vince— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That is the province of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     —is not of a nature to attract immigrants 
     <lb/>
     who people the districts. The Northwest has 
     <lb/>
     its separate schools, Manitoba has abolished 
     <lb/>
     them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Every good act has its reward, every bad act 
     <lb/>
     its chastisement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Manitoba will remain lowest with her pre<lb break="no"/>tentious law. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     A little before that the same paper says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In proportion to her big sisters Manitoba will 
     <lb/>
     count as little more than a large county. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In view of these suggestions, they are 
     <lb/>
     more than suggestions, in view of these dir<lb break="no"/>ect statements, one of them made by a 
     <lb/>
     journal supposed to be under the control of 
     <lb/>
     a very prominent member of the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration, and claiming for itself to be under

     the absolute direction and control of the

            <p>
     right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
     <lb/>
     in view of all this, might I not respectfully 
     <lb/>
     inquire whether it would not have been well 
     <lb/>
     for the right hon. gentleman on an earlier 
     <lb/>
     occasion than that which he has selected to 
     <lb/>
     have made to the country the statement 
     <lb/>
     which he has made to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have nothing to say with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     position which is said to have been assumed 
     <lb/>
     by His Excellency Monseigneur Sbarretti. 
     <lb/>
     He is not in any sense responsible to this 
     <lb/>
     parliament, he is responsible only to his 
     <lb/>
     ecclesiastical superiors in authority. The 
     <lb/>
     only persons who are in any way respon<lb break="no"/>sible to this parliament are the government 
     <lb/>
     of this country, and I thought that my right 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend to-day might have gone a little 
     <lb/>
     further than he did go. He knows as well 
     <lb/>
     as any of the rest of us, that it has been 
     <lb/>
     rumoured throughout this country, not only 
     <lb/>
     rumoured but stated in the public press 
     <lb/>
     that there were negotiations with His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency with regard to education in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories if not in Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     My right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
     <lb/>
     did not see fit to touch that question at all 
     <lb/>
     to-day and I suppose when he thinks a pro<lb break="no"/>per occasion arises he will deal with it, but 
     <lb/>
     in the meantime I may call his attention to 
     <lb/>
    the fact that the statements to that 
     <lb/>effect are being made in the press 
     <lb/>of the country ; upon what authority 
     <lb/>I do not know. All I do know is 
     <lb/>this, that when statements made in a very 
     <lb/>much less direct manner, and on very slight 
     <lb/>foundation were current in 1895 and 1896, 
     <lb/>with regard to the Conservative administra<lb break="no"/>tion of those days my hon. friend was al<lb break="no"/>ways ready to come forward and ask for 
     <lb/>ministerial explanations and if necessary to 
     <lb/>move the adjournment of the House in 
     <lb/>order that they might be discussed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     In view of the attitude which he saw fit 
     <lb/>
     to adopt ten years ago, we might have ex<lb break="no"/>pected that he would have gone a little 
     <lb/>
     further to-day when he called the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the House to these circumstances. As I 
     <lb/>
     said before, the matter may perhaps require 
     <lb/>
     to be discussed a little further. I was not 
     <lb/>
     aware that the right hon. gentleman intend<lb break="no"/>ed to bring it up to-day in this somewhat 
     <lb/>
     extended form. If necessary, it may be 
     <lb/>
     brought up and discussed on a future oc<lb break="no"/>casion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. D. STAPLES (Macdonald). I 
     <lb/>
     want to call attention for a moment to that 
     <lb/>
     mysterious letter of the 23rd of February. 
     <lb/>
     I think I can bring testimony to show where 
     <lb/>
     this letter went, and I think I can trace 
     <lb/>
     it to the right hon. the First Minister's 
     <lb/>
     own residence. Now, on the 23rd of Feb<lb break="no"/>ruary the Hon. Mr. Rogers, after writing 
     <lb/>
     this letter, asked me to see that it got over 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. the First Minister. I rang the 
     <lb/>
     bell from room No. 6, and there came a 
     <lb/>
     messenger named Julius Beaulieu, I gave 
     <lb/>
     the letter to him, and he said he would 
     <lb/>
     deliver it. He says now there is no doubt 
     <lb/>
     but that he did deliver the letter. Surely 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. R. L. BORDEN. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     we are living in a mysterious age, myster<lb break="no"/>ious things are taking place every day, 
     <lb/>
     and this is one of them. I wish to call the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman's attention to another 
     <lb/>
     statement he made. He told us to-day that 
     <lb/>
     his memory is as fresh now as it was in his 
     <lb/>
     younger days. He stated that the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Colin Campbell was on the floor of the 
     <lb/>
     House on the 22nd day of February when 
     <lb/>
     these Bills were introduced, which is not the 
     <lb/>
     case. I may add regarding that letter that 
     <lb/>
     I have been down and consulted the records 
     <lb/>
     in the messengers department in this build<lb break="no"/>ing, which show that this wonderful letter 
     <lb/>
     went from room No. 6, and that it was de<lb break="no"/>livered to the messenger at about the time 
     <lb/>
     that the messenger states, it was carried to 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman's residence on that 
     <lb/>
     particular day, and they show that it went 
     <lb/>
     from that particular room.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I want to cor<lb break="no"/>rect my hon. friend. I stated that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers was here on the 21st of February, 
     <lb/>
     and I am sure of that ; and I stated that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Campbell was here also, but I was not 
     <lb/>
     so sure of that and that is what I said. In 
     <lb/>
     regard to the letter that was sent to my 
     <lb/>
     House, I think that if it was sent to my 
     <lb/>
     house it must have gone astray somewhere, 
     <lb/>
     because I have never seen it. I really did 
     <lb/>
     not suppose that anybody would suspect that 
     <lb/>
     I would make an inaccurate statement in 
     <lb/>
     regard to that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN (South York). I in<lb break="no"/>tend for a few moments to refer to and com<lb break="no"/>ment upon the statement made here to-day. 
     <lb/>
     On February 27th I brought to the attention 
     <lb/>
     of this House the very question referred to 
     <lb/>
     just now by the leader of the opposition, 
     <lb/>
     when I read a declaration of the French 
     <lb/>
     newspaper called ' Le Soleil ,' saying it was 
     <lb/>
     the organ of the government, and I also read 
     <lb/>
     its editorial, which declared that Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     wes being punished by a denial of extension 
     <lb/>
     of her western or other boundaries because 
     <lb/>
     of her school laws. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman repudiated all that. He said 
     <lb/>
     there was no intention of punishing Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, and he made light of the state<lb break="no"/>ments I made. But since then it has 
     <lb/>come out that that newspaper was his 
     <lb/>newspaper, at least it has never been denied, 
     <lb/>and a colleague of his, according to a state<lb break="no"/>ment in the papers, transferred the other day 
     <lb/>a large portion of the shares he held in that 
     <lb/>paper to a senator who is a supporter of the 
     <lb/>right hon. gentleman. It has been shown 
     <lb/>by other quotations from papers supporting 
     <lb/>the government that little Manitoba was 
     <lb/>being punished for her iniquitious school 
     <lb/>legislation, there is no doubt about that. 
     <lb/>Now comes the Hon. Mr. Rogers, and his 
     <lb/>statement has been read here to-day and 
     <lb/>remains undenied in a great many re<lb break="no"/>spects so far as the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>is concerned. Mr. Rogers says that he 
     <lb/>received a letter from the Archbishop of 
     <lb/>Ephesus, Monseigneur Sbarretti, and there 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     is no denial of that; there is no denial of 
     <lb/>
     the fact that he waited upon the Apostolic 
     <lb/>
     delegate at his residence. There is another 
     <lb/>
     statement that the Papal ablegate presented 
     <lb/>
     to him these amendments which he desired 
     <lb/>
     to be put in the school law of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     and that is the question before the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada to-day. Did this Archbishop of 
     <lb/>
     Ephesus, the delegate Apostolic to Canada, 
     <lb/>
     this delegate of the Pope—did he pre<lb break="no"/>sent these amendments to one of the 
     <lb/>
     ministers of the province of Manitoba ? 
     <lb/>
     And what were they ? They were in the 
     <lb/>
     shape of a command that members of 
     <lb/>
     the government of Manitoba should stultify 
     <lb/>
     themselves by making provision in the law 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba for a separate school establish<lb break="no"/>ment, after it had been refused by the legis<lb break="no"/>lature and by the people of that country, 
     <lb/>
     and after the right hon. gentleman had .re<lb break="no"/>fused to pass remedial legislation or to take 
     <lb/>
     any hand in securing remedial legislation 
     <lb/>
     for the Catholic minority of that province. 
     <lb/>
     Well, that much has been proved. What 
     <lb/>
     more has been proved? What more has 
     <lb/>
     not been denied here to-day ? What is 
     <lb/>
     singular is that which has not been denied. 
     <lb/>
     Probably the right hon. gentleman is in no 
     <lb/>
     position to deny it. Mr. Rogers says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This invitation was accepted and His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency then presented the following memo<lb break="no"/>randum, remarking that if we would place this 
     <lb/>
     on the statute-book of our province it would 
     <lb/>
     greatly facilitate an early settlement of our 
     <lb/>
     mission, the fixing of our boundaries, which 
     <lb/>
     would be extended to the shores of Hudson 
     <lb/>
     bay. His Excellency further added that our 
     <lb/>
     failure to act in the past had prejudiced our 
     <lb/>
     claim for extension westward. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Now is that true or is it not ? Is it true 
     <lb/>
     that the delegate of the Pope told this mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Manitoba government that their 
     <lb/>
     failure to act in the past had prevented an 
     <lb/>
     extension of their western boundary, and 
     <lb/>
     that if they would give him this remedial 
     <lb/>
     legislation now—for it is remedial legisla<lb break="no"/>tion that he was seeking—they would get 
     <lb/>
     their request for an extension to the 
     <lb/>
     north. The people of Canada want to 
     <lb/>
     know to-day if that statement was really 
     <lb/>
     made. There has been no denial of it to<lb break="no"/>day. The Prime Minister says he cannot 
     <lb/>
     deny it, but the people of Canada want to 
     <lb/>
     know if it is true befdre any such Bill as that 
     <lb/>
     now before the House is passed. What more 
     <lb/>
     took place '2 There has been no denial to 
     <lb/>
     another statement of Mr. Rogers, namely, 
     <lb/>
     that this office of Papal delegate to Canada 
     <lb/>
     was created by the hon. gentlemen Opposite, 
     <lb/>
     or rather was created at their request—there 
     <lb/>
     is no denial of that. It is known now to 
     <lb/>
     all the people of this country that we have 
     <lb/>
     a Papal delegate here at the request of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite and that is proved in 
     <lb/>
     this very document. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. Mr. Speaker. 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman is entirely misstating the 
     <lb/>
     facts if he means by 'hon. gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite ' the government.

     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. _I did not say that. 
     <lb/>
     I said gentlemen sitting on the opposite 
     <lb/>
     side of the House are responsible for this 
     <lb/>
     Papal delegate being here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. I suppose the

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MAC-LEAN. Let me read what 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers says. The following extract has 
     <lb/>
     not been denied: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It is desirable, if not necessary, that the mis<lb break="no"/>sion of Monseigneur Merry Del Val should be or 
     <lb/>
     rather continued, and that he should be pre<lb break="no"/>sent in the midst of us for a more or less pro<lb break="no"/>longed time as the accredited representative 
     <lb/>
     of the Holy See. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The hon. Minister of Justice, as Mr. Chas. 
     <lb/>
     Fitzpatrick, and the right hon. Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister, as Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and forty other 
     <lb/>
     colleagues of theirs in this House made the 
     <lb/>
     representation to the Holy See and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice, though acting as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chas. Fitzpatrick, asked that this dele<lb break="no"/>gate should be sent to Canada. The state<lb break="no"/>ment is here and it is not denied. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILFRID LAURIER. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman can read the petition. The petition 
     <lb/>
     of the Catholic members was read in this 
     <lb/>
     House. ' 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. M'ACLEAN. I know and it 
     <lb/>
     proves that statement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir WILFRID LAURIER. No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. W'. F. MACLEAN. And then, the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     legal agent of this government in London 
     <lb/>
     was used as a missionary to go to Rome to 
     <lb/>
     have this appointment confirmed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SAM. HUGHES. How much did it 
     <lb/>
     cost ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. I do not know. 
     <lb/>
     This is an extract from the letter that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Russell presented in Rome : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I have just arrived at Rome once more at the 
     <lb/>
     urgent request of the Catholic members of the 
     <lb/>
     government and parliament of Canada. My in<lb break="no"/>structions enjoin the to again renew to Your 
     <lb/>
     Eminence the desire which I had already the 
     <lb/>
     honour to express to you, that His Holiness will 
     <lb/>
     be pleased to nominate a permanent delegate 
     <lb/>
     to Canada as a representative of His Holiness, 
     <lb/>
     who would reside on the spot. but would be 
     <lb/>
     outside all local interests. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That is not denied. Then, what else fol<lb break="no"/>lows '3 Mr. Russell, the Canadian legal re<lb break="no"/>presentative, wrote to His Eminence as fol<lb break="no"/>lows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We do not solicit His Holiness to sanction as 
     <lb/>
     perfect the concessions obtained, but that in his 
     <lb/>
     wisdom he will be pleased to regard them as 
     <lb/>
     a. beginning of justice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Now, that is a very important statement. 
     <lb/>
     The beginning of justice took place in 1896. 
     <lb/>
     The completion of justice is taking place 
     <lb/>
     in 1905, when the west is to be fettered in

     regard to her school freedom. In addition I 
     <lb/>
     wish to refer to another thing. Does not 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman, in the view of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, in the full concep<lb break="no"/>tion we have of responsible government in 
     <lb/>
     this country and in England, consider that 
     <lb/>
     he is responsible for that delegate being 
     <lb/>
     here and responsible for his conduct in this 
     <lb/>
     country just as much as if he were one of 
     <lb/>
    his own administration, or one of his own 
     <lb/>civil service ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman and his colleagues laugh, but 
     <lb/>
     they brought that high dignitary here. He 
     <lb/>
     came at their request and for all the things 
     <lb/>
     that he does in connection with the politics 
     <lb/>
     and education of this country the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman will find that he is held respon<lb break="no"/>sible, and as a matter of fact he is respon<lb break="no"/>sible, within the full meaning of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. SAM. HUGHES. He has not denied 
     <lb/>
     his responsibility. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Now, we have 
     <lb/>
     had it very clearly pointed out in this de<lb break="no"/>bate so far that the ablegate is here at the 
     <lb/>
     request of the government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. That is not 
     <lb/>
     correct. He is not here at the request of 
     <lb/>
     the government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. He is here at the 
     <lb/>
     request of hon. gentlemen opposite. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. Some gentle<lb break="no"/>men. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. He is here, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to Mr. Russell's statement, which 
     <lb/>
     has never been denied, at the request of 
     <lb/>
    members of the government of Canada and 
     <lb/>at the request of members of the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, and I say, and I say it in 
     <lb/>the hearing of the people of Canada, that 
     <lb/>the government of the day are responsible 
     <lb/>because all the members of the government 
     <lb/>are responsible for the acts of the individ<lb break="no"/>ual members of the government and every 
     <lb/>member who sits behind them and supports 
     <lb/>the government is responsible for the con<lb break="no"/>duct of the government in this matter. We  
     <lb/>referred to Russian rule the other day. They  
     <lb/>have the procurator general of the Holy 
     <lb/>Synod in Russia, and it looks now to me as  
     <lb/>if the Papal ablegate in this country occu<lb break="no"/>pies the same position as a member of this 
     <lb/>government. Any way the evidence of that 
     <lb/>is not denied ; it has not been denied to-day. 
     <lb/>The Papal ablegate has had an oppourtunity 
     <lb/>day after day of denying it. For some rea<lb break="no"/>son he has not seen fit to deny it and un<lb break="no"/>less he does deny it, it will be taken as true 
     <lb/>that he did have that conversation with 
     <lb/>Mr. Rogers, that he did press the acceptance 
     <lb/>of these two amendments upon them, that 
     <lb/>he did tell them that if they did accept 
     <lb/>them they would find that their boundaries 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>would be extended to the north, and that<lb/>the reason that their boundaries had not<lb/>been extended to the west was because of<lb/>their school legislation. This is something<lb/>that the people want an explanation of. It<lb/>is something of which no explanation has<lb/>been given here to-day and if the right hon.<lb/>leader of the government thinks that this<lb/>is to pass off with the explanation made<lb/>here to-day he greatly misunderstands the<lb/>situation of this country. There is a poli<lb break="no"/>tical crisis in this country, there is a feeling<lb/>of unrest that hon. gentlemen opposite pre<lb break="no"/>tend to ignore but it is here, it must be<lb/>dealt with and there is nothing that con<lb break="no"/>firms it so much as the timidity of hon.<lb/>gentlemen opposite. They are afraid to do<lb/>anything. They cannot fill the vacancies in<lb/>their cabinet. They cannot send the hon.<lb/>member for London (Mr. Hyman) back for<lb/>the endorsation of his constituents, they are<lb/>doing everything that men who have done<lb/>wrong and fear public censure could do, but<lb/>they are not discharging their duty as they<lb/>ought to discharge it.<lb/>
               <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
     I do not know that the right hon. leader<lb/>of the government made it clear whether<lb/>any of his colleagues had been in consulta<lb break="no"/>tion with the Papal ablegate or not, but<lb/>let us recall what took place. It is well to<lb/>bear in mind that there are two faiths in<lb/>this country ; there is the Roman Catholic<lb/>faith and there is the Protestant faith, and<lb/>there is such a thing as keeping faith be<lb break="no"/>tween the two faiths in this country. How<lb/>did this Bill come before parliament as far<lb/>
               <lb/>
               <lb/>as we know from the discussion which has 
     <lb/>
     taken place here ? The right hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the government, the hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice, and the hon. the Secretary of State, 
     <lb/>
     three co-religionists, one with the other drew 
     <lb/>
     up this Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. Order. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. BRODEUR. Shame. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Now let me make 
     <lb/>
     my statement. The hon. Postmaster Gen- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     earl (Sir William Mulock) and the hon. the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Customs (Mr. Paterson), who 
     <lb/>
     are supposed to represent Ontario opinion, 
     <lb/>
     as far as we know, were not present when 
     <lb/>
     it was drawn up. Then, we have the fur<lb break="no"/>ther statement that the hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance (Mr. Fielding) and the hon. ex-Min- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton), both men 
     <lb/>
     who were supposed to represent the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant faith in the government,–I suppose 
     <lb/>
     there has been some recognition of religion 
     <lb/>
     in the formation of the cabinet—were not 
     <lb/>
     consulted. But, on the contrary, by some 
     <lb/>
     process of stealth, it was got past them. 
     <lb/>
     There is no accounting for that, but the 
     <lb/>
     fact remains that legislation was actually 
     <lb/>
     introduced by three members of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and I am not saying anything as 
     <lb/>
     reflecting on their religion in any way 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever, but they happen to be of one 
     <lb/>
     religion, and they did not consult with their 
     <lb/>
     colleagues before the Bill was introduced.

     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance says he knew nothing 
     <lb/>
     about it and they both have said in the

     taken past the representatives of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in the Northwest Territories, and 
     <lb/>
     by stealth it was taken past the caucus of 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite, so that, as far as 
     <lb/>
     we know, this Bill got into this House un<lb break="no"/>der the circumstances which I have stated

     they are. I take the full responsibility for

            </p>

            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Take it back. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. I will modify it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SPEAKER. Withdraw it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. _F. MACLEAN. Which state<lb break="no"/>ment ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. As I understand, when 
     <lb/>
     you are out of order and I have directed 
     <lb/>
     you to do so, you will withdraw the state<lb break="no"/>ment which is out of order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. What statement 
     <lb/>
     do you object to? I said the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is paying his political debts 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. Order. My ruling must 
     <lb/>
     not be discussed; it I am wrong the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has his remedy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Will you please 
     <lb/>
     tell me the statement to which you object ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. WHITE. Mr. Speaker, I do not wish 
     <lb/>
     to call your judgment in question, but if 
     <lb/>
     the point you make is that the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South York is out of order in saying 
     <lb/>
     that the right hon. the Prime Minister is 
     <lb/>
     paying his political debts, it seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that is straining the rule. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     White), as I understand it. misconceives 
     <lb/>
     what the hon. member (Mr. W. F. Mac- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     lean) has said. As I understood him, he 
     <lb/>
     said that the Prime Minister was attempt<lb break="no"/>ing to pay his political debts by sacrificing 
     <lb/>
     the civil rights of the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MAGLEAN. And the educa<lb break="no"/>tional rights of the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. In my judgment and 
     <lb/>
     under my ruling, that is an otfensive state<lb break="no"/>ment in reference to the Prime Minister. 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. gentleman must withdraw. 
     <lb/>
     If I am wrong in that, he has his remedy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Withdraw. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     must bow and withdraw, and I will have 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity elsewhere of saying what 
     <lb/>
     my opinion is. And now, Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     want to say this, that we have government 
     <lb/>
     in this country— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>

            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. I am again in the judg<lb break="no"/>ment of the House, when I call a gentleman 
     <lb/>
     to order who says to another member who is 
     <lb/>
     speaking. directing his reference to the

     Mr. SAM. HUGHES. I rise to a point of

     order. I rise to take the full responsibility 
     <lb/>
     in this House for what I have said. I say 
     <lb/>
     that the member for South York ought not 
     <lb/>
     to be bluffed by any authority in this House.

     Sam. Hughes' ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. My opinion is, 
     <lb/>
     and I take the full responsibility for saying 
     <lb/>
     it, and I intend to say it from one end of 
     <lb/>
     this country to the other, that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of this country is to-day due to two 
     <lb/>
     things. The government of this country is 
     <lb/>
     to-day due to a combination between a 
     <lb/>
     solid Quebec and a corporation interest in 
     <lb/>
     this country, which is centred in Toronto. 
     <lb/>
     And what happened here the other night in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the municipal rights of the city 
     <lb/>
     of Ottawa is one instance of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Yes, it is one 
     <lb/>
     instance where the municipal rights— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Nonsense. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Yes ; the muni<lb break="no"/>cipal rights of the people of Ontario were 
     <lb/>
     in question here the other night, and there 
     <lb/>
     was a vote of eighty against them, and 
     <lb/>
     forty-one of that eighty came from the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec. And this legislation which 
     <lb/>
     is brought here today, this proposal to put 
     <lb/>
     fetters on the people of the west in regard 
     <lb/>
     to their educational authority, is a contri<lb break="no"/>bution to the demand from a solid Quebec 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the Northwest shall be 
     <lb/>
     deprived of their educational rights. The 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest are here asking for 
     <lb/>
     educational freedom, and I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     they will get three or five votes from the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec. It is evident that the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec is going out of its way— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BELCOURT. Nonsense. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEA N. It is evident that 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec is going out of its 
     <lb/>
     way to put fetters on and manacle the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the west and deprive them of their 
     <lb/>
     rights under the constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BELCOURT. Why don't you march 
     <lb/>
     on Quebec right off ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Just let me bring 
     <lb/>
     out an instance that shows it. The province 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba has been denied an extension 
     <lb/>
     of her boundaries at the instigation of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     An hon. MEMBER. Prove it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. I will prove it in 
     <lb/>
     this way : that a solid Quebec within two 
     <lb/>
     or three members will vote for this iniquit<lb break="no"/>ous proposition in regard to the autonomy 
     <lb/>of the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SPEAKER. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Sir WILLIAM MULOCK. Will the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman allow me to put a question to 
     <lb/>
     him ? Speaking of the demand of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba to extend its boundary 
     <lb/>
     easterly to Hudson bay, does he say, or 
     <lb/>
     does he not, that the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     should be heard before such a request is 
     <lb/>
     conceded ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MAGLEAN. I will not deny 
     <lb/>
     that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. And when the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General said that the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario ought to be consulted in regard 
     <lb/>
     to a few waste acres, what about the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the west, and the minister from the 
     <lb/>
     west, and the government of the west, not 
     <lb/>
     being consulted in regard to their civil and 
     <lb/>
     educational liberties ? What is a bit of 
     <lb/>
     land to a man's educational rights ? What 
     <lb/>
     is a bit of land to a man's freedom and 
     <lb/>
     religious liberty ? Coming back to the other 
     <lb/>
     issue. When the little province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     asked for an extension to the west, 'Le 
     <lb/>
     Soleil' of Quebec denied that request, and 
     <lb/>
     gave as a reason— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Let me give you 
     <lb/>
     another reason which also comes from the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec. If Manitoba were 
     <lb/>
     allowed to extend her boundaries to the 
     <lb/>
     west, that portion of the new territory 
     <lb/>
     brought into Manitoba would have no se<lb break="no"/>parate schools and that portion of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories which remained in the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces would have the right to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools under this legislation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. TURRIFF. I beg leave to ask a 
     <lb/>
     question. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. TURRIFF. The province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     has not the first thing to do, one way or 
     <lb/>
     the other, with the extension of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     to the west— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. I understood the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to say he wanted to ask a ques<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. TURRIFF. I want to ask what evi<lb break="no"/>dence he has that the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     would prevent the extension of Manitoba to 
     <lb/>
     the west ? It is the people of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories who object to the extension of Maui 
     <lb/>
     toba westward. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. The province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec made the statement here through 
     <lb/>
     one of its members that they helped to pay 
     <lb/>
     for that land in the west, and they have 
     <lb/>
     as much to say about it as the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Turriff). 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     MR. INGRAM. Which land ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. I am not going 
     <lb/>
     to discuss private ownership of land in this 
     <lb/>
     House. Now, Mr. Speaker, I have made it 
     <lb/>
     clear—

            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh ; where ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite like to throw out their gibes 
     <lb/>
     and their flaunts, but it is clear that if the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba had been extended 
     <lb/>
     westward, even if it were only one meri<lb break="no"/>dian, it would have knocked the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional argument of the Prime Minister into 
     <lb/>
     a cocked hat. And if Manitoba were ex<lb break="no"/>tended westward, that portion included in it 
     <lb/>
     would be free from this separate school 
     <lb/>
     clause. Now, then, I want to deal with the 
     <lb/>
     solid Quebec and what they are doing in 
     <lb/>
     regard to this school question. This is a 
     <lb/>
     question that never should have come into 
     <lb/>
     this House. It is a local question which 
     <lb/>
     could be settled in a local way, and which 
     <lb/>
     should not be spread out in the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     parliament as a federal issue. It should 
     <lb/>
     have been settled in the province ; it should 
     <lb/>
     have been left to the west. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BRODEUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to a 
     <lb/>
     point of order. I do not think the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman should discuss the Bill which is now 
     <lb/>
     engaging the attention of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. I think that is the rule. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BENNETT. Take it up to Centre 
     <lb/>
     Toronto. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Then I have this 
     <lb/>
     to say, that this Bill which is the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of discussion here to-day— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. If hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men will have it that way, I will leave 
     <lb/>
     it with them ; but I have this to say in 
     <lb/>
     conclusion, that any legislation which is at<lb break="no"/>tempted in this House in regard to this 
     <lb/>
     matter will receive whatever opposition I 
     <lb/>
     can command, and the opposition of a con<lb break="no"/>siderable number of the members from 
     <lb/>
     Ontario. The right hon. gentleman is near 
     <lb/>
     the exhaustion of his supplies, and, so far 
     <lb/>
     as I am concerned, I wish to tell him now 
     <lb/>
     that no legislation of the character that he 
     <lb/>
     has introduced without consulting the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the west will be allowed to go through 
     <lb/>
     committee or any other stage as long as I 
     <lb/>
     am able to oppose it, with some others who 
     <lb/>
     will be associated with me in that work. 
     <lb/>
     This legislation is not in the interest of the

     people of Canada. There will be meetings

     held in this country from one end to the

     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. All right. Hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen may make these statements here ; 
     <lb/>
     but let them come out on the platform with 
     <lb/>
     me, and see who will get a hearing. Let 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman open a constituency 
     <lb/>
     in the west if he dare. Let him put up his 
     <lb/>
     candidate in Centre Toronto to justify the 
     <lb/>
     statements made here to-day. Let the Post<lb break="no"/>master General dare to face a meeting in 
     <lb/>
     the city of Toronto. He dare not go even 
     <lb/>

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     into his own constituency of North York 
     <lb/>
     and discuss this Bill. I will go into North 
     <lb/>
     York and discuss it before his own electors. 
     <lb/>
     I challenge him now to name the day and 
     <lb/>
     the place in North York where he will dis<lb break="no"/>cuss this measure with me. Or I will resign 
     <lb/>
     my seat if he will resign his seat, and I 
     <lb/>
     will run against him in North York. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I repeat that I will resign my 
     <lb/>
     seat in South York and run against the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General in North York where he 
     <lb/>
     had a majority of nearly one thousand. 
     <lb/>
     And I challenge the member for London 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Hyman) to resign his seat, and I will 
     <lb/>
     go and run against him there. I challenge 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Centre York (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell) to do the same. That hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman would have been to-day in the cabinet 
     <lb/>
     but for this legislation ; but because of 
     <lb/>
     this legislation his career is absolutely 
     <lb/>
     wound up, and he dare not resign his seat. 
     <lb/>
     But if he does, I will resign mine and run 
     <lb/>
     against him in Centre York. Yes, I will 
     <lb/>
     go further : I will resign my seat, and I 
     <lb/>
     will run in Oxford if the government 
     <lb/>
     care to make a vacancy there, and I 
     <lb/>
     will make only the one issue, the abandon<lb break="no"/>ment of provincial rights by this govern<lb break="no"/>ment, which at one time professed to be 
     <lb/>
     the champion of provincial rights. Later 
     <lb/>
     on I intend to expand much more fully on 
     <lb/>
     this question, when I suppose I shall be 
     <lb/>
     more in order than I am to-day. But I 
     <lb/>
     do now challenge the Prime Minister and 
     <lb/>
     those who sit alongside of him. Where is 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) 
     <lb/>
     who is implicated in these statements, and 
     <lb/>
     who ought to be here to-day ? I expect 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite to make a state<lb break="no"/>ment on this matter to-morrow. I expect 
     <lb/>
     them to go to the Papal ablegate, who is 
     <lb/>
     here at their request, and get from him 
     <lb/>
     a statement which will clear them of the 
     <lb/>
     charge made to-day. The denial which has 
     <lb/>
     been made is no denial. It is not even an 
     <lb/>
     explanation to the country, which today is 
     <lb/>
     demanding that an answer be made to the 
     <lb/>
     statement made in that letter of Mr. Rogers 
     <lb/>
     and no answer is forthcoming. The people 
     <lb/>
     Want to know if those two propositions were 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the Minister of Public Works 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba. The people want to know if 
     <lb/>
     there was a reference in that interview to 
     <lb/>
     the question of the Manitoba boundaries ; 
     <lb/>
     and, if it is true, they want to know what 
     <lb/>
     the government of Canada intend to do. 
     <lb/>
     We know what President Cleveland did 
     <lb/>
     with the British ambassador. The moment 
     <lb/>
     he was trapped into making a statement 
     <lb/>
     which he should not have made, President 
     <lb/>
     Cleveland gave him his passport. I say 
     <lb/>
     that the right hon. gentleman, as a member 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion government, and the forty 
     <lb/>
     members of parliament who were associated 
     <lb/>
     with him, are bound to send Mr. Russell to 
     <lb/>
     Rome, even at the expense of the Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     to ask for the recall of this Italian priest 
     <lb/>
     who has had the temerity to interfere with 
     <lb/>

     the government of this country. Hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen may laugh ; but we all know what 
     <lb/>
     King John said—and let me tell these hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen that this is my sentiment—that 
     <lb/>
     'no Italian priest shall tithe or toll in our 
     <lb/>
     dominions.' Now, there is a proposal to toll 
     <lb/>
     and tithe in our dominions by an outside 
     <lb/>
     influence. The Prime Minister knows that 
     <lb/>
     his statement was not in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the facts when he said that there was no 
     <lb/>
     intention to interfere with the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     school lands. There is practically an in<lb break="no"/>tention to interfere with the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     school lands, and there is a proposition to 
     <lb/>
     toll and tithe in our domains by an outside 
     <lb/>
     influence. I leave hon. gentlemen to ex<lb break="no"/>plain this matter before the country. They 
     <lb/>
     have not explained it to-day ; I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe they can explain it. I challenge 
     <lb/>
     them to attempt to explain it before this 
     <lb/>
     House. I challenge them to come out on 
     <lb/>
     the public platform and try to explain the 
     <lb/>
     statements that have been made here to<lb break="no"/>day.

     Mr. H. H. MILLER. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) has to<lb break="no"/>day quoted Shakespeare. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     remind him of another quotation, the words 
     <lb/>
     of one Shakespearian character to another: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Get thee glass eyes, and, like a scurvy politi<lb break="no"/>cian,

     Mr. IV. F. MACLEAN. Mr. Speaker: 1 
     <lb/>
     rise to a point of order. I thought, when you 
     <lb/>
     were so earnest in the discharge of your 
     <lb/>
     duty to protect the good name of members 
     <lb/>
     of this House, that the same earnestness 
     <lb/>
     would have characterized your conduct to<lb break="no"/>wards the hon. gentleman who has referred 
     <lb/>
     to me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. If the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
    had heard distinctly, he would have heard 
     <lb/>me call that hon. gentleman to order also. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Then I must ask 
     <lb/>
     the hon. the Speaker to call on the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber to withdraw the statement.

            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. I call on the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber who applied the term ' scurvy politician' 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. member for South York to with<lb break="no"/>draw the term.

     Mr. HENRI BOURASSA (Labelle). Mr.

     Speaker, I have no intention of following 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for South York (Mr. W. F. 
     <lb/>
     Maclean) through the rambling speech which 
     <lb/>
     we have just heard. I desire simply to ask 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     hon. gentlemen opposite if they really intend 
     <lb/>
     to fasten on the parliament of Canada such 
     <lb/>
     a reputation that in any civilized country we 
     <lb/>
     would be looked upon as not worthy of en<lb break="no"/>joying liberty of speech and representative 
     <lb/>
     institutions. In Russia where there is no 
     <lb/>
     such thing as representative government, no 
     <lb/>
     sane, no decent man would think of getting 
     <lb/>
     up before any audience of peasants, de<lb break="no"/>prived of the most primary education, and 
     <lb/>
     make such an onslaught on the representa<lb break="no"/>tive of His Holiness the Pope as has been 
     <lb/>
     made in this House. Why, all the civilized 
     <lb/>
     nations of the world entertain relations 
     <lb/>
     with the head of the Catholic church. The 
     <lb/>
     Protestant government of England enter<lb break="no"/>tains direct and official relations with the 
     <lb/>
     Pope. The Protestant government of Germ<lb break="no"/>any, the Orthodox government of Russia— 
     <lb/>
     in fact all the governments of the world, in<lb break="no"/>cluding the government of Washington. 
     <lb/>
     entertain official relations with the Pope, 
     <lb/>
     and no citizen of any one of these countries 
     <lb/>
     would think for a moment that it was any 
     <lb/>
     discredit to his country that it should hold 
     <lb/>
     relations with the highest moral authority 
     <lb/>
     acknowledged by the greatest number of 
     <lb/>
     men in this world at present. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) 
     <lb/>
     has challenged the Postmaster General and 
     <lb/>
     other members of this government and of 
     <lb/>
     parliament to go and make an election in 
     <lb/>
     their respective counties and to meet him on 
     <lb/>
     the public platform. But on what ground, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, does he invite them to make the elec<lb break="no"/>tion ? 0n the ground of provincial rights. 
     <lb/>
     He had not even the courage to say what 
     <lb/>
     really was the ground on which he wanted 
     <lb/>
     to make the contest. If he had stated the 
     <lb/>
     true grounds on which he would care to run 
     <lb/>
     an election, he would have stated grounds 
     <lb/>
     which might have been of some use in 
     <lb/>
     England 300 years ago but would not be 
     <lb/>
     tolerated in any civilized country to-day— 
     <lb/>
     the ground of no popery and no romish 
     <lb/>
     domination. That is the cry the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman would like to raise. And that is the 
     <lb/>
     kind of cry, as things have been going, the 
     <lb/>
     past few weeks, which the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition will be charged with encouraging. 
     <lb/>
     That is the cry which the leader of a once 
     <lb/>
     respected party in the Dominion is lending 
     <lb/>
     himself to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I am charged with 
     <lb/>
     that perhaps by the hon. gentleman but I 
     <lb/>
     absolutely deny that anything of the kind 
     <lb/>
     can be taken from any word I have spoken. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BOURASSA. The leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition has got into this unfortunate posi<lb break="no"/>tion that he is not even capable of either 
     <lb/>
     standing for or against anything which is 
     <lb/>
     going on in his party. He will not be 
     <lb/>
     charged with being the direct author or pro<lb break="no"/>moter of all the offensive and silly things 
     <lb/>
     which are being stated in the organs of his 
     <lb/>
     party and by some members of his party, 
     <lb/>
     but he will be charged with not having the 
     <lb/>
     courage and the manliness of standing up 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     and denouncing such an infamous policy. 
     <lb/>
     And at a moment like this, when such ap<lb break="no"/>peals are being made to the worst passions 
     <lb/>
     of the people, the leaders of great parties 
     <lb/>
     who have not the courage to stand up against 
     <lb/>
     this current of opinion and check the fanati<lb break="no"/>cism of their partisans, are as responsible 
     <lb/>
     as if they were the authors of them. Let 
     <lb/>
     the hon. the leader of the opposition consult 
     <lb/>
     some of his best and most enlightened 
     <lb/>
     friends. Let him have a conversation upon 
     <lb/>
     this question—I will not say with the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) or 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Beauharnois (Mr. Ber- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     geron), who have shown by their speeches 
     <lb/>
     that they had the courage to separate from 
     <lb/>
     their party upon a question like this and 
     <lb/>
     stand for truth and justice and fair-play— 
     <lb/>
     but I will say to the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion : let him consult the most enlightened 
     <lb/>
     Protestant members of his party, those men 
     <lb/>
     who have been educated in the political 
     <lb/>
     school of the late Sir John Macdonald, and 
     <lb/>
     ask them if the Conservative party is follow<lb break="no"/>ing a wise and a good course in allowing 
     <lb/>
     itself to be dragged down to such depths of 
     <lb/>
     political infamy, as it is being dragged into 
     <lb/>
     by the Toronto ' News ' and the Toronto 
     <lb/>
     ' World,' and the hon. member for East Grey 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sproule) and the member for South York 
     <lb/>
     and the member for Victoria and Haliburton 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sam. Hughes). These gentlemen may 
     <lb/>
     meet with some success for a little while ; 
     <lb/>
     but as a French Canadian, who has gone 
     <lb/>
     time and again into the province of Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     I have too much respect for the good people 
     <lb/>
     of that province to think that even if they 
     <lb/>
     may get excited a little while by such wild 
     <lb/>
     appeals, they will stand for any such policy. 
     <lb/>
     The member for South York (Mr. W. F. 
     <lb/>
     Maclean) has defied any member of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to go and meet him on the public 
     <lb/>
     platform in the province of Ontario. Well, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, I am ready to accept that chal<lb break="no"/>lenge. I am ready to meet the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) or the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) or 
     <lb/>
     even the hon. and gallant member for Vic<lb break="no"/>toria and Haliburton (Mr. Sam. Hughes) 
     <lb/>
     even with his man Turpin behind him—I 
     <lb/>
     am ready to go and discuss the issue with 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen before any audience in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario. I do not say that I 
     <lb/>
     would gather votes ; but I say that if any 
     <lb/>
     man in this House, whether French or 
     <lb/>
     English-speaking, Protestant or Catholic, 
     <lb/>
     Liberal or Conservative, would go and ap<lb break="no"/>peal to the common sense and spirit of fair- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     play of the people of Ontario he would, if 
     <lb/>
     not gain votes, at least get a good hearing. 
     <lb/>
      And I do not hesitate to say that in the long 
     <lb/>
     run, when the heat of passion had subsided, 
     <lb/>
     he might even ask for some votes on such 
     <lb/>
     a ground.

            <p>As regards the propriety and the advisa<lb break="no"/>bility of the presence of a Papal delegate in

     As a matter of fact that is perfectly true. 
     <lb/>
     But even if the government of Canada had 
     <lb/>
     requested the Pope to send a delegate to this 
     <lb/>
     country, would that be a greater sin than is 
     <lb/>
     committed by other governments at Wash<lb break="no"/>ington, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Vienna ? 
     <lb/>
     Even the present anti-clerical French gov<lb break="no"/>ernment at Paris, though the official rela<lb break="no"/>tions have been broken off, keep relations 
     <lb/>
     with an unofficial representative of the Holy 
     <lb/>
     See. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     An hon. MEMBER. And in London. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BOURASSA. No, I do not think there 
     <lb/>
     is an official ablegate in London. But I un<lb break="no"/>derstand there is an accredited representa<lb break="no"/>tive of His Holiness there who keeps up re<lb break="no"/>lations between the British government and 
     <lb/>
     the head of the church. But the talents of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for South York (Mr. W. F. 
     <lb/>
     Maclean) have been wasted. He should 
     <lb/>
     have gone to the old country some years ago, 
     <lb/>
     when, through the representative of the 
     <lb/>
     British government in Rome—not the repre<lb break="no"/>sentative accredited to the King of Italy but 
     <lb/>
     the representative accredited to the Pope— 
     <lb/>
     the British government entered into negotia<lb break="no"/>tions with His Holiness in order to bring 
     <lb/>
     about a better understanding between the 
     <lb/>
     Irish party and the government of England. 
     <lb/>
     Even in that small section of the British 
     <lb/>
     empire from which, if I know anything of 
     <lb/>
     their origin, my hon. friends from South 
     <lb/>
     York and Victoria and Haliburton come, 
     <lb/>
     there arose no cry of dissent to that proceed<lb break="no"/>ing. Even the Ulster Orangemen were not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to find any fault if, through the 
     <lb/>
     pacifying influence of His Holiness, the Irish 
     <lb/>
     people could be brought to a better under<lb break="no"/>standing with the King of England. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from South York (Mr. W. F. 
     <lb/>
     Maclean) at the beginning of the session 
     <lb/>
     made a plea for greater autonomy for Can<lb break="no"/>ada. Sir, the people of Canada would not 
     <lb/>
     be worthy of greater autonomy if one great 
     <lb/>
     political party of this country, which once 
     <lb/>
     held the reins of the government for years 
     <lb/>
     and which may again occupy office, has no 
     <lb/>
     better understanding of what constitutes 
     <lb/>
     the dignity of a nation, no better appreci<lb break="no"/>ation of the feelings of two millions of their 
     <lb/>
     fellow-citizens, and no better sense of the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which a respectable government 
     <lb/>
     should conduct the business of a self-reliant 
     <lb/>
     and self-respecting people, especially in their 
     <lb/>
     relations with foreign powers. And if the 
     <lb/>
     government of the Pope was for a time a 
     <lb/>
     foreign government from a temporal point 
     <lb/>
     of view, it is to-day no longer a temporal 
     <lb/>
     government but only a high moral govern<lb break="no"/>ment, guiding the spiritual affairs of 300,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     000,000 of human beings, among which are 
     <lb/>
     12,000,000 respectable, law-abiding British 
     <lb/>
     subjects, including 2,000,000 Canadians of 
     <lb/>
     different origins. It is unworthy of mem<lb break="no"/>

     bers of this House, of representatives of a

     great party, and representatives of a great 
     <lb/>
     province such as the province of Ontario, to 
     <lb/>
     come here and by means of innuendoes and 
     <lb/>
     insinuations and accusations which they 
     <lb/>
     have not the courage to make openly from 
     <lb/>
     their seats in parliament, to try and excite 
     <lb/>
     religious strife. I say they dare not make 
     <lb/>
     these openly because when you pin them 
     <lb/>
     down to the crucial point, they say : Oh 
     <lb/>
     yes, you are ruled by the Pope, and you are 
     <lb/>
     under French domination, but what we are 
     <lb/>
     ready to discuss in this House is provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights and constitutional principles. They 
     <lb/>
     are prepared to lead the people of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     to vote for provincial rights, but to do so 
     <lb/>
     animated by anti-Popish, anti-French feel<lb break="no"/>ings.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With reference to the request made by 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic members of the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
     to the Pope for the nomination of a Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate, I have no shame in saying that 
     <lb/>
     I have taken my share in that action; I 
     <lb/>
     have signed the document, and I have no 
     <lb/>
     shame either as a French Canadian, a Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic, a British subject, or a member of 
     <lb/>
     this House, for so doing. Sir, knowing and 
     <lb/>
     appreciating as I do the liberty I enjoy as 
     <lb/>
     a British subject, under the British Crown, 
     <lb/>
     I was proud to ask the highest moral au<lb break="no"/>thority of the church to which I belong 
     <lb/>
     to send here a Papal ablegate who would 
     <lb/>
     see that good and proper relations existed 
     <lb/>
     between the clergy and laity of Quebec, to 
     <lb/>
     see that relations between the clergy and 
     <lb/>
     laity would be such that there would not 
     <lb/>
     be any cause of misunderstanding such as 
     <lb/>
     those which occurred at certain times in 
     <lb/>
     the past. The cause which induced the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal Catholic members of this House 
     <lb/>
     to seek the appointment of an ablegate here 
     <lb/>
     was that we could not see eye to eye with 
     <lb/>
     a certain part of our clergy as to the right 
     <lb/>
     way of dealing with certain political ques<lb break="no"/>tions. And, Sir, in that respect I want to 
     <lb/>
     remind the House of the words of one of 
     <lb/>
     the greatest Protestant writers and philoso<lb break="no"/>phers of the nineteenth century, who has 
     <lb/>
     said that the Catholic church was a great 
     <lb/>
     school of respect. Appealing to the head 
     <lb/>
     of the church, we found justice, enlighten<lb break="no"/>ment, breadth of view and respect for the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the people. At one time or an<lb break="no"/>other there was trouble between the clergy 
     <lb/>
     and people of Quebec. Hon. gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite are always talking about the priest- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     ridden people of Quebec, about the clerical 
     <lb/>
     domination under which the poor habitant 
     <lb/>
     is resting; but, Sir, do you know that we 
     <lb/>
     never stood from our clergy the kind of 
     <lb/>
     sermons and political interference that has 
     <lb/>
     been going on for the last month in On<lb break="no"/>tario ? For what reason did we ask the 
     <lb/>
     Pope to send an ablegate out here ? Ex<lb break="no"/>actly to prevent what is going on now in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario. And this was not 
     <lb/>the first time that an ablegate was sent to<lb/>Canada. The same thing was done in 1876<lb/>and later on on the 80's. But how was it in<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BOURASSA. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     those days ? The arch-defenders of British 
     <lb/>
     citizenship and of loyalty to Protestantism 
     <lb/>
     never raised their voices against the rela<lb break="no"/>tions which existed between the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Quebec and the Pope. 
     <lb/>
     Why ? Because of political reasons; be<lb break="no"/>cause in those days the people of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     and the majority of the Catholic people 
     <lb/>
     kept them in the fats of office. Sir, I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry to see that a question which is put on 
     <lb/>
     this high ground of national feeling and 
     <lb/>
     fidelity to religious principle must after 
     <lb/>
     all be brought to that very low placed feel<lb break="no"/>ing of a thirst for office. These gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     having found that their fiscal policy was of 
     <lb/>
     no influence with the people, that the coun<lb break="no"/>try had no confidence in them, thought that 
     <lb/>
     there was in this country a sufficient num<lb break="no"/>ber of people who would still believe in 
     <lb/>
     the old tales about the Gunpowder Plot, the 
     <lb/>
     Guy Fawkes conspiracy, and other matters 
     <lb/>
     that were taught 150 years ago, but which 
     <lb/>
     the poorest schoolmaster in England would 
     <lb/>
     be ashamed of mentioning, except possibly 
     <lb/>
     as the remnant of a legend which existed 
     <lb/>
     in the times of credulity in that country. 
     <lb/>
     That may appear to be exaggerated. But 
     <lb/>
     not later than a few days ago I read in a 
     <lb/>
     newspaper that proposes to enlighten the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada, a statement to the effect 
     <lb/>
     that the same conspiracy, the same dark 
     <lb/>
     and sinister organization and the same pow<lb break="no"/>erful people who are now trying to shackle 
     <lb/>
     the people of the west, that same power 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Quebec, headed by the 
     <lb/>
     hierarchy that was trying to prevent the 
     <lb/>
     free people of the west from enjoying their 
     <lb/>
     liberty, could be related to the same man, 
     <lb/>
     to the same power and the same influences 
     <lb/>
     that brought about the Gunpowder conspir<lb break="no"/>acy ! I have seen that statement printed 
     <lb/>
     in the columns of either the ' News' or the 
     <lb/>
     'World,' because these two papers consti<lb break="no"/>tute a pair, and I cannot say which is the 
     <lb/>
     silliest. But, Sir, even when I read such 
     <lb/>
     things, printed in the twentieth century, 
     <lb/>
     in leading newspapers, published in a city 
     <lb/>
     like Toronto, and in a province like Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     I refuse to believe that you would find a 
     <lb/>
     majority of the people of Ontario who would 
     <lb/>
     believe such silly talk. I cannot believe it, 
     <lb/>
     and I must say that the member for South 
     <lb/>
     York (Mr. W. F. Maclean), in the allusions 
     <lb/>
     he has made to-day, just as in the cartoons 
     <lb/>
     which are published every day in his news<lb break="no"/>paper, is simply putting on his province the 
     <lb/>
     greatest slur that could be cast on it by 
     <lb/>
     any man. Sir, if I would stand up in this 
     <lb/>
     House and say that the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     is filled with a population of ignorant peo<lb break="no"/>ple, with a drown-trodden people under the 
     <lb/>
     control of the Methodist ministers, by 
     <lb/>
     which you could organize any kind of con<lb break="no"/>spiracy to deprive the Catholic church of 
     <lb/>
     their power, to unthrone the Pope and 
     <lb/>
     prevent the priests of the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec from saying mass, I would not be say<lb break="no"/>ing more silly things than you read every<lb/>day in three or four columns of the 'World'<lb/>

     <lb break="maybe"/>
     siou that Ontario is one of the most ignor<lb break="no"/>ant places on earth. I refuse to believe 
     <lb/>
     that. I refuse to believe that a majority 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Ontario can be carried by 
     <lb/>
     such an appeal. If any constituency in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario should be opened, I would be pre<lb break="no"/>pared to enter it, and unless the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean), 
     <lb/>
     and the hon. member for Haliburton (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sam. Hughes), with his man Turpin and 
     <lb/>
     the seventeen men who took General de 
     <lb/>
     Villiers and let him skip off the next morn- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ing—unless these two gentlemen would 
     <lb/>
     come together and throw stones at me, I do 
     <lb/>
     not think I would be prevented from speak<lb break="no"/>ing in Ontario, standing for the rights of 
     <lb/>
     my people, for the rights of justice in this 
     <lb/>
     country; standing for the good reputation 
     <lb/>
     of our country, and saying that it is just 
     <lb/>
     as legitimate for the Catholics to have here 
     <lb/>
     a representative of the highest spiritual au<lb break="no"/>thority on earth, as it is legitimate for the 
     <lb/>
     government of any civilized country to have 
     <lb/>
     a representative of the Pope, to have an 
     <lb/>
     ablegate to look after what ? Not to look 
     <lb/>
     after political questions, but to look after 
     <lb/>
     the interests of the church. And what are 
     <lb/>
     the interests of the church in any country ? 
     <lb/>
     The interests of the church include every<lb break="no"/>thing which looks to the development of 
     <lb/>
     the religion to which that church belongs 
     <lb/>
     and all such things must be looked after by 
     <lb/>
     that Papal ablegate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know nothing of what may have oc<lb break="no"/>curred between Monseigneur Sbarretti and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers, and I think it is most absurd 
     <lb/>
     to come into this House and ask any mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the federal House to give an account 
     <lb/>
     of what may have occurred between the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate and a member of the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba cabinet. If the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>
     York was so excited over the liberties of 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada, he should have had 
     <lb/>
     some friend in the Manitoba house to raise 
     <lb/>
     the question and put Mr. Rogers on trial 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba, before the people of that 
     <lb/>
     province, to whom he is responsible. If, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, it is such a nasty thing for the Catho- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     lies to have called for an ablegate to come 
     <lb/>
     into this country to look after their own 
     <lb/>
     affairs, after their own interests as Catho<lb break="no"/>lics, how is it that the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     South York (Mr. IV. F. Maclean) has noth<lb break="no"/>ing to say against Mr. Rogers. a Protestant   
     <lb/>statesman, who comes here and entertains 
     <lb/>relations with Monseigneur Sbarretti? If 
     <lb/>it was a sin, and a sin for which any man 
     <lb/>in this House should be arraigned before 
     <lb/>the people of Canada, it it was a sin for 
     <lb/>Sir Wilfrid Laurier, for Mr. Brodeur, for 
     <lb/>Mr. Lemieux, for Mr. Bourassa, or any 
     <lb/>other hon. gentleman in this House to ask 
     <lb/>the Pope to send a representative to look 
     <lb/>after their own affairs, then what a crime 
     <lb/>has been committed by a member of the 
     <lb/>Manitoba government and of the legislative 
     <lb/>assembly of Manitoba, by a Protestant 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     statesman, in having an interview with 
     <lb/>
     Monseigneur Sbarretti ? I do not suppose 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Rogers was troubled in his con<lb break="no"/>science and wanted to get absolution for 
     <lb/>
     his sins. So I presume that he visited His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency, acting in his official and poli<lb break="no"/>tical capacity. Therefore, if anybody must 
     <lb/>
     be denounced before the Protestantism of 
     <lb/>
     this country, if anybody must be denounced 
     <lb/>
     before the crowds of the county of South 
     <lb/>
     York, and must be burned or brought to 
     <lb/>
     the scaffold, it is Mr. Rogers, member of 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba government. But, Sir, no, I 
     <lb/>
     would never think of making that kind of 
     <lb/>
     appeal; I acknowledge Mr. Rogers' right to 
     <lb/>
     go and meet Monseigneur Sbarretti and 
     <lb/>
     have a conversation with him. If the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) 
     <lb/>
     and the member for Victoria and Haliburton 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sam Hughes), would go and see Mon<lb break="no"/>seigneur Sbarretti and talk with him, I 
     <lb/>
     think it would do them a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     good—if any improvement is possible for 
     <lb/>
     those gentlemen—I am sure it would do 
     <lb/>
     them good. As for the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey (Mr. Sproule), I do not think 
     <lb/>
     any improvement is possible with him, be<lb break="no"/>cause I think he is desperately sincere. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>But, coming back to our action in having 
     <lb/>a Papal ablegate to be appointed, we did 
     <lb/>it because we thought it was our duty to do 
     <lb/>it. Monseigneur Sbarretti has succeeded 
     <lb/>Monseigneur Falconio in the same capacity 
     <lb/>that Monseigneur Martinelli exercised at 
     <lb/>Washington where he has been succeeded by 
     <lb/>Monseigneur Falconio transferred from Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa. These prelates have been here re<lb break="no"/>presenting the church, to look after the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the Roman Catholics of Canada. 
     <lb/>As I have said, I know nothing of what 
     <lb/>passed between Mr. Rogers and Monseigneur 
     <lb/>Sbarretti, and I would advise the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for South York to call on them if he 
     <lb/>wants to know what transpired between 
     <lb/>them. But suppose that Monseigneur Sbar- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>retti (lid discuss with Mr. Rogers the rights 
     <lb/>of the Catholics of Manitoba, suppose he 
     <lb/>did ask Mr. Rogers to do something for the 
     <lb/>Catholics of Manitoba, where in the name 
     <lb/>of justice and common sense is there any<lb break="no"/>thing wrong in that? Here is a dignitary 
     <lb/>of the Roman Catholic Church, sent here to 
     <lb/>look after the interests of the people belong<lb break="no"/>ing to his church, and what harm is there 
     <lb/>in his meeting another gentleman and ask<lb break="no"/>ing him if something could not be done for 
     <lb/>the interests of his people? Now, we have 
     <lb/>in this city a consul from the United States, 
     <lb/>he is here to look after the interests of the 
     <lb/>American people living in this country and 
     <lb/>the interests of American citizens who may 
     <lb/>be trading in this country; suppose he finds 
     <lb/>something in our tariff which he thinks is 
     <lb/>prejudicial to their interests, would it be a 
     <lb/>great sin for that gentleman to meet the 
     <lb/>Minister of Trade and Commerce and ask 
     <lb/>if some change could not be made? Sir, 
     <lb/>it is about time that we should look at these 
     <lb/>questions from a common sense point of

     <lb/>
    'Monseigneur Sbarretti, in discussing with 
     <lb/>Mr. Rogers the interests of the Catholics 
     <lb/>of Manitoba, was not only acting within 
     <lb/>his rights, but was fulfilling his duty. As 
     <lb/>I said, I have not the slightest knowledge of 
     <lb/>what took place between them; but the idea 
     <lb/>of hon. gentlemen getting up in this House 
     <lb/>and talking about a conspiracy of the hier<lb break="no"/>archy, about the dark and sinister designs 
     <lb/>of the church, because a member of the 
     <lb/>local legislature of Manitoba has thought fit 
     <lb/>to hold an interview with the representative 
     <lb/>of the highest spiritual power in our church, 
     <lb/>I say that it is entirely unworthy of the 
     <lb/>dignity of a member of this House and the 
     <lb/>representative of a free people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. PETER WHITE (North Renfrew). 
     <lb/>
     I am sure that if the object of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) was to 
     <lb/>
     raise this discussion out of the rut into 
     <lb/>
     which he says it has fallen, the region of 
     <lb/>
     race and religion he has signally failed 
     <lb/>
     in doing so ; because during all the 
     <lb/>
     long years in which I have sat in par<lb break="no"/>liament I do not think I ever listened to a 
     <lb/>
     more inflammatory speech than that to 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. member for Labelle has just 
     <lb/>
     treated this House. For my own part, speak<lb break="no"/>ing as a Protestant and as a representative 
     <lb/>
     of an Ontario constituency, I have to say, 
     <lb/>
     and I think the House will agree with me, 
     <lb/>
     that I have not the slightest objection to the 
     <lb/>
     bringing of a Papal delegate here to super<lb break="no"/>intend the religious affairs of the Church of 
     <lb/>
     Rome. For my own part I have a great 
     <lb/>
     admiration for the moral teaching of the 
     <lb/>
     Church of Rome, although I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     in its tenets. But I do say as a citizen of 
     <lb/>
     this country that when the allegation is 
     <lb/>
     made that the Papal delegate, who comes 
     <lb/>
     here properly enough to fulfil the purpose 
     <lb/>
     for which he was brought—though the man<lb break="no"/>ner in which he was brought might not be 
     <lb/>
     acceptable to many of us who sit on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the House—though he came here 
     <lb/>
     properly enough to supervise the affairs of 
     <lb/>
     the church of which he is a distinguished 
     <lb/>
     dignitary; but I say that when it is alleged 
     <lb/>
     by the newspapers and by a leading mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the government of Manitoba, that 
     <lb/>
     that gentleman has interfered in a matter 
     <lb/>
     that does not belong to the domain of the 
     <lb/>
     Church of Rome at all, then I say that the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country, and at all events 
     <lb/>
     those of us who sit on this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House, have a right to complain. Now. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, what are the facts in relation to this 
     <lb/>
     matter? I am not here to relate the facts, 
     <lb/>
     because I do not know them. I accept to 
     <lb/>
     the fullest extent the statement made by 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. leader of the government that 
     <lb/>
     he had no knowledge of these negotiations 
     <lb/>
     going on between the Papal delegate and the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the province of Manitoba; 
     <lb/>
     but I say that if these negotiations did go 
     <lb/>
     on according to the allegation that has 
     <lb/>
     been made, then Monseigneur Sbarretti 
     <lb/>
     ought not to remain in this country a single 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. BOURASSA. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     hour longer than those gentlemen who secur<lb break="no"/>ed his presence here can manage to effect 
     <lb/>
     his recall by communicating with his su<lb break="no"/>perior in Rome. I think it is their duty, it 
     <lb/>
     is the duty of those forty members of this 
     <lb/>
     parliament who secured his presence here. 
     <lb/>
     and especially is it the duty of the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the government, at the earliest possible 
     <lb/>
     moment, at once to communicate with the 
     <lb/>
     head of the church in Rome and secure the 
     <lb/>
     recall of that gentleman—if, I say, it be 
     <lb/>
     proven that these allegations made with re<lb break="no"/>gard to him are true. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, I want to say one word with 
     <lb/>
     reference to a statement made by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Labelle respecting the hon. lead<lb break="no"/>er of the opposition. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle said that the hon. leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position had no opinions of his own, that 
     <lb/>
     his opinions were simply moulded by those 
     <lb/>
     who were following him in this House. I 
     <lb/>
     think, Sir, it ill becomes any supporter of 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. leader of this government to 
     <lb/>
     make a statement of that kind with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the leader of the opposition, when we 
     <lb/>
     know as a matter of fact, from the mouth of 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     government himself, that his policy with re<lb break="no"/>gard to those important Bills which are now 
     <lb/>
     under discussion, was changed and modi<lb break="no"/>fied to a material degree by the pressure of 
     <lb/>
     his followers in this House. Sir, I am sorry 
     <lb/>
     that I have been obliged to rise upon a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of this kind. But I thought it my duty 
     <lb/>
     to do so, and I consider I hold moderate 
     <lb/>
     views both political and religious. I have 
     <lb/>
     no objection to any man's political or religi<lb break="no"/>ous views. but I do think that it is an unfor<lb break="no"/>tunate thing that an hon. gentleman like 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Labelle should take 
     <lb/>
     the course which he has taken here today 
     <lb/>
     and that he should accuse hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on this side of the House of endeavouring 
     <lb/>
     to inflame the public mind in this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. WHITE. I hear some hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the other side of the House laugh. 
     <lb/>
     What was the object which my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from South York (Mr. Maclean) had in mak<lb break="no"/>ing the proposition that he made to hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite ? He had a right to 
     <lb/>
     call in question the conditions that exist 
     <lb/>
     upon the other side of the House. He had 
     <lb/>
     a right to express his opinion that the fail<lb break="no"/>ure of the right hon. the leader of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in filling the vacancy in the port<lb break="no"/>folio of the Interior and in filling the posi<lb break="no"/>tion which has practically been vacant in 
     <lb/>
     the Public Works Department and he had 
     <lb/>
     the right to assume that the failure of the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. the leader of the government to 
     <lb/>
     fill these positions was because he feared 
     <lb/>
     public opinion in the country. It was. I 
     <lb/>
     assume, because he took the ground that 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. the leader of the government 
     <lb/>
     fears to open any constituency in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario, or in any of the English 
     <lb/>
     speaking provinces at the present time,

     that my hon. friend made the challenge that 
     <lb/>
     he did make to hon. members on the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the House. As I stated a moment 
     <lb/>
     ago, I am loth to discuss a question of this 
     <lb/>
     kind. 1 have no desire whatever to discuss 
     <lb/>
     a question which raises distinctions of creed 
     <lb/>
     or nationality. I think we ought to be as 
     <lb/>
     one people throughout this country and I 
     <lb/>
     may say this for the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     to which I belong that whatever may be the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of our hon. friends from the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec they will find as much lib<lb break="no"/>erality and toleration in Ontario as can be

            <p>
     Mr. T. S. SPROULE (East Grey). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I did not intend to say anything 
     <lb/>
     on this subject just now, but for the 
     <lb/>
     frequent references to myself by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). 
     <lb/>
     They were very pointed. Whether he 
     <lb/>
     considered them offensive or not, to 
     <lb/>
     my judgment, they were offensive and 
     <lb/>
     they were uncalled for and nothing on 
     <lb/>
     my part, as far as my judgment en<lb break="no"/>ables me to determine, would justify the 
     <lb/>
     references which the hon. gentleman made 
     <lb/>
     to me. He started out by asking a very 
     <lb/>
     significent question : Are we like the serfs 
     <lb/>
     of Russia that we have not freedom of 
     <lb/>
     speech in this House ? Are we ? The ex<lb break="no"/>hibition we had for the following twenty 
     <lb/>
     minutes is the best answer I can give to 
     <lb/>
     that question, because, if there ever was 
     <lb/>
     in any civilized country in the world, a de<lb break="no"/>sire to restrict freedom of speech the tirades 
     <lb/>
     to which he has treated this House, ought 
     <lb/>
     to have induced this House not to have lis<lb break="no"/>tened to him. Now, the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     went on to say that my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
     <lb/>
     and his party are opposing the Pope. What 
     <lb/>
     justification had he for that statement ? 
     <lb/>
     What word was ever said from this side 
     <lb/>
     of the House that would justify that state<lb break="no"/>ment ? 'Not a single word that I have heard 
     <lb/>
     and none that I am aware of. But, he says 
     <lb/>
     that we are opposing his church. Was 
     <lb/>
     there anything said in the shape of abuse 
     <lb/>
     of his church ? There is no desire or in<lb break="no"/>tention to abuse his church, but our desire 
     <lb/>
     is to give that church its rights the same 
     <lb/>
     as every other church in the country and 
     <lb/>
     to respect its rights as much as we respect 
     <lb/>
     the rights of every other church. Then, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman said : Has not every 
     <lb/>
     civilized government in the world its Papal 
     <lb/>
     representative, its ambassador ? He asks 
     <lb/>
     the question which I can answer by telling 
     <lb/>
     him that there is not one in France to-day. 
     <lb/>
     Diplomatic relations have been broken off. 
     <lb/>
     Then, why should the hon. member for La- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     bell stand up and say that we are worse 
     <lb/>
     than France, that we are worse than Eng<lb break="no"/>land and that we are worse than other 
     <lb/>
     countries ? I could point to many coun<lb break="no"/>tries, even Italy itself, in which diplomatic 
     <lb/>
     relations do not exist between the Pope and 
     <lb/>
     the government. Do they exist in the 
     <lb/>
     United States ? Not at all. There is, it 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     is true, a Papal representative, but to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the church, not to negotiate with the 
     <lb/>
     state, and he has no relationship with the 
     <lb/>
     government of the United States and does 
     <lb/>
     not pretend to exercise any authority over, 
     <lb/>
     or to assume the right to dictate or to ne<lb break="no"/>gotiate with the government in regard to 
     <lb/>
     matters of state. So that, in no civilized 
     <lb/>
     country that he has mentioned is there a 
     <lb/>
     condition known to exist which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman claims is all right in this coun<lb break="no"/>try. There are a few questions which I 
     <lb/>
     think you might reasonably ask. We know 
     <lb/>
     that there is a Papal delegate here. That 
     <lb/>
     is a self evident fact, but we might ask 
     <lb/>
     the question : Who brought him here ? 
     <lb/>
     Some one has stated that it was the pre<lb break="no"/>sent government. Well, I think that was 
     <lb/>
     too wide ; I would say that the Reform 
     <lb/>
     party brought him here. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the government (Sir Wilfrid Lau<lb break="no"/>rier) does not deny that he was one of the 
     <lb/>
     forty who sent an application to the Pope 
     <lb/>
     to send a delegate here. We are not object<lb break="no"/>ing to it and do not object to it if he con<lb break="no"/>fines his duties to the work that the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman told us was the work for 
     <lb/>
     which he was brought here. What was he 
     <lb/>
     brought here for ? What did he come for ? 
     <lb/>
     The right hon. gentleman has told us what 
     <lb/>
     he came for. There was a difference be<lb break="no"/>tween us and the bishops of our church and 
     <lb/>
     it was to settle disputes between the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic people and their clergy. If he 
     <lb/>
     confines his operations to that I say we 
     <lb/>
     have no reasonable ground for complaint. 
     <lb/>
     He has a right to be here and remain in this 
     <lb/>
     country just as long as he likes and so far 
     <lb/>
     as he can succeed in readjusting the differ<lb break="no"/>ences between the Roman Catholic people 
     <lb/>
     and their bishops it is nothing that concerns 
     <lb/>
     us and we do not desire to interfere with 
     <lb/>
     him in any way. Has he confined his oper<lb break="no"/>ations to that line ? This is the first time 
     <lb/>
     in the history of Canada that we have had 
     <lb/>
     such an ablegate. Commencing with Mon<lb break="no"/>seigneur Mery Del Val, the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle stated that we have had several 
     <lb/>
     of them before. I believe there was one 
     <lb/>
     away back in the eighties but it was 
     <lb/>
     scarcely found out he was in the country 
     <lb/>
     until he was out of the country. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Labelle does not wait to hear 
     <lb/>
     any criticism that may be made of his re<lb break="no"/>marks or to answer any questions that may 
     <lb/>
     be asked of him. We know that he is a re<lb break="no"/>markably valiant man and that he displays 
     <lb/>
     a great deal of that peculiar grace which is 
     <lb/>
     indicative of courage. But he seems al<lb break="no"/>ways to exemplify the old saying that : 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>He who fights and runs away 
     <lb/>May live to fight another day, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     for every time he finishes speaking he gets 
     <lb/>
     up and clears from the House. He has 
     <lb/>
     not the moral courage to sit there and listen 
     <lb/>
     to the replies to his tirades or answer the 
     <lb/>
     questions that may be asked him. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     he ought to be the last one to talk about 
     <lb/>
     a lack of courage. But, what are the 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     duties of this Papal delegate ? We were 
     <lb/>
     told that his duties were to settle differ<lb break="no"/>ences between the Roman Catholic people 
     <lb/>
     and the church and as long as he confines 
     <lb/>
     himself to those duties we have no com<lb break="no"/>plaint to make. It is a fact well known in 
     <lb/>
     this country that in 1896 there was a differ<lb break="no"/>ence between the present Reform party, or 
     <lb/>
     at least one portion of that party, the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic element of the party, and 
     <lb/>
     the bishops in regard to the school question 
     <lb/>
     and it was said that the Papal delegate was 
     <lb/>
     brought here for the purpose of settling that 
     <lb/>
     difficulty. So long as he attempted to set<lb break="no"/>tle that difficulty you heard no complaint 
     <lb/>
     from any Protestant in this country as to 
     <lb/>
     what he was doing and no complaint that 
     <lb/>
     he was here. But, is he confining himself 
     <lb/>
     to the interests of the church ? The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Labelle says that he has a per<lb break="no"/>fect right in the interests of his church and 
     <lb/>
     of his co-religionists to take part in anything 
     <lb/>
     which is going on and in which that church 
     <lb/>
     is directly interested. In my judgment he 
     <lb/>
     has no right to go the distance that it is 
     <lb/>
     alleged he has gone. Now, it is said some<lb break="no"/>times. and I think correctly said, that eter<lb break="no"/>nal vigilance is the price of liberty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The history of the ages has taught that 
     <lb/>
     lesson over and over again, and the maxim is 
     <lb/>
     as true today as when it was first an<lb break="no"/>nounced. The complete separation of church 
     <lb/>
     and state is another principle recognized in 
     <lb/>
     the history of the English parliament long 
     <lb/>
     ago. That principle was adopted in consti<lb break="no"/>tutional government, and we are trying to 
     <lb/>
     live up to it and we desire to carry it out to 
     <lb/>
     the fullest extent. When we took the clergy 
     <lb/>
     reserve lands from the church and 
     <lb/>
     distributed them for' the benefit of the 
     <lb/>
     state we asserted that principle because 
     <lb/>
     we desired there should be no sem<lb break="no"/>blance of connection between church 
     <lb/>
     and state. We declared that every church 
     <lb/>
     should stand on its own footing and we have 
     <lb/>
     lived up to that according to the best of our 
     <lb/>
     judgment. But as I said, eternal vigilance 
     <lb/>
     is the price of liberty, and when we see any 
     <lb/>
     encroachment on that principle we are bound 
     <lb/>
     to draw attention to it in the interests of 
     <lb/>
     our constitutional rights and in the interest 
     <lb/>
     of our constituents. That is what we are 
     <lb/>
     doing to-day. Since the settlement of the 
     <lb/>
     clergy reserve lands we have not had that 
     <lb/>
     question up until today, when it comes for<lb break="no"/>ward again in a different way in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the presence of the Papal ablegate 
     <lb/>
     here. We fought against the contention of 
     <lb/>
     the church in 1898, because we believed it 
     <lb/>
     was the church that was making the fight 
     <lb/>
     against the rights of the people of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     The Prime Minister and his friends joined 
     <lb/>
     with us in that fight, and I stood up here 
     <lb/>
     day atter day and night after night to de<lb break="no"/>fend the rights of the people against im<lb break="no"/>proper interference. I am glad to know I 
     <lb/>
     had the assistance and support of Sir Wil- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     frid Laurier and his friends in that fight, 
     <lb/>
     With his sunny ways and his diplomatic 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. SPROULE.

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     ability he succeeded in arranging that trouble 
     <lb/>
     and bringing about conciliation and har<lb break="no"/>mony where they did not exist before. But 
     <lb/>
     it was out of that incident that grew the 
     <lb/>
     troubles which induced him to bring this 
     <lb/>
     Papal delegate here. Is there not to-day in<lb break="no"/>terference by the church with the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the state ? Can we believe what ap<lb break="no"/>pears in the newspapers of this city from day 
     <lb/>
     to. day, that every time there has been a 
     <lb/>
     crisis in connection with this Bill the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister has visited that Papal delegate and 
     <lb/>
     every change that has been made has been 
     <lb/>
     made with his knowledge and on his ad<lb break="no"/>vice. We are told that the Bill was sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to him and that the Bill was satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory. to him or otherwise it would not have 
     <lb/>
     been introduced into this House. Then 
     <lb/>
     there is the strange coincidence that on the 
     <lb/>
     13th of February, the Manitoba delegates 
     <lb/>
     were invited down here to consider the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of extending the boundaries of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba ; on the 16th they reached here ; on 
     <lb/>
     the 17th they had a conference with the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister who asked them to remain 
     <lb/>
     four or five days when they would get an 
     <lb/>
     intimation as to the position of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. They remained in obedience to that 
     <lb/>
     request and though he said he denied cer<lb break="no"/>tain statements categorically and in toto he 
     <lb/>
     did not as a matter of fact deny some of 
     <lb/>
     them categorically. He does not deny that 
     <lb/>
     he asked Mr. Rogers to remain here. And 
     <lb/>
     what happened. On the 17th of February 
     <lb/>
     they had a conference, on the 20th they were 
     <lb/>
     invited by the Papal delegate to visit him, 
     <lb/>
     and on the 21st the Bill was introduced. I 
     <lb/>
     noticed the Minister of Agriculture coach<lb break="no"/>ing the member for Labelle to draw atten- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ton to the fact that Mr. Robert Rogers and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Colin Campbell were with the Papal 
     <lb/>
     delegate trying to negotiate with him. But, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, they were there in answer to a respect<lb break="no"/>ful invitation to visit him. Did they not 
     <lb/>
     show respect for the high position he occu<lb break="no"/>pied ? Did they not show the ordinary cour<lb break="no"/>tesy which one man would show to another 
     <lb/>
     when they accepted that invitation and went 
     <lb/>
     there not knowing the purpose for which 
     <lb/>
     they were invited. He told them that if 
     <lb/>
     they would amend their law and give sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools to Manitoba, they could have 
     <lb/>
     the boundary question settled at once, but 
     <lb/>
     they would not agree to that and the Bill 
     <lb/>
     was introduced the very next day. The 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister said nothing about the ex<lb break="no"/>tension of the boundaries of Manitoba when 
     <lb/>
     he introduced the Bill, except to say that it 
     <lb/>
     could not be done. and he did not deign the 
     <lb/>
     courtesy of a reply to the Manitoba dele<lb break="no"/>gates. The Prime Minister has told us that 
     <lb/>
     he did not remember receiving a letter from 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba delegates written on the 23rd 
     <lb/>
     of February asking for a reply, and it turns 
     <lb/>
     out that that letter was sent to the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister's house. I will not say that his 
     <lb/>
     letter reached the hands of the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter because it may never have reached his 
     <lb/>hands, but at all events it verifies the state<lb break="no"/>

     ment made by Mr. Robert Rogers, that 
     <lb/>
     from that day to this they have never re<lb break="no"/>ceived the reply they believed they were en<lb break="no"/>titled to. Was that the way to treat the 
     <lb/>
     accredited representatives of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     government ? Is that complimentary to the 
     <lb/>
     dignity of the Prime Minister of this federal 
     <lb/>
     parliament of his ministers. It is not. I 
     <lb/>
     assume that the statements made in the 
     <lb/>
     newspaper is correct because the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister, did not deny it, and the next step was 
     <lb/>
     that there was an invitation to the premier 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario to set up a claim for a portion of 
     <lb/>
     that territory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I deny it now. 
     <lb/>
     1 never wrote to Mr. Whitney. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPROULE. I inferred from what ap<lb break="no"/>peared in the paper that by some means or 
     <lb/>
     other there was an intimation conveyed to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Whitney that it was desired that he 
     <lb/>
     should put up some claim. At all events 
     <lb/>
     the suggestion was made in the speech of 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister, and I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     he had friends enough to bring that to the 
     <lb/>
     attention of Mr. Whitney. At all events, On<lb break="no"/>tario set up a claim and this government 
     <lb/>
     took advantage of that to say : We cannot 
     <lb/>
     settle the boundary of Manitoba because 
     <lb/>
     Ontario has set up a claim to that territory. 
     <lb/>
     Why did the First Minister say that a set<lb break="no"/>tlement could only be reached after a con<lb break="no"/>ference between Quebec, Ontario and Man<lb break="no"/>itoba ? What interest had Quebec in it ; 
     <lb/>
     it did not touch the boundaries of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince in any way. However, the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister since arbandoned that contention. 
     <lb/>
     We do find however, that according to the 
     <lb/>
     statement of Mr. Robert Rogers, the boun<lb break="no"/>daries of Manitoba are not extended because 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba will not grant separate schools ; 
     <lb/>
     and we find that the provisions of the Bill 
     <lb/>
     which were submitted to that ablegate—if 
     <lb/>
     we can believe what appears in the press, 
     <lb/>
     fasten separate schools on these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces for all time to come. That Bill was 
     <lb/>
     only accepted by the members from the west 
     <lb/>
     when some amendments were proposed, 
     <lb/>
     which amendments were submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Papal delegate and approved of by him be<lb break="no"/>fore they were submitted to parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then I ask is this Papal ablegate going 
     <lb/>
     beyond his duty ? Is he interfering with 
     <lb/>
     the rights of the state ? In my judgment 
     <lb/>
     he is. So long as he confines himself to the 
     <lb/>
     rights of his church, we have not a word to 
     <lb/>
     say against him ; but we respectfully deny 
     <lb/>
     the right of any dignitary representing that 
     <lb/>
     church, for which we have the greatest 
     <lb/>
     respect, or representing any other church, 
     <lb/>
     to come here and interfere with the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the state. In the name of this country 
     <lb/>
     we protest against it ; in the name of con<lb break="no"/>stitutional government, which we represent, 
     <lb/>
     we protest against it. Who has been re<lb break="no"/>sponsible for this unprecedented act ? The 
     <lb/>
     present government and their friends of 
     <lb/>
     the Reform party. They brought him here, 
     <lb/>
     and they have not put a single check upon 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     him, so far as we know. I need not go 
     <lb/>
     into the history of his being here ; but I 
     <lb/>
     want to ask one very important question. 
     <lb/>
     When all these negotiations were going on 
     <lb/>
     with regard to this Bill and when the knowl<lb break="no"/>edge that the Papal ablegate was taking a 
     <lb/>
     particular interest in it was so apparent, 
     <lb/>
     where were the Protestant members of the 
     <lb/>
     cabinet ? Where was the Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms (Mr. Paterson) who took such an in<lb break="no"/>terest in the subject the other night? Where 
     <lb/>
     was the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding), 
     <lb/>
     who made such a pitiable excuse for the Bill, 
     <lb/>
     and declared that government could not be 
     <lb/>
     carried on in this country if it were de<lb break="no"/>feated, because there would have to be a 
     <lb/>
     Protestant government formed ? Where 
     <lb/>
     was the lynx-eyed Postmaster General (Sir 
     <lb/>
     William Mulock). the only Protestant re<lb break="no"/>presentative on that subcommittee to which 
     <lb/>
     the Bill was submitted? Where is there 
     <lb/>
     any evidence that he lodged any protest 
     <lb/>
     against the improper interference of the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate ? Where was the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Trade and Commerce (Sir Richard Cart<lb break="no"/>wright)? And, lastly, where was the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton), who 
     <lb/>
     fought so vigorously before against inter<lb break="no"/>ference with the rights of Manitoba ? It 
     <lb/>
     is true, he lodged his protest against the 
     <lb/>
     government and went out as a rebuke to 
     <lb/>
     them for their improper conduct ; but to 
     <lb/>
     day he is silenced, he is chloroformed. And 
     <lb/>
     the other ministers seem to be chloroformed, 
     <lb/>
     for we have not a word from them. 
     <lb/>
     Who among them represents the great Pro<lb break="no"/>testant element of this country ? You can 
     <lb/>
     speak freely on behalf of the other side; 
     <lb/>
     but if you raise your voice as a Protestant, 
     <lb/>
     it would seem as if you were almost a fugi<lb break="no"/>tive from justice. That is the kind of tol<lb break="no"/>eration that we are treated to in this 
     <lb/>
     House. It is toleration all on one side, 
     <lb/>
     with no evidence of any on the other side. 
     <lb/>
     Let us have a little more of it on that side. 
     <lb/>
     Let charity begin at home. Let our Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic friends show some charity and to]- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     erance towards those opposed to them, and 
     <lb/>
     then they will have very much less trouble 
     <lb/>
     in this country. I do not wish to continue 
     <lb/>
     this discussion longer, but I did wish to say, 
     <lb/>
     and I repeat it, that we are to-day as firmly 
     <lb/>
     opposed to church interference with the 
     <lb/>
     state as we ever were in this country. It 
     <lb/>
     must come to an end, and it must come to 
     <lb/>
     an end now. What is the logical sequence 
     <lb/>
     of all this ? It is admitted, and the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances justify the conclusion, that 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba's boundary is not extended be<lb break="no"/>cause of the interference of the Papal able- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     gate. There is no doubt about it whatever. 
     <lb/>
     Then, let the government say that as a pro<lb break="no"/>test against that interference they will 
     <lb/>
     extend the boundary of Manitoba, and here<lb break="no"/>by show that the state is the supreme 
     <lb/>
     arbiter in this country, and the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba will get its rights. Until that is 
     <lb/>
     done, there will be a lingering suspicion in 
     <lb/>
     the minds of the Canadian people that the 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Papal ablegate did interfere, not only with 
     <lb/>
     that question, but with the other important 
     <lb/>
     question that is engaging the attention of 
     <lb/>
     parliament at the present time, the question 
     <lb/>
     of granting autonomy to the new provinces in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest, and the educational clauses

     in connection therewith. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SAM. HUGHES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
     <lb/>
     on a personal matter. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) was this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon called to order on a certain point. 
     <lb/>
     After some hesitation, he obeyed the ruling 
     <lb/>
     of the chair and proceeded with the discus<lb break="no"/>sion, when the hon. gentlemen behind the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister, who are a little too prone to 
     <lb/>
     make unseemly interruptions, not only to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for South York but to 
     <lb/>
     other members of this House interrupted 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman. He paused, when I 
     <lb/>
     said to him : 'Don't let them bluff you,' 
     <lb/>
     I take the responsibility of the words I 
     <lb/>
     used, and I was justified in saying what I 
     <lb/>
     did. My remark had no reference to the 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, and I protest against being called 
     <lb/>
     to order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. The words as I distinctly 
     <lb/>
     heard them were : 'Don't let him bluff you.' 
     <lb/>
     If the hon. member now says that his refer<lb break="no"/>ence was not to the Speaker, I accept his 
     <lb/>
     statement ; but at the time it was perfectly 
     <lb/>
     clear to me that the reference was to my<lb break="no"/>self. I desire also to say that interruptions 
     <lb/>
     are becoming a little too frequent, not only 
     <lb/>
     from the side referred to by the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, but also from the hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     own side, and from himself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SAM. HUGHES. The only interrup<lb break="no"/>tion I made to-day was perfectly legitimate 
     <lb/>
     and within my right, and therefore I must 
     <lb/>
     protest against being called to order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. I have accepted the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman's statement. The only point is 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. gentleman should have called 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the House to that at the 
     <lb/>
     moment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Motion agreed to. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>At six o'clock, House took recess. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     After Recess.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. H. R. EMMERSON (Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Railways and Canals). There will appear 
     <lb/>
     on the order paper t'o-morrow a Bill to amend 
     <lb/>
     the General Railway Act and enable the 
     <lb/>
     government to take running rights over 
     <lb/>
     the Canada Atlantic from Parry Sound to 
     <lb/>
     Coteau—in fact over the lines controlled

     as the Canada Atlantic system, and also over 
     <lb/>
    the Grand Trunk Railway from Coteau to its 
     <lb/>terminus at Montreal. The compensation 
     <lb/>is to be fixed by the Railway Commission 
     <lb/>and also the regulations for running the 
     <lb/>Intercolonial Railway trains. It is propos<lb break="no"/>ed that the rates between Montreal and 
     <lb/>Parry Sound will be subject to the control 
     <lb/>of that Commission, but that Commission 
     <lb/>will not control the rates over the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>colonial Railway from Montreal east. The 
     <lb/>right to use the terminals and also con<lb break="no"/>struct its own terminals at Parry Sound 
     <lb/>will be given to the Intercolonial Railway.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Might I ask the 
     <lb/>
     hon. minister if it is the intention to have 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railway compete 
     <lb/>
     the other railways and accept freight at 
     <lb/>
     Georgian hay ports ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. EMMERSON. The Intercolonial will 
     <lb/>
     have running rights and control its own 
     <lb/>
     trains, subject to the order and direction of 
     <lb/>
     the Railway Commission. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Is it the policy 
     <lb/>
     of the government to go into the trans<lb break="no"/>portation business by means of the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colonial Railway and accept freight at the 
     <lb/>
     Georgian bay terminal of the Canada At<lb break="no"/>lantic ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. EMMERSON. It will be the policy of 
     <lb/>
     the government to use this portion of the 
     <lb/>
     line together with the present system, tak<lb break="no"/>ing freight from the lakes to Canadian sea<lb break="no"/>board at Montreal, Quebec, Halifax, St. 
     <lb/>
     John and possibly Sydney. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. Is it the policy of 
     <lb/>
     or the government to take similar rights 
     <lb/>
     for the Canadian Northern over the Canada 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic portion of the Grand Trunk Rail<lb break="no"/>way ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. EMMERSON. This Bill has nothing 
     <lb/>
     to do with the Canadian Northern. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. R. L. BORDEN. What are the terms 
     <lb/>
     upon which the hon. gentleman proposes to 
     <lb/>
     acquire the running rights ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. EMMERSON. The compensation is to 
     <lb/>
     be fixed by the Railway Commission. The 
     <lb/>
     tariff from Parry Sound to Montreal will be 
     <lb/>
     subject to the Railway Commission, but it 
     <lb/>
     is not proposed to place the present system 
     <lb/>
     of the Intercolonial Railway under the con<lb break="no"/>trol of that commission. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. R. L. BORDEN. Is it the inten<lb break="no"/>tion to operate a through line from Parry 
     <lb/>
     Sound to Halifax or St. John, as the case 
     <lb/>
     may be ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. EMMERSON. Yes, to run Intercol- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     onial trains right through. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. R. L. BORDEN. If the Railway Act 
     <lb/>
     is to apply to the portion between Parry 
     <lb/>
     Sound and Montreal, how are through rates 
     <lb/>
     to be fixed from Parry Sound to Halifax 
     <lb/>
     and St. John ? 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Mr. SPROULE. I asked two questions, 
     <lb/>
     which I respectfully submit were fair: was 
     <lb/>
     the government prepared to share in the 
     <lb/>
     expense of the betterment of the road and 
     <lb/>
     would these come under the Railway Com<lb break="no"/>mission, and, if so, how could the Railway 
     <lb/>
     Act be made to apply to a railway to which 
     <lb/>
     it was not intended to apply. Were not 
     <lb/>
     these questions entitled to an answer, and 
     <lb/>
     how long would it take to answer them? 
     <lb/>
     I say I was not treated with courtesy.

     House resumed adjourned debate on the 
     <lb/>
     proposed motion of Sir Wilfried Laurier for 
     <lb/>
     the second reading of Bill (No. 69), to estab<lb break="no"/>lish and provide for the government of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Alberta, and the amendment 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. R. L. Borden thereto. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. URIAH WILSON (Lennox and Ad<lb break="no"/>dington). Mr. Speaker, the Bill now under 
     <lb/>
     discussion is one of the most important 
     <lb/>
     measures that have come before this House 
     <lb/>
     since I have had the honour of a seat in it, 
     <lb/>
     and I feel that it is my duty to have some<lb break="no"/>things to say upon it, representing as I do 
     <lb/>
     one of the old rural constituencies of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario. For many years no Bill 
     <lb/>
     has attracted so much public attention as 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, perhaps more especially because of 
     <lb/>
     the school clause contained in it. But be<lb break="no"/>fore I come to the school clause, I want to 
     <lb/>
     say a few words about the division of the 
     <lb/>
     Territory that has been made by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. In the first place, I think the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, before the last general election, 
     <lb/>
     fully intended to divide the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories and give them provincial autonomy, 
     <lb/>
     and it seems to me that it was their duty 
     <lb/>
     to have said something to the public on the 
     <lb/>
     subject, so that the public would have had 
     <lb/>
     some understanding of the measure, instead 
     <lb/>
     of having to go it blind, as they did on that 
     <lb/>
     occasion. I am quite sure that if the de<lb break="no"/>tails of the Bill had been known to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, there are a good many constituencies 
     <lb/>
     both in the province of Ontario and in the 
     <lb/>
     western country that would have been very 
     <lb/>
     differently represented in this House from 
     <lb/>
     what they are now. There was some cor<lb break="no"/>respondence, I believe, with Mr. Haultain, 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister of the Territories, but, 
     <lb/>
     so far as I have been able to learn, there 
     <lb/>
     was not one word in that correspondence 
     <lb/>
     with reference to the details of the Bill. 
     <lb/>
     although there was a promise that at this 
     <lb/>
     session of parliament a Bill would be in<lb break="no"/>troduced granting autonomy to the North<lb break="no"/>west provinces. I am not at all disposed 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     
     124 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     to agree with the government in the division 
     <lb/>
     they have made, creating two provinces 
     <lb/>
     out of the Northwest Territories and leav<lb break="no"/>ing Manitoba with its present area. I think 
     <lb/>
     that it is most unfair to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, which, if left as it is at present, 
     <lb/>
     will be crippled for all time to come. Mani<lb break="no"/>toba being the oldest province of that west<lb break="no"/>ern country ought to exercise its full pro<lb break="no"/>portion of influence in the Dominion, which 
     <lb/>
     it can never do if it is, as it were, simply a 
     <lb/>
     postage stamp on the map of Canada. I 
     <lb/>
     have heard accusations made against the 
     <lb/>
     government—and I do not like to say harsh 
     <lb/>
     things unless I am positive they are true; 
     <lb/>
     but a good deal has been said about the 
     <lb/>
     course pursued by Manitoba with regard to 
     <lb/>
     separate schools having something to do 
     <lb/>
     with her not being able to get her territory 
     <lb/>
     enlarged. There is no doubt that the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Manitoba should be enlarged and 
     <lb/>
     very greatly enlarged. If the government 
     <lb/>
     had considered Manitoba and the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories together, and had formed 
     <lb/>
     them into two provinces instead of three, 
     <lb/>
     it would have been a far better arrange<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Not only that, but they would not have 
     <lb/>
     been unduly large if we had made two 
     <lb/>
     provinces of what are now three, or will 
     <lb/>
     be after the 1st July, should these Bills 
     <lb/>
     carry. The two new provinces contain 
     <lb/>
     500,000 miles, and if we added to them the 
     <lb/>
     73,000 miles that Manitoba contains, that 
     <lb/>
     would simply make 573,000 miles altoge<lb break="no"/>ther. Divide that by two, and you would 
     <lb/>
     have two provinces, each with 286,500 miles, 
     <lb/>
     as compared with British Columbia, which 
     <lb/>
     has 372,620 miles, Quebec, which has 351,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     873, and Ontario, 260,862 miles. You can 
     <lb/>
     easily see, therefore, that if the government 
     <lb/>
     had taken into consideration the desirabil<lb break="no"/>ity of having only two provinces instead of 
     <lb/>
     three, neither of the two would have been 
     <lb/>
     unduly large. Then consider what an 
     <lb/>
     amount of money would have been saved 
     <lb/>
     by this means. In fact, the complaint in 
     <lb/>
     this country for a great many years has 
     <lb/>
     been that we have too much government 
     <lb/>
     and that our people are paying too much 
     <lb/>
     for government. I think it is pretty gener<lb break="no"/>ally conceded that it would be to the ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of the maritime provinces to have 
     <lb/>
     only one local government instead of three. 
     <lb/>
     It that were the case, they would be quite 
     <lb/>
     as strong, or even stronger in this House, 
     <lb/>
     than they are now, as three separate pro<lb break="no"/>vinces each with its own administration. 
     <lb/>
     When dealing with the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, the government should have had a 
     <lb/>
     view to the future and have taken warn<lb break="no"/>ing by the experience of the maritime pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Instead of having the small pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba and two other large pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, we could then have two fairly large 
     <lb/>
     provinces. But in consequence of the pol<lb break="no"/>icy of the government, the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba will always be inferior to the 
     <lb/>
     others.

            <p>
     I have no particular fault to find with 
     <lb/>
     the $50,000 given for the support of the 
     <lb/>
     government and legislature in each of the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces, or the 80 cents per head 
     <lb/>
     on the estimated population of 250,000. I 
     <lb/>
     think perhaps that these grants are fairly 
     <lb/>
     reasonable, and I do not suppose there is 
     <lb/>
     a man in this House who would want to 
     <lb/>
     deal by these provinces in any oher way 
     <lb/>
     than fairly and squarely and with the view 
     <lb/>
     of assisting them in every possible manner. 
     <lb/>
     But I am entirely opposed to the policy 
     <lb/>
     of the government with reference to the 
     <lb/>
     lands. The lands naturally belong to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. In agreeing to pay each of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces a certain amount for its lands, 
     <lb/>
     we really concede that they belong to them. 
     <lb/>
     The only plea I have heard why the lands 
     <lb/>
     are not given to the provinces is that that 
     <lb/>
     would interfere with our immigration pol<lb break="no"/>icy. With that view I entirely disagree. 
     <lb/>
     I have taken pains to find out what ar<lb break="no"/>rangements were made with the older pro<lb break="no"/>vinces with regard to immigration, and I 
     <lb/>
     find that there has been no difficulty ex<lb break="no"/>perienced in bringing immigrants to this 
     <lb/>
     country and locating them wherever the 
     <lb/>
     government thought best. Is it likely that 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces, which will be deeply 
     <lb/>
     interested in attracting settlers, would not 
     <lb/>
     be as much alive to the necessity of get<lb break="no"/>ting in population as possibly can be the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government ? It seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that the provinces could administer their 
     <lb/>
     own public lands better than we can and 
     <lb/>
     would be more interested in securing a good 
     <lb/>
     class of settlers. I have had occasion to 
     <lb/>
     speak several times with reference to the 
     <lb/>
     immigration into Canada, and the fault I 
     <lb/>
     have found is not that we are getting too 
     <lb/>
    many immigrants, but too many of an in<lb break="no"/>ferior class. Only the other day, the On<lb break="no"/>tario inspector of asylums said that in the 
     <lb/>Brockville Lunatic Asylum, out of the six 
     <lb/>hundred lunatics, sixty were immigrants, 
     <lb/>or ten per cent of the whole, which is en<lb break="no"/>tirely out of proportion to the number of 
     <lb/>immigrants located in that section of the 
     <lb/>country. It is not necessary for me to go 
     <lb/>into the details of the amounts that have 
     <lb/>been realized by the Dominion government 
     <lb/>from time to time on the sale of public 
     <lb/>lands, but I will content myself with saying 
     <lb/>that I am entirely opposed to the policy of 
     <lb/>the Dominion keeping these lands. I think 
     <lb/>it would be better to at once hand them 
     <lb/>over to the provinces and let the provinces 
     <lb/>administer them as they see fit. Let me 
     <lb/>give here the figures showing what we have 
     <lb/>received from the sale of lands, and 1 take 
     <lb/>those which were given by my hon. friend 
     <lb/>from Western Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) the 
     <lb/>other day. They will be found in his 
     <lb/>speech on page 3607 of 'Hansard.' From 
     <lb/>1870 to 1880, the administration of Crown 
     <lb/>lands in Manitoba and the Northwest cost 
     <lb/>$1,244,499.34 in excess of receipts. In the 
     <lb/>years 1881 to 1890 the accounts show $753,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>576.53 in excess of revenue. In the years 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Mr. U. WILSON. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     from 1891 to 1900 there was again an ex<lb break="no"/>cess of expenditure amounting to $184,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     398.95. In the years from 1901 to 1904, 
     <lb/>
     there was an excess of expenditure over re<lb break="no"/>ceipts of $11,733.49. Taking the whole per<lb break="no"/>iod from 1870 up to date, therefore, the 
     <lb/>
     administration of lands in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     has cost this Dominion $687,055.25 in excess 
     <lb/>
     of receipts, to which must be added re<lb break="no"/>funds amounting to $329,950, making a 
     <lb/>
     total of $1,017,005.25 of deficit. I fail to 
     <lb/>
     see how the government arrived at the 
     <lb/>
     amount they could give as a payment for 
     <lb/>
     these lands. They claim that there are 
     <lb/>
     twenty-five millions of acres of land to 
     <lb/>
     each province, which are worth $37,500,000, 
     <lb/>
     and on which of course they pay interest 
     <lb/>
     from time to time until it reaches a cer<lb break="no"/>tain amount. I do not see why the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment took it into their heads to keep 
     <lb/>
     these lands when it costs more to adminis<lb break="no"/>ter them than we are getting out of them. 
     <lb/>
     I hope that the government will reconsider 
     <lb/>
     this question, but I can quite understand 
     <lb/>
     why the hon. member for Edmonton (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Oliver) should have declared that he was 
     <lb/>
     perfectly willing to accept this arrangement 
     <lb/>
     provided the government kept the lands for 
     <lb/>
     the settlers. We can quite understand that 
     <lb/>
     position. The province gets the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     the lands inasmuch as it gets the people 
     <lb/>
     who settle on them, and it gets the money 
     <lb/>
     besides, while we are giving away our 
     <lb/>
     lands from time to time. but continuing for 
     <lb/>
     all time to pay that subsidy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another point. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     the First Minister based his whole argument 
     <lb/>
     for submitting this legislation to the House, 
     <lb/>
     especially clause 16 dealing with separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, on constitutional grounds. 1f I 
     <lb/>
     understood him rightly, he claimed that he 
     <lb/>
     had to do this because the constitution de<lb break="no"/>manded it. That is not the way, Sir, that I 
     <lb/>
     understand the constitution, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     think that is the way this House under<lb break="no"/>stands it. Not only that but I think he used 
     <lb/>
     synonymously the names 'province' and 
     <lb/>
     'territory.' He used the words 'province' 
     <lb/>
     and 'territory' as if they were synonyms. 
     <lb/>
     I can quite understand that if these had 
     <lb/>
     been provinces it might have been that we 
     <lb/>
     would have had to give these rights but as 
     <lb/>
     they are territories I think it is quite differ<lb break="no"/>ent. We have been trying for a good while 
     <lb/>
     to induce Newfoundland to come into the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. We have been anxious at times 
     <lb/>
     for this and I think we would be glad at 
     <lb/>
     any time to have her come in because that 
     <lb/>
     would round off the Dominion, and it is a 
     <lb/>
     province which w e very much desire to have. 
     <lb/>
     if it had been a territory we would not have 
     <lb/>
     had to ask their consent ; we would simply 
     <lb/>
     have brought them in under the constitution. 
     <lb/>
     That is what we are doing as I understand, 
     <lb/>
     with the provinces in the west. We are not 
     <lb/>
     obliged to ask their consent to bring them 
     <lb/>
     in ; we simply pass an Act and they come 
     <lb/>
     in of necessity and we give them such terms 
     <lb/>
     as the constitution provides unless we see fit 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     3897                       APRIL 5, 1905                        3898   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     to give them extra terms by the legislation 
     <lb/>
     of this House. The thing that is important 
     <lb/>
     in this matter is that whatever Act we pass 
     <lb/>
     now, so far as I have understood the debate 
     <lb/>
     will be permanent so far as this parliament 
     <lb/>
     is concerned, and any change that is made 
     <lb/>
     will have to be made by the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. It is important, therefore, that we 
     <lb/>
     should go slowly ; and it is very important 
     <lb/>
     that this should be debated from every 
     <lb/>
     standpoint, because if we make a mistake 
     <lb/>
     now it will be a lasting mistake. The Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister when he brought this Bill down 
     <lb/>
     said that there were four subjects which 
     <lb/>
     dominated all the others. The first was : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     How many provinces should be admitted into 
     <lb/>
     the confederation coming from the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories—one, or two or more ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     They have decided on two, and have ap<lb break="no"/>parently decided to leave Manitoba as it is, 
     <lb/>
     so far as any extension west is concerned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then the next question was : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In whom should be vested the ownership of 
     <lb/>
     the public lands ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     They decided that they would keep the 
     <lb/>
     land. The only advantage I can see in their 
     <lb/>
     keeping the lands is that they will be able 
     <lb/>
     to use them for political influence. It will 
     <lb/>
     not be any advantage to us from a financial 
     <lb/>
     or any other standpoint. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     What should be the financial terms to be 
     <lb/>
     granted to these new provinces ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     They have been liberal, but I certainly 
     <lb/>
     would not have complained of that if they 
     <lb/>
     had not kept the lands and then the premier 
     <lb/>
     said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     And the fourth and not the least important 
     <lb/>
     by any means was the question of the school 
     <lb/>
     system which would be introduced—not intro<lb break="no"/>duced because it was introduced long ago, but 
     <lb/>
     should be continued in the Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That I think is where the premier made a 
     <lb/>
     mistake ; that is where he talks of these 
     <lb/>
     Territories as though they were provinces 
     <lb/>
     and as though we were bound to retain these 
     <lb/>
     Acts with reference to separate schools in 
     <lb/>
     the Territories just as if they had been pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. If I understood the legal arguments 
     <lb/>
     which have been advanced in this House at 
     <lb/>
     all, I think that does not apply. Then, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     we had a speech from the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) on the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional side of the question, and I think 
     <lb/>
     that every one who heard that speech and 
     <lb/>
     every one who has read it will concede that 
     <lb/>
     he really put the Prime Minister out of 
     <lb/>
     business so far as the constitutional aspect 
     <lb/>
     of the case is concerned. I fully expected 
     <lb/>
     that when our leader had finished speaking 
     <lb/>
     they would have put up the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice to answer him and certainly they would 
     <lb/>
     have done so if the contention of the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister had been right because then the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice would have been able to 
     <lb/>
     down our leader, but he is not easily downed. 
     <lb/>
     To my great surprise they put up the Min<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>1241/2 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     ister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) and I was 
     <lb/>
     further surprised by the admissions he made. 
     <lb/>
     He differed entirely from the very beginning 
     <lb/>
     with his leader. He said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     My right hon. friend the First Minister has 
     <lb/>
     not declared that it is not within the power of 
     <lb/>
     this parliament to make a change. He has not 
     <lb/>
     declared that there is any legal or binding ob<lb break="no"/>ligation resting on the parliament of Canada 
     <lb/>
     to re-enact the clauses of the Act of 1875. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I think that is exactly opposed to what 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the government contended for, 
     <lb/>
     and I think that if the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment had felt that he was strong in his 
     <lb/>
     position after he had heard the speech of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Carleton who leads the 
     <lb/>
     opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) he certainly 
     <lb/>
     would have answered him in like manner, 
     <lb/>
     that is, he would have appointed a legal gen<lb break="no"/>tleman to answer the opposition leader. I 
     <lb/>
     find also that the Minister of Finance is not 
     <lb/>
     in favour of separate schools. He said that if 
     <lb/>
     he had his way personally, speaking for him<lb break="no"/>self he would not go in for separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     he would leave that word ' separate ' out of 
     <lb/>
     all schools. Then he went on to tell us that 
     <lb/>
     they had no separate schools by law in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, and he said that this was owing to 
     <lb/>
     the good fellowship that existed between 
     <lb/>
     the people there, because they divided up. 
     <lb/>
     Where there was a strong minority they had 
     <lb/>
     their schools, they had their teachers, I be<lb break="no"/>lieve with the same examination as those 
     <lb/>
     for public schools, but although they had 
     <lb/>
     not a separate school by-law they had by the 
     <lb/>
     consent of the majority in that province. 
     <lb/>
     I am strongly of opinion that this Bill which 
     <lb/>
     has been introduced will not tend to make it 
     <lb/>
     easier to have separate schools in the west<lb break="no"/>ern provinces than it would have been to 
     <lb/>
     have them without it. My own impression is 
     <lb/>
     that when you try to force a man to do 
     <lb/>
     something he does not want to do you will 
     <lb/>
     have a good deal of difficulty in making him 
     <lb/>
     do it. I understood the hon. gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     have spoken to tell us that they have had 
     <lb/>
     no difficulty in the last few years with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to separate schools. If that is the case 
     <lb/>
     I do not see why they want this enactment. 
     <lb/>
     The separate schools do not appear to have 
     <lb/>
     been a great success in that country any<lb break="no"/>way. I believe there are only about a dozen 
     <lb/>
     of them all told, nine Roman Catholic and 
     <lb/>
     two or three Protestant. These Protestant 
     <lb/>
     schools are as much separate schools, I pre<lb break="no"/>sume, as the others. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I took some notes of what was said by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) 
     <lb/>
     and I was astonished at the state of things 
     <lb/>
     existing in that country. I was especially 
     <lb/>
     surprised at his construing of the Act now 
     <lb/>
     before the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We are proposing to make these people fully 
     <lb/>
     responsible for their own self-government in 
     <lb/>
     the important matters of education, public 
     <lb/>
     works and all affairs of internal development. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The hon. member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott) seemed to think that there was 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="3899" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-05_Page_3899.jpg"/>
            <p>
     3899                       COMMONS                           3900 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     no difference between the public schools of 
     <lb/>
     that country and the separate schools. Well 
     <lb/>
     there seems to be a difference according to 
     <lb/>
     the gentleman who spoke last night, a slight 
     <lb/>
     difference at least. The hon. member (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Scott) found a good deal of fault with the 
     <lb/>
     headlines that are published in some news<lb break="no"/>papers in Ontario. For instance : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     A free west, a common school, provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights and religious equality. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     He did not seem to think that was a good 
     <lb/>
     thing to publish in any part of this country. 
     <lb/>
     I think they are sentiments that even he 
     <lb/>
     might endorse although he may support this 
     <lb/>
     Bill, if he does I am of opinion that he will 
     <lb/>
     not be voting for all these sentiments. He 
     <lb/>
     seems to differ with me. He says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Articles and inflammatory cartoons under 
     <lb/>
    that motto have led the innocent citizens to be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the proposals of the government are 
     <lb/>entirely in the teeth of this motto. I say that 
     <lb/>every item proposed by the government is in 
     <lb/>strict observance of these principles.  .    .    .    . 
     <lb/>A common school—that is just what we are 
     <lb/>asked to vote for in this proposition ; a non<lb break="no"/>sectarian school, absolutely under state control. 
     <lb/>A free west—that is a reasonably free west ; 
     <lb/>just as free as Ontario. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Now, if it is no freer than Ontario, it 
     <lb/>
     has to have separate schools, because by the 
     <lb/>
     constitution which we have we are bound to 
     <lb/>
     maintain separate schools, but we do not 
     <lb/>
     maintain them in every part of the country. I 
     <lb/>
     am proud to say that I live in a town where 
     <lb/>
     we do not have any separate schools. We 
     <lb/>
     had a separate school a good many years 
     <lb/>
     ago, but the people got tired of it, and away 
     <lb/>
     back in 1875, before the law compelled us 
     <lb/>
     to put a Roman Catholic on the high school 
     <lb/>
     board, by common consent the town coun<lb break="no"/>cil, of which I had the honour of being a 
     <lb/>
     member, asked the Roman Catholics to name 
     <lb/>
     a man to represent them on the high school 
     <lb/>
     board. He was put on, and I think he has 
     <lb/>
     been a member of the school board ever 
     <lb/>
     since. We employ a certain number of 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic teachers in our schools, 
     <lb/>
     and we have had no trouble whatever, we 
     <lb/>
     have lived in peace and harmony, which 
     <lb/>
     is the kind of thing I would like to see all 
     <lb/>
     over this country. I think when our boys 
     <lb/>
     and girls grow up and attend school to<lb break="no"/>gether, they come to know one another, 
     <lb/>
     and they forget for the time being what 
     <lb/>
     particular sect each one may belong to. 
     <lb/>
     They grow up to respect one another, and 
     <lb/>
     to live together as Christian people ought 
     <lb/>
     to live, in my judgment. A free common 
     <lb/>
     school under state control is what my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend calls it. Then the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Beauharnois asked the question : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BERGERON. What is the difference be<lb break="no"/>tween the two schools then ? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SCOTT. Not any difference, only the one 
     <lb/>I have mentioned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. BERGERON. Where is the separate 
     <lb/>school then ?  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. U. WILSON. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. SCOTT. It is certainly a separate school, 
     <lb/>
     though it is not a religious school. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. BERGERON. It may be in a different 
     <lb/>
     building, but it is the same school. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. SCOTT. It is the same class of school. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Now the hon. member for East Assini- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     boia (Mr. Turriff) spoke last night, and he 
     <lb/>
     said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The only difference is that in the first and sec<lb break="no"/>ond readers the text is a little different, but 
     <lb/>
     even these books have to be authorized by the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Education. There is no church or 
     <lb/>
     clerical control in any shape, form or manner 
     <lb/>
     over the Catholic schools in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Now we have one gentleman saying there 
     <lb/>
     is no difference whatever, and another gen<lb break="no"/>tleman admitting that there is a difference 
     <lb/>
     ill the two first books that the children use. 
     <lb/>
     And there may be others. Then the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman quoted some things, and I have 
     <lb/>
     not been able to understand why he quoted 
     <lb/>
     them, unless it was to obtain the good op<lb break="no"/>inion of his leader ; because there is a 
     <lb/>
     vacancy in the cabinet, we have no Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior at the present time, and as 
     <lb/>
     a matter of course they will have to take 
     <lb/>
     a man from the west. I do not object to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman if he can get the posi<lb break="no"/>tion, but I fear he will have a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     trouble in getting elected. Now he said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I have a communication from an important 
     <lb/>
     body, the Baptist convention of Manitoba and 
     <lb/>
     the Territories, the third clause of which is as 
     <lb/>
     follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is a scheme which will promote discord 
     <lb/>
     and defeat one of the main purposes of public 
     <lb/>
     school education, which is the unification of all 
     <lb/>
     classes. A confederation cannot be sound in 
     <lb/>
     which the elements lack the first essential of 
     <lb/>
     harmony. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Now, why he should quote that communi<lb break="no"/>cation as a reason for voting for the Bill, 
     <lb/>
     I cannot understand, because if I had a com<lb break="no"/>munication like that sent to me I would 
     <lb/>
     think that they wanted me to vote the 
     <lb/>
     other way. But I noticed that after he 
     <lb/>
     got through his leader went up and shook 
     <lb/>
     hands with him, and I wondered whether 
     <lb/>
     it was on account of the amount of scrap 
     <lb/>
     book material he used, or on account of his 
     <lb/>
     independence of the people he represented. 
     <lb/>
     Again he said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Another petition very largely signed contains 
     <lb/>
     the following : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We, the undersigned citizens, respectfully 
     <lb/>
     urge you to use all influence you may have 
     <lb/>
     against the separate school clause in the Bill 
     <lb/>
     now before parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That is another reason why he should 
     <lb/>
     vote for that Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In a petition dated March 7th, from the Min<lb break="no"/>isterial Association of Winnipeg, the second 
     <lb/>
     clause reads as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Whereas the rights of the minority are suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently protected by the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act in any particular case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="3901" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-05_Page_3901.jpg"/>
            <p>
     3901                     APRIL 5, 1905                          3902 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That is another reason he gave for sup<lb break="no"/>porting the Bill. For myself I do not see 
     <lb/>
     anything in any of these petitions that would 
     <lb/>
     induce any member of this House to sup<lb break="no"/>port the Bill before parliament at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time ; I think the very reverse is the 
     <lb/>
     case. I said in the beginning that this 
     <lb/>
     Bill had caused more contention than any 
     <lb/>
     other Bill that has been before this House 
     <lb/>
     since I have had the honour of a seat in 
     <lb/>
     it, and I think that is true. We had notice 
     <lb/>
     to-day from a gentleman in this House that 
     <lb/>
     there was going to be a large number of 
     <lb/>
     public meetings all over this country in 
     <lb/>
     the near future. There was a large public 
     <lb/>
     meeting in Toronto a few days ago, a good 
     <lb/>
     many speakers took part, and I judge from 
     <lb/>
     what I see reported that they were all Lib<lb break="no"/>erals except one, and he was an indepen<lb break="no"/>dent, I suppose, the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe (Mr. L. G. McCarthy). He said he 
     <lb/>
     was an independent, and I am bound to 
     <lb/>
     take his word for it. The gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     occupied the chair at that meeting is a Lib<lb break="no"/>eral, I think no person who lives in To<lb break="no"/>ronto and knows anything about the public 
     <lb/>
     men there will dispute that he is a Liberal 
     <lb/>
     of the Liberals. I refer to Mr. Stapleton 
     <lb/>
     Caldecott. He said himself before the meet<lb break="no"/>ing was over that as Paul called himself, 
     <lb/>
     a Hebrew of the Hebrews, so he, Mr. Calde- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cott, was a Grit of the Grits. He is re<lb break="no"/>ported to have said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We must make no mistake, and if we pass 
     <lb/>
     the clause as brought before us by Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier we should make a most tremendous 
     <lb/>
     mistake. (Hear, hear). What he proposes is 
     <lb/>
     open to most serious objection, and for myself, 
     <lb/>
     with my previous admiration for this man, giv<lb break="no"/>ing him my hearty service as a model states<lb break="no"/>man, for the moment I have lost my respect 
     <lb/>
     for his judgment. (Hear, hear). He has sought, 
     <lb/>
     almost in an indecent manner, to thrust upon 
     <lb/>
     this people a piece of legislation they will 
     <lb/>
     never submit to. What have our Ontario cabi<lb break="no"/>net ministers been doing in the meanwhile ? 
     <lb/>
     (Hear, hear). What is the reason for their 
     <lb/>
     silence ? Are we to take it that they are in 
     <lb/>
     favour of the proposal ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Well, Sir, the Minister of Customs took a 
     <lb/>
     fling at that gentleman, he said he did not 
     <lb/>
     think the First Minister would suffer much 
     <lb/>
     because he had lost the respect of that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, but he did not respect Mr. Calde- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cott's judgment because, he said, a man 
     <lb/>
     who knew anything about parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     practice would know that if a minister stays 
     <lb/>
     in a government he must agree with the 
     <lb/>
     doings of that government. Well, there 
     <lb/>
     was another gentleman who spoke at that 
     <lb/>
     meeting, the hon. member for North Simcoe, 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Leighton McCarthy) and let me read 
     <lb/>
     what he said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Since the date of the introduction of these 
     <lb/>
     Bills, there has arisen a huge wave of public 
     <lb/>
     opinion, and would you believe it ? It has 
     <lb/>
     reached as far as Ottawa, it was wafted there 
     <lb/>
     in some particular way, it has caused much ex<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>citement—acute situations, resignations have 
     <lb/>
     taken place, and rumors of more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, under that state of 
     <lb/>
     things, Mr. Caldecott must not be blamed 
     <lb/>
     much if he did not know exactly where the 
     <lb/>
     Ontario ministers were of the opinion that 
     <lb/>
     they did not know themselves exactly where 
     <lb/>
     they were at first. After this Bill was in<lb break="no"/>troduced, any person looking over on to the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the House could see that there 
     <lb/>
     was pretty general confusion everywhere, 
     <lb/>
     and I think if a vote had been taken then, 
     <lb/>
     we would have had no Liberal government 
     <lb/>
     at the present time. But when the shepherd 
     <lb/>
     got back, you know, and when they changed 
     <lb/>
     the wording of the clause without changing 
     <lb/>
     the meaning, as a matter of course they had 
     <lb/>
     an excuse to come back. That is all it 
     <lb/>
     amounted to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. CAMPBELL. Are you not sorry that 
     <lb/>
     you did not have to vote then ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. U. WILSON. I know, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. member for Centre York will 
     <lb/>
     be glad at the next election if there are a 
     <lb/>
     good many men in this riding who will not 
     <lb/>
     have votes. You may fool them once or 
     <lb/>
     twice, but you cannot fool them all the time. 
     <lb/>
     You remember that the hon. gentleman got 
     <lb/>
     in once on higher duties on vegetables. Then 
     <lb/>
     he got out of that by saying that he could 
     <lb/>
     not induce the government to do what he 
     <lb/>
     wanted them to do. I do not know what 
     <lb/>
     he will do the next time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. CAMPBELL. He is here any way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. WILSON. That is about as good an 
     <lb/>
     argument as the right hon. First Minister 
     <lb/>
     once gave us when he said : We are here, 
     <lb/>
     and you are there ; what are you going to 
     <lb/>
     do about it ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. CAMPBELL. What did you do about 
     <lb/>it ?<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     Mr. U. WILSON. We ran again and got 
     <lb/>
     beaten. There was another gentleman at 
     <lb/>
    that meeting, Dr. Goggin, who made a very 
     <lb/>strong speech. Some say he is a Tory and 
     <lb/>some say he is a Liberal. I do not know 
     <lb/>what he was or what he is, but I will read 
     <lb/>an extract from what he said, as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I take it that we meet here to-night as a 
     <lb/>
     body of Liberals, intent upon setting before 
     <lb/>
     our party our views on this subject, whether 
     <lb/>
     they be right or wrong. This I believe is one 
     <lb/>
     of the qualifications of a good party man. We 
     <lb/>
     are not here as a body of Conservatives intent 
     <lb/>
     upon making capital for ourselves. We are not 
     <lb/>
     here as a body of Orangemen trying to arrest 
     <lb/>
     Romanism. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is most unfortunate that the question was 
     <lb/>
     ever raised. The responsibility for the state 
     <lb/>
     of the public opinion now existing in the west 
     <lb/>
     does not rest upon the people of Ontario. or of 
     <lb/>
     any other province, but upon that fraction of 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet at Ottawa who manufactured those 
     <lb/>
     educational clauses for the people of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion without the knowledge of those mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the cabinet most concerned therewith. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="3903" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-05_Page_3903.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3903</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS  3904</fw>
            <p>
     I ought to have said, perhaps, earlier in 
     <lb/>
     my speech that I am strongly of the opi<lb break="no"/>nion that had the hon. Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Fielding) and the hon. ex-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior (Mr. Sifton) been here we cer<lb break="no"/>tainly would not have seen the Bill we have 
     <lb/>
     seen introduced into this House. I think we 
     <lb/>
     never would have seen these educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses in it. It seems to me that if the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. First Minister had been well 
     <lb/>
     advised, and I am afraid he was not, these 
     <lb/>
     clauses would have been left out and the 
     <lb/>
     constitution that the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act provides for these provinces would have 
     <lb/>
     gone into operation without any let or hin<lb break="no"/>drance from this parliament. It does seem 
     <lb/>
     to me that that would have been the fairest 
     <lb/>
     thing to do. We would have saved all this 
     <lb/>
     discussion and all this bad feeling. We 
     <lb/>
     would not have seen what we are seeing 
     <lb/>
     every day here–a debate on a question that 
     <lb/>
     we really ought to have nothing to do with 
     <lb/>
     because we ought to be willing to give our 
     <lb/>
     fellow subjects the same rights as we claim 
     <lb/>
     for ourselves. I notice that the hon. ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior, the hon. Finance 
     <lb/>
     Minister and even some hon. gentlemen from 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest have stated that if the deci<lb break="no"/>sion were left to them whether there should 
     <lb/>
     be separate schools or not they would not 
     <lb/>
     have them, but rather than have this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment go out of office, rather than have the 
     <lb/>
     possibility of a Liberal Conservative admin<lb break="no"/>istration they would bury their principles, 
     <lb/>
     have three, or four, or five years in parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and take the chance of the people for<lb break="no"/>getting what they have done. It seems to 
     <lb/>
     me from the speech made by the hon. Fin<lb break="no"/>ance Minister in this House that those were 
     <lb/>
     the tactics which were pursued in the cau<lb break="no"/>cus. When this was brought before the mem<lb break="no"/>bers in caucus they said to them : If you 
     <lb/>
     vote us out there will be a general election, 
     <lb/>
     you will have all the odium of this Bill and 
     <lb/>
     the Tories will beat you ; you had better 
     <lb/>
     vote for it and stay in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, there was a pretty strong resolution 
     <lb/>
     passed at this meeting. I have not heard it 
     <lb/>
     read in the House up to this time. It ap<lb break="no"/>peared in the Toronto ' News ' on the 21st 
     <lb/>
     March, 1905. I do not suppose I dare men<lb break="no"/>tion that name in this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     At the mass meeting held in the Massey Hall 
     <lb/>
     last evening to protest against the school clause 
     <lb/>
     of the Autonomy Bill the following resolution 
     <lb/>
     was moved by Mr. D. E. Thomson, seconded by 
     <lb/>
     Rev. Dr. Milligan, and carried unanimously : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I do not suppose that any one will accuse 
     <lb/>
     Dr. Thomson or Dr. Milligan of being 
     <lb/>
     Tories. I have the pleasure of an acquain<lb break="no"/>tance with Dr. Milligan and I regard him as 
     <lb/>
     a very fine man, but a great Liberal and I 
     <lb/>
     am informed that D. E. Thomson is quite as 
     <lb/>
     strong a Liberal as Dr. Milligan. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Whereas it is of vital importance to Canada 
     <lb/>
     that the new provinces about to be established 
     <lb/>
     shall be left free to shape their own educa<lb break="no"/>tional policy in accordance with the needs of 
     <lb/>
     the future, as these shall develop ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. U. WILSON. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Be it therefore resolved, that this meeting 
     <lb/>
     emphatically protests against the enactment of 
     <lb/>
     section 16 of the present Autonomy Bills, or 
     <lb/>
     any other provisions inconsistent with their 
     <lb/>
     constitutional freedom in this regard ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Be it further resolved, that, since the elec<lb break="no"/>tors have had no opportunity to pass upon the 
     <lb/>
     principle embodied in the school clauses of the 
     <lb/>
     Bills now before parliament, the government 
     <lb/>
     should : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (a) Abandon the clauses, or  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (b) Appeal to the country on the measure, or 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     (c) Defer action entirely until after the next 
     <lb/>
     general election. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And be it ordered that copies of this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion be forwarded to the Honourable the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister and to the city members of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That is, in my judgment, a pretty strong 
     <lb/>
     resolution to be passed at a public meeting by 
     <lb/>
     reformers. I do not care whether they were 
     <lb/>
     reformers or not, they were citizens of this 
     <lb/>
     country, but the men who moved and 
     <lb/>
     seconded this resolution were reformers 
     <lb/>
     beyond all doubt. Then, there was Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Willison, the editor of the ' News,' a great 
     <lb/>
     admirer in other days of the present Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister. He wrote his life and, I have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt, he gave him as favourable a charac<lb break="no"/>ter as could well be given. I do not wish 
     <lb/>
     to detract from it but if he writes another 
     <lb/>
     volume it will be a very different volume 
     <lb/>
     from those which he has written. I have 
     <lb/>
     here quite a number of extracts. I have 
     <lb/>
     an extract from a statement of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     David Mills, who was the great constitu<lb break="no"/>tional authority of this House at one time 
     <lb/>
     and who afterwards occupied a seat on the 
     <lb/>
     Supreme Court bench. I have another from 
     <lb/>
     a statement by Sir Louis Davies, once a 
     <lb/>
     prominent member of the Liberal party in 
     <lb/>
     this House, and who has also been elevated 
     <lb/>
     to the Supreme Court bench. Both of these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen tell us that when the time comes 
     <lb/>
     to create provinces in our great Northwest 
     <lb/>
     that will be the time for them as provinces 
     <lb/>
     to initiate their own school system. I will 
     <lb/>
     not detain the House by reading all of these 
     <lb/>
     quotations, but there are one or two that I 
     <lb/>
     cannot refrain from giving. My time is 
     <lb/>
     about up and I do not intend, as the speeches 
     <lb/>
     have generally been long, to follow the bad 
     <lb/>
     example that has been set on both sides of 
     <lb/>
     the House. This is a comment by the Tor<lb break="no"/>onto ' News' of 11th March, 1905 : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The remedial legislation of 1896 had some 
     <lb/>
     warrant in the constitution ; the present legis<lb break="no"/>lation has none. It is a gratuitous seeking for 
     <lb/>
     trouble which could easily be avoided. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That the antagonism to forcing separate 
     <lb/>
     schools on the west should come from Liberal 
     <lb/>
     sources can easily be understood. The Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party is threatened with a far greater disaster 
     <lb/>
     than loss of power. It is threatened with the 
     <lb/>
     loss of the principles to which it owes its 
     <lb/>
     vitality.

     Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     I shall not quote extracts from papers which 
     <lb/>
     have been opposed to the Liberal party here<lb break="no"/>tofore ; I am reading from the newspapers 
     <lb/>
     which have always supported the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party, and if I had time I could read a 
     <lb/>
     good many extracts from the 'Globe '—I 
     <lb/>
     was going to say I could read the whole 
     <lb/>
     'Globe'—denouncing the policy of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on this question. The 'Globe,' in 
     <lb/>
     its turn, has been denounced by hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite, but their denunciation is 
     <lb/>
     because the 'Globe' stood by Liberal prin<lb break="no"/>ciples which the Liberal party have re<lb break="no"/>canted. Take the Toronto 'Saturday Night'; 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Sheppard has been for many years a 
     <lb/>
     great admirer of the present Liberal leader, 
     <lb/>
     and he has said a good many kind things 
     <lb/>
     of that right hon. gentleman, but on the 
     <lb/>
     llth of March, 1905, Mr. Sheppard wrote 
     <lb/>
     thus : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     No legislation is too wild, unpatriotic or in<lb break="no"/>defensible to be regarded as a possibility under 
     <lb/>
     a government which repudiates its most solemn 
     <lb/>
     professions, and deliberately plots to force 
     <lb/>
     upon the people the thing which it came into 
     <lb/>
     power pledged to oppose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Any man who places the will of the priest of 
     <lb/>
     his church above the will of the people who 
     <lb/>
     made him what he is, can not be trusted. And 
     <lb/>
     the hierarchy demands and exacts implicit 
     <lb/>
     obedience from its subjects. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, I have placed before the 
     <lb/>
     House some of the views I entertain on this 
     <lb/>
     subject. Personally I am strongly opposed 
     <lb/>
     to separate schools and have always been. 
     <lb/>
     I left my party in 1896, and voted with the 
     <lb/>
     present Prime Minister for six months hoist 
     <lb/>
     of the Remedial Bill, and I did that against 
     <lb/>
     the strong remonstrance of my leader. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     An hon. MEMBER. You got into bad 
     <lb/>
     company. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. URIAH WILSON. No ; the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister was all right in 1896, but the trou<lb break="no"/>ble is that he has changed his principles 
     <lb/>
     since, and I can no longer follow him in 
     <lb/>
     endeavouring to maintain provincial rights. 
     <lb/>
     In 1895, I stood for provincial rights, and I 
     <lb/>
     stand for provincial rights to-day. Ever 
     <lb/>
     since I was a boy, I have heard the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party fighting for provincial rights, but the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party no longer has that plank in 
     <lb/>
     its platform. We all remember the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties between Upper and Lower Canada 
     <lb/>
     before confederation, when one province 
     <lb/>
     wanted representation by population, and 
     <lb/>
     the other did not. We remember the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties that arose until the crisis came that 
     <lb/>
     we could not govern the country properly, 
     <lb/>
     and a solution was sought in confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Was not the understanding at confederation 
     <lb/>
     that every province should be left to do its 
     <lb/>
     own business and that the federal parlia<lb break="no"/>ment should only do the general business of 
     <lb/>
     the country. Why is there a change made 
     <lb/>
     in that compact now ? I say Sir, that as 
     <lb/>
     honourable men we are bound to carry out 
     <lb/>
     the compact of confederation and to pursue 
     <lb/>
     the policy which the fathers of confedera- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     tion have laid down as the principles of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of our country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. H. S. BELAND (Beauce). Mr. Speak<lb break="no"/>er, I feel satisfied that however long may 
     <lb/>
     be my public career in this parliament, I 
     <lb/>
     shall never be called upon to address the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons of Canada on a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of greater importance than this. Let 
     <lb/>
     me say at the outset of my remarks, which 
     <lb/>
     I hope will be brief, that having but slight 
     <lb/>
     experience as a debater, having no legal 
     <lb/>
     training whatever, I being a physician, and 
     <lb/>
     having but a very imperfect command of 
     <lb/>
     the English language, I feel that I must 
     <lb/>
     crave the indulgence of the House. This 
     <lb/>
     subject is one which should be approached 
     <lb/>
     with a deep sentiment of patriotism, and 
     <lb/>
     with the spirit which animated the illus<lb break="no"/>trious fathers of confederation when they 
     <lb/>
     met to endeavour to devise a scheme under 
     <lb/>
     which the people of the British possessions 
     <lb/>
     in North America might live together 
     <lb/>
     in union, happiness and prosperity. It 
     <lb/>
     should be gratifying to every true Canadian 
     <lb/>
     that in the evolution of our national history 
     <lb/>
     we are in this Canadian parliament to-day 
     <lb/>
     discussing a measure to create two new 
     <lb/>
     provinces in our splendid Northwest domain. 
     <lb/>
     The Northwest Territories were discovered 
     <lb/>
     long ago by French settlers and French ad<lb break="no"/>venturers chiefly. Thirty years ago these 
     <lb/>
     Territories had a population of only 500 
     <lb/>
     white people, and it is claimed to-day (and 
     <lb/>
     the claim is well founded) that these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories are now settled by 500,000 frugal, 
     <lb/>
     sturdy and industrious people, who are ask<lb break="no"/>ing to be admitted into confederation and 
     <lb/>
     to enjoy the full privileges of statehood and 
     <lb/>
     self-government. The years of 1903 and 
     <lb/>
     1905 will go down in Canadian history as 
     <lb/>
     memorable years, because they are identified 
     <lb/>
     with the introduction into the Canadian par<lb break="no"/>liament of two enactments, the most im<lb break="no"/>portant in the history of our country—I re<lb break="no"/>fer to the creation of provinces in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories with their untold and un<lb break="no"/>imagined possibilities, and the measure pro<lb break="no"/>viding for the building of the National 
     <lb/>
     Transcontinental Railway. When our child<lb break="no"/>ren and our childrens' children read the his- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     story of these years, they will feel that the 
     <lb/>
     venerated statesman who leads the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party, who leads this House, and I make 
     <lb/>
     bold to say, who leads this country, has 
     <lb/>
     associated his name with two epoch mark<lb break="no"/>ing events, they will feel Sir, that these 
     <lb/>
     measures mark an era in the progress of our 
     <lb/>
     country, and that entitle the great states<lb break="no"/>man who fathered them to rank amongst 
     <lb/>
     the foremost patriots of this country of 
     <lb/>
     ours. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, many important questions are 
     <lb/>
     involved in this Autonomy Bill. And while 
     <lb/>
     the question as to the number of provinces 
     <lb/>
     to be created, the financial aid to be given 
     <lb/>
     them. and the location of the capital, have 
     <lb/>
     met with very little criticism, the land and 
     <lb/>
     educational clauses of the Bill have excited 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="3907" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-05_Page_3907.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3907</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS          3908</fw>
            <p>
     much comment; although in my opinion 
     <lb/>
     they have received, and are receiving the 
     <lb/>
     warmest support of the majority of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Canada. Nevertheless the land clause, 
     <lb/>
     and especially the educational clause, have 
     <lb/>
     encountered very bitter opposition from 
     <lb/>
     some quarters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to the lands, it has been 
     <lb/>
     stated by the hon. leader of the opposition, 
     <lb/>
     in that very able statement which he pre<lb break="no"/>sented to us the other day, that it was im<lb break="no"/>portant and in accordance with the prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of the constitution that the lands of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories should be handed 
     <lb/>
     over to the new provinces. Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     have to take exception to that view of the 
     <lb/>
     question, because I believe that it is the 
     <lb/>
     part of wisdom for this government to re<lb break="no"/>tain control of the lands, apart from the 
     <lb/>
     consideration which was offered to us the 
     <lb/>
     other day by the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior (Mr. Sifton), that, from the point of 
     <lb/>
     view of an effective immigration policy, it 
     <lb/>
     was not wise to have two or more govern<lb break="no"/>ments dealing with it. There is another 
     <lb/>
     consideration, and that is the following : 
     <lb/>
     The moment you hand over to the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces the control of their lands, you leave 
     <lb/>
     them face to face with two propositions, 
     <lb/>
    which, I believe, are contrary to each other 
     <lb/>—the creating of a revenue and the main<lb break="no"/>taining of an efficient immigration policy. 
     <lb/>The new provinces, if possessed of the lands, 
     <lb/>would naturally be deprived of the financial 
     <lb/>aid extended to them by this government 
     <lb/>in lieu of the lands. They would have to 
     <lb/>create their revenue from those lands ; and 
     <lb/>the moment you increase the price of land<lb/>you hamper immigration, while you want<lb/>to promote immigration you have to de<lb break="no"/>crease the price of land.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard some hon. gentlemen on the<lb/>other side of the House say that the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Ontario and Quebec have the con<lb break="no"/>trol of their lands. Very true, Mr. Speaker ;<lb/>but the provinces of Ontario and Quebec <lb/>should not be considered from the same <lb/>point of view as the Northwest provinces,<lb/>and I will tell you why. Because there are<lb/>in those two provinces immense timber<lb/>limits, from which they derive a very large<lb/>revenue. In the province of Quebec, during<lb/>the last year, I think the revenue accruing<lb/>from the Crown lands amounted to $600,-<lb break="maybe"/>000-not from the sale of lands, but from<lb/>the stumpage only. The situation is not the <lb/>same in the Northwest Territories.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>There is another point of view from which<lb/>I think we should withhold the lands from<lb/>the new provinces, that is the national point<lb/>of view. In stating this opinion, I may be<lb/>taxed by some hon. gentlemen with being<lb/>a Utopist ; I may be told that I am dream<lb break="no"/>ing ; but let me say frankly what I think.<lb/>It is obvious to every one who observes the<lb/>Northwest Territories to-day that the loyal<lb/>sentiment which prevails there is pure,<lb/>deep and large, as the stately rivers which<lb/>run over the endless prairies. But who<lb/>knows what will be the immigration of<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. BELAND.<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     to-morrow ? There are to-day half a mil<lb break="no"/>lion people in the Northwest Territories ; 
     <lb/>
     how many will you find in twenty or thirty 
     <lb/>
     years from now ? Who can tell ? Perhaps 
     <lb/>
     two million, perhaps three million, perhaps 
     <lb/>
     five million, perhaps ten or twelve million ; 
     <lb/>
     and as we know that the largest foreign 
     <lb/>
     immigration to-day is from the United States, 
     <lb/>
     who can assure this House and this country 
     <lb/>
     that the control of the legislatures in the 
     <lb/>
     two new provinces thirty years from now 
     <lb/>
     will not be in the hands of people having 
     <lb/>
     a greater interest in the country to the south 
     <lb/>
     of the boundary line ? And, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     we shall have, in the control of the lands 
     <lb/>
     and in the control of immigration, perhaps 
     <lb/>
     not a complete remedy, but certainly a 
     <lb/>
     palliative. Hon. gentlemen opposite say to 
     <lb/>
     us : Hands off the twins ; let them enjoy 
     <lb/>
     the greatest liberty ; give them all their 
     <lb/>
     lands and the largest possible autonomy. 
     <lb/>
     Well, I can assure my hon. friend from East 
     <lb/>
     Grey (Mr. Sproule), whom I am glad to see 
     <lb/>
     in his seat, that in that future time, if he 
     <lb/>
     wishes, in order to maintain a loyal senti<lb break="no"/>ment in the Northwest Territories, the ser<lb break="no"/>vices of that Roman Catholic clergy, whom 
     <lb/>
     he does not appear to like very much, they 
     <lb/>
     will be found as usual ready to support, 
     <lb/>
     day and night, through weeks and months 
     <lb/>
     and years, the British flag. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. SPROULE. I may tell my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend that, contrary to his opinion or be<lb break="no"/>lief, I do not dislike them by any means. 
     <lb/>
     I have no feeling of dislike against them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. I am very glad to hear it. 
     <lb/>
             Coming to what is known in the country as 
     <lb/>the educational clause of this Bill, it is a<lb/>very burning question and a question of<lb/>very great importance. The agitation which<lb/>has been aroused over that clause is im<lb break="no"/>mense, and we all regret it. That agita<lb break="no"/>tion is so intense that we are that that the <lb/>provincial government of Manitoba, now on<lb/>its last legs, is seeking to get a new lease<lb/>of office out of it. Well, the educational<lb/>clauses of this measure have already been<lb/>discussed a good deal in this country. They<lb/>have encountered very bitter opposition<lb/>from the newspapers, especially in that en<lb break="no"/>lightened city of Toronto, where even men<lb/>who used to be ranked amongst the fore<lb break="no"/>most Liberals have been outspoken in their<lb/>opposition to those clauses, and they have<lb/>also enjoyed the distinction of being made <lb/>the subject of the censorious tongues of those<lb/>who adorn the pulpits of this country. There<lb/>are many points of view from which this<lb/>important question may be considered.<lb/>There is a constitutional point of view,<lb/>there is the provincial autonomy point of<lb/>view ; but whatever may be the reasons in<lb break="no"/>voked in this debate, the main object of<lb/>those who are making to-day a solid opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to these educational clauses is nothing<lb/>else but political capital. Before proceed<lb break="no"/>ing further, I must say that I was very<lb/>much surprised the other night when I<lb/>heard the eloquent member for West As<lb break="no"/>

     siniboia (Mr. Scott) state in this House that 
     <lb/>
     amongst the Protestant population of this

     country the opinion prevailed that the pri<lb break="no"/>vileges of the Catholic minority had been 
     <lb/>
     called for by them. Nothing could be further 
     <lb/>
     from the truth. The educational privileges 
     <lb/>
     of the minorities in this country were called 
     <lb/>
     for, not by Catholics, but by Protestants. 
     <lb/>
     They were called for by Mr. Galt, and I 
     <lb/>
     will go further. I will say that the man 
     <lb/>
     who had every authority to represent the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic population of this country, John 
     <lb/>
     Sandfield Macdonald, moved a resolution in 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of United Canada asking 
     <lb/>
     that the Catholic minority be left in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the Protestants of this country, 
     <lb/>
     as they could rely on the good faith of the 
     <lb/>
     Protestants—and what was the fate of that 
     <lb/>
     motion ? It was defeated by a vote of 95 
     <lb/>
     to 8. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     You have heard, Sir, on this question 
     <lb/>
     constitutional authorities ; you have heard 
     <lb/>
     men of great legal training ; you have had 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity of hearing men who are 
     <lb/>
     professors in our most reputable universi<lb break="no"/>ties ; and you have also heard men whose 
     <lb/>
     profession it is to read themselves in 
     <lb/>
     national and international problems. We 
     <lb/>
     have had in this House on the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional question the spectacle of the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman who leads the govern<lb break="no"/>ment differing with one or two of his 
     <lb/>
     ministers, while they all adopted the 
     <lb/>
     same course. We have had on the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the House the spectacle of the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition differing in toto 
     <lb/>
     from his first lieutenant, the member for 
     <lb/>
     Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk). I will refrain 
     <lb/>
     from going any further into the divergencies 
     <lb/>
     we have witnessed in this House regarding 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional aspects of the question, 
     <lb/>
     and will present on that aspect the point 
     <lb/>
     of view of a layman. There are two alter<lb break="no"/>natives, I believe, which confront every 
     <lb/>
     member of parliament on this matter. Are 
     <lb/>
     these Territories entering confederation to<lb break="no"/>day or did they enter the union in the year 
     <lb/>
     1870 ? You may take whichever view you 
     <lb/>
     prefer, but you must adopt the one or the 
     <lb/>
     other. Either they entered the union in 
     <lb/>
     1870 or they are going into it to-day. If they 
     <lb/>
     are going into it to-day, article 93 is very 
     <lb/>
     plain : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially 
     <lb/>
     affect any right or privilege with respect to 
     <lb/>
     denominational schools which any class of per<lb break="no"/>sons have by law in the province at the union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, if we take the alternative that 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories are going into the 
     <lb/>
     union to-day, it seems to me that this clause 
     <lb/>
     should apply, but some hon. gentlemen, I 
     <lb/>
     think among them the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, contend that the Territories entered 
     <lb/>
     the union in 1870. If they did, what is 
     <lb/>
     our position to-day ? Legislation was passed 
     <lb/>
     by this parliament in 1875, in the full exer<lb break="no"/>cise of its powers, creating in the North<lb break="no"/>west Teritories a system of separate 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     schools by which the minorities were to en<lb break="no"/>joy certain privileges. In pursuance of that 
     <lb/>
     law, ordinances were passed in the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories by which this system of schools 
     <lb/>
     was amended over and over again. What 
     <lb/>
     then is our position to-day ? Are we go<lb break="no"/>ing to adopt the views of those who enact<lb break="no"/>ed that law of 1875 or are we going to 
     <lb/>
     repudiate them ? I think that when we 
     <lb/>
     know that this parliament in 1875 passed 
     <lb/>
     a law conferring upon the Catholic minority 
     <lb/>
     certain privileges, and that that law has 
     <lb/>
     been amended by the legislature of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories in the exercise of its power—and 
     <lb/>
     we must admit that it was in the exercise 
     <lb/>
     of its power so long as these ordinances 
     <lb/>
     have not been repealed by this parliament 
     <lb/>
     —I submit that when we know that, our 
     <lb/>
     paramount duty is to confirm the legislation 
     <lb/>
     passed both by this parliament and the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     This is the layman's point of view. By 
     <lb/>
     adopting this course we put an end to inter<lb break="no"/>minable judicial disputes ; and if only the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition had adopted 
     <lb/>
     that view, as he seemed to be about to adopt 
     <lb/>
     it when the Bill was first introduced into 
     <lb/>
     this House, if he had left aside those ele<lb break="no"/>ments of his party who are opposed to any 
     <lb/>
     privilege being given the Catholic minority, 
     <lb/>
     it he had said : I will stand with the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman in upholding legis<lb break="no"/>lation that this parliament has passed, that 
     <lb/>
     men like Sir Alexander McKenzie, Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald, Sir Alexander Campbell, have 
     <lb/>
     supported—had he adopted the view of 
     <lb/>
     those eminent statesmen, what would be 
     <lb/>
     the position to-day ? There would have 
     <lb/>
     been no agitation of any importance in 
     <lb/>
     this country, we would have buried for ever 
     <lb/>
     the old feuds which I say have been a curse 
     <lb/>
     to the nation in the past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are three systems of schools; first 
     <lb/>
     there is the system of separate schools with 
     <lb/>
     two boards, each board having the super<lb break="no"/>vision of its schools, the qualification of 
     <lb/>
     teachers, text books, inspection and so on. 
     <lb/>
     The type of these schools is to be found in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. There is a second 
     <lb/>
     system of schools which you call neutral 
     <lb/>
     or godless schools. The best illustration 
     <lb/>
     of that system of schools is, I believe, to 
     <lb/>
     be found in the United States of America. 
     <lb/>
     There is a third system of schools which 
     <lb/>
     may be called either separate or public 
     <lb/>
     schools, which are under one single board, 
     <lb/>
     and in which religious instruction is al<lb break="no"/>lowed, according to the wishes of the par<lb break="no"/>ents. This system, I believe, is the one 
     <lb/>
     which is in force in the Northwest at the 
     <lb/>
     present moment. The argument of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
     <lb/>
     the other day was fairly conducted all 
     <lb/>
     along the lines that church influence in 
     <lb/>
     the schools was prejudicial to their effi<lb break="no"/>ciency. He went so far as to say that in<lb break="no"/>formation which he has gathered permitted 
     <lb/>
     him to state that church influence, clerical 
     <lb/>

     schools, in France, for instance. had pro<lb break="no"/>duced a people of illiterates and atheists. 
     <lb/>
     He will likely be disposed to recognize that 
     <lb/>
     he has been led into error. In France 
     <lb/>
     there are very few atheists ; there are a 
     <lb/>
     good many free-thinkers— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPROULE. I was not expressing an 
     <lb/>
     opinion on that at all. I referred to what 
     <lb/>
     a French gentleman had told me was the 
     <lb/>
     result of that system. I was using his 
     <lb/>
     language, not my own, because I am not 
     <lb/>
     competent to express an opinion of that 
     <lb/>
     kind, never having visited the country and 
     <lb/>
     knowing little about it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. That is exactly what I 
     <lb/>
     say, that the hon. gentleman had been led 
     <lb/>
     into error. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPROULE. I understood the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to say that I had said that of 
     <lb/>
     France. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. No, Mr. Speaker, I said 
     <lb/>
     that by some information he had gathered 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman had been led into error 
     <lb/>
     when he stated that in France there was 
     <lb/>
     a large number of atheists. For my part, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, I am not discussing this ques<lb break="no"/>tion from the point of view of an advocate 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools, nor from the point of 
     <lb/>
     view of an advocate of public schools. We 
     <lb/>
     are not called upon in this House to say 
     <lb/>
     whether we favour the one or the other. 
     <lb/>
     We are discussing a Bill which provides 
     <lb/>
     for religious instruction in the schools in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest, a system which has been 
     <lb/>
     adopted by the Northwest and which is in 
     <lb/>
     force now. Our country is a British coun<lb break="no"/>try, our institutions are modelled after the 
     <lb/>
     institutions of Great Britain, and I am 
     <lb/>
     very sorry, I deeply regret—I say it sin- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cerely—that the great lines, the illuminat<lb break="no"/>ed paths which have been set for 
     <lb/>
     us in the mother country, are in this 
     <lb/>
     debate willingly ignored. Unshakable at<lb break="no"/>tachment to all things British, be they 
     <lb/>
     military, be they political, be they 
     <lb/>
     social, has been boasted of here, especially 
     <lb/>
     by hon. gentlemen opposite. It is but a 
     <lb/>
     few days since the echoes of this chamber 
     <lb/>
     were disturbed by the imperialistic elo<lb break="no"/>quence of my hon. friend from Victoria 
     <lb/>
     and Haliburton (Mr. Sam. Hughes). In his 
     <lb/>
     footsteps we have seen the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     from South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) and 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member from East Grey (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule), earnestly and honestly, we be<lb break="no"/>lieve, preaching the rapproachement, closer 
     <lb/>
     relations between England and Canada. It 
     <lb/>
     is their contention that British institutions 
     <lb/>
     are the climax of perfection for a consti<lb break="no"/>tutional country. Why in the name of 
     <lb/>
     common sense was the British school sys<lb break="no"/>tem not good enough for them ? The 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian is very devoted to British 
     <lb/>
     institutions, and I make hold to say here 
     <lb/>
     that if my countrymen, my compatriots in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. were offered to-day 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity to sever their connection 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     from Great Britain, if they were offered 
     <lb/>
     independence, if they were offered annexa<lb break="no"/>tion, if they were offered French allegiance, 
     <lb/>
     I have not the slightest hesitancy to say 
     <lb/>
     they would squarely refuse and remain, 
     <lb/>
     faithful to Great Britain. And why, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker ? Because as was said so elo<lb break="no"/>quently by one of the hon. gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site in a debate a few years ago, Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain has distinguished herself at home and 
     <lb/>
     abroad for that broad spirit of good faith 
     <lb/>
     and toleration, for those sacred principles 
     <lb/>
     of religious equality and self-government. 
     <lb/>
     In England an education Act was recently 
     <lb/>
     introduced providing for religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tion in the schools, according to the wishes 
     <lb/>
     of the parents. By whom was it intro<lb break="no"/>duced ? By men like Chamberlain, by men 
     <lb/>
     like Balfour, and that legislation was as<lb break="no"/>sailed, and I think encountered as bitter 
     <lb/>
     an opposition as this legislation is encoun<lb break="no"/>tering to-day. Ministers of the gospel went 
     <lb/>
     as far as to say that the state was in dan<lb break="no"/>ger, that the primary and elementary rights 
     <lb/>
     were threatened, that the birth right of the 
     <lb/>
     British citizen was at stake, that it was a 
     <lb/>
     battle for life. The Solicitor General (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Lemieux) the other night, in the course 
     <lb/>
     of a very able speech, read to this House 
     <lb/>
     quotations from speeches that have been 
     <lb/>
     delivered in England by Mr. Chamberlain 
     <lb/>
     and by Mr. Balfour. I shall not trouble 
     <lb/>
     the House by reading any more of those 
     <lb/>
     speeches. I think the House will permit 
     <lb/>
     me to make an allusion to a reverend gen<lb break="no"/>tleman in England, a minister of the Pres<lb break="no"/>byterian denomination, Rev. Archibald La<lb break="no"/>mont, of St. Paul's Presbyterian Chapel. 
     <lb/>
     Here is what that gentleman said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have high hopes for education and for Pres<lb break="no"/>byterianism and for future Christianity as the 
     <lb/>
     result of the advent of this imperfect, but sub<lb break="no"/>stantially good, Education Bill, and, in spite of 
     <lb/>
     an unreasouing and undignified agitation against 
     <lb/>
     it, an agitation to which, as I deeply deplore, 
     <lb/>
     my own beloved church has thoughtlessly, but 
     <lb/>
     I hope temporarily, committed herself. I fear 
     <lb/>
     that in most of our Protestant churches, elo<lb break="no"/>quence of speech is often more a hindrance 
     <lb/>
     than help to the practical solution of far- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     reaching and complex questions. It often puts 
     <lb/>
     men unwittingly in a false pre-eminence, so 
     <lb/>
     that the rank and file—the common people— 
     <lb/>
     are misled and become martyrs by mistake. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     This should be read to some of the reve<lb break="no"/>rend gentlemen of Ottawa and Toronto who 
     <lb/>
     have thought it proper to speak from the 
     <lb/>
     pulpit against the educational clauses of this 
     <lb/>
     Bill. But, Mr. Speaker. this Bill has been 
     <lb/>
     adopted in England, and has been in force 
     <lb/>
     for a couple of years, and it has given entire 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction. The impression that must pre<lb break="no"/>vail in the end is that some people want 
     <lb/>
     more religious instruction and some people 
     <lb/>
     want less religious instruction than this Bill 
     <lb/>
     provides ; but, Mr. Speaker, standing here 
     <lb/>
     as a representative in parliament of a coun<lb break="no"/>try of 43,000 souls. I think it is my duty to 
     <lb/>
     uphold the constitution, and by it to con<lb break="no"/>firm the privileges. be they large or be they

     small, that the majority enjoy in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. There are some hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on the other side of this House, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
     <lb/>
     the hon member for South York (Mr. W. F. 
     <lb/>
     Maclean) and the hon. member for Victoria 
     <lb/>
     and Haliburton (Mr. Sam. Hughes) who pro<lb break="no"/>fess to believe that religious instruction 
     <lb/>
     should be done away with in the schools. 
     <lb/>
     But, Mr. Speaker, though I have great res<lb break="no"/>pect for their opinion,. I must say without 
     <lb/>
     hesitation that if those three gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     were put on one side, and on the other side 
     <lb/>
     you were to show me statesmen like Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chamberlain, like Mr. Gladstone, like Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Balfour, like Mr. Guizot, I would have to 
     <lb/>
     throw in my lot with the great Englishmen. 
     <lb/>
     Now, Sir, the claim has been made in this 
     <lb/>
     House and out of it that the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
     has trampled upon provincial rights and 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy, that it has abandoned 
     <lb/>
     its principles of 1896, and that now the Lib<lb break="no"/>eral party is invading provincial rights and 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     let me refer for a moment to what took place 
     <lb/>
     in 1890. What was the position of the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. the Prime Minister in 1896, when he 
     <lb/>
     moved the six months hoist of the Remedial 
     <lb/>
     Bill ? He said : This parliament has a 
     <lb/>
     right to interfere ; the remedy lies with us, 
     <lb/>
     but I think that remedy should not be 
     <lb/>
     applied until all conciliatory methods have 
     <lb/>
     been exhausted. Now, Sir, in 1896 we stood 
     <lb/>
     for conciliation. What are we doing today ? 
     <lb/>
     We are still standing for conciliation, we 
     <lb/>
     stand for compromise on an honourabe 
     <lb/>
     basis. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BERGE'RON. Would my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     allow me to ask him a question ? Did the 
     <lb/>
     solution of 1896 settle the Manitoba school 
     <lb/>
     question to the satisfaction of the minority? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BFEILAND. It did settle it to a certain 
     <lb/>
     extent which appears to be satisfactory to 
     <lb/>
     the minority. It may not be satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     to my hon. friend, who is known to be an 
     <lb/>
     ardent and devoted supporter of the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     church. But to my mind, and as a means 
     <lb/>
     establishing peace and harmony in this 
     <lb/>
     country between the different elements, it 
     <lb/>
     is satisfactory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BERGERON. I hope I am not troubl<lb break="no"/>ing my hon. friend. But how does he ex<lb break="no"/>plain this trip of Mr. Rogers and Mr. Camp- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     bcll down here to secure a more favourable 
     <lb/>
     settlement for the minority of Manitoba ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. L. G. McCAR'DHY. Was that what 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers and Mr. Campbell came for ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BERGERON. That is what we were 
     <lb/>
     told this afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. L. G. MCCARTHY. I am glad to 
     <lb/>
     know it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. I think I can satisfy 
     <lb/>
     the hon gentleman on that point. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers is fond of notoriety, he desires to 
     <lb/>
     make himself and his party some politi- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
    

            <p>
     cal capital in Manitoba, and he came to 
     <lb/>
         meet Monseigneur Sbarretti for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose, in my opinion. of procuring some ar<lb break="no"/>rangement by which he hoped to capture 
     <lb/>the Catholic vote of Manitoba. I think that 
     <lb/>the object of Mr. Rogers, in my estimation, 
     <lb/>and I think in the estimation of my hon. 
     <lb/>friend also, was to make political capital. 
     <lb/>Now, Sir, who is making a claim for pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights to-day ? The hon, the leader 
     <lb/>of the opposition is making, from the rock 
     <lb/>of the constitution, as he said, a fight for 
     <lb/>provincial rights. We had an instance the 
     <lb/>other day of how hon. gentlemen will stand 
     <lb/>sometimes for provincial rights when the 
     <lb/>leader of the opposition criticised the Bill 
     <lb/>that was introduced a few days ago by the 
     <lb/>right hon. gentleman, and when he was asked 
     <lb/>whether the land should be left with the 
     <lb/>provinces or with the federal government, 
     <lb/>he was of the opinion that the land should 
     <lb/>go to the provinces. But then he bethought 
     <lb/>himself, I suppose, of the strong objection, 
     <lb/>for it was an objection, that I quoted a 
     <lb/>minute ago, that it would perhaps interfere 
     <lb/>with an effective immigration policy. But 
     <lb/>I will quote his own words : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     May I not further suggest that even if there 
     <lb/>
     were any danger—and I do not think there is— 
     <lb/>
     it would be the task of good statesmanship to 
     <lb/>
     have inserted, if necessary, a provision in this 
     <lb/>
     Bill with regard to free homesteads and the 
     <lb/>
     price of these lands, and obtain to it the con<lb break="no"/>sent of the people of the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It is no more difficult than that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Provincial rights, provincial autonomy as 
     <lb/>
     long as it serves his purpose ! But, as soon 
     <lb/>
     as it does not serve his purpose, let us in<lb break="no"/>vade provincial rights and send a postcard,— 
     <lb/>
     I suppose that is the system in vogue in 
     <lb/>
     Toronto now—to every member and to 
     <lb/>
     every citizen in the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     saying : Do you approve of that? If he 
     <lb/>
     says he does, all right, and if he says he 
     <lb/>
     does not, well, where will he be ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We, of the province of Quebec, we, the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority of this Dominion, are 
     <lb/>
     bound to change our mind as to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L Borden). 
     <lb/>
     We had always thought that he was a broad 
     <lb/>
     minded Englishman, we had always thought 
     <lb/>
     that he was animated by that spirit of fair 
     <lb/>
     dealing and kindly forbearance that have 
     <lb/>
     distinguished English institutions for the 
     <lb/>
     last fifty years. The other day be pro<lb break="no"/>nounced upon us a beautiful eulogy. He 
     <lb/>
     said that he had traversed the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec from one end to the other and that 
     <lb/>
     every man he had met there was well read, 
     <lb/>
     intelligent and sociable and a moment after<lb break="no"/>wards he moved the amendment which is 
     <lb/>
     now before the House. The hon. gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     I am afraid, has missed his vocation. He 
     <lb/>
     has missed his profession. He should have 
     <lb/>
     been a surgeon because he would have made 
     <lb/>
     a very skilful one. When I listened to him 
     <lb/>
     I could not refrain from thinking that when 
     <lb/>
     he pronounced that eulogy, when he uttered 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <pb n="3915" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-05_Page_3915.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3915</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS  3916</fw>
            <p>
     those words in praise of the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dian people he was doing the work of a 
     <lb/>
     surgeon before the operation—injecting into 
     <lb/>
     the tissues an analgesic before he used 
     <lb/>
     the scalpel. The hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto (Mr. Foster) says that because we 
     <lb/>
     have tried to invade provincial rights we 
     <lb/>
     have become a disrupted and disbanded 
     <lb/>
     party. But, for a moment or two let us 
     <lb/>
     examine what has happened on the other 
     <lb/>
     side. The moment the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition has placed his constitutional gun 
     <lb/>
     in position and the moment he has fired that 
     <lb/>
     gun it has been found to be a slate gun. It 
     <lb/>
     splits to pieces. The hon. member for Jac<lb break="no"/>ques Cartier (Mr. Monk) mortally wounded ; 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Beauharnois (Mr. Ber- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     geron) not quite so badly wounded. The list 
     <lb/>
     of wounded grows every day. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Toronto says that 
     <lb/>
     the weakness of the Czar of Russia 
     <lb/>
     is that he does not consult his people. 
     <lb/>
     Then, I might retort : What is the weak<lb break="no"/>ness of the hon. leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion ? If it is a mistake for the Czar 
     <lb/>
     of Russia not to consult his people how 
     <lb/>
     much greater a mistake must it be for that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman to turn his gun against his 
     <lb/>
     own lieutenants and his own regiment ? 
     <lb/>
     But, we have not heard so far in this House 
     <lb/>
     from the hon. member for South York (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Maclean). He will be coming some day and 
     <lb/>
     making a plea such as he made to-day in 
     <lb/>
     favour of provincial rights. That hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman succeeded in the not very remote 
     <lb/>
     past in making himself plainly understood 
     <lb/>
     on the question of provincial rights. It was 
     <lb/>
     in March, 1902. What did the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South York say ? He was speaking in 
     <lb/>
     this House and he said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Speaking of the provinces, I have not a mo<lb break="no"/>ment's hesitation in saying that the result of 
     <lb/>
     provincial government in Canada has been 
     <lb/>
     detrimental to the progress of the country. I 
     <lb/>
     say that the interpretation of the law that has 
     <lb/>
     been given by the English Privy Council in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the distribution of rights as between 
     <lb/>
     the provinces and the federal power, has been 
     <lb/>
     against the interests of the country as a whole. 
     <lb/>
     That I regret. I agree with the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Lanark (Hon. Mr. Haggart) that some day 
     <lb/>
     we will have the whole jurisdiction in this par<lb break="no"/>liament, and in some way we will work it out, 
     <lb/>
     and in some way we will increase the federal 
     <lb/>
     power and wipe out gradually the provincial 
     <lb/>
     power. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Who would believe that after what the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman told us this afternoon ? But, 
     <lb/>
     that is not all. He said something else. 
     <lb/>
     Here is what he said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Yet we are told that there is no hope of 
     <lb/>
     progress, that the main thing is to uphold 
     <lb/>
     local rights. That is the doctrine of the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice of Canada. I take issue with 
     <lb/>
     him there. The thing which the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party of this country committed itself to was 
     <lb/>
     to build up a nation, with a unification of laws, 
     <lb/>
     if that was possible, and that this country 
     <lb/>
     should in some way try to recover the federal 
     <lb/>
     power which has been lost to the provinces in 
     <lb/>
     the past few years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     I ask my hon. friend frankly if he ap<lb break="no"/>proves of that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. All of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. Well, if the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man says he approves of that, I have noth<lb break="no"/>ing more to say. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Toronto did not pose as the champion 
     <lb/>
     of provincial rights in 1896. He assumed 
     <lb/>
     a different position then, but when he made 
     <lb/>
     his speech he said he would not do it again, 
     <lb/>
     and why ? Because the will of the people 
     <lb/>
     and particularly the expression of the popu<lb break="no"/>lar will in Quebec prevented him from doing 
     <lb/>
     it. Do you not see, Mr. Speaker, the skill 
     <lb/>
     and adroitness of that argument ? If the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman had only said that at the 
     <lb/>
     general election in 1896 the people of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec went against his position, 
     <lb/>
     while we know better, we could have under<lb break="no"/>stood it, but he mentioned also the general 
     <lb/>
     elections of 1900 and 1904 as giving an ex<lb break="no"/>pression of the people against the stand he 
     <lb/>
     took in this House on the question of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights. He sought to escape the con<lb break="no"/>demnation which was placed upon the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party for their bad administra<lb break="no"/>tion prior to that day. He affects to be<lb break="no"/>lieve that in 1896, 1900 and 1904 the people 
     <lb/>
     voted for the upholding of provincial rights. 
     <lb/>
     He counts for nothing his own disastrous 
     <lb/>
     financial administration. He counts for 
     <lb/>
     nothing the scandals of his party during the 
     <lb/>
     18 years of their regime. He counts for 
     <lb/>
     nothing the stagnation of affairs, the in<lb break="no"/>effective immigration policy and especially 
     <lb/>
     that in the general elections in 1900 and 
     <lb/>
     1904 the people gave expression to the con<lb break="no"/>tentment which they felt under the pro<lb break="no"/>gressive policy that our great leader has 
     <lb/>
     introduced into this country and which he 
     <lb/>
     has maintained. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The plea for provincial rights is a myth 
     <lb/>
    in this debate, cold political calculation 
     <lb/>is behind it. Men like the leader of 
     <lb/>the opposition, men like the member 
     <lb/>for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) should 
     <lb/>rise to a higher level, for no one doubts 
     <lb/>in his heart that they do not know this 
     <lb/>plea is unfounded. Intended as it is to 
     <lb/>appeal strongly to the highest principles 
     <lb/>of autonomy, of liberty, and of equality ; 
     <lb/>it will utterly fail in its results when the 
     <lb/>sound reasoning of the plain people of this 
     <lb/>country is applied to it. I have spoken 
     <lb/>longer than I expected, but I ask the House 
     <lb/>to bear with me a few moments longer. 
     <lb/>There have been very strong appeals made 
     <lb/>to religious and racial prejudices in this 
     <lb/>country. I will not refer to the circular 
     <lb/>sent broadcast by the member for East 
     <lb/>Grey ; I will not refer to his speech in this 
     <lb/>House, though he uttered some very regret<lb break="no"/>table words, but I will deal for a moment 
     <lb/>and a moment only with the Huntingdon 
     <lb/>' Gleaner ' which he quoted. The Hunting<lb break="no"/>don ' Gleaner' I may say is a paper of minor 
     <lb/>importance in the province of Quebec; it is 
     <lb/>a purely local paper, and from the extracts 
     <lb/>that the member for East Grey read to the 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     House one would be led to believe that the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant people in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec are being ill-treated. Well, here is the 
     <lb/>
     answer I have to give to the Huntingdon 
     <lb/>
     'Gleaner'; I shall quote the words of the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Mr. Weir, a man of high standing in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec, and a representative 
     <lb/>
     of the Protestant people in the Quebec cabi<lb break="no"/>net. Mr. Weir spoke at a public meeting in 
     <lb/>
     Montreal ; he spoke when he was not asked 
     <lb/>
     to deal with the question, when he was not 
     <lb/>
     solicited to say a word in reference to it. 
     <lb/>
     and here is what Mr. Weir said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I, being the son of a Scotch father and a 
     <lb/>
     Scotch mother. I, a Protestant, have always 
     <lb/>
     in this province seen not only our rights but 
     <lb/>
     our remotest wishes respected. I challenge 
     <lb/>
     any Protestant to say, that he has ever been 
     <lb/>
     ill-treated. And therefore, when in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario we see politicians and 
     <lb/>
     bigots appealing to racial and religious 
     <lb/>
     prejudices in order to deprive the minor<lb break="no"/>ity of the rights to which they are constitu<lb break="no"/>tionally and logically entitled, it is our im<lb break="no"/>perious duty to cry shame, and to stigmatize 
     <lb/>
     them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Let me refer for a moment or two to some 
     <lb/>
     of what I shall call, the exaggerations of 
     <lb/>
     language in the newspapers of Ontario, and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec also—for there are bigots in both 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Here is what the Toronto 'News ' 
     <lb/>
     writes : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It is not conceivable that Sir Wilfrid Laurier, 
     <lb/>
     much less the Protestant, members of his cabi<lb break="no"/>net believe they are acting in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of the constitution. That they have 
     <lb/>
     submitted themselves to the will of the hier<lb break="no"/>archy of Quebec is the only reasonable expla<lb break="no"/>nation of their conduct. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I will give you the answer to that from 
     <lb/>
     'L'Evénement' of Quebec, an organ of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party ; the leading organ of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party in the district of Que<lb break="no"/>bec. 'L'Evénement' writes : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     No, no. It is not the free denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools that Sir Wilfrid Laurier guaranteed to 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic and French minority of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories ; it is the neutral schools which are 
     <lb/>
     slaves of the state. This is the truth, the 
     <lb/>
     cruel truth, the truth undeniable and manifest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The Toronto 'World,' the organ of my 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend—not my right hon. friend, 
     <lb/>
     but my hon. friend from South York, I shall 
     <lb/>
     quote from it. I must say, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     that I had great trouble in finding a clip<lb break="no"/>ping from the Toronto 'World' that I 
     <lb/>
     could, with any sense of decency, quote to 
     <lb/>
     the House, when that paper writes against 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. I have been look<lb break="no"/>ing through its columns for some time and 
     <lb/>
     hardly could I put my finger upon a few 
     <lb/>
     lines which would be quotable in this House, 
     <lb/>
     but few as they are I will read them. The 
     <lb/>
     Toronto ' W'orld ' says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The new provinces are to be stripped of their 
     <lb/>
     public lands and compelled to submit to an edu<lb break="no"/>cational system modelled under the artistic 
     <lb/>
     direction of the Quebec hierarchy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Let me give my hon. friend from South 
     <lb/>
     York the answer from 'L'Evénement,' that 
     <lb/>
     same Conservative newspaper in Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     which writing of Sir Wilfrid Laurier says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     When one has seventy of a majority, he does 
     <lb/>
     his duty or he falls on the field of honour. He 
     <lb/>
     does not need to betray to remain in power. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     And when ' L'Evénement ' talks of betray<lb break="no"/>ing, it does not talk of betraying Protes<lb break="no"/>tants; it is surely talking of Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier betraying Catholics. But there is 
     <lb/>
     something more serious than all that. This 
     <lb/>
     afternoon I heard the member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey say very plainly : it is about time that 
     <lb/>
     we should have some proof of that toler<lb break="no"/>ation in the province of Quebec which is 
     <lb/>
     so much talked of. Well, I will try to give 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman a few proofs of that 
     <lb/>
     toleration of ours. The hon. gentleman will 
     <lb/>
     admit that in the province of Quebec— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     An hon. MEMBER. He will not admit 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. My hon. friend who sits 
     <lb/>
     beside me says that he will not admit it, 
     <lb/>
     but the member for East Grey is fair, and 
     <lb/>
     that being so I am sure that when he hears 
     <lb/>
     what I have to say he will stand up and 
     <lb/>
     declare that he was mistaken—honestly mis<lb break="no"/>taken, but mistaken just the same. Let 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman (Mr. Sproule) listen. In 
     <lb/>
     this House we have twelve Protestant mem<lb break="no"/>bers from the province of Quebec. We 
     <lb/>
     have one from Argenteuil, a county in which 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant population is 7,800 and the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic population 8,100. The division of 
     <lb/>
     Montreal, St. Antoine, represented by my 
     <lb/>
     good friend Mr. Bickerdike— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     An hon. MEMBER. Mr. Ames. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. Yes, represented by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ames, and I can still call him my good 
     <lb/>
     friend I hope. In Montreal, St. Antoine, the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant population is 22,000 and the

     <lb/>
     electing that gentleman.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. INGRAM. Will the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     allow me ? We will agree that that is the 
     <lb/>
     standing of the two religious parties in the 
     <lb/>
     several constituencies; but when it comes 
     <lb/>
     to the vote, all the good Protestants will 
     <lb/>
     vote for this Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. FIELDING. Let us hope so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. I am not concerned with 
     <lb/>
     that at all. They may vote as they please, 
     <lb/>
     and I am sure the French Canadian people 
     <lb/>
     will never go back on them on that ac<lb break="no"/>count. Out of the twelve counties in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec which are represented 
     <lb/>
     in this House by Protestants, there is only 
     <lb/>
     one county where the majority is Protes<lb break="no"/>tant, and that is the county of Brome, re<lb break="no"/>presented here by my hon. friend, the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Agriculture (Hon. Mr. Fisher). 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, this may not be exactly fair; it 
     <lb/>
     may indicate that we are more tolerant 
     <lb/>
     than we are in reality. I will take another 
     <lb/>
     point of view—that of the whole popula<lb break="no"/>tion of the province. According to the 
     <lb/>
     whole population of the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, the Protestants would be entitled in 
     <lb/>
     this parliament to eight representatives ; 
     <lb/>
     but they have twelve. What does my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from East Grey think of that ? The 
     <lb/>
     'Evening Telegram,' of Toronto, which 
     <lb/>
     makes a specialty of dealing with the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the tolerance of the provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and Quebec, has the following : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Ontario's tolerance is illustrated in the ten<lb break="no"/>dency of every Roman Catholic who represents 
     <lb/>
     a Protestant constituency to vote as a liegeman 
     <lb/>
     of his church rather than as the citizen of his 
     <lb/>
    country, upon questions affecting the aims of 
     <lb/>the church. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The intolerance of Quebec is illustrated in 
     <lb/>
     the spectacle of every Protestant representa<lb break="no"/>tive voting with an eye to the race and creed 
     <lb/>
     prejudices of Quebec, and with vision blinded 
     <lb/>
     to the principles of his own race and creed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Ontario's treatment of the minority that is 
     <lb/>
     over-represented in the government, over-repre- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     sented in the legislature, is not equalled by 
     <lb/>
     the treatment which the minority receives in 
     <lb/>
     any other commonwealth on earth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BELAND. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Ontario can match her alleged intolerance 
     <lb/>
     against the boasted tolerance of any people on 
     <lb/>
     earth. It is an outrage that such a province 
     <lb/>
     with such a record should be the recipient of 
     <lb/>
     lectures on toleration from the bigots of Que<lb break="no"/>bec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Well, let us see if it is true that Ontario 
     <lb/>
     can match her tolerance against the toler<lb break="no"/>ance of Quebec. In Ontario the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     population is 1,800,000, and the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     population 390,000. On that basis the Pro<lb break="no"/>testants of Ontario are entitled to 72 mem<lb break="no"/>bers in this House and the Catholics to 14 
     <lb/>
     members. What is the representation in 
     <lb/>
     reality ? Seventy-nine Protestants and 
     <lb/>
     seven Catholics, just one-half of what the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics are entitled to by their popula<lb break="no"/>tion. These are the figures, irrespective of 
     <lb/>
     parties, for they include all the 86 mem<lb break="no"/>bers from the province of Ontario. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But this is not all. Let us take the Do<lb break="no"/>minion as a whole, and see how the repre<lb break="no"/>sentation stands. According to their popu<lb break="no"/>lation, the Catholics are entitled in this 
     <lb/>
     House to 87 members, and we have how 
     <lb/>
     many ? Seventy-two. I hope that my 
     <lb/>
     good friend who publishes the Toronto 
     <lb/>
     ' Telegram ' will publish these figures, which 
     <lb/>
     are exact, being based on the census of 
     <lb/>
     1901. That would be only an act of jus<lb break="no"/>tice on the part of the 'Telegram,' instead 
     <lb/>
     of misrepresenting the people of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, as it has done in the past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I wonder, Mr. Speaker, what the average 
     <lb/>
     man of Ontario thinks when he reads such 
     <lb/>
     articles as are published to-day in the Tor<lb break="no"/>onto newspapers ? I wonder if the aver<lb break="no"/>age farmer of the province of Ontario has 
     <lb/>
     ever been taught in his school—I hope he 
     <lb/>
     has—what the Catholic clergy have done 
     <lb/>
     for this country of ours. I wonder if he 
     <lb/>
     has been taught that that same clergy have 
     <lb/>
     rendered eminent and inappreciable services 
     <lb/>
     to the British Crown during the last 140 
     <lb/>
     years, especially in the acute and critical 
     <lb/>
     days of early British rule in America. I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if he has been taught that, if he 
     <lb/>
     has been informed of the Catholic clergy's 
     <lb/>
     unshakable loyalty to the kings and 
     <lb/>
     queens of Great Britain since fate went 
     <lb/>
     against us on the Plains of Abraham. If 
     <lb/>
     the good farmers of the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario were taught that the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     clergy in the province of Quebec have re<lb break="no"/>sisted time and again temptations and in<lb break="no"/>ducements to take part in agitations for 
     <lb/>
     annexation; if he were taught in his early 
     <lb/>
     days what education in the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     colleges and universities has done towards 
     <lb/>
     supplying this country with men who have 
     <lb/>
     gained distinction in literature, in the pro<lb break="no"/>fessions and in agriculture, and who, every 
     <lb/>
     one will admit, will stand comparison with 
     <lb/>
     those of any other country; if he knew that 
     <lb/>
     the great idol of Ontario, the late Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald, declared on a memorable oc<lb break="no"/>casion in the city of London, that amongst 
     <lb/>
     the most faithful subjects of Her Majesty 
     <lb/>
     in Canada were to be ranked the French

     <lb/>
     things, I would have no fear for the result,            
     <lb/>
     and would be confident that he would re<lb break="no"/>sist any malicious appeals, because he is

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, I am about to close. 
     <lb/>
     I have detained the House longer than I 
     <lb/>
     intended, but I find I must claim your in<lb break="no"/>dulgence a little longer. I say it is of vital          
     <lb/>interest, admittedly, that the citizens of this  
     <lb/>country should not lose sight of their rights 
     <lb/>but it is far more important that they should 
     <lb/>not overlook their duties. To sum up my 
     <lb/>idea, this is the inevitable conclusion to 
     <lb/>which we must arrive, that the efforts of 
     <lb/>statesmen and public powers shall always be  
     <lb/>vain and fruitless if they are not founded 
     <lb/>on the spirit of good faith and toleration, 
     <lb/>on that broad spirit of Christianity, vivify<lb break="no"/>ing hundreds of thousands of firesides 
     <lb/>throughout this great land. That spirit of 
     <lb/>toleration and mutual forbearance between 
     <lb/>creeds and nationalities in the great west 
     <lb/>as well as in the older portions of our be<lb break="no"/>loved country, will alone give that social, 
     <lb/>intellectual, moral and material foundation 
     <lb/>without which no nation can rise to perman<lb break="no"/>ent greatness. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Let us not shelter ourselves under the 
     <lb/>
    flimsy parapet of legal technicalities ; and 
     <lb/>if ever doubt should enter our minds, if 
     <lb/>our path should appear full of difficulties, 
     <lb/>let us rise to the great responsibilities of 
     <lb/>our office with courage, justice and a spirit 
     <lb/>of fair-dealing. Let us ignore both the 
     <lb/>zealot and the bigot, and plant our feet in 
     <lb/>the solid ground of honourable compro<lb break="no"/>mise. Let us above all remember that this 
     <lb/>is a land, unparalleled, perhaps, and certain<lb break="no"/>ly unsurpassed for its immense resources, 
     <lb/>and its future possibilities, to which we 
     <lb/>invite the civilized nations of the old world, 
     <lb/>and if we desire to be a true nation, a 
     <lb/>worthy product of the 20th century, we 
     <lb/>must be prepared to sink and melt our in<lb break="no"/>dividual differences in the warm rays of the 
     <lb/>sun of justice and liberty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. J. BARR (Dufferin). As the hour 
     <lb/>
     is late, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that 
     <lb/>
     the House should rise and would beg to 
     <lb/>
     move the adjournment of the debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. FIELDING. The hon. member was 
     <lb/>
     not present last evening when there was, 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, what I might call an understand<lb break="no"/>ing that we should sit later into the night. 
     <lb/>
     At all events the observation was made 
     <lb/>
     that in assenting to an early adjournment 
     <lb/>
     last evening, we should, in order that this 
     <lb/>
     debate should be advanced in a reasonable 
     <lb/>
     way, work harder and sit later, and I think 
     <lb/>
     that is the temper of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BARR. I must of course, bow to 
     <lb/>
     the will of the House. I should not attempt 
     <lb/>
     to address the House on this subject, did 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     I not think it was my bounden duty not to 
     <lb/>give a silent vote on this Autonomy Bill.<lb/>In voting, as I intend to do, for the amend<lb break="no"/>ment of the leader of the opposition, I do<lb/>not wish to be understood as being opposed<lb/>to giving to the fullest extent provincial<lb/>rights to all the great lone land of the <lb/>Northwest. But before entering upon the <lb/>remarks I intend to make on the Bill itself,<lb/>I desire for a shore time to follow my hon.<lb/>friend who has just sat down. I was pleased<lb/>
    to learn that the hon. gentleman is not a 
     <lb/>lawyer, because I naturally supposed that 
     <lb/>he would take pains to steer clear of the 
     <lb/>constitutional question which has taken up 
     <lb/>so much of our time. I think we might well 
     <lb/>leave that question to be threshed out by 
     <lb/>the lawyers who, so far as we can judge, 
     <lb/>will leave it just as hazy as it was when 
     <lb/>they entered the discussion. And after 
     <lb/>we shall have heard all the learned argu<lb break="no"/>ments advanced by the gentlemen of the 
     <lb/>legal profession on the one side or the 
     <lb/>other, I have no doubt that we shall come 
     <lb/>back to the same conclusion which has al<lb break="no"/>ways prevailed in the past, and that is that 
     <lb/>it is their duty to make black appear white 
     <lb/>and right wrong. And as that is part of 
     <lb/>their business, I am glad to know that I am 
     <lb/>not a lawyer, but a doctor. But there is 
     <lb/>one thing which I presume every hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man will admit, and that is that it is the 
     <lb/>duty of this House to make laws, and that, 
     <lb/>on the other hand, it is the duty of the 
     <lb/>courts to interpret them, and whether we 
     <lb/>arrive at the conclusion that this Bill is 
     <lb/>ultra vires or otherwise, I presume the end 
     <lb/>will be that it will have to go to the Privy 
     <lb/>Council. And as that court is composed of 
     <lb/>human beings who are also lawyers, the 
     <lb/>probability is that they will give a decision 
     <lb/>according to the temper in which they are 
     <lb/>and according as their digestion is good 
     <lb/>or bad. We shall therefore have to wait 
     <lb/>for their decision to decide whether this 
     <lb/>Bill is legal or not. But I venture to say 
     <lb/>that the free and independent elector, the 
     <lb/>ordinary man, as he reads the 92nd clause 
     <lb/>of the British North America Act, will have 
     <lb/>no hesitation in concluding that so far as 
     <lb/>education is concerned, that is a question 
     <lb/>which has to be left to the province, with 
     <lb/>the exception that this parliament has the 
     <lb/>right to pass a remedial law in the event 
     <lb/>of any province not carrying out the law as 
     <lb/>it is in the statute-books. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     My hon. friend has said we should live 
     <lb/>
     in peace and harmony. We all agree with 
     <lb/>
     that, we would like to live in peace and 
     <lb/>
     harmony with all men in all parts of this 
     <lb/>
     fair Dominion of ours, but in order to do 
     <lb/>
     that we have rights and we have privileges 
     <lb/>
     which we must guard and guard safely. 
     <lb/>
     We must remember that the majority have 
     <lb/>
     rights which they should exercise just as 
     <lb/>
     freely as do the minority. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>

            <p>er of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) and 
     <lb/>
     although not a lawyer he endeavoured to 
     <lb/>
     insinuate that we on this side have not 
     <lb/>
     succeeded in our argument and that the 
     <lb/>
     legal argument of the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion had been a failure. I shall not follow 
     <lb/>
     that up beyond saying that we are all proud 
     <lb/>
     of the leader of the opposition. We feel 
     <lb/>
     that we have one man here who is not only 
     <lb/>
     able to take care of himself, but able to 
     <lb/>
     sustain the combat on any question that 
     <lb/>
     comes before this House, legal or other<lb break="no"/>wise, and to hold his own with any hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman on the opposite side. He has 
     <lb/>
     proved this to be the case in the past, and 
     <lb/>
     I venture to say that he will continue to 
     <lb/>
     show in the future that it is still the case. 
     <lb/>
     Then we have the member for North To<lb break="no"/>ronto (Mr. Foster) whom I have no hesita<lb break="no"/>tion in saying hon. gentlemen opposite have 
     <lb/>
     dreaded in the past, but never more than 
     <lb/>
     at the present time. This is shown by the 
     <lb/>
     very fact that in the past on two occasions 
     <lb/>
     when he was defeated, they put forth every 
     <lb/>
     effort of the government, not only by their 
     <lb/>
     voice and by means that are not too clear 
     <lb/>
     or too fair, but they put forth their money 
     <lb/>
     bags, which they sent to all parts to ac<lb break="no"/>complish the work to an extent that is detri<lb break="no"/>mental to the best interests and to the mor<lb break="no"/>ality of this country. My hon. friend who 
     <lb/>
     has just sat down (Mr. Beland) tried to 
     <lb/>
     make a point out of the fact that they are 
     <lb/>
     more liberal in Quebec than in other prov<lb break="no"/>inces. They may be, looking at it from a 
     <lb/>
     religious point of view, but when we look 
     <lb/>
     at it from a political point of view we 
     <lb/>
     must know that there are some reasons why 
     <lb/>
     there are only 12 Conservatives from that 
     <lb/>
     province. The Conservatives have about 
     <lb/>
     100,000 votes in Quebec while the Reform<lb break="no"/>ers have only about 130,000, and notwith<lb break="no"/>standing that there were only 11 Conser<lb break="no"/>vatives returned and 54 Reformers, prov<lb break="no"/>ing beyond a doubt that there was some 
     <lb/>
     work going on behind the scenes that was 
     <lb/>
     not of a religious nature. I might point to 
     <lb/>
     the liberality of Ontario. In the Conser<lb break="no"/>vative government of the province of On- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ario, one of the strongest governments the 
     <lb/>
     province ever had, there is for the first 
     <lb/>
     time as Minister of Public Works a French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian, and we have as Minister of Crown 
     <lb/>
     Lands a Roman Catholic, both men worthy 
     <lb/>
     of the positions and we the Conservatives of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario were pleased be<lb break="no"/>yond degree when we saw the choice which 
     <lb/>
     the present premier, Hon. Mr. Whitney, had 
     <lb/>
     made. I ask you to point to such liber<lb break="no"/>ality under any other circumstances and I 
     <lb/>
     venture to say that if I had the vote here 
     <lb/>
     it would be found that so far as their re<lb break="no"/>presentatives are concerned the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics have received a fair share of the 
     <lb/>
     vote according to their numbers in the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Ontario, particularly in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the Conservative party. In looking 
     <lb/>
     over the votes we find that in all cases they 
     <lb/>
     have had a larger representation in the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BARR. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Conservative ranks than they have had in 
     <lb/>
     the Reform ranks, proving beyond a doubt 
     <lb/>
     that the Conservatives on all occasions have 
     <lb/>
     been more liberal along these lines than the 
     <lb/>
     Reformers have been in the past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was rather amused to see my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Beland) endeavouring to make a point 
     <lb/>
     against the hon. member for South York 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Maclean). He struggled hard, he read 
     <lb/>
     'Hansard,' and read it with all the ingenu<lb break="no"/>ity of one well up along that line. He read 
     <lb/>
     'Hansard' to prove beyond a doubt that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend was opposed to provincial rights, 
     <lb/>
     but he did not tell you what the gist of that 
     <lb/>
     argument was. He did not tell you what 
     <lb/>
     question was being discussed at that time. 
     <lb/>
     and of course we all know that there are 
     <lb/>
     questions in connection with the rights and 
     <lb/>
     privileges of the Dominion and those of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces which on many occasions have 
     <lb/>
     overlapped ; they have not been well defined 
     <lb/>
     and great injustice has on many occasions 
     <lb/>
     been done in consequence. Look, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, at our railways, look at the conflict 
     <lb/>
     of jurisdiction in regard to charters for 
     <lb/>
     joint stock companies, &amp;c. Here they are 
     <lb/>
     running from one parliament to the other 
     <lb/>
     obtaining charters of different kinds when 
     <lb/>
     the jurisdiction of the different parliaments 
     <lb/>
     in that respect should be well defined. We 
     <lb/>
     find that hon. gentlemen were discussing 
     <lb/>
     matters in connection with these grievances 
     <lb/>
     and that the discussion had nothing to do 
     <lb/>
     with equal rights such as we are discussing 
     <lb/>
     here to-night. I shall not follow my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend further along that line, but I shall 
     <lb/>
     dwell now for a few moments upon the 
     <lb/>
     great question of the Bill which is before 
     <lb/>
     us and I might say that while the educa<lb break="no"/>tional question is one of the most import<lb break="no"/>ant dealt with in this Bill, there is great 
     <lb/>
     danger under existing circumstances that 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the people of Canada will 
     <lb/>
     be diverted from the other great questions 
     <lb/>
     which must affect that country in the future 
     <lb/>
     by the consideration of this one clause, and 
     <lb/>
     it may not be until after this becomes law, 
     <lb/>
     it may not be until it is beyond remedy, that 
     <lb/>
     we will have discovered mistakes which 
     <lb/>
     will then be beyond recall. I look upon the 
     <lb/>
     question of the number of provinces as one 
     <lb/>
     of great importance and one which cannot 
     <lb/>
     be too carefully considered. It is my opin<lb break="no"/>ion that it would have been much better 
     <lb/>
     for these provinces if we had two provinces 
     <lb/>
     instead of three. It would have been much 
     <lb/>
     better if the province of Manitoba could 
     <lb/>
     have been extended either to the north or 
     <lb/>
     west or east, and then we would have had 
     <lb/>
     one province west of that, making two in 
     <lb/>
     place of three. There is no doubt that Mani<lb break="no"/>toba as she is constituted to-day will be at 
     <lb/>
     a great disadvantage in the future. It is 
     <lb/>
     a small province of 73,000 square miles, 
     <lb/>
     against two provinces of 150,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles each. I submit that Manitoba is not 
     <lb/>
     receiving justice and before I have finished 
     <lb/>
     I shall endeavour to show why this injustice 
     <lb/>
     is being done to her. I believe it would be 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     better to have two provinces in place of 
     <lb/>
     three. We know that the more populous a 
     <lb/>
     province is the more expensive its admin<lb break="no"/>istration becomes. At the present time in 
     <lb/>
     those two provinces there are only half a 
     <lb/>
     million people, surely not more than enough 
     <lb/>
     for one province. It has been said before, 
     <lb/>
     and I will say it again, that we are very 
     <lb/>
     much over-governed in the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. We have more representatives in 
     <lb/>
     every legislature than are required. We 
     <lb/>
     have too much legislative machinery. So I 
     <lb/>
     say that if there were only one province in<lb break="no"/>stead of two in the Northwest one-half less 
     <lb/>
     machinery would be required. Perhaps there 
     <lb/>
     would need to be a greater number of re<lb break="no"/>presentatives, but only one parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     building would be required. We must re<lb break="no"/>member that to-day we are laying the foun<lb break="no"/>dation of what will probably become the 
     <lb/>
     two greatest provinces in this fair Domin<lb break="no"/>ion of ours. Although they have only 500,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     000 at present, in less than two decades, cer<lb break="no"/>tainly in less than a quater of a century, 
     <lb/>
     there will be 10,000,000 or 20,000,000 in that 
     <lb/>
     vast country, people who have come from 
     <lb/>
     many parts of the world and from many 
     <lb/>
     nations, mingling together and forming pro<lb break="no"/>bably the brightest and most intelligent peo<lb break="no"/>ple in this fair Dominion. Under these cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances it is all important that the foun<lb break="no"/>dation should be strong and well laid and 
     <lb/>
     that no mistake should be made. As for 
     <lb/>
     the capitals of the two provinces, whether 
     <lb/>
     they are to be Edmonton or Calgary or not, 
     <lb/>
     it is well to let the people settle that ques<lb break="no"/>tion for themselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now with reference to the land in those 
     <lb/>
     provinces. I do not agree with some hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite who have spoken on this 
     <lb/>
     subject. I believe it would be to the interest 
     <lb/>
     of those provinces that they should have con<lb break="no"/>trol of the public lands, and I believe it 
     <lb/>
     would be to the interest of the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to leave the land with the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, Ontario and all the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     except Manitoba have control of their public 
     <lb/>
     lands. Manitoba has not, because circum<lb break="no"/>stances were very different when she was 
     <lb/>
     created a province, there were only about 
     <lb/>
     12,000 souls in the territory now forming 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and they were not in a position 
     <lb/>
     to manage their own affairs. But here we 
     <lb/>
     have 500,000 people, very intelligent, and 
     <lb/>
     comprising among them able men such as 
     <lb/>
     have composed their legislative assemblies. I 
     <lb/>
     freely admit that the Dominion has dealt 
     <lb/>
     liberally with them, we have given on the 
     <lb/>
     whole to each province, $1,124,125. That is 
     <lb/>
     a large sum indeed, larger than the revenue 
     <lb/>
     which the Dominion will get out of the land. 
     <lb/>
     At the same time it is not sufficiently large 
     <lb/>
     to carry on the administration of public 
     <lb/>
     affairs as it should be carried on. I have 
     <lb/>
     made a calculation of the sums we are 
     <lb/>
     giving those provinces. For the support of 
     <lb/>
    the government and legislature, $50,000 ; 80 
     <lb/>cents per head on an estimated population 
     <lb/>of 250,000, $200,000 ; interest at 5 per cent on 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     125 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     $38,107,568, as a set-off against the debt of 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces which the Dominion as<lb break="no"/>sumed when they entered confederation, 
     <lb/>
     $405,373. We are also to pay them by way 
     <lb/>
     of compensation for public lands, $375,000 
     <lb/>
     yearly, and we give them annually for ten 
     <lb/>
     years $92,750 to provide for the construction 
     <lb/>
     of the necessary public buildings. That will 
     <lb/>
     be increased as the population increases. 
     <lb/>
     When the population reaches 800,000 the two 
     <lb/>
     provinces will have an income of $4,415,750. 
     <lb/>
     Now I submit that it would be better for 
     <lb/>
     the provinces to keep their land, the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion of Canada will not make that much 
     <lb/>
     money out of the land, and the payments 
     <lb/>
     we are making to those provinces will be a 
     <lb/>
     burden on this Dominion which will be felt 
     <lb/>
     for many years to come. I contend that 
     <lb/>
     it would be better for the province to keep 
     <lb/>
     the land because it would be administered 
     <lb/>
     much better and much more economically 
     <lb/>
     than it is at the present time. Take the 
     <lb/>
     land offices in the Northwest Territories, I 
     <lb/>
     submit that many of them are perfect cess<lb break="no"/>pools of corruption, and I speak whereof I 
     <lb/>
     know, as I have had some dealings through 
     <lb/>
     agents and otherwise with these land offices, 
     <lb/>
     and my conclusion is that they are not con<lb break="no"/>ducted in a proper manner. For instance, 
     <lb/>
     they are surrounded by heelers, by those 
     <lb/>
     who have claims upon the government, and 
     <lb/>
     the result is that when an actual settler 
     <lb/>
     goes there, when he has picked out his land 
     <lb/>
     and desires to place his name upon it, in<lb break="no"/>variably he is told that it will require some 
     <lb/>
     consideration. Now if the business was pro<lb break="no"/>perly conducted, they would be able to say 
     <lb/>
     at once to that man : You can have it, or : 
     <lb/>
     It is sold. But that is not the course pur<lb break="no"/>sued. He is annoyed, and, in many cases, 
     <lb/>
     he has to settle with the claims of some other 
     <lb/>
     parties. The result is hardships to the actual 
     <lb/>
     settler, to the immigrant coming in to make 
     <lb/>
     his home there. Many of them do not 
     <lb/>
     get the land after they have gone to much 
     <lb/>
     trouble in picking it out. Whilst that is 
     <lb/>
     the case with the actual settler, it is much 
     <lb/>
     worse with the, prospector, of whom there 
     <lb/>
     are many, they are the most important class 
     <lb/>
     of the community. I speak from knowledge 
     <lb/>
     on this subject. Prospectors are numerous 
     <lb/>
     there, they travel all over the country, hun<lb break="no"/>dreds of thousands of miles exploring the 
     <lb/>
     land, digging down into the bowels of the 
     <lb/>
     earth to see if they can find anything that 
     <lb/>
     is worth taking up. When they make ap<lb break="no"/>plication to the land office, in almost every 
     <lb/>
     case, I venture to say in ninety-nine cases 
     <lb/>
     out of a hundred, they are told that it is 
     <lb/>
     impossible to decide whether that land is 
     <lb/>
     taken up or otherwise, and they will have 
     <lb/>
     to wait a few days. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The prospector perhaps spends a large 
     <lb/>
     sum of money in locating the land which 
     <lb/>
     he desires to obtain. He comes back in a 
     <lb/>
     few days and finds three or four bogus 
     <lb/>
     claims made, and if he obtains the land 
     <lb/>
     by paying two or three rake-offs he is more 
     <lb/>
     fortunate than the great majority of pros<lb break="no"/>

            <p>
     pectors that are doing business in that 
     <lb/>
     vast country. They are surrounded by the 
     <lb/>
     barnacles that are sticking to these land 
     <lb/>
     offices like barnacles to a ship, who are 
     <lb/>
     looking for a rake-off, and I say that under 
     <lb/>
     these circumstances justice cannot be done. 
     <lb/>
     There are in that country hundreds and 
     <lb/>
     thousands of this class of men who are be<lb break="no"/>coming rich year after year at the expense 
     <lb/>
     of the country. Large tracts of land are 
     <lb/>
     sold to speculators for very small sums. 
     <lb/>
     There is a condition that they have to set<lb break="no"/>tle so much land, but this is not always 
     <lb/>
     carried out. Different arrangements are 
     <lb/>
     made and the result is that the country is 
     <lb/>
     suffering because they are not settling the 
     <lb/>
     land to the extent that it should be settled, 
     <lb/>
     and that it would be if the land were in 
     <lb/>
     the hands of the provinces. I venture to 
     <lb/>
     say that there is to-day a state of corrup<lb break="no"/>tion in that country that could not exist 
     <lb/>
     for one day if the lands were in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces. I venture to say, and in 
     <lb/>
     this I speak whereof I know, that if a com<lb break="no"/>mission was issued and if an examination 
     <lb/>
     were made, it would be found that the 
     <lb/>
     state of affairs is much worse up there 
     <lb/>
     than I have described it. It is preventing 
     <lb/>
     settlement, it is preventing people from 
     <lb/>
     going in there, it is preventing men who 
     <lb/>
     are prepared to invest their money in en<lb break="no"/>deavouring to open up that country from 
     <lb/>
     making the ventures which they otherwise 
     <lb/>
     would make. One of the strongest claims 
     <lb/>
     that we have heard put forward by hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite is that they should hold 
     <lb/>
     these lands in order that they may control 
     <lb/>
     the immigration policy. I submit that if 
     <lb/>
     there is one branch of the administration 
     <lb/>
     which these provinces should have in their 
     <lb/>
     own hands, it is immigration. We know 
     <lb/>
     that immigration may prove a curse or a 
     <lb/>
     blessing. If we have immigrants coming 
     <lb/>
     into this country who are not desirable, 
     <lb/>
     if we have a great many immigrants who 
     <lb/>
     will not make good citizens, who are phy<lb break="no"/>sically or otherwise unfit to undertake the 
     <lb/>
     duties of citizenship and who are not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to earn their own livelihood, then 
     <lb/>I say these immigrants will prove a curse 
     <lb/>rather than a blessing. It is a regrettable 
     <lb/>circumstance that we have had so many 
     <lb/>immigrants coming into this country who 
     <lb/>are utterly unfit to earn a livelihood. Many 
     <lb/>of them refuse to become citizens, and I 
     <lb/>submit that an immigrant, let him come 
     <lb/>from whatever country he may, if he is 
     <lb/>not prepared to become a full-fledged citi<lb break="no"/>zen and to fight the battles of this country 
     <lb/>if needs be, is not a person that any coun<lb break="no"/>try should desire to bring in. It is a re<lb break="no"/>markable fact that a large class of these 
     <lb/>immigrants have been brought into this 
     <lb/>country on more advantageous terms than 
     <lb/>those granted to settlers from eastern Can<lb break="no"/>ada. I presume that one of the reasons 
     <lb/>why such great interest is taken in this 
     <lb/>Bill in the eastern provinces is that the 
     <lb/>people residing in this part of the country 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BARR. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     have relatives in the west, that many of 
     <lb/>
     them have their sons and daughters up 
     <lb/>
     there, worthy sons of the noble sires of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, Quebec and the different provinces 
     <lb/>
     of this Dominion, but notwithstanding this 
     <lb/>
     fact foreigners and others have been ac<lb break="no"/>corded advantages which Canadian settlers 
     <lb/>
     cannot obtain in that new land. That is 
     <lb/>
     a state of affairs, which, I submit, should 
     <lb/>
     not exist. According to the returns of the 
     <lb/>
     last year, we brought into this country 
     <lb/>
     134,223 immigrants, of whom 17,055 were 
     <lb/>
     under twelve years of age. We paid for 
     <lb/>
     the inspection of these immigrants to medi<lb break="no"/>cal men, a total of $542,126, or $3.57 for the 
     <lb/>
     inspection of each immigrant. Yet, we all 
     <lb/>
     know that to-day there are hundreds and 
     <lb/>
     thousands physically unfit to make their 
     <lb/>
     living in this country, that they are a 
     <lb/>
     charge upon the Dominion or the province 
     <lb/>
     where they are, and we hear from the chari<lb break="no"/>table institutions all over this Dominion 
     <lb/>
     that the greater number of those for whom 
     <lb/>
     they have to provide are the immigrants 
     <lb/>
     that are brought into the country. We 
     <lb/>
     know that many of them are affected with 
     <lb/>
     contagious diseases, that many are affected 
     <lb/>
     with eye diseases, that they have had 
     <lb/>
     from infancy, and that if the medical ex<lb break="no"/>amination had been as thorough as it should 
     <lb/>
     have been, the state of affairs that we find 
     <lb/>
     in regard to immigration could not exist. 
     <lb/>
     Only a few were deported last year, prov<lb break="no"/>ing beyond a doubt that whilst we have 
     <lb/>
     paid large sums for the services of these 
     <lb/>
     medical inspectors, the examinations were 
     <lb/>
     not such as should have been made, and 
     <lb/>
     that those who to-day are imposing the 
     <lb/>
     greatest burden upon the charitable institu<lb break="no"/>tions are these immigrants. Under these 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, I submit we have a state 
     <lb/>
     of affairs which could not exist if the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces had supervision over these lands 
     <lb/>
     and of immigrant work, the provinces hav<lb break="no"/>ing much more interest in this work than 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion has. Under these circum<lb break="no"/>stances, I submit that it would be much 
     <lb/>
     better that they should have the lands. 
     <lb/>
     They could make more out of them and 
     <lb/>
     they could have settlers of a desirable class 
     <lb/>
     coming in under their supervision. Then, 
     <lb/>
     again, I submit that the land belongs to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces. It is true that the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada paid £300,000 for that country, 
     <lb/>
     not for the land, but for the right of the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson Bay Company to hunt. There<lb break="no"/>fore, I say that the land, as I read the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, should and does 
     <lb/>
     belong to the provinces. If the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces require all the land they can get in 
     <lb/>
     order to make ends meet, if they require 
     <lb/>
     money, and if they run in debt year after 
     <lb/>
     year, how is it that these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     with the amount of money which is to be 
     <lb/>
     placed at their disposal, will be able to im<lb break="no"/>prove that country as they should ? They 
     <lb/>
     have to provide charitable institutions for 
     <lb/>
     that unfortunate class that is rapidly in<lb break="no"/>creasing in all countries, the insane. They 
     <lb/>

     have to provide charitable institutions, they 
     <lb/>
     have to build roads and bridges and incur 
     <lb/>
     enormous expense, and with the money at 
     <lb/>
     their disposal it is utterly impossible for 
     <lb/>
     them to build up  that country as they 
     <lb/>
     should. If the province of Quebec is given 
     <lb/>
     its lands, why should not these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ?  By this Bill they have nothing un<lb break="no"/>der the land, they have nothing but the 
     <lb/>
     free air of heaven, and I suppose the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government would have grasped 
     <lb/>
     that too had it the power. Quebec has 
     <lb/>
     no surplus, but out of the lands of the 
     <lb/>
     province they are able to give to the parent 
     <lb/>
     of twelve children a bounty in land and 
     <lb/>
     money.

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. BARR. Very well.  We have never 
     <lb/>
     advanced that far in Ontario, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it would be worth while to offer that 
     <lb/>
     inducement because there would be very  
     <lb/>
     few to take advantage of it. Ontario has 
     <lb/>
     her lands, mines, and minerals and without 
     <lb/>
     them that province would have been starved  
     <lb/>
     years ago. Every year Ontario has found, 
     <lb/>
     it necessary to sell from her timber limits  
     <lb/>
     and her Crown lands and to obtain large  
     <lb/>
     sums out of her mines and minerals. Not<lb break="no"/>withstanding that so far as we in the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion during many years were concerned we  
     <lb/>
     never were able to find a surplus. It is true  
     <lb/>
     that the Liberal government always claimed  
     <lb/>
     they had a surplus, but that surplus was 
     <lb/>
      mythical as mythical could be, and when 
     <lb/>
     the books are now thoroughly audited it will  
     <lb/>
    be proved that not only has the province  
     <lb/>not a surplus, but that she is millions of dol<lb break="no"/>lars behind. What advantage is it for the  
     <lb/>new provinces to have borrowing powers if  
     <lb/>they have no security to offer ?  Had it not  
     <lb/>been that Ontario could obtain a revenue 
     <lb/>from her natural resources years ago that  
     <lb/> province would have been face to face with  
     <lb/> direct taxation which is the greatest calam<lb break="no"/>ity that could possibly happen to any people, 
     <lb/>province or country, and under this Bill that 
     <lb/>calamity is bound to overtake the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. Manitoba has control of her swamp 
     <lb/>lands which in time will become most pro<lb break="no"/>ductive, and from them she derives a large 
     <lb/>income. Why should Manitoba have the 
     <lb/>swamp lands and the new provinces be 
     <lb/>denied them ? I venture to say that in the 
     <lb/>near future these provinces will be found 
     <lb/>coming here demanding better terms and 
     <lb/>putting up such a strong case that better 
     <lb/>terms will have to be granted no matter 
     <lb/>what government is in power. At this late 
     <lb/>hour of the night I will not speak as long 
     <lb/>as I had intended, but I shall for a short 
     <lb/>time discuss that vexed question of separate 
     <lb/>schools in the new provinces, which is to-day 
     <lb/>agitating the mind of the people in this fair 
     <lb/>Dominion as no other question has for many 
     <lb/>years. It is a question which will live, 
     <lb/>and which will continue to increase in im<lb break="no"/>portance, at all events until free and in<lb break="no"/>dependent electors of Canada will have 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     125½ 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     an opportunity to make themselves heard 
     <lb/>
     on it. We have had the legal aspect of this 
     <lb/>
     question discussed day after day and while 
     <lb/>
     no definite decision has been arrived at, no<lb break="no"/>body will deny that if the government had 
     <lb/>
     not seen fit to insert the separate school 
     <lb/>
     clause, there would have been no agitation 
     <lb/>
     and the people of the new provinces could 
     <lb/>
     decide on the question according to the dic<lb break="no"/>tates of their conscience and in their own 
     <lb/>
     best interests. It is not necessary to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss here whether we are in favour of sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools or not. I am glad to say that 
     <lb/>
     I am in accord with a number of those on 
     <lb/>
     the other side of the House who have an<lb break="no"/>nounced that they are not in favour of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. The Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     has told us that he is opposed to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools ; the member for Edmonton told us, 
     <lb/>
     as he stated many times on the public plat<lb break="no"/>form that he was opposed to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. He is an old war horse who fought 
     <lb/>
     for provincial rights in the past, and who 
     <lb/>
     stated that he would never consent that sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools should be inflicted on the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, but now he has changed his 
     <lb/>
     mind, like many others, in order to save 
     <lb/>
     his party. For my part I would be sorry 
     <lb/>
     to deprive any people of their just rights, 
     <lb/>
     but the people of the new provinces them<lb break="no"/>selves know best what rights should be 
     <lb/>
     respected. It has been argued that because 
     <lb/>
     we have separate schools in Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     Ontario there should be separate schools 
     <lb/>
     in the new provinces, but let me point out 
     <lb/>
     that they have no separate schools in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land, Manitoba or British Columbia. We 
     <lb/>
     have Manitoba on the one side and British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia on the other, free to regulate 
     <lb/>
     their schools, and these two provinces 
     <lb/>
     wedged in between them, with separate 
     <lb/>
     schools forced upon them for all time to 
     <lb/>
     come—a state of affairs which I think never 
     <lb/>
     should have existed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         The difference  between the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in Ontario and Quebec and those in 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces in this. By the consent 
     <lb/>
     of both parties, by an agreement entered 
     <lb/>
     into by Quebec and Ontario, after due con<lb break="no"/>sideration, separate schools were establish<lb break="no"/>ed in those two provinces in perpetuity, and 
     <lb/>
     the government was embodied in the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. That is a very differ<lb break="no"/>ent position from the position occupied by 
     <lb/>
     these two provinces. When they obtained 
     <lb/>
     their territorial rights they were in their 
     <lb/>
     infancy; they were the wards of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government. They had no voice in 
     <lb/>
     the settlement of the school question at 
     <lb/>
     that time. The system was provided for in 
     <lb/>
     the Bill of 1875 after much discussion, both 
     <lb/>
     in this House and in the Senate. An amend  
     <lb/>
     ment was moved, I think by the late Sen<lb break="no"/>ator Aikens in the Senate, but was defeated 
     <lb/>
     by a small majority. It was then that those 
     <lb/>
     memorable words, of which so much has 
     <lb/>
     been made, were uttered by the Hon. George 
     <lb/>
     Brown, to the effect that in providing for 
     <lb/>

            <pb n="3931" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-05_Page_3931.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS 3932</fw>
            <p>
     separate schools in the Territorial Bill, they 
     <lb/>
     were establishing them for all time to come. 
     <lb/>
     He did not wish to imply that they would 
     <lb/>
     have to be placed there ; but, being a far<lb break="no"/>seeing man, he knew that the fact of that 
     <lb/>
     provision being made would be used for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of perpetuating separate schools in 
     <lb/>
     those provinces ; and it is well known that 
     <lb/>
     he was always opposed to separate schools. 
     <lb/>
     Now, what guarantee have we that the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in these two provinces will 
     <lb/>
     continue as they are at the present time ? 
     <lb/>
     I submit that we have no guarantee. We 
     <lb/>
     find that the provisions of the Bill are very 
     <lb/>
     hazy, so much so that lawyers might place 
     <lb/>
     very different interpretations upon it ; and 
     <lb/>
     the ordinances only guide the Territories, 
     <lb/>
     but do not ensure the schools as they now 
     <lb/>
     exist being continued for all time to come. 
     <lb/>
     While no great hardship may be experienced 
     <lb/>
     at the present time, it will certainly be a 
     <lb/>
     hardship to the majority in newly settled 
     <lb/>
     districts to maintain two weak and sickly 
     <lb/>
     schools where there might be one vigorous 
     <lb/>
     and healthy school. The Territories have 
     <lb/>
     no guarantee whatever that these schools 
     <lb/>
     will remain for all time to come as they are 
     <lb/>
     at the present time. I suppose they could 
     <lb/>
     change them for a system of schools similar 
     <lb/>
     to what exists in the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     to-day. According to a judgment given by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Justice McMahon some three months 
     <lb/>
     ago, there are one hundred and five teachers 
     <lb/>
     teaching in the separate schools of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     to-day who have never passed a legal ex<lb break="no"/>amination. This is a serious state of affairs; 
     <lb/>
     and yet these teachers are going on teach<lb break="no"/>ing month after month. It is true they have 
     <lb/>
     appealed the case to a higher court, and I 
     <lb/>
     suppose it will ultimately go to the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council. These teachers are now teaching 
     <lb/>
     contrary to the law, except that the late 
     <lb/>
     government gave them permits to teach un<lb break="no"/>til a decision of the higher court could be 
     <lb/>
     obtained. Many of these teachers are not 
     <lb/>
     educated. It is said that many of them are 
     <lb/>
     priests, who are educated ; but many are 
     <lb/>
     indies and others who have had no training 
     <lb/>
     whatever. The law with regard to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in Ontario has been changed in 
     <lb/>
     many ways. For instance. the law provides 
     <lb/>
     that all taxes paid by corporations must be 
     <lb/>
     used for the support of the public schools ; 
     <lb/>
     but a private Bill was passed providing that 
     <lb/>
     the Sturgeon Falls Pulp Company should 
     <lb/>
     divide its taxes between the public schools 
     <lb/>
     and the separate schools. If that state of 
     <lb/>
     affairs can be brought about in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario, why could it not in these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces ? The Minister of Customs en<lb break="no"/>deavoured to make a point against the gov» 
     <lb/>
     ernment of the Northwest Territories, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly against Mr. Haultain, when he 
     <lb/>
     used these words : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Talk about Mr. Haultain not having been con<lb break="no"/>sulted. He was consulted frequentlym but if he 
     <lb/>
     had never been consulted or if no Northwest 
     <lb/>
     member had ever been consulted, I ask what 
     <lb/>
     better indication can you have of the desire 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BARR. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     of the people of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     than their own legislation ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The legislation to which the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Customs referred was a law of the North<lb break="no"/>west council, of which Mr. Haultain was 
     <lb/>
     the head, particularly a law based on the 
     <lb/>
     school law which was handed down to 
     <lb/>
     them from this House. The law set forth 
     <lb/>
     that there should be an advisory board com<lb break="no"/>posed of not less than two Catholics and 
     <lb/>
     four Protestants. But it is only an advi<lb break="no"/>sory board : it is not clothed with any power 
     <lb/>
     except to advise the Minister of Education, 
     <lb/>
     and he can change the regulations at any 
     <lb/>
     time ; so that we might have a very different 
     <lb/>
    state of affairs in the near future from what 
     <lb/>we have at the present .time. To my mind 
     <lb/>it seems most extraordinary that the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) was 
     <lb/>not consulted and more extraordinary still 
     <lb/>that he himself did not make it a point to 
     <lb/>be present at the cabinet meetings when this 
     <lb/>matter was being decided. He well knew 
     <lb/>that these Bills were being prepared and 
     <lb/>he should have made it his duty to impress 
     <lb/>on his colleagues and the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man the necessity of having them passed 
     <lb/>upon by him before they were finally draft<lb break="no"/>ed. ln not taking this action, I submit he 
     <lb/>was recreant to his duty. 1 submit that he 
     <lb/>did not do what was expected of him by 
     <lb/>the people of the Northwest. It is indeed 
     <lb/>extraordinary that on the subcommittee of 
     <lb/>the cabinet which undertook to frame those 
     <lb/>Bills, there was only one representative 
     <lb/>from Ontario while there were three from 
     <lb/>Quebec. Mr. Haultain. the premier of the 
     <lb/>Territories was not consulted, and Mr. Ro<lb break="no"/>gers from Manitoba informed us to-day that 
     <lb/>neither was be consulted, and we must con<lb break="no"/>clude that it was decided by two or three 
     <lb/>representatives from Quebec that this clause 
     <lb/>No. l6 should be embodied in these Bills. 
     <lb/>It is evident that the First Minister took 
     <lb/>upon himself to bring down these Bills and 
     <lb/>force them through the House without con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>sultingr his colleagues, proving beyond doubt 
     <lb/>that we have to-day in this country a one 
     <lb/>man government. Let us for a moment look 
     <lb/>at the position occupied by this government 
     <lb/>today as compared with the one they took 
     <lb/>in 1896. In the election of 1896, the position 
     <lb/>I admit was a unique one. The late govern<lb break="no"/>ment was endeavouring to force on this 
     <lb/>House remedial legislation against the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba. The right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man. who was then leading the opposition, 
     <lb/>seized that opportunity to declare in the 
     <lb/>province of Quebec that if he were returned 
     <lb/>to power he would see that Manitoba gave 
     <lb/>the Catholic minority of that province what 
     <lb/>they desired. That was the stand taken by 
     <lb/>the Quebec wing of the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's party. but what did they do in the 
     <lb/>province of Ontario? In the elections in 
     <lb/>1896 in that province. I took a rather active 
     <lb/>part and had the pleasure of hearing the 
     <lb/>First Minister and the Postmaster General 
     <lb/>on several occasions, and the arrangement

     they entered into was this. The First Min<lb break="no"/>ister went up to the western part of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     and entered into an agreement with the late 
     <lb/>
     Sir Oliver Mowat to this effect, that if the 
     <lb/>
     Reform party were returned to power—and 
     <lb/>
     the signs of the times pointed that way— 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Mowat would resign his seat in the local 
     <lb/>
     cabinet and take office as Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice in the Dominion. Sir Oliver, being a 
     <lb/>
     canny Scotchman, was not going to take 
     <lb/>
     any chances and would not resign his pre<lb break="no"/>miership of Ontario until it was certain 
     <lb/>
     that the Liberals were returned to power in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion. Contrary to his protestations 
     <lb/>
     in the past, that the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     should not interfere in Dominion elections, 
     <lb/>
     Sir Oliver Mowat took a very active part 
     <lb/>
     in those elections, and I had the pleasure of 
     <lb/>
     meeting him on several platforms. The po<lb break="no"/>sition he then took was this. An effort, he 
     <lb/>
     said, is being made by the government of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion to force remedial legislation 
     <lb/>
     upon Manitoba to deprive that province of 
     <lb/>
     its rights, and I ask the electors of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     to look back at my past history and say 
     <lb/>
     whether I have not on all occasions stood for 
     <lb/>
     equal rights. Have I not, he exclaimed, 
     <lb/>
     fought the battle of equal rights in years 
     <lb/>
     gone by, have I not fought it in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the boundary award and the license 
     <lb/>
     question and fought it successfully. And 
     <lb/>
     just as I fought it in the past in the local 
     <lb/>
     legislature, so I shall, when I enter Domi<lb break="no"/>nion politics, fight for the rights. not only 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba but of all that great western 
     <lb/>
     country ; and he went on to declare that 
     <lb/>
     when in the near future the territories would 
     <lb/>
     be created provinces, he would see that equal 
     <lb/>
     rights were extended to them. He would 
     <lb/>
     never agree to separate schools or to reme<lb break="no"/>dial legislation for the purpose of forcing 
     <lb/>
     those schools upon Manitoba or any pro<lb break="no"/>vince in the great lone land. And if the 
     <lb/>
     time should ever come when he would not 
     <lb/>
     have that power, he would resign his place 
     <lb/>
     in the House. The Postmaster General took 
     <lb/>
     the same ground. He declared on many a 
     <lb/>
     platform that he would never support sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools in the Dominion and would 
     <lb/>
     never allow remedial degislation to be forced 
     <lb/>
     on Manitoba. The First Minister was also 
     <lb/>
     loud in his denunciation of the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment. He declared that he had stood in 
     <lb/>
     this House, and was prepared to stand in 
     <lb/>
     any part of the Dominion, for provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights, and that he would never allow this 
     <lb/>
     remedial legislation to be placed on Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. He would never shackle any pro<lb break="no"/>vince with legislation along that line. He 
     <lb/>
     would never put the fetters upon any of 
     <lb/>
     those provinces, he was opposed to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, he was pleased to know that they 
     <lb/>
     could attend school together, that they could 
     <lb/>
     go to the polls and vote together, and the 
     <lb/>
     result was that all these statements had 
     <lb/>
     their effect in Ontario. Seat after seat that 
     <lb/>
     had gone Conservative in the past went by 
     <lb/>
     overwhelming majorities to the Reform 
     <lb/>
     party and the result was that in 1896 the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Reformers were surprised at the large vote 
     <lb/>
     which they received in Ontario. They ob<lb break="no"/>tained it under false pretenses in the way 
     <lb/>
     which I have pointed out. I ask the ques<lb break="no"/>tion how have they been able to swallow 
     <lb/>
     all these principles, to swallow themselves 
     <lb/>
     and to come here to-day after making these 
     <lb/>
     pledges in Ontario and endeavour to force 
     <lb/>
     separate schools upon this province, although 
     <lb/>
     they are the very men who denounced them 
     <lb/>
     in the past. I wonder how they in ten years 
     <lb/>
     succeed in swallowing all these promises. 
     <lb/>
     I cannot understand it unless in the words 
     <lb/>
     of the poet : 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>An all-wise and ever-indulging Providence has 
     <lb/>made them hollow. 
     <lb/>In order that they their promises might swal<lb break="no"/>low. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>We have no separate schools in my county. 
     <lb/>We had them on one occasion but they have 
     <lb/>all disappeared. After a trial the Roman 
     <lb/>Catholics found that the public schools were 
     <lb/>much better and cheaper than the separate 
     <lb/>schools. It has been pointed out to us in 
     <lb/>the past that our public schools are Godless 
     <lb/>schools ; in fact some speakers almost seem 
     <lb/>to have the idea that as far as the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant religion is concerned there is no God 
     <lb/>in that. So far as our national schools are 
     <lb/>concerned they must remember that we had 
     <lb/>enacted the Ross Bible from which portions 
     <lb/>of scriptures were to be read each day. Re<lb break="no"/>ligious instruction can be given by Minis<lb break="no"/>ters of different denominations if they so 
     <lb/>desire and if the trustees and parents desire 
     <lb/>it and this is very often done. Under these 
     <lb/>circumstances I submit that it cannot be 
     <lb/>charged that these schools are Godless 
     <lb/>schools. So far as the county of Dufferin 
     <lb/>is concerned they do not want separate 
     <lb/>schools, and I venture to say that that is 
     <lb/>the case in many parts of the province as 
     <lb/>well. I have here a resolution which was 
     <lb/>passed in my county regretting that a pro<lb break="no"/>vision for separate schools was placed in 
     <lb/>this Bill. I have here also the statement 
     <lb/>of the Minister of Public Works for Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and I must say that it shows a most 
     <lb/>extraordinary state of affairs indeed. We 
     <lb/>find that in place of the First Minister meet<lb break="no"/>ing these delegates, as naturally we would 
     <lb/>expect, they were met by the Papal dele<lb break="no"/>gate. We have no objection to there being 
     <lb/>a Papa] delegate in the Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada so long as he confines his services to 
     <lb/>the work of the church, but just as soon 
     <lb/>as he interferes in our educational questions, 
     <lb/>then I say the line must be drawn and we 
     <lb/>have a right to take exception to his action. 
     <lb/>It has been going the rounds for many 
     <lb/>days that the Papal delegate met Mr. 
     <lb/>Rogers and Mr. Campbell by appointment 
     <lb/>and made a proposition to them. The pro<lb break="no"/>position was that they should place a clause 
     <lb/>in the Manitoba school law that where 
     <lb/>there were in a rural district fifteen 
     <lb/>Roman Catholic children or in a city or 
     <lb/>town thirty Roman Catholic children sep<lb break="no"/>arate rooms must be provided for them 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     and that the trustees if they so desired it 
     <lb/>
     must engage a teacher of their religious 
     <lb/>
     persuasion. Now look how that would work 
     <lb/>
     out; suppose there were sixty children in 
     <lb/>
     the district, then one-quarter of those 
     <lb/>
     would have one teacher and the other forty 
     <lb/>
     or forty-five would have one teacher, yet 
     <lb/>
     under that direction the trustees would be 
     <lb/>
     required to pay their equal share of taxes 
     <lb/>
     for the Catholic teacher who was only 
     <lb/>
     teaching fifteen children. I submit that 
     <lb/>
     this is a most unjust proposal and one that 
     <lb/>
     should not be entertained. If that meet<lb break="no"/>ing was not brought about I ask why the 
     <lb/>
     rumour has not been denied. I submit that 
     <lb/>
     it is up to His Excellency that he should 
     <lb/>
     set himself right upon it. Here are two 
     <lb/>
     men holding honourable positions, standing 
     <lb/>
     high in their province, men who have the 
     <lb/>
     confidence of their province, and they state 
     <lb/>
     distinctly that that meeting took place and 
     <lb/>
     that that proposition was made. Did the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister know about that meeting or 
     <lb/>
     did he not ? That is the question to be 
     <lb/>
     decided. If he did not know then I submit 
     <lb/>
     that the Papal delegate was going beyond 
     <lb/>
     his proper sphere in making that proposition 
     <lb/>
     and therefore taking it in any light you 
     <lb/>
     can it was an improper thing to do ; it was 
     <lb/>
     wrong to make the proposition. He told 
     <lb/>
     them according to this report that if they 
     <lb/>
     agreed to put this clause in, it would ex<lb break="no"/>pedite the enlargement of the province. 
     <lb/>
     What does that mean ? Does it not carry 
     <lb/>
     out the statements that have been made in 
     <lb/>
     the past over and over again that Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     need not expect any extension of territory 
     <lb/>
     unless she agreed to separate schools, and. 
     <lb/>
     here we have a proposition made that proves 
     <lb/>
     beyond a doubt that this was the case. I 
     <lb/>
     say again that we in this House object to 
     <lb/>
     any interference whatever in connection 
     <lb/>
     with church or state. We refuse to allow 
     <lb/>
     any foreign potentate to take any part in our 
     <lb/>
     legislation or to dictate how our children 
     <lb/>
     shall be educated in any part of this fair 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of ours. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now in this age of the world when church 
     <lb/>
     and state are being separated in France, 
     <lb/>
     we in Canada are binding them together. 
     <lb/>
     I submit that is a state of affairs that should 
     <lb/>
     not exist. It has been said that in the 
     <lb/>
     United States, because they have national 
     <lb/>
     schools where no religion is taught, the 
     <lb/>
     people have become unchristian, and we are 
     <lb/>
     pointed to the eastern countries where state 
     <lb/>
     church schools have existed for so long. I 
     <lb/>
     have travelled through those eastern coun<lb break="no"/>tries myself. I have seen the sun rise and 
     <lb/>
     set in many lands, and in travelling through 
     <lb/>
     them I have observed the way in which the 
     <lb/>
     Sabbath was kept. and have endeavoured to 
     <lb/>
     learn something of the results of the church 
     <lb/>
     schools which prevail there. I found that 
     <lb/>
     those eastern countries have not been going 
     <lb/>
     ahead as the United States has. Spain has 
     <lb/>
     had church schools for centuries, and to<lb break="no"/>day Spain is one of the dying nations of 
     <lb/>
     the world. France has had church schools, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. BARR. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     and to-day she is severing all connection 
     <lb/>
     between church and state, and as a result 
     <lb/>
     of establishing national schools I believe 
     <lb/>
     we will see France rise amongst the na<lb break="no"/>tions of the world. It is true that in the 
     <lb/>
     United States where there are no separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, there are divorce laws, and lynch<lb break="no"/>ings and many other problems that are 
     <lb/>
     difficult to solve ; nevertheless the United 
     <lb/>
     States stands to-day among the foremost 
     <lb/>
     nations of the world. As regards Sabbath 
     <lb/>
     observance, it is in those countries where 
     <lb/>
     church schools prevail that you will find the 
     <lb/>
     Sabbath most generally violated, theatre 
     <lb/>
     going and all kinds of amusements are car<lb break="no"/>ried on on that day. If you want to find a 
     <lb/>
     Christian nation you will find one that ob<lb break="no"/>serves the Sabbath. Where will you find 
     <lb/>
     the Sabbath as well observed as it is in 
     <lb/>
     this fair Dominion of ours ? You will find 
     <lb/>
     it observed just as well in those provinces 
     <lb/>
     that have national schools as in those that 
     <lb/>
     have separate schools. I am not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     say that there is any difference. But 1 think 
     <lb/>
     we can boast that we have a Christian peo<lb break="no"/>ple in this Dominion, who observe the Sab<lb break="no"/>bath better than in any other country in 
     <lb/>
     the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Therefore, I say, that in building up this 
     <lb/>
     great country we are making history, and! 
     <lb/>
     we must carefully procure the greatest free<lb break="no"/>dom to the greatest number of people. We 
     <lb/>
     must give those new provinces provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights, we must give them all the freedom 
     <lb/>
     they have a right to expect at our hands. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, the time will come, whether it is this 
     <lb/>
     year or next year, when the free and in<lb break="no"/>dependent electors of this Dominion will 
     <lb/>
     assert themselves. We have seen petitions 
     <lb/>
     coming from every part of this Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     the table has groaned beneath their weight. 
     <lb/>
     We have seen public meetings passing resol- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ntions in almost every province in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, protesting against forcing separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools upon these new provinces. There 
     <lb/>
     is an awakening amongst the free and 
     <lb/>
     independent electors such as never existed in 
     <lb/>
     this Dominion before, and it will go on 
     <lb/>
     and increase. Exception has been taken to 
     <lb/>
     the petitions that have been presented and 
     <lb/>
     to the public meetings that have been held. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, that is the only way in which the 
     <lb/>
     people can express their opinions when 
     <lb/>
     no election is going on, it is only by peti<lb break="no"/>tions and by public meetings passing reso<lb break="no"/>lutions that they can make their voice heard. 
     <lb/>
     Then we find that the newspapers from one 
     <lb/>
     end of this Dominion to the other, except 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec, have condemned 
     <lb/>
     this legislation. The 'Globe,' the organ of 
     <lb/>
     the Reform party, is just as strong on this 
     <lb/>
     question as the Conservative newspapers. 
     <lb/>
     I venture to say that if we could have now 
     <lb/>
     an expression of opinion at the polls, we 
     <lb/>
     would find Reformers and Conservatives go<lb break="no"/>ing to the polls side by side and shoulder 
     <lb/>
     to shoulder in every constituency in Ontario, 
     <lb/>

     three years, or four years from now, this

     so far as the province of Ontario is con 
     <lb/>
     cerned, even four years from now, this

     government will not carry half a dozen

     Manitoba and in those two new provinces. 
     <lb/>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     1. How many extradition cases, demanded by

     the United States, have come, during the past

     eighteen months, before the extradition com<lb break="no"/>missioner in the district of Montreal ?

            <p>
     2. What decision was given in each case ?

            </p>

            <p>
     3. Before which commissioner or judge did the

     said extradition cases come, and by which were 
     <lb/>
     they decided upon ?

            <p>
     Hon. CHAS. FITZPATRICK (Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice) : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     1. Five extradition cases demanded by the 
     <lb/>
     United States have come, during the past 
     <lb/>
     eighteen months, before the Extradition 
     <lb/>
     Commissioners in the district of Montreal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. In four cases the prisoner was com<lb break="no"/>mitted to await extradition ; one case (Gay- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     nor and Greene) is still sub judice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     GAYNOR-GREENE EXTRADITION. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BERGERON—by Mr. Taylor—asked : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     1. Is the government aware that, during the 
     <lb/>
     extradition proceedings against John F. Gaynor 
     <lb/>
     and Benjamin D. Greene, a recusation for al<lb break="no"/>leged reasons was taken against Mr. Ulric La- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     fontaine, the extradition commissioner ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. 1f so, what course does the government 
     <lb/>
     purpose taking in regard to the said recusation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Hon. CHAS. FITZPATRICK (Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice) : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     1. It is a matter of public notoriety, 
     <lb/>
     through the newspapers, that in the extradi<lb break="no"/>tion proceedings against John F. Gaynor 
     <lb/>
     and Benjamin D. Greene, 21 paper called a 
     <lb/>
     'recusation' was filed against Mr. Lafon- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     taine, the Extradition Commissioner; but 
     <lb/>
     the government has no official notice of 
     <lb/>
     any such proceeding. The question of the 
     <lb/>
     magistrate's competency is now before the 
     <lb/>
     courts for judicial determination. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. When the matter is officially before the 
     <lb/>
     government, it will be time to say what 
     <lb/>
     course the government propose taking in 
     <lb/>
     regard to it.

     On the Orders of the Day being called, 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. R. L. BORDEN (Carleton, Ont). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, before the Orders of the Day are 
     <lb/>
     called, I would like to say a few words 
     <lb/>
     with respect to a matter that was mentioned 
     <lb/>
     in the House yesterday. Let me, in the first 
     <lb/>
     place, speak of the letter of February 23rd, 
     <lb/>
     which evidently was not received by the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister. May I be permitted to 
     <lb/>
     say that I understood from the remarks of 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister yesterday that there 
     <lb/>
     was rather a reflection on Mr. Rogers in the 
     <lb/>
     suggestion that the letter had not been re<lb break="no"/>ceived. I rather gathered that the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister had some doubts as to whether or 
     <lb/>
     not the letter was written. Perhaps I mis<lb break="no"/>understood the right hon. gentleman, but 
     <lb/>
     it is, I think, right to say that very ample 
     <lb/>
     evidence was forthcoming of the writing 
     <lb/>
     and of the sending of the letter, and while 
     <lb/>
     we at once accept most unreservedly the 
     <lb/>
     statement of the Prime Minister that he 
     <lb/>
     (lid not receive it, still I would think that, 
     <lb/>
     under the circumstances, it would be a per<lb break="no"/>fectly proper thing to include that letter in 
     <lb/>
     the correspondence which is about to be 
     <lb/>
     printed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Since the discussion of yesterday a state<lb break="no"/>ment has been made by His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     Monseigneur Sbarretti. I will come to that 
     <lb/>
     a little later on. Let me say that I know 
     <lb/>
     nothing of the circumstances under which 
     <lb/>
     a delegate of the Holy See was in the first 
     <lb/>
     place brought to this country beyond what 
     <lb/>
     has been stated by gentlemen on the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the House, who are well qualified to 
     <lb/>
     make such statements, because they have 
     <lb/>
     personal knowledge of that which they 
     <lb/>
     state. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I gather from them the Delegate Apos<lb break="no"/>tolic came to this country in 1897, not at 
     <lb/>
     the instance of the bishops of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic church in Canada, but at the in<lb break="no"/>stance of some forty Liberal members of 
     <lb/>
     parliament who are members of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic church. I understand that there 
     <lb/>
     was no demand for the appointment of a 
     <lb/>
     delegate by the bishops or clergy. In mak<lb break="no"/>ing that statement, of course, I rely entirely 
     <lb/>
