               I have detained the House with the cor-

               respondence at this length principally for 
               <br />
               these reasons: In the ﬁrst place, to show 
               <br />
               that this has been a live question in 
               <br />
               the North-west Territories since the year 
               <br />
               1900 at least; in the second place, to 
               <br />
               show that it has been the subject of con- 
               <br />
               siderable correspondence between the terri-

               <br />
               a sub-committee of the Privy Council has 
               <br />
               been appointed to deal with it. and that re-

               presentatives of the territorial government 
               <br />
               have conferred with that committee; in the 
               <br />
               third place, to show the reasons on account 
               <br />
               of which this government has declined to 
               <br />
               act upon the memorial twice forwarded to 
               <br />
               His Excellency by the legislature of the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories, urging upon this 
               <br />
               government that provincial status should be 
               <br />
               granted; and in the fourth place, to prove 
               <br />
               by the statement of the Prime Minister of 
               <br />

               <br />
               lution passed by its legislature that the 
               <br />
               people of the North-west Territories are 
               <br />
               almost unanimous in their demand that the 
               <br />
               provincial status should be granted to them.

               I shall deal very brieﬂy—because I 
               <br />
               have taken up the time of the House 
               <br />
               longer than I intended—I shall deal very 
               <br />
               brieﬂy with some of the objections which 
               <br />
               have been raised against granting a 
               <br />
               provincial status to the territories. In 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place, there is the objection 
               <br />
               which has been already adverted to in 
               <br />
               the letters of Mr. Haultain, that the popu- 
               <br />
               lation of the territories is increasing at a 
               <br />
               more rapid rate than the population of the 
               <br />
               older provinces. I say, as I have several 
               <br />
               times before said in this House, and as Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain has said in his correspondence, that 
               <br />
               if this is to debar the North-west Territo- 
               <br />
               ries from obtaining a provincial status, then 
               <br />
               we must deprive them of provincial status 
               <br />
               during the next ten or ﬁfteen years. That 
               <br />
               reason would deprive them of a provincial 
               <br />
               status after they have a population of a 
               <br />
               million people—after they have a population 
               <br />
               three or four times, possibly ﬁve or six 
               <br />
               times, that of some of the provinces of 
               <br />
               Canada which have enjoyed representative 
               <br />
               institutions for many years.

               In the next place, the objection was made 
               <br />
               —it was made by my hon. friend the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior last year, and I think 
               <br />
               also in some of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> correspondence—that 
               <br />
               with a continually increasing population it

               at our hands '2 I do not conceal from my- 
               <br />
               self that the question is attended with dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculties; but I suppose that almost every 
               <br />
               question of this kind is attended with some 
               <br />
               difﬁculties. The confederation of this Do- 
               <br />
               minion was not unattended with difﬁculties. 
               <br />
               On the contrary, it was accompanied with 
               <br />
               difﬁculties tenfold greater than any of those 
               <br />
               which in the present case are considered 
               <br />
               so formidable. Those diﬁiculties _were 
               <br />

               the wisdom of the men who undertook 
               <br />
               to grapple with those difﬁculties; and 
               <br />
               all we require. it seems to me, is a

               certain amount of courage and capacity to
