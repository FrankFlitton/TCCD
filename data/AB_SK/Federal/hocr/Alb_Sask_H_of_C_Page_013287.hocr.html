               English. But, as you know, the moneys voted 
               <br />
               for the North-West government were voted in a 
               <br />
               lump sum, and as the country settled up it was 
               <br />
               necessary that public works should be constructed, 
               <br />
               and it was found necessary to use all the available 
               <br />
               money we could possibly get on the public works. 
               <br />
               Up to 1885, although the ordinances had been 
               <br />
               printed in French, there were virtually very few 
               <br />
               applications made to me or to my ofﬁcers for copies 
               <br />
               of the French ordinances. In that or the subsequent 
               <br />
               year, on account of the demand made upon me for 
               <br />
               moneys for public works, I neglected to have those 
               <br />
               ordinances printed in French, but in 1887, when I 
               <br />
               found a demand was being made for those 
               <br />
               ordinances, and ﬁnding that I had not the 
               <br />
               money with which to have them printed, I came 
               <br />
               down to this honorable House and asked for a vote 
               <br />
               for the purpose of having them printed in French. 
               <br />
               This House voted the sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3,000</span> for that pur- 
               <br />
               pose. Let me here call the attention of the House 
               <br />
               to a remark which was made by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Victoria (Mr. Barron), where he stated that he 
               <br />
               was informed by Mr. Cayley, one of the members 
               <br />
               of the North-VVest Council, which is now the 
               <br />
               North-VVest Assembly, that while in 1883, I think 
               <br />
               he said, the cost of printing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> 
               <br />
               ordinances was only some $300, in 1887 it cost 
               <br />
               $1,000 for printing in French and $1,000 for trans- 
               <br />
               lation. Well, Sir, Mr. Cayley was a member of 
               <br />
               my Council before it became a Legislative As— 
               <br />
               sembly, and he ought to have known that the 
               <br />
               reason of the large expenditure of 1887 was that 
               <br />
               the money was voted in this House to print the 
               <br />
               ordinances which I neglected to have printed in 
               <br />
               1885 and in 1886. I had in my hands a day or 
               <br />
               two ago a statement of the cost of printing those 
               <br />
               ordinances, and it corresponded with the state- 
               <br />
               ment made by the Minister of Public Works that 
               <br />
               since 1881 the average expense was $400 or $500 a 
               <br />
               year.

               <br />
               account of my neglecting to publish them in 1884— 
               <br />
               85. Not only did I publish the ordinances of 
               <br />
               those two years and those of the year in which the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Journals of the House, which had never before 
               <br />
               been published in French, published from the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               year of Mr. Laird’s appointment as Lieutenant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gov-</span> 
               <br />
               ernor up to the time I left the Territories. I believe 
               <br />
               they will prove interesting in the future, in the 
               <br />
               same way as the old Journals of Ontario and Que- 
               <br />
               bec are interesting to me whenever I look over 
               <br />
               them. So when I left the Territories the whole of 
               <br />
               the ordinances up to that time were printed in 
               <br />
               French, and also the Journals of the House. I 
               <br />
               think I may claim to be able to speak with author- 
               <br />
               ity with respect to the sentiments of the people 
               <br />
               of that country in respect to this matter. During 
               <br />
               the ten years I lived in the North-W'est Territories 
               <br />
               I never, on one single occasion that I recollect, 
               <br />
               heard any' objection to the printing of the ordi- 
               <br />
               nances in French, except an occasional remark that 
               <br />
               it would be as well if we spent the money on public 
               <br />
               works instead of on printing French ordinances, as

               the demand for those ordinances was very small. 
               <br />
               These observations were made at the time when 
               <br />
               farmers coming in from the north and south of the 
               <br />
               railway were often obliged to unload part of their 
               <br />
               loads, and go back for the part so left, before they 
               <br />
               could reach the railway. Every one, however, 
               <br />
               knows the difﬁculties experienced in a new country ; 
               <br />
               but those were the only remarks I heard men- 
               <br />
               tioned in regard to the printing of the French 
               <br />
               ordinances. I have also, since the gentlemen who 
               <br />
               constitute the present Legislative Assembly were 
               <br />
               returned, run an election myself. I have also 
               <br />
               travelled through the country, and as late as last 
               <br />
               year I travelled through it from one end to the 
               <br />
               other. I followed in the wake of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), 
               <br />
               and I must say that from one end to the 
               <br />
               other there was no indication of any excite- 
               <br />
               ment on this question. Perhaps the House will 
               <br />
               permit me to give my opinion with respect to the 
               <br />
               population in the N orth-VVest to-day. One-third 
               <br />
               of the people in the Territories comprise Ontario 
               <br />
               farmers and Ontario settlers ; the balance is made 
               <br />
               up of English or old country settlers, French, 
               <br />
               German and other nationalities. I think very 
               <br />
               likely among the Ontario settlers there may be 
               <br />
               some who fought this battle over before in their 
               <br />
               younger days, and have strong feelings on the 
               <br />
               subject ; but I do not believe that feeling exists to 
               <br />
               any great extent among that class. The old coun- 
               <br />
               try settlers rank next in number to those from 
               <br />
               Ontario, and I believe not seventy—ﬁve per cent. of 
               <br />
               them ever heard of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               or of the Manitoba Act, and the bulk of them do 
               <br />
               not know of the clause in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> Terri- 
               <br />
               tories Act providing that the ordinances and pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings shall be printed in the two languages. 
               <br />
               But I can understand that interested parties, those 
               <br />
               who within the last few weeks have taken a great 
               <br />
               interest in this question and are engaged in getting 
               <br />
               up the petitions to send down to this House stating 
               <br />
               their views should go to those ignorant people, ignor- 
               <br />
               ant so far as this matter is concerned, and obtain their 
               <br />
               signatures to petitions asking that money should 
               <br />
               not be wasted on the printing of French ordinances, 
               <br />
               but should be spent on useful work in other direc- 
               <br />
               tions. But, I believe, if I know what British fair 
               <br />
               play is and how Englishmen feel on such matters, 
               <br />
               that these same men, if they had heard the s eech 
               <br />
               of my hon. colleague on Tuesday night, woul say : 
               <br />
               “ This is a small matter ; let the French have the 
               <br />
               records printed in their own language.” With <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re‘</span> 
               <br />
               gard to the other nationalities, I may say there are 
               <br />
               a large number of Germans. On my visit last 
               <br />
               summer to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vhitewood</span> I was invited to meet a lot 
               <br />
               of settlers who had established themselves 16 miles 
               <br />
               north of that place. Many came out to meet me, 
               <br />
               and I found in two townships, Nos. 18 and 19 on 
               <br />
               Ranges 1, 2 and 3, the people were representatives 
               <br />
               of nine nationalities—Bohemians, Norwegians, 
               <br />
               Danes, Slavonians, Polish, Swedes, French and 
               <br />
               English. My opinion is that when we invite foreign- 
               <br />
               ers to come to our country we should endeavor to 
               <br />
               allow them, whether English, French, Germans or 
               <br />
               other nationalities, to have the laws under which 
               <br />
               they live printed in their own language, especially 
               <br />
               the school ordinances and laws of that character. I 
               <br />
               should like to say a word or two in regard 
               <br />
               to the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy). I can echo the sentiments expressed 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for N orthumberland (Mr. 
               <br />
