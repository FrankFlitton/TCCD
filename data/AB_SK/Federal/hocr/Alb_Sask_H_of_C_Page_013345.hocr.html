               accepted by those who had the Bill in charge ; 
               <br />
               and the Bill which now comes before this House 
               <br />
               is, consequently, without such provision. Out of 
               <br />
               22 members composing the North-West Council, 
               <br />
               as I have said, not one belonged either to the 
               <br />
               French nationality, or even to the Catholic religion, 
               <br />
               although 0ne~ﬁfth of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> is French. 
               <br />
               The population of the N orth-West Territories, ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the last census, was 22,000 or 27,000 
               <br />
               inhabitants, out of which 4,800 were of French 
               <br />
               origin, and these people, asI repeat, are without 
               <br />
               representation in the North—VVest Assembly. 
               <br />
               Before this Bill is adopted by the House, I hope 
               <br />
               that such an amendment as will rectify this state 
               <br />
               of affairs will be incorporated. When a Constitu- 
               <br />
               tion was given to the Province of Quebec, at Confe- 
               <br />
               deration, the framers were very careful to set apart 
               <br />
               a certain number of counties which were called the 
               <br />
               English counties ; and by the Constitution, the 
               <br />
               Legislature of the Province of Quebec could not 
               <br />
               interfere with the limits of these counties, so that 
               <br />
               the Protestant minority of the Province would 
               <br />
               have their representatives, and would thus be pro— 
               <br />
               tected against the majority. I say that this was well 
               <br />
               done. Although there was no danger, still it was 
               <br />
               right, I believe, that the minority should be pro— 
               <br />
               tected against the majority. If we had this pro- 
               <br />
               tection in the Province of Manitoba, we would not 
               <br />
               have had to regret the legislation recently adopted 
               <br />
               in that Province. I maintain that it is within 
               <br />
               our duty, as representatives of the people here, to 
               <br />
               see that the minority is protected in the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">VVest</span> Territories, as it is in the Province of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba by the Constitution, and as the Protestant and 
               <br />
               English minority of the Province of Quebec is also 
               <br />
               protected by the Constitution. I repeat expressing 
               <br />
               the hope that, before this Bill is put through all its 
               <br />
               stages in this House, such provision will be incor- 
               <br />
               porated as shall protect the minority of the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">VVest</span> Territories, as far as their right to fair repre- 
               <br />
               sentation at least, is concerned.

               Mr. MCCARTHY. I agree with a great deal 
               <br />
               which has been said by my hon. friend from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\N’est</span> 
               <br />
               Durham (Mr. Blake), but I do not think he has 
               <br />
               quite stated the law ; he has not stated it, at all 
               <br />
               events, as I understand it. The difﬁculty with the 
               <br />
               North-\Vest Territories is, that the Advisory Coun- 
               <br />
               cil is not responsible as a Government would be ; 
               <br />
               although it is stated that the Lieutenant Governor 
               <br />
               has to consult the Advisory Council with regard to 
               <br />
               the expenditure of moneys. It is a hybrid system. 
               <br />
               It is neither a system of responsible government, 
               <br />
               such as we are accustomed to understand it, nor is 
               <br />
               it a system by which the Executive—that is, the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant Governor of the North-VVest Territories 
               <br />
               ——is responsible, and, I suppose, solely responsible to 
               <br />
               his ofﬁcial head. But I think the hon. member for 
               <br />
               West Durham (Mr. Blake) was wrongin this respect. 
               <br />
               As I understand the effect of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendment»</span> now 
               <br />
               proposed, it is this : that in addition to the moneys

               which the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Vest</span> vote them-

               selves, and which, according to the present practice, 
               <br />
               they are supposed to have control over ; they are 
               <br />
               to have control over such further sums of money, 
               <br />

               any responsibility, is, as I conceive, the result of 
               <br />
               the present scheme; the Lieutenant Governor is

               not responsible, as the hon. gentleman pointed

               <br />
               is a most unfortunate condition of things, and I 
               <br />
               join with the hon. gentlemen of the Opposition in 
               <br />
               thinking that, if the day has not come, it is fast

               approaching, when responsible government might

               <br />
               degree at all events. I do not mean to say that 
               <br />
               we should give them control of the public lands, 
               <br />
               but I believe that responsible government might 
               <br />
               well be given in a very large degree to the people of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“vest</span> Territories. A Bill of a similar 
               <br />
               nature to this is now before the British Parliamene 
               <br />

               population there is 65,000 only—not so much at 
               <br />
               the population of the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth-W'est</span> Territories, 
               <br />
               if my memory serves me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rightmthe</span> Imperial 
               <br />
               Government have introduced a Bill proposing 
               <br />
               to confer on West Australia responsible govern-

               ment, though not giving them absolute control 
               <br />
               over the great public lands of that country. With 
               <br />
               that exception, I do not know why our North— 
               <br />
               VVest Territories, with 100,000 inhabitants, as, 
               <br />
               I think, they claim themselves to he, should not 
               <br />
               be entrusted with responsible government. instead 
               <br />
               of the extraordinary system which is perpetuated 
               <br />
               to some extent by this measure. Any one who 
               <br />
               reads the difﬁculties of the last session of the 
               <br />
               North-VVest Assembly will see how important it 
               <br />
               is in the interests of that country that this ques- 
               <br />
               tion should be settled, and settled promptly. \Ve 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that in the early days of the last meeting of 
               <br />
               the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Haultain’s Admin- 
               <br />
               istration resigned, because the Lieutenant Gover- 
               <br />
               nor declined to account for the expenditure which 
               <br />
               had been voted by the Assembly the preceding 
               <br />
               session. Then we ﬁnd, that a new Advisory Board 
               <br />
               having been selected, the Council promptly voted 
               <br />
               want of conﬁdence in them, and the Advisory Board 
               <br />
               having refused to resign on account of that, the 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly refused to vote money which 
               <br />
               had been recommended by the Lieutenant Governor. 
               <br />
               There is a deadlock; it is a deadlock that thls 
               <br />
               measure is certainly not going to get rid of in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.any</span> 
               <br />
               way ; the same difﬁculty will arise next sessmn ; 
               <br />
               and I really think that when the Bill is before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us,</span> 
               <br />
               some more adequate provision should be made for 
               <br />
               getting rid of a difﬁculty which is calculated to

               <br />
               I notice, too—though it is perhaps not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intentional~</span> 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of the Bill is rather to limit the 
               <br />
               authority of the Legislative Assembly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the
