               much for the general question. Now, in regard to

               the particular question of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“est,</span> it is the

               <br />
               the North-\Vest you have a country that can 
               <br />
               sustain a hundred million people. and that country, 
               <br />

               <br />
               secured. I ask, therefore, that the Government here 
               <br />
               should give the little Government of the North-

               <br />
               well as for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorthlVest.</span> All the other pro-

               without increasing in population, then failure will

               <br />
               on immigration to the North-West. Think 
               <br />
               of our vast harvest of last year ; how much

               and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meeting</span> their bills, are the people of the

               the Hovermnent have already done their part;

               this House. is the master question for Canada. It 
               <br />
               is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> to which the statesmen desiring to 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">energy</span> ; and instead of frittering away our time 
               <br />
               and spending a few thousand dollars a year upon
