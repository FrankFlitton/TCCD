               is unnecessary to promote immigration to that

               The 11011. First Minister warned us of the terrible 
               <br />
               consequences of drawing up two races against 
               <br />
               each other. He said this was a question which 
               <br />
               could afford to wait, and a moment afterwards 
               <br />
               he said : For Heaven’s sake, bury this and get 
               <br />
               it out of sight. It is certainly lamentable that 
               <br />
               two races should be drawn up against one 
               <br />
               another ; but, if one race is drawn up, if that 
               <br />
               race is acting and aiming at a common purpose, 
               <br />
               it may become necessary to have some organ-

               claims and to stand by their own interests. It may 
               <br />
               be necessary to watch the opposite party, because

               <br />
               lack judiciousness. My hon. friend from West 
               <br />
               Ontario (Mr. Edgar), for instance, warned the 
               <br />
               French to beware of their enemies. Who are 
               <br />
               their enemies? I deny that they have an enemy 
               <br />
               in this House, or in this country, or that any de-

               mand is made in this Bill which indicates enmity 
               <br />
               to the French race in this Dominion. The hon. mem-

               <br />
               temperate speech, spoke of the demagogues, whose

               designs were to provoke dissension and disaster.

               institutions for the future of a great country ? If 
               <br />
               there is an actwhich is worthy of being characterised

               my observation in this Parliament of Canada, it is 
               <br />
               an act of that character. Then the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
