               This is one of the most burning questions of the North- 
               <br />
               West. The people should be allowed to decide whether 
               <br />
               they would have free whiskey 0r high license, or have the

               brought into the country, and the Government derive no

               <br />
               are in Calgary to-day not less than 25 saloons selling 
               <br />
               liquor. Neither the town of' Calgary nor the Dominion 
               <br />
               Government derive any revenue from that sale. It will be 
               <br />
               asked, where does the liquor come from? It comes from 
               <br />
               British Columbia, Manitoba and Montana. Under these 
               <br />
               Circumstances, it would be better if the people of the 
               <br />
               North-West were allowed to havea vote on this subject, 
               <br />
               or at least be placed on the same footing as the peeple 
               <br />
               in other portions of the Dominion, so that they could pass 
               <br />
               the Scott Act or not as they desired. It is certain that you 
               <br />
               can never prohibit the sale of liquor in the N orth-West as 
               <br />

               <br />
               member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin). It is asked 
               <br />
               that the sum of $15,000 be placed at the disposal of 
               <br />
               the Territories, and this would be a mere drop in the bucket 
               <br />
               as compared with other expenses that are going on, and it 
               <br />
               would beneﬁt the country tenfold. The next resolution 
               <br />
               deals with the subject of the settlers being allowed to use 
               <br />
               dry wood for fuel. That, I believe, has been already 
               <br />
               arranged, and I have simply to say that the people of the 
               <br />
               North West should be allowed to burn up the dry wood that 
               <br />
               is going to waste without paying revenue to the Dominion. 
               <br />
               There is anciher question [wish to urge upon the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Inland Revenue, and that is the appointment of a 
               <br />
               hide inspector at McLeod and Calgary. At the present 
               <br />
               time when so many cattle are being shipped out of the 
               <br />
               country, it has become very important that all the hides 
               <br />
               should be inspected before the cattle leave the country. 
               <br />
               Even if a man kills meat on the prairie he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shculd</span> be com- 
               <br />
               pelled to bring in the hides, so that it would be known 
               <br />
               whether he had killed his own animals or those of his 
               <br />
               neighbors. The cost would be but very light and it could 
               <br />
               easily be paid out of the revenue. by simply putting a fee

               were settled with they moved to the North-West. Those 
               <br />
               people were not settled with until <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1885</span> and then only those 
               <br />
               who were included in the Treaty of 1870 had their claims 
               <br />
               met by the Government, leaving the children born between 
               <br />
               1870 and 1885 out of the treaty. There is no reason in the 
               <br />
               world why those children should not receive the same 
               <br />
               beneﬁts as the other so long as their title is not extinguished. 
               <br />
               If the Government had paid eveiyone of them in 1870 
               <br />
               there would probably have been no rebellion in 1885. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.I</span> 
               <br />
               would strongly recommend to the Government that this 
               <br />
               matter should be attended to at once and that the claims of 
               <br />
               those excluded from the treaties should be considered in the 
               <br />
               same way as the claims of the others, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vin,</span> by a commission 
               <br />
               of the judges of the North-West Territories. The Assembly 
               <br />
               also recommends:

               They also recommend that the North—West Mounted Police, 
               <br />
               Who rendered valuable services during the rebellion, should 
               <br />
               be rewarded. 1 think that this is a very fair request to make 
               <br />
               to the Government. There is not the slightest doubt that 
               <br />
               any one who acted as a scout duiing the rebellion, as well 
               <br />
               as the members of the Nerth-West Mounted Police force 
               <br />
               should receive the same compensation as others. They are 
               <br />
               certainly better entitled to recognition at the hands of the 
               <br />
               Government than many of those who received it. I cannot 
               <br />
               see why the scouts and the Mounted Police should not be 
               <br />
               treated the same as the militia and volunteer forces. They 
               <br />
               did as good work as any of the others, and they should
