               <br />

               <br />
               to do by this Bill. I may say also that it was not 
               <br />
               because the English population was fairly large 
               <br />
               that so much care was taken of Canada at this time ;

               Well, Mr. Speaker, as we see when those pre- 
               <br />
               cautions were taken, about which I spoke a few 
               <br />
               moments ago, it was not merely in order to pro- 
               <br />
               tect the English minority, because Gen. Carleton 
               <br />
               answers that the English population which dwelt 
               <br />
               in Canada at that period was far from being in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuential and important. But if at that time there 
               <br />
               were men of elevated views, practical men, who 
               <br />
               asked that the people of the Province of Quebec 
               <br />
               might be placed on a footing of equality with the 
               <br />
               other British subjects ; there were also at that 
               <br />
               time, men of narrow minds, men wishing to excite 
               <br />
               prejudices, as there exist such at the present day. 
               <br />
               I discovered while making the researches, which I 
               <br />
               have given to the House, a remarkable incident 
               <br />
               which I must relate. There happened to live, at 
               <br />
               the time in question, a certain Richard VVhitworth, 
               <br />
               who was probably one of the political ancestors of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Simcoe, if one may 
               <br />
               judge from his remarks. The House of Commons 
               <br />
               had returned from the House of Lords, where they 
               <br />
               had attended to hear the sanction of the Bills. 
               <br />
               These are the words, which I again borrow from 
               <br />
               the history of England :
