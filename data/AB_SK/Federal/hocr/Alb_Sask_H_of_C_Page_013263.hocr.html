               <br />
               House to a reply given by the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man the leader of the Government a few days ago, 
               <br />
               to the member for Northumberland (Mr. Mitchell), 
               <br />
               When he stated that the matter of the Behring Sea 
               <br />
               ﬁshery negotiations was then under consideration 
               <br />
               at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W’ashington.</span> On a subsequent occasion, in 
               <br />
               reply to an enquiry of my own respecting the 
               <br />
               modus <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">m'vendi,</span> the hon. gentleman stated that both 
               <br />
               the Behring Sea ﬁshery question and the question 
               <br />
               of the ﬁsheries generally, were under consideration 
               <br />
               at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W’ashington</span> between the British Minister and 
               <br />
               the United States Government. Now, this is a 
               <br />
               question in which the people of the Dominion 
               <br />
               naturally feel a very great interest, and, therefore, 
               <br />
               I would ask the right hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> whether, in 
               <br />
               view of the negotiations which he has announced 
               <br />
               are proceeding at Washington, it is the purpose of 
               <br />
               the Government to have a representative of Canada 
               <br />
               at Washington to look after Canadian interests, as 
               <br />
               on previous occasions ? I think the people of 
               <br />
               Canada would naturally expect, in a matter of so 
               <br />
               much interest to this country, that the views of 
               <br />
               the Government and the people of Canada should 
               <br />
               be represented there.
