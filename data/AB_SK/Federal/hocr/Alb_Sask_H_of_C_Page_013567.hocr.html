               granting of provincial autonomy to these 
               <br />
               territories, do not seem to «be quite so clear ; 
               <br />
               because, so far as I was able to understand 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman, he said that if we 
               <br />
               passed a Bill for that purpose such as 
               <br />
               exactly suited him, it would be entirely 
               <br />
               satisfactory to him. That is about as near 
               <br />
               as he could .get the hon. gentleman to com- 
               <br />
               mit himself.

               <br />
               hon. friend’s caution. Now with regard to 
               <br />
               the details of the Bill, with which I am not 
               <br />
               at all familiar, as I have not had an op- 
               <br />
               portunity of seeing it—I do not think those 
               <br />
               details have much to do with the question. 
               <br />
               It is a question which will have to be dealt 
               <br />
               with by this government, it is a question, 
               <br />
               of course, which should be dealt with in a 
               <br />
               manner satisfactory to the territories for the 
               <br />
               time being. But because the government 
               <br />
               of the territories submits a Bill which this 
               <br />
               government does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> as satisfactory, 
               <br />
               that of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[itself</span> is hardly a suﬁicient reason 
               <br />
               ' for putting off a settlement of this question
