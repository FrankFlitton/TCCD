               seem to think that the use of the French language

               is a monstrous privilege, something unheard of in

               quote a remark which was made in that Assembly, 
               <br />

               One of the speakers in the Mauritius Assembly 
               <br />

               Hope and Canada, which he concluded by saying

               <br />
               and best specimens of British conservatism which

               to England by the generous and liberal treat-

               ment which they received at the hands of the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government. I refer to Sir Charles 
               <br />
               Dilke. The debate on this subject has considerably 
               <br />
               widened. My hon. friend who proposed this 
               <br />
               measure, and those who support it, felt them- 
               <br />
               selves compelled to seek other reasons beyond the 
               <br />
               practical question to which they would like to re— 
               <br />
               duce it ; and in their search for reasons they went 
               <br />
               to foreign countries. But in their search they 
               <br />
               were equally unfortunate. For what do we ﬁnd ?
