               were holding an election for a legislative body bound

               against ascertaining in that way what the wishes

               <br />
               House on this question to-night. I cannot imagine 
               <br />
               it being gravely asserted to this Legislature in one 
               <br />
               breath that the French people of the North~VVest 
               <br />
               Territories are numerically so insigniﬁcant that it is 
               <br />
               not worth while to use the French language in the 
               <br />
               Territories at all, and that its abolition is a matter 
               <br />
               of absolute certainty, and in the next breath that 
               <br />
               the French there are so strong and feel so keenly on 
               <br />
               this question that there will be bloodshed if they 
               <br />
               should be allowed to go to the polls upon it. I 
               <br />
               cannot understand how it can be urged that in 
               <br />
               a free country, or in a territory to which we 
               <br />
               have given the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right,</span> of self-government to 
               <br />
               any extent, we shall have a legislative assem- 
               <br />
               bly there, give a free and liberal franchise 
               <br />
               to the people, and then say to them, we are 
               <br />
               afraid we cannot trust you to go to the polls, 
               <br />
               and, therefore, we must govern you without 
               <br />
               hearing your voice on your own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs.</span> By 
               <br />
               all means let the constitutional rights of the 
               <br />
               people be respected ; let the people speak 
               <br />
               through their representatives; let them vote, 
               <br />
               and let us see that the votes shall be counted, in 
               <br />
               order that we may ascertain which of the many 
               <br />
               conﬂicting statements made to this chamber 
               <br />
               as to the comparative numbers of the popula- 
               <br />
               tion of the Territories is the safer one to adopt. 
               <br />
               I have always been under the impression that we 
               <br />
               had equal rights in this country, but I should begin 
               <br />
               to doubt it if we were to say, with regard to any 
               <br />
               section of the country: we are afraid there will 
               <br />
               be riots if you go to the polls, and we will close 
               <br />
               the polls against you and legislate for you against 
               <br />
               your Will. Therefore, I will propose to the House 
               <br />
               the amendment I am about to read. I shall 
               <br />
               make but one other observation, which I had 
               <br />
               forgotten to make in its proper place, as regards 
               <br />
               the preamble, because it is touched upon in the 
               <br />
               amendment I am about to move. The mover of 
               <br />
               the Bill cannot fail to admit that, while it is true 
               <br />
               the preamble may be eliminated from the Bill, in 
               <br />
               proposing the second reading he puts the preamble 
               <br />
               forward as the basis of the Bill, and the reason 
               <br />
               which is assigned on the face of the Bill as the 
               <br />
               reason Why this House should pass it is that 
               <br />
               community of language is necessary to the unity 
               <br />
               of a country.

               Sir ADOLPHE CARON. Before the question is 
               <br />
               put, I should like to express my deep regret that I 
               <br />
               was away from thé‘I-Iouse when the motion of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil) was 
               <br />
               voted upon. I do not like to sail under false colors, 
               <br />
               and if I had been here I should have voted for that 
               <br />
               motion. I was told that no vote would be taken 
               <br />
               to-night. I do not wish at all to blame the persons 
               <br />
               from whom I got that information, but I thought 
               <br />
               no vote would be taken to-night. Of course, it was 
               <br />
               my duty to be here, to be in my seat, but if I had 
               <br />
               been here, without going into any discussion of the 
               <br />
               question which has been occupying the attention 
               <br />
