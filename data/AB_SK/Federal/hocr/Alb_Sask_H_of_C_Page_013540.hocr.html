               The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />

               Bill are somewhat miscellaneous in their

               character. I need not explain them at,

               <br />
               ever, generally speaking, that the main 
               <br />
               provision of the Bill is to change the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-1</span>
