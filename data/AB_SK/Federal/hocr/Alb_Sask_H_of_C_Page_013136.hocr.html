               timber was not upon the portion for which they

               <br />
               for whom the member for Lincoln was acting. I 
               <br />
               heard nothing more of the matter until some time, 
               <br />
               I think late in August, when I was again appealed 
               <br />
               to by these gentlemen, who said that they had 
               <br />
               learned that something was being done which they 
               <br />
               did not think was fair or right by their claim. 
               <br />
               They begged of me to come down to Ottawa and 
               <br />
               see about it. I put them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off</span> ; I said it was useless 
               <br />
               to go, the Ministers were away, but I promised to 
               <br />
               write, and I did write to the Department, claim- 
               <br />
               ing that nothing should be done until I had an op- 
               <br />
               portunity of coming to the Capital. When I came 
               <br />
               here afterwards, in the month of September, I 
               <br />
               found the limit was granted to the applicant, Mr. 
               <br />
               Adams, for whom the member for Lincoln was act- 
               <br />
               ing. I reported that to my constituents, or rather 
               <br />
               to their solicitor, Mr. William Laidlaw, and my 
               <br />
               connection in the matter practically then ceased. 
               <br />
               They were very much dissatisﬁed. I need 
               <br />
               not go into that now, because I had no 
               <br />
               connection with that. They were very much 
               <br />
               dissatisﬁed indeed, and I think they ap- 
               <br />
               pealed subsequently to the Department with 
               <br />
               reference to it; but, practically, from that 
               <br />
               time out, I had nothing more to do with it. I had 
               <br />
               no interest, direct or indirect, with Messrs. Short-

               Mr. MITCHELL. I think, before we depart 
               <br />
               from this very interesting subject,it is desirable to 
               <br />
               say something more about it. I feel it to be due 
               <br />
               to the Minister of Customs to say that, whatever 
               <br />
               other people may think of his conduct in this 
               <br />
               matter, his explanation entirely removes any doubt 
               <br />
               that might <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existed‘in</span> the minds of any per- 
               <br />
               son in relation to that correspondence. I am sure 
               <br />
               that there is no gentleman in this House who read 
               <br />
               that correspondence but will pronounce it an 
               <br />
               infamous correspondence so far as it relates to the 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs. Therefore I think the House 
               <br />
               should feel that he has given a full and ample ex- 
               <br />
               planation, and has quite removed from himself and 
               <br />
               his reputation any suspicion that he ever received 
               <br />
               any money, or acted in any way improperly. 
               <br />
               There are other members of the Cabinet here who 
               <br />
               were in that Cabinet at that time. I must say 
               <br />
               that having been myself a member of a Cabinet

               men themselves, it is due to their position, it is

               occupying the high position of advisers of

               Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD. I have not the 
               <br />
               slightest objection to make such a statement. I 
               <br />
               thought that I had done so,the other day,when the 
               <br />
               matter was ﬁrst brought up. In the beginning of 
               <br />
               this transaction I was Minister of the Interior, but 
               <br />
               before it was all ﬁnished, I think, Sir David Mac- 
               <br />
               pherson was Minister of the Interior. I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sure:</span> 
               <br />
               neither myself nor my successor in any way received 
               <br />
               any consideration of any kind, pecuniary or other- 
               <br />
               wise, for any of the transactions concerning this 
               <br />
               license. I almost think that the House would not 
               <br />
               even require this statement from me. The hon. 
               <br />
               member himself (Mr. Rykert) disavows any such 
               <br />
               intention, although I quite agree with the Minister 
               <br />
               of Customs that the language is singularly unfortu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nateuit</span> is singularly unfortunate. As regards the 
               <br />
               solicitors who were employed by Mr. Adams, I 
               <br />
               think they were my son and the son of Sir Charles 
               <br />
               Tupper. Those are both young men, ﬁghting their 
               <br />
               way as solicitors. I cannot speak about the wealth 
               <br />
               of my son’s partner, but as far as my son is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, he had to ﬁght his own battle. I gave him 
               <br />
               his education, and that is all. He is ﬁghting his 
               <br />
               own way, and I believe he is doing it honestly and 
               <br />
               uprightly. Whatever may be his faults, I am 
               <br />
               quite sure that want of honor or honesty is not 
               <br />
               one of them. There is a remarkable discrepancy 
               <br />
               between a statement in the telegram that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs has read from my son, and the 
               <br />
               statement of the hon. member for Lincoln. He says 
               <br />
               that these two gentlemen were here ; this telegram 
               <br />
               says they were not here ; the letter which will be 
               <br />
               here, I suppose, this week, will most likely throw 
               <br />
               some light upon this discrepancy. As for myself, I 
               <br />
               can throw no light upon it, because I do not remem- 
               <br />
               ber the persons of either of these two gentlemen. I 
               <br />
               dare say that most probably they have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">written~at</span> 
               <br />
               least Mr. McArthur, who was then their partner, 
               <br />
               was looking after this matter. And whether he 
               <br />
               carried on the correspondence on behalf of the 
               <br />
               clients of those two gentlemen, I cannot say. The 
               <br />
               correspondence in the Department will, however, 
               <br />
               show who carried on the correspondence on behalf 
               <br />
               of Mr. Sands, who bought from Mr. Adams. It will 
               <br />
               be shown whether Mr. McArthur or Mr. Tupper, 
               <br />
               or the ﬁrm as a whole, carried on the correspond- 
               <br />
               ence. I will lay this correspondence before the 
               <br />
               House.

               Mr. MULOCK. Mr. Speaker, in considering 
               <br />
               the proposition embraced in the Bill of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), I feel 
               <br />
               that it is impossible to limit the discussion to the

               <br />
               the question whether or not the French language 
               <br />

               <br />
               the North—West, the discussion would be reduced 
               <br />
               to narrow limits, and I fancy a rather satisfactory 
               <br />
               conclusion would be arrived at. But when we
