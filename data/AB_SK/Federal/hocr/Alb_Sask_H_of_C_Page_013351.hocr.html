               a few days ago, in our local paper here, a statement

               themselves that the snow would do good to the

               otherwise determines. The Legislature ought to 
               <br />
               have an opportunity of altering the boundaries of 
               <br />
               constituencies, or increasing the number of mem- 
               <br />
               bers. It may be convenient, on account of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settle</span>

               ment going on more rapidly in one division than in 
               <br />
               another, to divide it and give it two representa- 
               <br />
               tives. Then, I can see no object in having three 
               <br />
               legal experts.

               two electoral districts, I may state, that that 
               <br />
               number was agreed to during my term as Lieu- 
               <br />
               tenant Governor, and a great deal of trouble was 
               <br />
               taken in the division of the electoral districts. The 
               <br />
               members were naturally jealous for their districts, 
               <br />
               desiring to get as many members for them as 
               <br />
               possible; but after a good deal of negotiation, the 
               <br />
               number of twenty-two was agreed to as a com- 
               <br />
               promise. I am not aware whether there will be 
               <br />
               any objection to giving to the Legislative Assembly 
               <br />
               power to increase their number ; I think they 
               <br />
               would probably know the position of affairs better 
               <br />
               than any one else. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">IVith</span> regard to the legal

               experts, during my time they were of very great 
               <br />
               service in the Council, and I believe they are still 
               <br />
               felt to be of great service, and I think it would be 
               <br />
