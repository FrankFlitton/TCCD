               There is an instance of the oppressive Toryism 
               <br />
               which my hon. friend lamented. But my hon.

               friend ought to have looked at the history 
               <br />
               of old Canada after that period. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend says truly that a Conservative Government 
               <br />
               was kept in for years by the support of the Con- 
               <br />
               servatives of Lower Canada. And why was that 
               <br />
               so? Because from the Conservative party the 
               <br />
               Lower Canadians got full and ample justice. What 
               <br />
               party was it that relieved the habitants of Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cemitaires</span> of Lower Canada, from the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oppression</span> of the seigniorial tenure? What was it 
               <br />
               t at made them free men instead of being victims 
               <br />
               of antiquated feudalism? The seigniorial tenure 
               <br />
               oppressod them, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> rose against it; 
               <br />
               and it was a Conservative Government, of which I 
               <br />
               had the honor to be a member, that relieved 
               <br />
               them of that burden. You might remember, Sir,

               that Bill, a small Bill; I might almost call it an 
               <br />
               insigniﬁcant Bill in its enacting c1ause——is based 
               <br />
               on the purpose of doing away with the French 
               <br />
               language, of discarding the French language, at all 
               <br />
               events, and depriving the French Canadian people 
               <br />
               of the solace of the language they learned at the 
               <br />
               feet of their mothers. Why, Mr. Speaker, if there 
               <br />
               is one act of oppression more than another which 
               <br />
               would come home to a man’s breast, it is that he 
               <br />
               should be deprived of the consolation of hearing 
               <br />
               and speakin and reading the language that his 
               <br />
               mother tang t him. It is cruel. It is seething 
               <br />
               the kid in its mother’s milk. The greatest, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per-</span> 
               <br />
               haps, of all the objections to this measure, is that 
               <br />
               it is a futile measure. It will not succeed. It 
               <br />
               cannot succeed. As my hon. friend from Both- 
               <br />
               well (Mr. Mills) said the other day, and as the hon. 
               <br />
               member from the West Riding of Durham (Mr. 
               <br />
               Blake) repeated, in order to carry out an oppressive 
               <br />
               measure we must have a Russian Government or 
               <br />
               we must have a Straﬁ'ord here ; we must put down 
               <br />
               the language with a. strong hand; we must exclude 
               <br />
               it from the schools; we must exclude it from 
               <br />
               oﬂicial life; no man in Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Who</span> spoke French 
               <br />
               must be allowed to take ofﬁce; the Frenchman 
               <br />
               must be made a Pariah, and his language must be 
               <br />
               made a mark of scorn; that is the only way to 
               <br />
               carry out the principle or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,object</span> of my hon.
