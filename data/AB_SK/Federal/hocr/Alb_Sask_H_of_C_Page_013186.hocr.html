               practically the same. If that settlement were, what

               I would not prefer myself, isolated, it might create

               arises and as the condition exists; and when we 
               <br />

               I admired those glowing periods in which he 
               <br />
               advocated a broad-minded and liberal policy 
               <br />
               in Canada, I could not help asking myself if 
               <br />
               it was possible the hon. gentleman was not aware 
               <br />
               that his own conduct was largely responsible for 
               <br />
               the agitation and for the fear in the Province of 
               <br />
               Ontario which had given rise to this agitation 
               <br />
               which he condoms. I could not help asking myself 
               <br />
               whether the hon. gentleman was not aware that the 
               <br />
               course which he had pursued in reference to the 
               <br />
               Riel agitation had warned the people of Ontario of 
               <br />
               the danger in which they stood and had led them to 
               <br />
               believe, rightly or wrongly, that the power of 
               <br />
               French Canada was so great that even Edward 
               <br />
               Blake had succumbed to its inﬂuence, had gone back 
               <br />
               on all the record of his past life, had forgotten his 
               <br />
               pledge, yet warm from his lips that he would not 
               <br />
               attempt to build up a political party on the scaffold 
               <br />
               of Regina, had forgotten the blood of his own fel— 
               <br />
               low-countrymen on the plains of the North-West, 
               <br />
               and had joined hands with the Parti National. That 
               <br />
               party which without his support would have 
               <br />
               withered and died almost in the hour in which it 
               <br />
               was born, that party which is responsible to-day for 
               <br />
               all the trouble that is upon us at this moment. I 
               <br />
               could not help also asking myself if the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man Who had addressed us in such eloquent terms 
               <br />
               had also forgotten, or was it possible that the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman who told us that this preamble of the 
               <br />
               Bill was the all-important part of the Bill, was the 
               <br />
               same gentleman who voted last Parliament that 
               <br />
               the preamble of a Bill had nothing whatever to do 
               <br />
               with it, or was it due to his approval of that pre- 
               <br />
               amble that he so voted. I do not wish to press 
               <br />
               this matter further, but I will say that these 
               <br />
               considerations presented themselves to my mind.
