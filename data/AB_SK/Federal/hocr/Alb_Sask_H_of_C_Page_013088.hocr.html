               Mr. MILLS (Bothwell). This, of course, relates to the 
               <br />
               House of Assembly in the North-West Territory. I would 
               <br />
               ask the hon. gentleman whether he has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considered</span> the pro- 
               <br />
               priety of placing at the disposal of the Governor and Legis- 
               <br />
               lature of the N orth-West Territory the same grant as that 
               <br />
               which the Provinces receive in proportion to their popula- 
               <br />
               tion ; leaving to them to appoint their own clerk, regulate 
               <br />
               their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs,</span> and to spend the money so given, in the 
               <br />
               way that they think best in the public service. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman knows at the present time that this assembly 
               <br />
               has really no funds with which to carry on the business of 
               <br />
               legislation, except such as the Government here may place 
               <br />
               at its disposal. If there was an account opened with the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritory, the moment a Legislature is established and money 
               <br />
               placed at their disposal, when they come to be admitted as 
               <br />
               a Province of course the whole sum so received by that 
               <br />
               means could be taken into consideration. It always seemed 
               <br />
               to me, that that would be the rational way to deal With 
               <br />
               them whenever they had a legislative assembly. I would 
               <br />
               like to know whether the hon. gentleman has considered 
               <br />
               the subject, and whether he proposes to invite parliamen- 
               <br />
               tary action in the matter? It will be perceived that it 
               <br />
               would be a little more reasonable, in conferring on them 
               <br />
               the power of legislation and representation, that they 
               <br />
               should have funds with which to carry on their operations._

               Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD. This discussion will 
               <br />
               arise more properly on the second reading of the Bill. I 
               <br />
               will say to my hon, friend that we do not propose to put in 
               <br />
               any such vote for this year. The territories are not quite 
               <br />
               without revenue, as the hon. gentleman knows, and I have no 
               <br />
               doubt they dispose of that revenue to the best advantage of 
               <br />
               the territories. Those revenues are very small, certainly, 
               <br />
               and I am quite ready to admit the merits of the suggestion 
               <br />
               of the hon. gentleman. The idea is to make as little change 
               <br />
               as possible until they have a purely elective assembly re- 
               <br />
               presenting the peOple. They will be obliged, after the elec- 
               <br />
               tions, to meet very soon, and to consider what the wants of 
               <br />
               the country and what administrative action here they think 
               <br />
               would be most satisfactory for that country. The measure 
               <br />
               before the House is intended merely to carry out the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple, with all due respect to their suggestions for the future. 
               <br />
               From time to time we have had a series of resolutions pass- 
               <br />
               ed by the mingled council, in which parties were nomin- 
               <br />
               ated and parties elected. Those are contradictory in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them-</span> 
               <br />
               selves and cannot be supposed really to represent the feel- 
               <br />
               ings of the people. We propose to make no apprOpriation 
               <br />
               of a sum to be disposed of by the Governor there, including 
               <br />
               the Legislature, until they have really a Local Legislature 
               <br />
               and ascertain what their own ideas are on the subject.

               enter into a discussion, and I am making only a suggestion 
               <br />
               now. These people are contributing their proportion to 
               <br />
               the taxes of the country at the present time. In all the
