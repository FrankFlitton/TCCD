               <br />
               sion which took place during last year, after 
               <br />
               Mr. Ross went out of the government. There 
               <br />
               was a preliminary talk about a year and a 
               <br />
               half ago, and of course some correspond- 
               <br />
               ence followed, and It was arranged that 
               <br />
               there should be a discussion when we would 
               <br />
               atempt to come down to details. And let 
               <br />
               me say that until the discussion of this 
               <br />
               last year, 1901, it was not understood, either 
               <br />
               by myself or the members of the territorial 
               <br />
               government, that we were at close quar— 
               <br />
               ters upon this question. We were simply 
               <br />
               discussing it as a thing which would come 
               <br />
               in the future, but no attempt was made to 
               <br />
               ﬁx a time for discussion when any settle- 
               <br />
               ment would be arrived at. Last year it 
               <br />
               was arranged that a discussion should take 
               <br />
               place, and our friends of the territorial gov- 
               <br />
               ernment did urge that it should take place 
               <br />
               earlier. But the Minister of Finance was 
               <br />
               obliged to go to England immediately after 
               <br />
               the session, and a discussion in his absence 
               <br />
               would of course have been impossible, he 
               <br />
               being one of the members of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment whose presence would be absolutely 
               <br />
               necessary in addition to the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               and myself. So that until the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance returned from England, it was im- 
               <br />
               possible altogether to arrive at any arrange- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment,</span> as to when the conference should take 
               <br />
               place. When the members of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment who were away in England did come 
               <br />
               back, the happy event of the visit of the 
               <br />
               Prince of Wales occurred. That engaged 
               <br />
               the attention of everybody some little time, 
               <br />
               and the result was that it was impossible 
               <br />
               to give any time for the discussion of this 
               <br />
               question until after that event took place. 
               <br />
               Two members of the territorial government 
               <br />
               came down just about the time His High- 
               <br />
               ness was leaving. We proceeded to get to- 
               <br />
               gether to discuss the question on two or 
               <br />
               three occasions, and go into the details as 
               <br />
               fully as possible. From time to time mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the government gave the various 
               <br />
               phases of the question consideration, and 
               <br />
               the conclusion I arrived at was that 110t- 
               <br />

               spects, was made out by our friends in the 
               <br />
               territories, it was better that the matter 
               <br />
               should be laid over for the present, and 1 
               <br />
               am bound to say that the more I have 
               <br />
               thought of the matter since that decision 
               <br />
               was arrived at, the more strongly I am 
               <br />
               convinced that it was a Wise one. I am 
               <br />
               not desirous of binding myself this evening 
               <br />
               to any expression of opinion, as very rapid 
               <br />
               changes are likely to take place in the posi-

               tion of the territories in the next year or 
               <br />
               two, and it would be most unwise for us

               The suggestion was made that we should

               <br />
               settlement will go in places where it has not

               rapid and great changes will take place in 
               <br />
               the territories within a few years, and it 
               <br />

               <br />
               completely lack the element of permanency. 
               <br />
               The House will understand that there 
               <br />
               would be no advantage in giving provin- 
               <br />
               cial autonomy to these people and having 
               <br />
               them come down here every year for ‘better 
               <br />
               terms. Every province has had to come 
               <br />
               to the Federal government for better terms. 
               <br />
               I was a boy in Manitoba when the 
               <br />
               representatives of that province had to come 
               <br />
               every year for better terms. Every year 
               <br />
               they made their pilgrimage to Ottawa, for 
               <br />
               this purpose. This was because the ele- 
               <br />
               ments of permanency and ﬁnality did not 
               <br />
               exist in the terms between Manitoba and the 
               <br />
               Dominion. The arrangements were made at 
               <br />
               a time when population was so small and 
               <br />
               the circumstances were of such a character 
               <br />
               that nobody could understand what the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial arrangement of the future needed 
               <br />
               to be. There was constant agitation going 
               <br />
               on in the province as to what better terms 
               <br />
               were acceptable. And there was constant 
               <br />
               difﬁculty over these questions between the
