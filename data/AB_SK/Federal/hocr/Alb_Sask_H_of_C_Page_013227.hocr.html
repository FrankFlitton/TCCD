               Well, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) has allowed himself, in the 
               <br />
               course of his remarks, to allude to the antipathy 
               <br />
               existing between the French Canadians and the 
               <br />
               Irish. He has received in this House the most 
               <br />
               solemn denial of this statement that he could 
               <br />
               obtain. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> have seen the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Montreal Centre (Mr. Curran) rising and speaking 
               <br />
               in French, in the name of the Irish of the Province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, bearing Witness, in this way, to the 
               <br />
               sympathies which his fellow-countrymen have for 
               <br />
               us. This is the most ample vindication which we 
               <br />
               could adduce as to this matter. This sympathy, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, exists not only between the Irish and 
               <br />
               the.French Canadians ; it exists and will exist in 
               <br />
               spite of the obstacles raised by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) between the 
               <br />
               French Canadians and the thinking Englishmen. 
               <br />
               We have had evidence of this in this House. They 
               <br />
               wish to respect our institutions, our laws, our cus- 
               <br />
               toms and our religion. On the other hand, we 
               <br />
               return the reverence which they pay us, and we 
               <br />
               respect likewise their institutions and their religion, 
               <br />
               their language and their character. We are capable 
               <br />
               of living in peace in this country. We have but 
               <br />
               one only object—to form a stronger Dominion, a 
               <br />
               great nation. But to reach this end it is not neces- 
               <br />
               sary to cast a brand of discord among us, as has 
               <br />
               done the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc 
               <br />
               Carthy). We Wish to live in peace, we desire har— 
               <br />
               mony, we desire to be calm and unexcited. But I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affirm</span> that the proposition of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe is an act of tyranny, which will show, 
               <br />
               if it is sanctioned, that they are not so patriotic as 
               <br />
               they would wish us to believe. Before closing, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, let me be allowed to say that we look 
               <br />
               upon the Bill of the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy) with calmness and tranquility. 
               <br />
               We are strong in our rights, and we fear nothing, 
               <br />
               even if this Bill were a declaration of war. We 
               <br />
               are strong in our rights and we are proud, at the 
               <br />
               same time, of our ancestors, whose memory we 
               <br />
               know how to make respected. I shall say no more. 
               <br />
               I am convinced that the Bill which is now before 
               <br />
               you for consideration will obtain the fate it 
               <br />
               deserves, and I am certain that all true patriots in 
               <br />
               this House will join hand to hand in order to give 
               <br />
               a lesson to the author of this Bill.

               yet reached a period of the Session when the 
               <br />
               Government should take another day. We have 
               <br />
               not yet discussed one of the numerous public Bills 
               <br />
               set down on the Order paper, and if Thursday is 
               <br />
               taken away, the only time when those Bills 
               <br />
               can come up will be Wednesday evening. It 
               <br />
               is not likely that we could dispose of them, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">having</span>

               <br />

               <br />
               of these public Bills.

               Mr. MITCHELL. The Government have, for 
               <br />
               a number of Sessions, compelled me to take the

               very objection which the leader of the Opposition
