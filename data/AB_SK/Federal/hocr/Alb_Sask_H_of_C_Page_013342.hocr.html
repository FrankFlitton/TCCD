               be sold except by consent of the Governor in 
               <br />
               Council. The amendment proposed by section 31 
               <br />
               to section 110 of the said chapter 50 will give the 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly which will be elected to 
               <br />
               succeed the present one the right to regulate and 
               <br />
               to decide the manner of recording and publishing 
               <br />
               its proceedin s. By section 32 of the Bill it 
               <br />
               is to be provi ed that no change shall be made in 
               <br />
               the existing law of the Territories concerning 
               <br />
               intoxicating liquor until the dissolution of the 
               <br />
               present Assembly has afforded the inhabitants an 
               <br />
               opportunity of expressing their opinion with 
               <br />
               regard to the nature of such change. The other 
               <br />
               sections of the Bill contain no material alterations 
               <br />
               of the present law.

               Mr. LAURIER. The hon. gentleman has only 
               <br />
               given us a synopsis of what the Bill contains, but 
               <br />
               no explanations as to the reasons of the alterations 
               <br />
               made in the Act. I think no more important sub- 
               <br />
               ject could be brought before this House at the 
               <br />
               present time than a Bill legislating in regard to the 
               <br />
               N orth-VVest Territories, and the House, I am 
               <br />
               sure, will be disappointed at the more than dry 
               <br />
               manner in which the hon. gentleman has introduced 
               <br />
               this subject, but I cannot blame him very much 
               <br />
               for that, because the Bill itself is a very dry one, 
               <br />
               and the changes made in the present law are mostly 
               <br />
               technical, with the exception of section 13, which 
               <br />
               is clothing the Legislature of the N orth-VVest 
               <br />
               Territories With powers similar to those now en- 
               <br />
               joyed by the Provinces. In fact, section 13, as 
               <br />
               amended by this Bill, is largely borrowed from 
               <br />
               section 92 of the Confederation Act, which gives 
               <br />
               the powers now enjoyed by the Provinces. I do 
               <br />
               not ﬁnd fault with the Administration for enlarg- 
               <br />
               ing, to that extent, the powers now enjoyed by the 
               <br />
               Legislature, but it seems to me that while the 
               <br />
               Government was making that concession, it would 
               <br />
               have been opportune to supplement it with another 
               <br />
               concession by giving responsible government to the 
               <br />
               Territories. The Territories are not progressing 
               <br />
               very fast, but still the population which goes 
               <br />
               there is an advanced population, well educated, 
               <br />
               and already showing great powers of self-govern- 
               <br />
               ment. There are some subjects of a nature which 
               <br />
               had better be entrusted to them than kept in this 
               <br />
               House. They are the best judges of what is best 
               <br />
