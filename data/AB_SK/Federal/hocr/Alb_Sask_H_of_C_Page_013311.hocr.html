               it is desirable for Quebec to have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> in- 
               <br />
               stitutions, and I may, in a proper way and on a. 
               <br />
               proper occasion, express that opinion, I trust ; but 
               <br />
               so far as regard dealing in any manner with the 
               <br />
               vested rights of Quebec, I would not be a party to 
               <br />
               such an attempt or countenance it in any way 
               <br />
               whatever. The proposal to divide the continent 
               <br />
               between the two races is unreasonable. I consider 
               <br />
               this country is under British institutions, and 
               <br />
               although the French language prevailed when the 
               <br />
               country was ceded to the British, and although the 
               <br />
               French language has been recognised and certain 
               <br />
               vested rights have been granted, yet the proposal 
               <br />
               to divide this great country between the two races 
               <br />
               and the two languages is unreasonable and unsatis- 
               <br />
               factory and not calculated to promote the future 
               <br />
               good of the country. The issue I think we all 
               <br />
               recognise is inevitable; no matter in what way 
               <br />
               we may deal with this question the dual language 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> is doomed. It is doomed, 
               <br />
               whether this Bill passes or not, whether the motion 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. 
               <br />
               Davin), or even the motion of the hon. the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice passes ; in either of these cases it is 
               <br />
               useless to propose that the French language in the 
               <br />
               great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“West</span> will be retained for any length 
               <br />

               <br />
               may as well meet the inevitable to-day, and ex- 
               <br />
               punge clause 110 from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HOLTON.</span> I wish in a very few words to 
               <br />
               emphasise the position whichI have so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fart-alien,</span> and 
               <br />
               111 which I propose continuing, with respect to the

               measure now under the consideration of this House. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And</span> at the outset I would say that I fully agree

               <br />
               The principle involved in this measure is, of course, 
               <br />
               a fairly debatable one. Yet after listening very

               attentively to the discussion of the past week, and 
               <br />
               more particularly to the speeches of the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), I am 
               <br />
               unable, in my own mind, to separate the Bill now 
               <br />
               submitted to us from those speeches, or from the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir,</span> the hon. member’s advocacy of the proposed

               <br />
               . the unhappy riod of half a century ago. And, Sir,

               ‘ with the pub ic mind thus excited and disturbed, 
               <br />
               this measure is forced upon the attention of the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> House, and in no sense as oil is poured upon the

               troubled waters ; under such circumstances, the

               <br />
               In this fact alone, I ﬁnd good and sufﬁcient reason

               misconception for which I believe the present
