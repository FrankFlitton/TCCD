               is meant by “ National <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?’f</span> These words were said 
               <br />
               in the presence of the hon. gentleman who 
               <br />
               leads the Opposition in this House, as he does not 
               <br />
               deny, and he allowed them to pass without rebuke.

               I quite admit that when the hon. gentleman spoke 
               <br />
               he made no such declaration of policy in his own 
               <br />
               behalf, and when he delivered himself afterwards in 
               <br />
               Toronto—perhaps it would have been better if he 
               <br />
               had said it in Quebec——he stated that he for one was 
               <br />
               not in favor of French nationality. There is no 
               <br />
               doubt, at all events, as to what was meant by the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman who leads the‘Local Government

               disclaimer from the leader of the Opposition in

               that when he went back to his Province he was not

               a quotation from that paper here. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               will perhaps remember it sneeringly alluded to the 
               <br />
               fact that the people were astonished at his observ- 
               <br />
               ation, they could not accept it, they could not 
               <br />
               credit it, and instead of cheering it they merely 
               <br />
               said “ hear, hear,” being induced to do so by aston— 
               <br />
               ishment, but such was not the views or the policy 
               <br />
               of the French Canadian people. Now I have en- 
               <br />
               deavored to show to the House so far, that this is not 
               <br />
               merely a sentimental matter but that it is a matter 
               <br />
               of practical politics and a matter which must be dealt 
               <br />
               with. I have endeavored to show that as early as 
               <br />
               the years 1837—38 it was then recognised as being 
               <br />
               the great cause of trouble in the Province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec. I think I have also successfully shown (I 
               <br />
               do not think, in fact, I needed to have shown it, 
               <br />
               because it is familiar to us all) that these difﬁculties 
               <br />
               exist at present, and that now that the French 
               <br />
               race, or those who speak the French language, 
               <br />
               to be more accurate, have attained to a consider- 
               <br />
               able numerical strength, their ambition is rising 
               <br />
               in proportion, and the difﬁculties which ought to 
               <br />
               have been foreseen long ago are now upon us and 
               <br />
               must be dealt with, at all events, as far as our 
               <br />
               new Territories are concerned, and that we must 
               <br />
               not allow the same difﬁculties to arise in that part 
               <br />
               of the Dominion. But if I have given the views of 
               <br />
               those within the Dominion, let me draw attention 
               <br />
               also to the views which are also entertained on 
               <br />
               this question outside of the Dominion by impartial 
               <br />
               spectators. I am not going to read from any 
               <br />
               journals that are hostile to the French Canadians, 
               <br />
               because I know that my quoting them as authority 
               <br />
               would produce no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁ'ect</span> upon those whom I am 
               <br />
               very anxious indeed should very seriously consider 
               <br />
               this question. There ought to be no such differences 
               <br />
               between the English and French Canadian mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House. There ought to be no differences 
               <br />
               on the subject between those who come from the 
               <br />
               Province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> Quebec and speak in the French 
               <br />
               langua 6, their mother tongue, and those Who 
               <br />
               come mm the other Provinces of the Dominion, 
               <br />
               and Who speak the English language. If, in truth 
               <br />
               and fact it is in the interests of this Dominion, 
               <br />
               that there should be one race, one nationality and 
               <br />
               one national life, it is the duty of all of us to strive 
               <br />
               to bring about that result. I am now aboutto quote 
               <br />
               from a paper, from a Catholic journal, which was 
               <br />
               introduced to this House last Session by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the Minister of Justice. I confess I did not 
               <br />
               hear of it before, but no doubt it has new bewme 
               <br />
