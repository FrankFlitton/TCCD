               this afternoon. I moved for copies of all

               <br />

               forth by the legislative assembly of which 
               <br />
               my hon. friend was then a member and had 
               <br />
               been for some time. As will be seen by re- 
               <br />
               ference to page. 355 of the “Hansard” of 1889. 
               <br />
               I pointed out that the old council of 1887 
               <br />
               petitioned for responsible government, and 
               <br />
               I stated what the memorial set forth. and 
               <br />
               I pressed for a subsidy very much larger 
               <br />
               than what had been given up to that time 
               <br />
               or than what has been given since. And 
               <br />
               I pointed out that we might take a leaf out 
               <br />
               of the book of the United States and follow <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> 
               <br />
               the example set by that country in dealing 
               <br />
               with its territories. I pointed out that Min- 
               <br />
               nesota, Wyoming, Dakota and Montana each 
               <br />
               got in lands, a large extent of territory for 
               <br />
               subsidizing branch lines. That is some- 
               <br />
               thing which this Government has never con- 
               <br />
               templated doing for the government of the 
               <br />
               Territories, but I contend that the sooner 
               <br />
               we give the giant in the North-west its 
               <br />
               limbs the better. The sooner we give that 
               <br />
               North-west people, now far in excess of 
               <br />
               numbers of what Manitoba was in 1870, 
               <br />
               what it is entitled to, the better; and as 
               <br />
               anybody will see who visits the giant. as 
               <br />
               the hon. Prime Minister did, at the time 
               <br />
               when the legislative assembly was sitting, 
               <br />
               the representatives in that assembly will 
               <br />
               compare well with the representatives of 
               <br />
               any assembly in the provinces. What is the 
               <br />
               reason this Government should keep that 
               <br />
               giant in leading strings all these years ? I 
               <br />
               appeal to the hon. Minister to cut those 
               <br />
               strings. He is fond of regarding himself as 
               <br />
               a breaker of manacles, let him break those 
               <br />
               manacles that are on the limbs of the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories, let him give the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories provincial autonomy and the annual 
               <br />
               subsidy to which it is entitled by reason of 
               <br />
               its population, according to the calculation 
               <br />
               so ably set forth by my hon. friend this 
               <br />
               afternoon. I would go further than was 
               <br />
               done in the case of‘ Manitoba, and would 
               <br />
               give the young man, so to speak, when I set 
               <br />
               him up in life, all the implements of man- 
               <br />

               gross earnings of the lines of railway that it

               In 1849, when Minnesota was organized, it had

               think we may err on the side of keeping the 
               <br />
               strings tcc much in our hands here in Ottawa, 
               <br />
               and not giving sufficient scope for the young 
               <br />
               giant, for which I plead here to-day, to develop 
               <br />
               his limbs. Now, it will be said to us, no doubt, 
               <br />
               you have got the mounted police. So we have, 
               <br />
               and we are very glad to have them ; but else- 
               <br />
               where you have batteries, militia, and military 
               <br />
               schools, and we pay for those just as well as you 
               <br />
               pay for the mounted police ; and before you knew 
               <br />
               where you are, I believe in the next ﬁve years, 
               <br />
               you will find we shall have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a'population</span> in those 
               <br />
               Territories which will be subscribing to your 
               <br />
               military schools, and batteries, and militia just 
               <br />
               as much as you are subscribing to the North- 
               <br />
               west mounted police. And remember that in any 
               <br />
               case the cost of defence would fall on the Federal 
               <br />
               Government; so that you cannot fairly make 
               <br />
               anything of our having the mounted police.

               Now what I point out there is of great im- 
               <br />
               portance—that the United States govern- 
               <br />
               ment, in dealing with territories is more 
               <br />
               generous than the Government of Canada. 
               <br />
               And as I repeat the argument, I repeat to 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman opposite the appeal I 
               <br />
               made to the Government of Sir John Mac- 
               <br />
               donald, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:I</span> say to him that not only will 
               <br />
               these facts justify him in complying with 
               <br />
               the demand made by my hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver) this afternoon, but they will justify 
               <br />
               him in going further. They will justify him 
               <br />
               in giving to the Territories responsible gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. They will justify him in giving 
               <br />
               the Territories not $260,000 as a grant, but 
               <br />
               $400,000'a year as a subsidy, and they will 
               <br />
               justify him in going still further—in giving 
               <br />
