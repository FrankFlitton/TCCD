               stand I took when the ﬁrst reading of this Bill 
               <br />
               was proposed to this House. Here are 217 names 
               <br />
               of opponents to this Bill from one locality alone ; 
               <br />
               so that the unanimity which we have been told 
               <br />
               existed in the North-VVest in favor of the abolition 
               <br />
               of the French language does not exist. I have to 
               <br />
               thank the House, Mr. Speaker, for the attention 
               <br />
               which has been paid to my remarks; and I am 
               <br />
               sorry that I have felt it my duty to detain you so 
               <br />
               long. I have again to express the hope that the 
               <br />
               proposition made by the hon. Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               will be accepted. I, for my part, accept it as a 
               <br />
               compromise, although I do not admit that this 
               <br />
               House has the right to ask us to deprive the French 
               <br />

               portion of what I consider to be their rights. 
               <br />
               Yet, in order to promote the peace and tran- 
               <br />
               quillity of this Dominion, I accept this amendment 
               <br />
               as a compromise, and I hope that the House will 
               <br />
               unanimously endorse it. I trust that in the future 
               <br />
               we shall have no reason to complain of the position

               Provincial autonomy in the resent instance. 
               <br />
               There are no Provinces in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Horth-W'est</span> Terri- 
               <br />
               tories which are under the jurisdiction of the

               Dominion Parliament, and are to a great extent 
               <br />
               governed by laws enacted by this Legislature. But 
               <br />
               even were Provincial rights in question, there 
               <br />
               are some rights which have been put above all 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Legislative Assembly there after the next 
               <br />
               general election. If that course is the right one, 
               <br />
               how is it that the Imperial Parliament, in the 
               <br />
               Act of 1867, did not leave to the Parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada the ri ht of deciding whether one language 
               <br />
               or two shoud be spoken in this chamber, and 
               <br />
               whether its proceedings and records should be 
               <br />
               printed in one or two languages? And how is it that 
               <br />
               the same control was not given to the Legislature of 
               <br />
               the Province of Quebec over the language of its 
               <br />
               proceedings and records ? The fact that this sub- 
               <br />
               ject, so far as it concerned the Dominion and the 
               <br />
               Province of Quebec, was settled by the Imperial 
               <br />
               Parliament in the Confederation Act, proves that 
               <br />
               it is not of the essence of Provincial rights that a 
               <br />
               Provincial Legislature should have the power of 
               <br />
               deciding in what language its proceedings should 
               <br />
               be carried on, or its recor s printed. Now, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span> 
               <br />
               tend that we are in the midst of a crusade organ- 
               <br />
               ised by the hon. member for North Simcoe for the 
               <br />
               purpose of depriving the French population of 
               <br />
               their language, their institutions, and their 
               <br />
               schools. His programme has been promulgated in 
               <br />
               Ontario, Manitoba, and the Territories, and we 
               <br />
               are asked to-day to help him to carry out his 
               <br />
               scheme. That hon. gentleman, both in this House 
               <br />
               and outside of the House, has stated that his pro— 
               <br />
               gramme for his future lifetime is the abolition of 
               <br />
               the French Ian ge in Manitoba and the North- 
               <br />
               VVest, the abo ition of the Separate Schools in 
               <br />
               Ontario, the abolition of the French language in 
               <br />
               the House of Commons, and, in the course of 
               <br />
               time, the abolition of the French language, 
               <br />
               in the Province of Quebec, although he does 
               <br />
               not expect to succeed for several years. Now, 
               <br />
               what is the object of the proposition made 
               <br />
               by the hon. Minister of Justice, in the opinion of 
               <br />
               all the newspapers, French and English, Liberal 
               <br />
               and Conservative, which have discussed the
