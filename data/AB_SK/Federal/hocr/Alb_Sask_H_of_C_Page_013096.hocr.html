               that is the way Mr. Young, to whom I referred a moment 
               <br />
               ago, terms. I want to say one word about the last part of 
               <br />
               that resolution, which asks for the establishment of a 
               <br />
               Dominion Lands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Oﬁce</span> in the Territories. This, I think, is 
               <br />
               a very important matter,and I may point out that the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, in his report of 1882, declares it necessary 
               <br />
               toestablish in the North-West a land board. However, 
               <br />
               when it was decided to establish this land board, instead of 
               <br />
               placing it in the North-West it was established at Winnipeg, 
               <br />
               in Manitoba. I think it would be a very wise thing to do 
               <br />
               what the LegislatiVe Assembly suggests, and to move that 
               <br />
               land board to the North-West. At the present moment 
               <br />
               you are getting an enormous revenue from the N orth-West. 
               <br />
               This year I see gladly, by the report of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Interior, the revenue of the Department of the Interior is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$54U,t05.</span> No doubt some of that comes from Manitoba, 
               <br />
               but the main portion of it undoubtedly comes from the 
               <br />
               North— West Territory, and as the principal business of the 
               <br />
               land board will be done in the North-West Territory, I 
               <br />
               believe that if it were established at Regina, instead of at 
               <br />
               Winnipeg, it would be a great improvement. The last 
               <br />
               resolution of these gentlemen deals with the question of 
               <br />
               responsible government. It says:

               West Territories was 28,000, larger y 11,000 than that of 
               <br />
               Manitoba when she was admitted into Confederation. The 
               <br />
               pOpulation has much increased since that census, as eviden- 
               <br />
               ced from the new electoral districts erected. Manitoba was 
               <br />
               erected into a Province in 1870, and as we see in 33 Vic., 
               <br />
               cap. 3, sec. 25, she received $30,000 in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suppOtt</span> of govern- 
               <br />
               ment, 80 cents per head of the populatiOn, which was esti- 
               <br />
               mated at 17,000, and the salaries of the Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor, judges, charges in respect to customs, postal, 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries, militia, geological, penitentiary department, and 
               <br />
               so on, were all paid by the Federal Treasury. In 1882, 
               <br />
               according to 45 Vic., cap. 5, when the pOpulation of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba, according to the census of 1881, was 69,954, that 
               <br />
               Province was allowed 80 cents or head on 150,000 souls, , 
               <br />
               indemnity for want of public Ian sof 845,000 ; and in 1870, 
               <br />
               because the Province was not in debt, 5 er cent. 
               <br />

               I ask the attention of the Houseto this argument. It 
               <br />
               is an argument of proportion, such an argument as we all 
               <br />
               have made when learning the rule of three at school. If 
               <br />
               Manitoba, in 1882, with a census pupulation of 65,954, was 
               <br />
               allowed 80 cents a head on a population of 150,000, 
               <br />
               then the North-West, four years after, it was declared 
               <br />
               by the census of 1885, to have a population of 28,000, 
               <br />
               must be entitled to 80 cents a head on about 80,000 people. 
               <br />
               But take the ratio adopted after one year, and we are 
               <br />
               entitled to 80 cents a head on 70,000, or 856,000; for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gov~</span> 
               <br />
               ernment, 850,000 ; and for want of our public lands, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">815,000.</span> 
               <br />
               Then, if Manitoba with a population of 17,000, not having 
               <br />
               any debt, was entitled to 5 per cent. on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">8472,000,</span> the 
               <br />
               North-West Territories, with a census pOpulation of 28,000, 
               <br />
               would be entitled to 5 per cent. on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$774,000,</span> or 838,700; and 
               <br />
               as we have more land than Manitoba, our gross revenue 
               <br />
               should amount to $239,700. We should also have 150,000 
               <br />
               acres of land for a university, and money for our own 
               <br />
               lunatic asylum, as well as Manitoba. Now, Sir, the tone 
               <br />
               taken towards that western country is a tone which I 
               <br />
               believe will not be often taken in this House after hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen come to see what its claims are; because at the 
               <br />
               present minute we must regard that western countryas 
               <br />
               composed of Manitoba, the North-West Territories and 
               <br />
               British Columbia, all west of the great lakes; and what do 
               <br />
               you ﬁnd? If you compare the amount that western 
               <br />
               country pays in customs duties with the amount paid by 
               <br />
               an old Province like Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, you
