               Assembly to legislate for them, that we ought to 
               <br />
               hand over a reasonable sum of money, such as we 
               <br />
               are voting here for speciﬁc purposes, to the control of 
               <br />
               that Assembly, and allow it to determine how and 
               <br />
               for what purpose that money shall be applied. 
               <br />
               When we undertake to confer representative insti- 
               <br />
               tions on the people of the territories we are assum- 
               <br />
               ing that they are in a condition toexercise the 
               <br />
               functions of self-government : and one of the 
               <br />
               earliest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fun'ctions</span> of self-government would be to 
               <br />
               apply the revenues placed at. their diSposal to those 
               <br />
               purposes which they think most necessary for the 
               <br />
               welfare of the territories. That, I think, is a 
               <br />
               matter of very considerable importance. I do not 
               <br />
               overlook the fact that the population of this vast 
               <br />
               area is not a homogeneous population, in the sense 
               <br />
               of being united together and capable of understand- 
               <br />
               ing each other’s 'ants, in the same way that a 
               <br />
               population in a well-settled province could. It is 
               <br />
               highly probable that. it may be found, in the 
               <br />
               interest of good government in those territories, 
               <br />
               that at no distant day they should be divided, 
               <br />
               and that it will be found that they will be capable 
               <br />
               of carrying on the local legislation in a way more 
               <br />
               satisfactory to themselves if they had separate dis- 
               <br />
               tricts. each of which is separatelyrepresented, than 
               <br />
               by undertaking to embrace nearly one million 
               <br />
               square miles within the area of one Local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lloVern-</span> 
               <br />
               inent, and bringing together representatives of 
               <br />
               distant settlements, who cannot understand each 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other’s</span> wants and can know little or nothing about 
               <br />
               each othcr’s circumstances. That fact alone will 
               <br />
               make any Assembly which may be called together 
               <br />
               there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> from what a representative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assem-</span> 
               <br />
               bly would be ina well-settled province. I observe, 
               <br />
               too, that by section 3 you give to the Lieutenant 
               <br />
               l(lovernor the powers and prerogatives that belong 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span> to the Crown ; you give him the power of dissqu- 
               <br />
               tion. I think that is very questionable. You say 
               <br />
               that the Legislature, when elected, shall be elected 
               <br />
               for three years, unless sooner dissolved by the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant Governor ; but why should the Lieuten- 
               <br />
               ant Governor have the power of dissolution, when 
               <br />
               you have not given him any responsible advisers ? 
               <br />
               The advisers he may have are not responsible to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">IllajOTlty</span> of the Legislature. It does seem to 
               <br />
               me that the evils which might arise from 
               <br />
               this power being held by an irresponsible officer 
               <br />
               are far greater than those which would spring 
               <br />
               from the continuance of the Assembly for the- 
               <br />
               whole period of its election. The Assembly
