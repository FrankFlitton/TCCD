               ﬁrst that country was governed by a Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor with a council appointed, I think, alto- 
               <br />
               gether by the Crown, and afterwards with a council 
               <br />
               composed of a certain number of Crown nominees 
               <br />
               and a certain number of elected councillors. The 
               <br />
               governor was practically without responsibility to 
               <br />
               the Legislature, and I have no doubt that was 
               <br />
               designedly so, the Governor being responsible to the 
               <br />
               central Government, and that central Government 
               <br />
               or Cabinet being responsible to the Dominion

               that, when the number of the elected members 
               <br />

               <br />
               disappear, and it should be changed from a council 
               <br />
               to an assembly, and the Governor would then sever 
               <br />
               himself—if I recollect aright——from the council of

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> was no responsible government provided for 
               <br />
               in so many words in that Act. In 1888, the last 
               <br />
               Act was passed, by which without the Lieutenant

               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the assembly and obliged to go back to their 
               <br />
               constituents for re-election upon being appointed 
               <br />
               advisers of the Crown, it was provided that 
               <br />
               further steps should be taken towards the assimil-

               <br />

               <br />
               should have an advisory board taken from the

               The Lieutenant Governor managed those revenues

               of Bills being passed for certain purposes when 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               act at ﬁrst on his own discretion. In 
               <br />
               1878, there was an attempt made to provide 
               <br />
               an embryotic Ministry or Council, to allow the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant Governor to select four advisers, from 
               <br />
               those he thought, from their commercial and 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial experience, were best ﬁtted to discharge

               <br />

               Mr. MILLS (Bothwell). I agree with the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), in 
               <br />
               saying that the measure now under our considera- 
               <br />
               tion is one of the most important, perhaps the 
               <br />
               most important, that has been before the House 
               <br />
               this Session, and I feel in my own mind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it is 
               <br />
               quite impossible at this period of the Session to 
               <br />
               give to a measure of this importance that full and 
               <br />
               exhaustive consideration which it ought to receive 
               <br />
               from this House. The principles involved in the 
               <br />
               measure are of very great importance, and ought 
               <br />
               to receive very full consideration, and ought to be 
               <br />
               discussed from every possible standpoint by the 
               <br />
               members of this House, before any ﬁnal action is 
               <br />
               taken. Now, the hon. gentleman has statedthat 
               <br />
               it is not proper at the present time that responsible 
               <br />
