               tion). I do not desire to detain the House very 
               <br />
               long, Mr. Speaker; nor have I the pretention that I 
               <br />
               have anything very new in the shape of argument to 
               <br />
               offer upon the important question which concerns 
               <br />
               us at the present moment. Nevertheless, the 
               <br />
               speeches delivered by the member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               contain assertions so unjust, so destitute of founda- 
               <br />
               tion, that I wish to arraign some of them. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“That</span> 
               <br />
               is the object of the Bill of the member for Simcoe ‘3 
               <br />
               Is it the interest of the public which urges him 
               <br />
               on ? Is it really a sincere desire to consolidate the 
               <br />
               Canadian nationality in the Dominion ‘? I answer 
               <br />
               emphatically, no. His sole object is to continue 
               <br />
               to excite the various races which inhabit this 
               <br />
               country, the one against the other; his sole end 
               <br />
               is to enflame religious prejudice, and to build for 
               <br />
               himself a small political party on the ruins which 
               <br />
               he shall have made, to the injury of political peace 
               <br />
               and religious tolerance in Canada. His Bill, I say, 
               <br />
               is an outrageous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provocation</span> to the French of this 
               <br />
               country. Last year, it was the Catholic sensibility 
               <br />
               which the member for North Sinicoe wished to 
               <br />
               wound with the Jesuit question; this time it is 
               <br />
               the French nationality which he attacks, wounding l 
               <br />
               in this way the two strongest and most sensitive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               feelings which exist in any nation proud and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">courageous.’</span> For months and months the member " 
               <br />
               for North Siincoe and the press at his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">command}</span> 
               <br />
               have not ceased to insult and vilify us. Have you l 
               <br />
               seen any agitation in the Province of Quebec ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span> 
               <br />
               No. Have you seen any tumultuous meetings <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">f</span> 
               <br />
               gathered together in order to protest again these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span> 
               <br />
               insults? No. Have you seen brought into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this}</span> 
               <br />
               House any petitions asking for the rejection of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> 
               <br />
               Bill ? None whatever. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vl'hy</span> so? It is because, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               spite of what they think in certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quarters,</span> we 
               <br />
               understand constitutional rule. We have remained 
               <br />
               calm,—conﬁding in the justice of this House ; and 
               <br />
               this justice will be meted out to us. In a few 
               <br />
               moments this anti-French Bill of the member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe will be crushed by the same humiliat- 
               <br />
               ing majority Which crushed out his motion against 
               <br />
               the Jesuits. In face of this display of narrow 
               <br />
               fanaticism, I ask whether we of French origin have 
               <br />
               done anything to justify it? I think not. Our 
               <br />
               history is there, to show on the contrary our spirit 
               <br />
               of tolerance, our spirit of friendliness. I asked a 
               <br />
               moment ago : Have we provoked our fellow 
               <br />
               Citizens of English origin <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘3</span> No. I shall quote 
               <br />
               to this House an eloquent witness to our spirit of 
               <br />
               tolerance,——and this evidence has fallen from the 
               <br />
               lips of a qualiﬁed man, from the lips of an English 
               <br />
               Conservative who played a no mean part in this 
               <br />

               should arise, calculated to infringe upon the rights of

               <br />
               aggression of this kind : ‘ We trusted each_ot er when we 
               <br />
               entered this union ; we felt then that our rights would be 
               <br />

               them.’ I believe this is an era in our history in which 
               <br />
               in after ages our children may appeal With <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pride.</span> and 
               <br />
               that if there should be any intention on eit er side to 
               <br />
               aggress upon the other, the recollection that each trusted 
               <br />
               to the honor of the other will prevent that intention 
               <br />
               from being carried out. Feeling as I do thus strongly

               that our French fellow~subjects are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plucmg.</span> entire

               <br />
               the English~spenking population of Lower Canada, ought 
               <br />
               not to be behind handin placing conﬁdence in them. 
               <br />
               feel that we have no reason as a minority to fear aggres- 
               <br />
               sions on the part of the majoritv. We feel that in the

               expect the future relations between the two races to be. 
               <br />
               But although this feeling of mutual conﬁdence may be 
               <br />
               strong enough in our breasts at this time, I am glad to
