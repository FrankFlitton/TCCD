               to deal with this question upon the broad principle 
               <br />
               of this Constitution, which has been devised for 
               <br />
               the safety of the majority and the protection of 
               <br />
               the minority, and in the light of the condition of 
               <br />
               things which may exist at that time in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Terri‘</span> 
               <br />
               tories. But till then I believe it is better to defer 
               <br />
               the consideration of this question. There is this 
               <br />
               remarkable feature in the Bill we have before us : 
               <br />
               it is not founded on an expression of the will 
               <br />
               of the people of the Territories; it is founded 
               <br />
               simply on alleged principles applicable to the 
               <br />
               whole Dominion. This is what I object to in 
               <br />
               this Bill, and—~though it is my own individual 
               <br />
               opinion only—I submit to all parties in this House, 
               <br />
               French or English, Liberals or Conservatives, 
               <br />
               that the best thing for us to do is to defer the 
               <br />
               consideration of this question to a future time 
               <br />
               when we shall be prepared to deal with all the 
               <br />
               questions now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘ecting</span> the North-West Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. In the meantime, however, we ought to 
               <br />
               remember this—French, English, Liberals, Con— 
               <br />
               servatives—that no race in this country has abso- 
               <br />
               lute rights, only the rights which do not invade 
               <br />
               the rights of any other race. We ought to remem- 
               <br />
               ber that the expression of race feelings and race 
               <br />
               sentiments should be well restrained to a point, 
               <br />
               beyond which, if pressed, though still kept Within 
               <br />
               legitimate limits, they might hurt the feelings and 
               <br />
               sentiments of other races. But when the time 
               <br />
               comes for dealing with this question, I hope we 
               <br />
               shall all be prepared, without party differences, to 
               <br />
               deal with it on the broad principles that apply to 
               <br />
               this Constitution; that we shall not, French or 
               <br />
               English, hesitate to apply true principles under 
               <br />
               the fear that evil consequences may ﬂow from 
               <br />
               them, because we must remember that true prin- 
               <br />
               ciples are only an emanation of Divine truth, and 
               <br />
               that there is above us an eternal Providence whose 
               <br />
               infinite wisdom knows better than man what is 
               <br />
               best for man, and who, even when all seems lost, 
               <br />
               still guides everything for the greatest good.

               Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD. I go a great way 
               <br />
               with my hon. friend in his remarks concerning the 
               <br />
               principle of this Bill. I sympathise with his very 
               <br />
               natural feelings of indignation at much of the lan- 
               <br />
               guage that has been used in su port of this mea- 
               <br />
               sure now before the House. I have no accord 
               <br />
               with the desire expressed in some quarters that by 
               <br />
               any mode whatever there should be an attempt 
               <br />
               made to oppress the one language or to render it 
               <br />
               inferior to the other ; I believe that would be im- 
               <br />
               possible if it were tried, and it would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.be</span> foolish 
               <br />
               and wicked if it were possible. The statement 
               <br />
               that has been made so often that this is a conquered 
               <br />
               country is ct <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">propos</span> de <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mien.</span> Whether it was con- 
               <br />
               quered or ceded, we have a constitution now under 
               <br />
               which all British subjects are in a position of ab- 
               <br />
               solute equality, havin equal rights of every kind 
               <br />
               —of language, of re 'gion, of property and of 
               <br />
               person. There is no paramount race in this coun- 
               <br />
               try; there is no conquered race in this country; 
               <br />
               we are all British subjects, and those who are 
               <br />
               not English are none the less British subjects on 
               <br />
               that account. But while I say so much, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, I must regret that my hon. friend, per-

               haps yielding to the necessity of his position as 
               <br />
               a party leader, should have commenced his

               generous or altogether politic. e on. gent eman 
               <br />
               spoke of the spirit of this Bill being that of 
               <br />
               Toryism, utter Toryism, oppressive Toryism. 
               <br />
               Why, Sir, if he looks at the history of England in 
               <br />
               modern days, I think he will find that most of the 
               <br />
               liberal measures passed there have been passed, if 
               <br />
               not by Tories, by Conservatives. I think also, if 
               <br />
               he will look at the history of Canada, he will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               at all events, that liberality towards the French 
               <br />
               Canadian race was pretty much conﬁned to the 
               <br />
               Conservative party. The hon. gentleman had to 
               <br />
               admit that while this Bill was, as he afﬁrmed, an 
               <br />
               evidence of utter Toryism, the exclusion of the 
               <br />
               French language, the injury done to the French 
               <br />
               people, the insult offered to them, came from a 
               <br />
               Radical, the Earl of Durham. To be sure, my hon. 
               <br />
               friend said that Lord Durham was a Radical who 
               <br />
               did not understand all about liberty. That is quite 
               <br />
               evident; and so great a Radical was he that in 
               <br />
               order to get rid of him the English Government 
               <br />
               sent him to this country to show us his liberalism 
               <br />
               by attempting to deprive half the people of their 
               <br />
               right to use their own language. Ay, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               and he succeeded in carrying out that effort; he 
               <br />
               succeeded in excluding the French language, and 
               <br />
               the measure was carried by a Liberal Government~ 
               <br />
               in England. That was in 1840. The ﬁrst 
               <br />
               Government formed in Canada under that 
               <br />
               measure in 1841 was a confused Government, 
               <br />
               where Liberals, and Tories, and ofﬁcials were 
               <br />
               mixed up together. But, Sir, in 1844, when there 
               <br />
               was a stand-up ﬁght between Conservatives and 
               <br />
               Liberals, when the Conservatives rallied around 
               <br />
               Lord Metcalfe, and carried a majority ; when the 
               <br />
               Parliament met in Montreal in that year, with a 
               <br />
               Conservative majority, the whole of the French 
               <br />
               Canadian race, with the exception, I think, of 
               <br />
               four, were in opposition to the Government. I 
               <br />
               was then elected for the ﬁrst time, and I sat in 
               <br />
               that Parliament as a Tory, a supporter of Lord 
               <br />
               Metcalfe. In that Parliament the French Cana- 
               <br />
               dians were powerless; and yet, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               what did that House do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘2</span> Let me read to you a 
               <br />
               resolution that was passed, not by a Liberal or 
               <br />
               Radical Government, not by a Parliament having 
               <br />
               sympathy with the French Canadians exactly, but 
               <br />
               by a Conservative Parliament elected, as was then 
               <br />
               alleged, in opposition to the interests of the 
               <br />
               Province of Lower Canada ; and yet passed, 
               <br />
               from a more sense of justice, and without 
               <br />
               one single dissenting voice. Yes, from a 
               <br />
               more sense of justice, the resolution was 
               <br />
               passed and the address was passed without 
               <br />
               one dissenting voice. I, as a member of the young 
               <br />
               Tory party, was proud then to have the oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of pronouncing on that question. The yeas 
               <br />
               and nays were not taken because we were unani- 
               <br />
               mous, but I was proud of having had a part, as a 
               <br />
