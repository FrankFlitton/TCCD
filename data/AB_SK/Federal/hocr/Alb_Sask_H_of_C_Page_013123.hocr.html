               on this question and telling us, in the face of the 
               <br />
               fact that Switzerland has endured since the 12th

               not know something about the interest that at- 
               <br />
               taches to that country ‘? Yet, in face of the fact that 
               <br />
               that prosperous nation has three ofﬁcial languages, 
               <br />
               my hon. and learned friend goes abroad and tells 
               <br />
               the people that, if there are two ofﬁcial languages 
               <br />
               in the country we can never hope to make a 
               <br />
               nation—~that we may throw up the sponge and 
               <br />
               write “ Ichabod ” over our country ! A mere state—

               ment of the fact Without any argument to support 
               <br />
               it is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reductio</span> ad absurdum. My hon. and learned 
               <br />
               friend tells us, that you cannot have anation unless 
               <br />
               you have only one ofﬁcial language. Well, thereby 
               <br />
               hangs a tale ; and I think the tale I am about to

               <br />
               the test negatively. It mig t be unsafe to rule that all

               community of language, there is no common nationality 
               <br />
               in the highest sense. As in the teeth of community of

               there may be an artiﬁcial nationality, a nationalit

               “ I think that will not be denied as a correct doctrine." 
               <br />
               And, of course, what he seeks to make out is 
               <br />
               this : that the teaching of that article is the teach- 
               <br />
               ing he had laid down in his proposition, that it 
               <br />
               was necessary to have community of language in 
               <br />
               order to have a nation. I cannot believe that my 
               <br />
               hon. friend meant to deceive this House, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there-</span> 
               <br />
               fore I am thrown back on the alternative, that he 
               <br />
               did not understand Freeman. That article, Sir, 
               <br />
               does not deal with the question my hon. friend 
               <br />
               tried to make the House think it dealt with. 
               <br />
               Freeman takes for his text the extraordinary cir- 
               <br />
               cumstance of a lot of Magyars going to Constanti- 
               <br />
               nople to congratulate an Ottoman general on a victory 
               <br />
               on the ground of their kinship ; because, as you know, 
               <br />
               the Magyar is a form of the same Semitic speech, 
               <br />
               if it be Semitic, that is spoken by the Turks. He 
               <br />
               does the same thing as Max Miiller who deals with 
               <br />
               an extraordinary phenomenon in modern life, 
               <br />
               brought about by a strong bent to philological 
               <br />
               studies ; for people are giving in this late day an 
               <br />
               importance to language that was not given before ; 
               <br />
               and when you read the article, you will ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               Freeman uses the word “ exceptions” in an extra- 
               <br />
               ordinary way. He actually uses the Word for the 
               <br />
               majority, and Why does he do it ? Because he lays 
               <br />
               down this proposition : that there are now certain 
               <br />
               nations which are formed on this language idea, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">_</span> 
               <br />
               he says the exceptions all over Europe are very 
               <br />
               large. Now, if the House will bear with me Iwill give 
               <br />
               them an idea of this article ; but, ﬁrst, let me ask 
               <br />
               why did not my hon. friend read on ‘2 You will 
               <br />
               see in a minute. If he had gone on, he would have , 
               <br />
               read that all the larger countries of Europe -
