               Mr. MCCARTHY. I think it is a mistake. I

               think in truth the word was “ unity. ”

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. BLAKE. Well, I am very glad to hear it, 
               <br />
               because I was about to say that I did not perceive 
               <br />
               that the word “ comity ” had any reasonable 
               <br />
               application to this matter at all. We know what 
               <br />
               the meaning of that word is, and if ever an im- 
               <br />
               proper word could be chosen for the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man’s Bill, it certainly was the word “comity.” 
               <br />
               But he now tells us, as I presumed, that what he in- 
               <br />
               tended by the phrase, was unity, and, therefore, 
               <br />
               it is in the interests of the national unity of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, that this result is to take place. 
               <br />
               Now, Mr. Speaker, in order to the advancement of 
               <br />
               our national unity, we must agree, if we adopt 
               <br />
               this preamble, that it is expedient, that we should 
               <br />
               take all possible steps which are open to us to pro- 
               <br />
               cure by legal and constitutional means the disallow- 
               <br />
               ance of the use of the French language where now 
               <br />
               it is allowed. That is clear, that is plain, that is 
               <br />
               obvious, that is logical. Was ever such a lame 
               <br />
               and impotent conclusion deduced from such impor- 
               <br />
               tant premises, if this question is to cease with 
               <br />
               this little enacting clause with reference to the 
               <br />
               North-VVest Territories ‘? If that which it is expe- 
               <br />
               dient for the unity of the Canadian Dominion to 
               <br />
               abrogate is to he suffered to go on in this chamber, 
               <br />
               is to be suffered to go on in Canada, is to be suffered 
               <br />
               to go on in the important Province of Quebec, while 
               <br />
               our national unity is to be preserved, forsooth. 
               <br />
               by dealing with a few thousands who now inhabit 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories? No. These gentle— 
               <br />
               men represent a very grave condition of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs.</span> 
               <br />
               That is not their intention. We all know it is 
               <br />
               not the intention; it has been admitted not to be 
               <br />
               the intention at all ; we cannot stop here ; that 
               <br />
               would indeed be much cry and little wool. Nor 
               <br />
               does the hon. gentleman so pretend. In the speech 
               <br />
               with which he moved the ﬁrst reading of this Bill 
               <br />
               he entered into a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">number</span> of considerations which 
               <br />
               would have been but remotely relevant to the 
               <br />
               simple clause of the Bill itself. True he pointed out 
               <br />
               plainly enough, what was perfeclty obvious, that he 
               <br />
               was not at the moment proposing to do more than 
               <br />
               deal with the North-West Territories question. 
               <br />
               But, so far from making that further announcement, 
               <br />
               which he could not have honestly made, but which 
               <br />
               was made by the hon. member for North Norfolk 
               <br />
               (Mr. Charlton) today, he said simply this. After 
               <br />
               speaking of the past and the present, he said: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “Ihave endeavored at all events to make ood my 
               <br />
               statements, that both from within and from wit out the 
               <br />
               general opinion prevails that this question has come to 
               <br />
               the point where it is likely to cause further diﬁ'ereuces, 
               <br />
               as it has already caused <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(inferences</span> 1n the Dominion. ” 
               <br />
               Then the hon. gentleman said : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ Come back now Sir, to the North-West Territories. I

               <br />

               It is a perfectly correct statement that this is all the 
               <br />
               legislation proposed by this clause ; but the proposi-

               <br />
               to the diversities of opinions on this subject, potent

               man’s preamble nor to his speech here. We ﬁnd in 
               <br />
               a recent speech delivered in this city to what is 
               <br />
               called the Equal Rights Association statements 
               <br />
               which deal with this question, and which deal 
               <br />
               with it in a manner showing that he at all events 
               <br />
               does not shrink from the application of the motto 
               <br />
               which the hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills), 
               <br />
               cited last night, the motto “ Thorough.” The hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton), said we 
               <br />
               are not talking of interfering or proposing to inter- 
               <br />
               fere with the use of the French language, with read- 
               <br />
               ing, writing or speaking it. Nothing of that 
               <br />
               kind, he said, is talked or thought of ; it is simply 
               <br />
               this question of using it in the North-West Legis~ 
               <br />
               lature, and, as the hon. gentleman repeated, this 
               <br />
               dreadful grievance of the statutes and ordinances 
               <br />
               being printed in the French language. But that 
               <br />
               is not the view of the hon. member for Simcoe. 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd these statements in a speech delivered by him 
               <br />
               as late as 12th December last, within a few yards 
               <br />
               of this building. He said that Lord Durham had 
               <br />
               held ﬁrst, and above all things, that the French 
               <br />
               language must be stamped out. And the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman gave his own personal opinion that 
               <br />
               Without a shadow of doubt Lord Durham was right. 
               <br />
               It is not, therefore, a question of an occasional 
               <br />
               French speech in Parliament which bores the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) and the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton), or 
               <br />
               of their being troubled by the fact that copies of 
               <br />
               the Debates and of the statutes are printed in 
               <br />
               French, in a tongue with which they are not as 
               <br />
               familiar as with their mother tongue ; but the 
               <br />
               language must be stamped out, says the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               proceeded : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ Is there a shadow of doubt that between these two 
               <br />
               races, of all races in the world, if they are ever to be 
               <br />
               united, it must be by obliteration of one of these lan- 
               <br />
               guages and by the teaching in one of these tongues.” 
               <br />
               I should judge, I hope I am not mistaken, that the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton), 
               <br />
               does not mean that the English language should 
               <br />
               be obliterated; if so, it must be the French language. 
               <br />
               Then, the hon. member for North Simcoe drew 
               <br />
               upon his experience as a parliamentarian, and de- 
               <br />
               clared he had observed that more French was now 
               <br />
               spoken in the House than formerly, an observa- 
               <br />
               tion, I must confess, entirely at variance with my 
               <br />
               experience, which is somewhat longer in this 
               <br />
               House than that of the hon. gentlemen. I quite 
               <br />
               admit that the course which the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               and others have pursued, will very naturally lead 
               <br />
               to a larger quantity of French <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speaking</span> in this 
               <br />
               House than has prevailed hitherto, but do say 
               <br />
               there is nothing more marked, than the change 
               <br />
               which has taken place since I ﬁrst entered Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, with respect to this question of French 
               <br />
               speaking. Then, the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               proceeded to point out that our constitution is 
               <br />
               amendable in regard to the use of the French 
               <br />
               language in Quebec and in Canada, and he gave the 
               <br />
               precedents which showed the truth of that state- _ 
               <br />
               ment, that the constitution is amendable. And
