               I am told by a gentleman holding a high

               position in the public affairs of the province

               The province of Quebec administers these 
               <br />
               lands. Immigration from foreign countries

               promoted by this government may come 
               <br />
               to settle on these lands. And yet, while the 
               <br />
               lands are controlled absolutely by the pro-

               <br />
               North-west Territories are controlled by this 
               <br />
               government through the Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior. We have heard a great deal lately 
               <br />
               of New Ontario, and no one can doubt that 
               <br />
               there is a splendid country in Ontario that 
               <br />
               will be ﬁlled up with a ﬁne population one

               brought from foreign countries to new 0n—

               ritories have their lands administered at

               Mr. BORDEN (Halifax). I think I stated 
               <br />
               that, except that I pointed out, as Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               t-ain has pointed out, that the people of 
               <br />
               Manitoba received a certain compensation, 
               <br />
               I believe for their lands at the time the 
               <br />
               province was constituted. Further than 
               <br />
               that, a portion of the lands at least have 
               <br />
               been handed over to the control of the 
               <br />
               province since it was organized. And, so 
               <br />
               far as the province of Manitoba is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, I kn0w of no good reason why any 
               <br />
               lands that remain to be administered in that 
               <br />
               province should not be administered by the 
               <br />
               local government instead of by this govern- 
               <br />
               ment. If the principle is good for the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories, I admit it is also 
               <br />
               good for the province of Manitoba. In mat- 
               <br />
               ters of this kind, I do not think we should 
               <br />
               shrink from going the full length. If the 
               <br />
               people of Ontario, of Quebec and of the mari- 
               <br />
               time provinces can properly administer their 
               <br />
               lands through their own local government, 
               <br />
               I say the people of Manitoba and the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories are just as capable of ad—

               <br />
               to some difﬁculties that might be suggested, 
               <br />
               with regard to immigration. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suppose.</span> he 
               <br />
               ref-ers to homestead entries and matters of 
               <br />
               that kind. These questions would have to 
               <br />
               be dealt with between this government and 
               <br />
               the government of the territories. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that reasonable provisions could be 
               <br />
               made with the people of the North-west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories which would ensure to the people 
               <br />
               of the country as a whole that there would 
               <br />
               be no restriction of immigration by reason 
               <br />
               of any dealing by the North-west Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, with their own lands. The peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the North-west Territories are more 
               <br />
               interested than any one else in Canada 
               <br />
               in having these lands taken up and oc- 
               <br />
               cupied, in having the country settled, and 
               <br />
               in the prosperity that would follow a great 
               <br />
               ﬂood of immigration into that country. So 
               <br />
               far as that question is concerned, it has been 
               <br />
               suggested by Mr. Haultain, I believe, that 
               <br />
               it would not be incapable of solution, and 
               <br />
               that it could be settled satisfactorily not 
               <br />
               only to the people as a whole, but to the 
               <br />
               people of the North-west Territories.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I think I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dealt,.though</span> very brieﬂy, 
               <br />
               with the principal objections which have 
               <br />
               been pointed out in the correspondence and 
               <br />
               in the speeches of the right hon. the Prime

               Minister and the Minister of the Interior in 
               <br />
               dealing with this question. I say in conclu- 
               <br />
               sion that, the people of the North-west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories are practically un-animdus on this 
               <br />
               question, that their government is urgent on 
               <br />
               this question, and as the matter has had the 
               <br />
               consideration of this government for at least 
               <br />
               two years and a half, there seems no good 
               <br />
               reason why active steps should not be taken 
               <br />
               for the purpose of giving to these people 
               <br />
               the rights of local self—government to which 
               <br />
               they are, I believe, justly entitled. I ap- 
               <br />
               prehend no injury, no danger, to the people 
               <br />
               of this country from taking that course. 
               <br />
               On the other hand, I believe the adoption 
               <br />
               of that course will tend to remove and 
               <br />
               obviate friction and dissatisfaction among 
               <br />
               these people which, however, will prevail 
               <br />
               and continue if we longer withhold from

               <br />
               which the people of the west, I believe,

               could exercise just as prudently and as well
