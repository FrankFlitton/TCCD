               West Territories, I would say “ no ” to such a pro-

               where both races should be united. I ask myself 
               <br />
               what is the object to be gained by the measure 
               <br />
               proposed by my hon. friend? Is it to make the 
               <br />
               members of the Legislature of the North-VVest 
               <br />
               speak English? That cannot be the object, be- 
               <br />
               cause they all speak English now, and I understand 
               <br />
               there is not a single elected man who is French. 
               <br />
               Is it his object to prevent the votes and deliber— 
               <br />
               ations of the N orth-VVest Assembly being printed 
               <br />
               in French? That cannot be, for I believe they 
               <br />
               are, in fact, only printed in the English language 
               <br />

               thousands of dollars every year to publish pamph- 
               <br />
               lets for distribution in France, Switzerland, 
               <br />
               Alsace-Lorraine and elsewhere—for what purpose? 
               <br />
               To bring French immigration to Canada, to say 
               <br />
               to those people that when they arrive here they 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd the ordinances of the country and many 
               <br />
               of those ordinances refer mainly to local interests 
               <br />
               and objects—and its laws printed in their own 
               <br />
               language. To deprive them of this privilege 
               <br />
               would be a gross injustice. But my hon. friend 
               <br />
               knew this very well; he knew that if he could pre— 
               <br />
               vent the promulgation and publication of the laws 
               <br />
               and" ordinances of the North-W'est in French, he 
               <br />
               would prevent French immigration into that 
               <br />
               country. He knew it, and he did it with that 
               <br />
               object in view ; he had the courage to acknowledge 
               <br />
               it. I am sorryto say that the Equal Righters who 
               <br />
               are acting with the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               are to blame if a war of races is the result of their 
               <br />
               agitation ; but I hope I am not mistaken in believ— 
               <br />
               ing that many hon. gentlemen, whose names have 
               <br />
               been connected with those of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe and the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Norfolk, do not carry their feelings to that extent. 
               <br />
               I know that amongst them there are men who do not 
               <br />
               wish anything of that kind to happen. It is very 
               <br />
