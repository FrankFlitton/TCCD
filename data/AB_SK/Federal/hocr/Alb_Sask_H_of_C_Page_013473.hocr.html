               to choose. if. we deny them the right to select 
               <br />
               for themselves. then, when the day comes.

               as it must before long. when some part of

               the Territories will ask for admission and

               be entitled by their population and position

               understanding of his remarks. Of course it 
               <br />
               is an important declaration from the First 
               <br />
               Minister. Now, the House will have to use 
               <br />
               its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">own</span> judgment on this question. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> 
               <br />
               I say is this : that if this question of separate 
               <br />
               schools is to remain in its present position 
               <br />
               until we grant provincial autonomy to any 
               <br />
               portion of the North-west. it will be practi- 
               <br />
               cally impossible. unless there is an enormous 
               <br />
               change in public opinion. to deny them what 
               <br />
               every other province that has joined the 
               <br />
               Confederation has been entitled to. what 
               <br />
               Manitoba was entitled to. and what I sub- 
               <br />
               mit under the circumstances every province 
               <br />
               would be entitled to. Now. let me draw 
               <br />
               attention to the constitution conferred upon 
               <br />
               Manitoba. in that regard. I have not got 
               <br />
               it under my hand, but it will be found on 
               <br />
               consulting it that when we conferred au- 
               <br />
               tonomy upon the province of Manitoba we 
               <br />
               did it by reference to the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> we declared was. that 
               <br />
               where not otherwise provided for in the Act, 
               <br />
               all the provisions of the British North Am- 
               <br />
               erica Act should apply to the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and I think the very same words 
               <br />
               were contained in the resolutions which were 
               <br />
               passed at the time British Columbia and the 
               <br />
               province of Prince Edward Island came into 
               <br />
               the Union. So that we have got that pre- 
               <br />
               cedent before us : that was the promise upon
