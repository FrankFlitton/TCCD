               Mr. McMULLEN. I do not wish to give 
               <br />
               a silent vote upon this question. The Bill 
               <br />
               introduced by the hon. member for- North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) in 1890 had two 
               <br />
               clauses linked together, one being with re- 
               <br />
               gard to the abolition of the dual language 
               <br />
               in the North-west Territories, and the other 
               <br />
               with reference to separate schools. On that 
               <br />
               occasion I supported the Bill. with the in- 
               <br />
               tention when we got into committee of sup-

               <br />
               of economy. It was not because I have any 
               <br />
               feeling whatever against the French prpu-

               wish to deprive them of any rights; but 
               <br />
               because I was led to understand that the

               necessary expense on the country. ‘With

               <br />
               with education, I am strongly inclined to 
               <br />
               respect the stand taken by the Hon. Alex.

               ing the privileges the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               minority now enjoy, and I am also in 
               <br />
               favour of the views expressed by the 
               <br />
               Hon. Edward Blake on that occasion. For 
               <br />
               my part, I am not an advocate of separ-

               <br />
               Wish by force of law to take from any 
               <br />
               Catholic minority the right to have separate 
               <br />
               schools if they desire to exercise that right. 
               <br />

               not agree to make the schools absolutely 
               <br />

               continuation of the separate schools as they 
               <br />

               <br />
