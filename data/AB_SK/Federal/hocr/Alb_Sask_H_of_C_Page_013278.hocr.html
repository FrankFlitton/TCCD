               gentleman referred to almost every country of the

               <br />
               the example shown us by the United States. There 
               <br />
               is not a doubt that in that great country their

               <br />
               have been to a very great extent secured by the

               fact that they have one common school system,

               this House recognises as a great student of history

               I listened to the remark of the hon. the Premier 
               <br />
               himself when he replied to the leader of the Oppo- 
               <br />
               sition—a leader for whom we all have more than 
               <br />
               ordinary respect and towards whom we entertain 
               <br />
               feelings akin to love and affection. This makes it 
               <br />
               all the harder for me to speak on this occasion, for 
               <br />
               I know that in saying what I do say and in feel- 
               <br />
               ing as I do feel, I am not in accord with the views 
               <br />
               of the Liberal leader; but, on the contrary, I am 
               <br />
               doing that, and I am saying that, and I shall vote 
               <br />
               that way which is contrary to his wishes, and 
               <br />
               perhaps shall hurt his feelings in a way I would 
               <br />
               not like. I think that the hon. the leader of the 
               <br />
               Opposition was right when he said that at all times 
               <br />
               in the history of Canada the rights of the minority 
               <br />
               were disregarded by the Conservative party. \Ve 
               <br />
               have only to go back to the times of the “ Family 
               <br />
               Compact.” We have only to go back to the seign- 
               <br />
               iorial tenures—the abolition of which the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman took credit for the Conservative 
               <br />
               party, to prove this. Why, Sir, everything in the 
               <br />
               way of reform which has been done by the Con- 
               <br />
               servative party (if my reading of history is cor- 
               <br />
               rect) has been brought about by the bayonet of 
               <br />
               argument addressed by the Reform party to the 
               <br />
               Conservative party of this country. The Conserva- 
               <br />
               tives have been forced time and time again to do 
               <br />
               that which they say now they did willingly, but 
               <br />
               which they only did willingly because it was done 
               <br />
               for the purpose of preserving themselves in 
               <br />
               power. We ﬁnd now that the Conservative 
               <br />
               party in this House are actually, partially acceding 
               <br />
               to the proposition of the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). If the hon. the First 
               <br />
               Minister regards the rights of the minority, why 
               <br />
               did he not support the amendment of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil)? No ; on the

               <br />
               in point of time, practically the same thing. The

               hon. Minister appeals to this House, not to be 
               <br />
               possessed of animus, not to create racial or creed 
               <br />
               animosity. We know that the right hon. First 
               <br />
               Minister is the general-in-chief of Mr. Meredith, 
               <br />
               who is carrying on a crusade against Mr. Mowat 
               <br />
               in respect to Separate Schools and the alleged use of 
               <br />
               French in the schools in Ontario ; and if the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman is consistent, after the language he 
               <br />
               used this afternoon, he will write to Mr. Meredith 
               <br />
               and tell him to stop this crusade ; and not only So, 
               <br />
               but he will support Mr. Mowat in his efforts to do 
               <br />
               what is right and just to the French minority in

               <br />
               the resolution itself was a gnat, or that the hon. 
               <br />

               referred to the hon. member, he made a very

               <br />
               the gnat really is——I suppose he meant the com-

               mon gnat, because that is the animal that does the

               And the hon. First Minister spoke of the irritation 
               <br />
               caused by the sting of the gnat. But here is the 
               <br />
               peculiar part of it. If the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe is a common gnat, he must be a female 
               <br />
               gnat, because it is only the female gnat that inserts 
               <br />
               this irritating ﬂuid which is spoken oﬁ' : 
               <br />

               But there is danger in calling my hon. friend from
