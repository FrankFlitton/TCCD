               gentleman express his approval of my sentiments, 
               <br />
               because if we do what this resolution proposes we 
               <br />
               would enable a minority in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-lVest</span> Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces to exercise the same power and control over 
               <br />
               the destinies of that country that a minority has 
               <br />
               exercised over the destinies of this country, an 
               <br />
               inﬂuence and power which has not been for the 
               <br />
               best interests of the Dominion. That is another 
               <br />
               reason, because it can be very well understood 
               <br />
               that if this power of continuing two languages is 
               <br />
               made a subject of local legislation, that minority 
               <br />
               may, by taking advantage of party conﬂicts, do 
               <br />
               what in our history has been done frequently, and 
               <br />
               What was done in old Canada, exercise a control- 
               <br />
               ling power to which neither their number nor their 
               <br />
               inﬂuence entitled them. That is a very important 
               <br />
               reason why the power should not be placed in the 
               <br />
               hands of the Local Legislature of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest.</span> 
               <br />
               Those are two very decided reasons why we should 
               <br />
               not deal with it as a local question and give away 
               <br />
               the power which belongs to us and to no one else. 
               <br />
               Another reason <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whykhon.</span> gentlemen should object 
               <br />
               to the amendment is, and it is a reason which is 
               <br />
               a very important and practical one, that, if the 
               <br />
               amendment were carried, it would not be worth 
               <br />
               the paper on which it is written. It does nothing 
               <br />
               —it does not repeal the statute. What assurance 
               <br />
               have we that the people of the North-West would 
               <br />
               ever get the power to do what the resolution asks? 
               <br />
               Does the hon. gentleman mean to say that by a 
               <br />
               resolution of this House we can repeal a clause of 
               <br />

               Mr. O’BRIEN. Upon the grounds which I have 
               <br />
               stated’I say that this House cannot recognise the 
               <br />
               deduction which the hon. gentleman endeavored to 
               <br />
               draw from his historical reference to the incidents 
               <br />
               of other nationalities. Let me disclaim entirely 
               <br />
               (although very likely the disclaimer on account of 
               <br />
               the very great representations already made may 
               <br />
               not amount to much) any intention to demand the 
               <br />
               total abolition of the French language, we demand 
               <br />
               the abolition of the French language as an ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               language in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-IVest,</span> where only ﬁve-sixths 
               <br />
               of the people know the language, and this has been 
               <br />
               treated as an attack on the French language <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per</span> se. 
               <br />
               Those who make that statement know that it is 
               <br />
               absolutely without foundation. They must know 
               <br />
               that nobody desires to interfere with the French 
               <br />
               language in any way where it is useful or neces- 
               <br />
               sary. Hereafter I venture to say that there will be 
               <br />
               but one language in this Dominion and that will 
               <br />
               be the language which should be used in all the 
               <br />
               new Provinces of this country ; the language which 
               <br />
               must be the ofﬁcial language of the Dominion if 
               <br />
               this is ever to be a great or prosperous country. 
               <br />
               If the member for East Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) had 
               <br />
               carried his historical references as far as Austro- 
               <br />
               Hungary, to which the analogy would more 
               <br />
               closely apply, he would ﬁnd that the people 
               <br />
               of that country, where there are more than ﬁve 
               <br />
               languages spoken,have to come to precisely the same 
               <br />
               conclusion as the hon. member who introduced 
               <br />
               this Bill, and he would ﬁnd that in Hungary, 
               <br />
               where there are the Magyar, the Saxon and 
               <br />
               Roumanian languages, all used in the ordinary 
               <br />
               pursuits of life, the Hungarian language is imposed 
               <br />
               as an absolute necessity, because it was discovered 
               <br />
               that the use of all these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dilferent</span> languages led to 
               <br />
               discord and rendered government impossible. On

               the other hand, in Austria, where there are several 
               <br />
               languages of a similar character, the attempt made 
               <br />
               by the recent Government to allow the use of all 
               <br />
               these languages in ofﬁcial documents has led to 
               <br />
               endless confusion, has fomented discord, and 
               <br />
               brought about endless trouble in the community. 
               <br />
               Even here, the analogy does not hold good no more 
               <br />
               than in the case of Switzerland, because there we 
               <br />
               have distinct nationalities federated for special 
               <br />
               purposes. And everyone knows that the Emperor 
               <br />
               of Austria is also King of Hungary. I do not 
               <br />
               intend to occupy the time of this House any 
               <br />
               longer, and I will merely recapitulate the grounds 
               <br />
               upon which I object to this amendment. It 
               <br />
               means nothing, it does nothing, and it produces 
               <br />
               no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁ'ect.</span> It is no answer to the petitions 
               <br />
               which have been sent here asking that a change 
               <br />
               should be made in the law. I further say that 
               <br />
               this is not a local question, and for the reasons I 
               <br />
               have given that it camiot be properly dealt with 
               <br />
               as a local question. The duty and responsibility 
               <br />
               connected with the matter belongs to this House, 
               <br />
               and they should not, and ought not, delegate it to 
               <br />
               any one. The question should be dealt with as 
               <br />
               the Bill of the hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) proposes to deal with it. Those who 
               <br />
               do not like the Bill can vote against it and sa that 
               <br />
               the French language shall continue in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">N'orth-</span> 
               <br />
               West Territories. Those who think there ought 
               <br />
               to but one language, in accordance with the well-
