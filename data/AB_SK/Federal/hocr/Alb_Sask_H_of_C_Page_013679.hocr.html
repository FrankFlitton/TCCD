               Mr. SCOTT. It is perfectly clear. The 
               <br />
               members of the North-west government 
               <br />
               were under some misapprehension as to the 
               <br />
               measure of control that the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment were going to exercise over the 
               <br />
               capital advance. But, when they read the 
               <br />
               words that the hon. Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               used here the other evening when the ad- 
               <br />
               vance was being voted that practically the 
               <br />
               money will be entirely under the control 
               <br />
               of the local authorities they will have no 
               <br />
               further objection as indeed they cannot 
               <br />
               have. But, to proceed with what I was 
               <br />
               saying here, I go even farther and I will 
               <br />
               state that when we submitted our ﬁnal pro- 
               <br />
               posal to the hon. Minister of Finance, a pro- 
               <br />
               posal which he has met in every particular 
               <br />
               this year, I communicated the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁect</span> of it to 
               <br />
               the members of the North-west government 
               <br />
               and I received a reply to the effect that the 
               <br />
               proposed provision would be considered rea- 
               <br />
               sonably satisfactory, and would fairly well 
               <br />
               meet their needs. I do not wish the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen to misunderstand me to mean 
               <br />
               that the North-west government indicated 
               <br />
               that they regarded this proposition as giving 
               <br />
               them everything that they were entitled to 
               <br />
               but they led us to believe that they would 
               <br />
               be reasonably able to carry on all the ser- 
               <br />

               <br />
               proposition were carried out.

               out that our limited and inadequate revenues

               The fact is that the lack of power to 
               <br />
               borrow money, to pledge the public credit, to 
               <br />
               undertake permanent works and spread the 
               <br />
               payment over a long period of years so as 
               <br />

               works constructed now has been seriously 
               <br />
               complained of for years. This lack is one 
               <br />
               of the strong features of the gradual growth

               tlemen from Saskatchewan (Mr. Davis) and 
               <br />
               from Alberta (Mr. Oliver) have shown, the 
               <br />
               grant made to the territorial government this 
               <br />
               year is a very much larger grant, taken pro- 
               <br />
               portionately or measured in any other way, 
               <br />
               than the grant given in any former year. 
               <br />
               Including the advance, it is actually more, 
               <br />
               than the North-west government stated in 
               <br />
               their estimates this year was necessary for 
               <br />
               their various purposes. The hon. the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition will ﬁnd in Mr. I—Ianltain’s 
               <br />
               budget speech, that he asked for $1,130,000, 
               <br />
               and he has received in all, on current re— 
               <br />
               venue account, $957,979, which is apart al- 
               <br />
               together from the $84,000 grant for bridge 
               <br />
               construction, and apart altogether from the 
               <br />
               capital advance. The amount granted there- 
               <br />
