               the hon. member for Assiniboia <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vest</span> (Mr.

               <br />
               the western Provinces to strike out section 110. 
               <br />
               I come from a Province where, as the member for 
               <br />
               Kent (Mr. Landry) has said, there are a consi- 
               <br />
               derable number of French-speaking people. We 
               <br />
               come from a Province which has not the dual lan- 
               <br />
               guage, from a Province where <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> live on terms 
               <br />
               of good-will with each other ; and no better evid~

               speaking people in that Province can be furnished, 
               <br />
               than the fact that a great party in that Province, 
               <br />
               mainly an English-speaking party, some years ago, 
               <br />
               chose as their leader the hon. member for Kent 
               <br />
               (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Landry),</span> Whom we all respected and knew 
               <br />
               to be a capable administrator, and he held for some 
               <br />
               time a. very important portfolio in the Government 
               <br />
               of that Province. The argument of the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for West Durham (Mr. Blake), that the conti- 
               <br />
               nuation of section 110 would have the effect of 
               <br />
               attracting emigrants from the New England States 
               <br />
               and leading to emigration westward seems to me 
               <br />
               to be not well founded on fact. Thirteen years 
               <br />
               ago this House passed section 110 as a bid for 
               <br />
               emigrants for the North-VVest; but that section 
               <br />
               has not had the effect of drawing emigrants there, 
               <br />
               and any French Canadians who have emigrated 
               <br />
               have gone to the factories and farms of the New 
               <br />
               England States. Many of my French Canadian 
               <br />
               friends have said to me since this discussion 
               <br />
               began : Be reasonable and endeavor to understand 
               <br />
               the present situation ; suppose a hundred 
               <br />
               years ago the French had obtained possession of 
               <br />
               the northern part of the continent, and you and 
               <br />
               yours were in the minority, how would you feel 
               <br />
               about this question? I said: I would hope that 
               <br />
               the French Government would deal as generously 
               <br />
               as the English have been disposed to deal with the 
               <br />
               French people in the Provinces ; but I would say 
               <br />
               frankly that in the matter of carving out new Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, however much I might desire the English 
               <br />
               language to be retained, I must accept the facts of 
               <br />
               history and could not hope for the perpetuation of 
               <br />
               my own language as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">official</span> language. I have 
               <br />
               only this to say in favor of repealing section 
               <br />
               110, and it is this : that I a ree with ever argu- 
               <br />
               ment made in its favor. thought a powerful 
               <br />
               ar ument was made by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) in the earlier part of 
               <br />
               his speech, in which he appeared to devote close 
               <br />
               attention to the precise question before the House ; 
               <br />
               and I concur in the opinion that it is desirable, 
               <br />
               other things being equal, without breaking faith, 
               <br />
               to have but one language, that Government is easier 
               <br />
               and that friction is less among a people in a 
               <br />
               country which has a homogeneous people. This 
               <br />
               remark is made by one whose duty all his life has 
               <br />
               been to study history, and I venture to say there is 
               <br />
               not in Europe a sin 1e example of a nation, with two 
               <br />
               rival races jealous y <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preserving</span> their own nation- 
               <br />
               ality, and nearly aqua in strength, whose power is 
               <br />
               at all commensurate with her resources and popula- 
               <br />
               tion as compared with a homogeneous nation. I will

               not follow that out in detail, because it has been 
               <br />
               discusssed fully by gentlemen on both sides of the 
               <br />
               House. In Switzerland, where there are three 
               <br />
               languages, the people live in good-will; but the 
               <br />
               force that holds Switzerland together is the iron 
               <br />
               band of pressure from the outside. If we had 
               <br />
               on the north and west of us, as we have on the 
               <br />
               south of us, jealous nations whom we felt were 
               <br />
               quite willing to eat us up at an hour’s notice, I 
               <br />
               think we would have better feelings of brotherly 
               <br />
               love than we have now. The case of Austro-Hun- 
               <br />
               gary was different from that of Switzerland, but I 
               <br />
               have not time to enter at any great length into 
               <br />
               the question of why Austro-Hungary, since that 
               <br />
               great duel on the ﬁeld of Sadowa, has not an in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence consistent with her large population, her 
               <br />
               fertile soil, and her great resources. Germany on 
               <br />
               the north, with far less population, is, beyond all 
               <br />
               question, themore powerfulnation ; that is, the nation 
               <br />
               with a comparatively homogeneous race is stronger 
               <br />
               than the other, although nominally the smaller. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from Noth Bruce (Mr. McNeill) 
               <br />
               made a very pertinent argument in the case of 
               <br />
               England, when he pointed out that when England 
               <br />
               was occupied by two rival races, the Saxons and 
               <br />
               the Normans, she made very little progress; but 
               <br />
               when these nations were fused together she went 
               <br />
               forward by leaps and bounds. The most pertinent 
               <br />
               of all the arguments advanced, to my thinking, is 
               <br />
               the argument based on facts with which we are all 
               <br />
               acquainted. We know something of the course of 
               <br />
               events in the great Republic to the south. Her 
               <br />
               success is something phenomenal in the history of 
               <br />
               nations ; and what is the policy which that great, 
               <br />
               progressive and sensible people have pursued in 
               <br />
               this matter of founding a new colony ‘3 Have they 
               <br />
               not stood by the one language? Have they not 
               <br />
               stood by the public schools? Have they not stood 
               <br />
               by the common law of England, those just and 
               <br />
               clement laws, those institutions of government 
               <br />
               which guarantee personal liberty ‘2 Have they not 
               <br />
               held those out to the foreign nations, saying: 
               <br />
               “Come and share these laws with us, enjoy this 
               <br />
               liberty with us.” And have not their most enlight- 
               <br />
               ened men, ever since they planted this policy in the 
               <br />
               land, discovered that these laws were a mighty force 
               <br />
               of assimilation and tended to make a people com- 
               <br />
               pact? To secure this homogeneity, it seems to me 
               <br />
               that, in this new commonwealth, it will be 
               <br />
               unwise to allure immigrants from France, from 
               <br />
               Denmark, from Germany, from Sweden, and 
               <br />
               from other foreign countries, by the hope that 
               <br />
               when they come into this Dominion, in our 
               <br />
               courts of justice, in our Legislatures, they will 
               <br />
               be entitled to the free use of their own language. 
               <br />
               I think, if we do so, we are holding out to 
               <br />
               them an illusive hope. I think it better to say 
               <br />
               to the Danes, Germans, Prussians, French and 
               <br />
               others who come here : we welcome you all ; there 
               <br />
               are our fertile lands, occupy them ; and there are 
               <br />
               our mighty English laws guarding your lives and 
               <br />
               property. There are schools in which your child— 
               <br />
               ren may be taught ; there are representative insti- 
               <br />
               tutions of Government. If you wish, you can have 
               <br />
