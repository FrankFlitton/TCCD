               Mr. PALMER. Representation by population

               vinces are throwing their resources into one

               <br />
               debt of Prince Edward island is nothing. Our 
               <br />
               taxation is vastly below that of other provin- 
               <br />
               ces. Our trade and revenue are rapidly in- 
               <br />
               creasing. Why give up so great a certainty for 
               <br />
               an uncertain beneﬁt where we have only a feeble 
               <br />
               voice? Looking ﬁrst at the larger provinces,

               Canada has secured for herself a greater rum-

               to population under all circumstances to be 
               <br />
               sound, it is, in the opinion of this House, par- 
               <br />
               ticularly objectionable as applied to this island 
               <br />
               in connection with Canada, taking into consid- 
               <br />
               eration that the number of our inhabitants is, 
               <br />
               and must continue comparatively small, owing 
               <br />
               to the fact that we have no Crown lands, mines, 
               <br />
               minerals or other resources suﬂ‘icient to induce 
               <br />
               immigrants to settle here, and that we never 
               <br />
               can expect to become to any extent a manufac-

               trade and communication with other countries 
               <br />
               stopped. Under this principle, the city of 
               <br />
               Montreal alone would at the present time, have 
               <br />
               a representation greater than the whole pro-

               <br />
               particularly the former—~and the certainty of a 
               <br />
               still greater increase therein in the future.
