               enough to assert a single word of dissent to them)

               natural outcome which is here announced on the 
               <br />
               ﬂoor of Parliament. If my ears did not deceive 
               <br />
               me I think I heard the Minister of Public Works 
               <br />
               speak of the autonomy of his race, and state 
               <br />

               <br />
               all that might be done against it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“7e</span> must 
               <br />
               remember that this has been a British colony for 
               <br />
               over a century and a quarter, and that within a 
               <br />
               very short period after the cession—I was nearly 
               <br />
               using the unfortunate word conquest—a distin- 
               <br />
               guished French traveller passing through here was 
               <br />
               able to announce that the French Canadians were 
               <br />
               better treated under the English than they were un- 
               <br />
               der their own Kings. We must remember that from 
               <br />
               that time to this they have enjoyed a liberty which 
               <br />
               they could not possibly have enjoyed under the 
               <br />
               Crown of France yet ; notwithstanding this, they 
               <br />
               are endeavoring to perpetuate this race and nation 
               <br />
               cry mainly by their language, which is the soul of 
               <br />
               the nation, as this writer says. If the language was 
               <br />
               permitted to die out, as it would naturally do, all 
               <br />
               this ambition, which must end in delusion, which 
               <br />
               can never end in anything but delusion and which 
               <br />
               can never lead to any accomplished fact, would soon 
               <br />
               disappear. We have no jealousy of the Germans, 
               <br />
               we have no jealousy of any other nationality,because 
               <br />
               we know that while they speak in their own tongue, 
               <br />
               and for years after they come here are not able to 
               <br />
               speak any other tongue, yet they do not propose to 
               <br />
               divide the people of this country by their race cries 
               <br />
               and race feelings. Now these are the problems we 
               <br />
               have to deal with. There is no use our going to 
               <br />
               Switzerland or to Austro-Hungary for examples. 
               <br />
               We have to deal with the question we have here at 
               <br />
               home ; and the practical question is, whether, under 
               <br />
               these circumstances, we should permit this kind of 
               <br />
               thing to go on. Whatever I might do bye-and- 
               <br />
               by, no man is responsible for my acts. The 
               <br />
               gentlemen who vote with me now, and the 
               <br />
               gentlemen who disagree with me, are not respon- 
               <br />
               sible for what I may do bye-and—by. I may state— 
               <br />
               as these hon. gentlemen who have done me the 
               <br />
               honor of followin my utterances with so much 
               <br />
               care know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">well—filiat</span> I have never pretended to 
               <br />
               believe or to say that it was possible to deal with 
               <br />
               the dual language in the Province of Quebec. I 
               <br />
               realise that that is beyond the hope of being dealt 
               <br />
               with by any possible legislation. I realise that 
               <br />
               that has been allowed to grow into such monstrous 
               <br />
               proportions that we can never hope to cope with it, 
               <br />
               except by natural ways <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and.</span> by natural causes 
               <br />
               which possiblymay work a cure. Notin our day, but 
               <br />
               within perhaps a time that one can imagine, it may 
               <br />
               work out its own cure. I look forward to the 
               <br />
               assimilation that is going on by reason of the 
               <br />
               travellin backwards and forwards between the 
               <br />
               French anadians of Quebec and the Eastern 
               <br />
               States of the Union. Do what you will, the people 
               <br />
               do go and will go to the Eastern States. Do what 
               <br />
               you will, they will more or less imbibe the language 
               <br />

               does no injustice to my French Canadian fellow

               dreamed of interfering. I do not say, Sir, that the 
               <br />
               time may not come when it will be proper to move—— 
               <br />
               though in that I do not ﬁnd much sympathy in this 
               <br />
               House—to do away with the dual language in this 
               <br />
               Chamber. The time has not come yet, that is quite 
               <br />
               certain. What we are dealing with now is this 
               <br />
               question in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North’VVest,</span> and' do not let us mix 
               <br />
               up questions that have nothing at all to do with it. 
               <br />
               One hon. gentleman said I had introduced even a 
               <br />
               religious cry. Why, Sir, is freedom of speech so 
               <br />
               gone in this country that I cannot express my dissent 
               <br />
               from the system of separate schools which exists in 
               <br />
               my own Province without being told that I am 
               <br />
               raising a religious cry ‘2 Is that a question of reli- 
               <br />
               gion ‘2 Is not that a question of great state policy 
               <br />
               as to how our children shall be educated ‘? And I 
               <br />
               do hope that before very long the delegation from 
               <br />
               the Province of Ontario will call on this House for 
               <br />
               its aid to blot out the Separate School clausefrom the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, which limits and fetters 
               <br />
               the people of that Province. That clause was carried 
               <br />
               by a majority of French Canadians, and was imposed 
               <br />
               upon the people of Ontario against their will ; and 
               <br />
               I am sorry to differ from my hon. leader on that 
               <br />
               question. He tells us ~— aud I never feel more 
               <br />
               humiliated than when I hear him speak on that 
               <br />
               subject —— that he participated in imposing that 
               <br />
               Separate School system upon us. But is it 
               <br />
               possible that the free people of Ontario are not to be 
               <br />
               placed in the same position as the people by the 
               <br />
               sea on both sides of them, in the Maritime Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces and in British Columbia? If they could 
               <br />
               not ask this Parliament to aid in freeing them from 
               <br />
               the restrictions imposed upon them I would despair 
               <br />
               of the freedom of this country. But that has no- 
               <br />
               thing to do with this question. All these are aside 
               <br />
               from it, and will be properly dealt with when they 
               <br />
               come up and not before. What We are dealing 
               <br />
               with now is the question whether this Bill for the 
               <br />
               repeal of the duallanguage in the North-VVest should 
               <br />
               or should not become law ; that and that only is the 
               <br />
               question before us. I am sorry, Sir, that the hon. 
               <br />
               member for West Durham (Mr. Blake) has been 
               <br />
               compelled by the unfortunate event to which he 
               <br />
               alluded to absent himself from this discussion. It 
               <br />
               is not pleasant to speak of an hon. gentleman be- 
               <br />
               hind his back, for I cannot quite accept the theory 
               <br />
               put forward by the hon. member for East Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. Cook), that that gives one a better privilege 
               <br />
               to abuse a man ; but, perhaps, I may be allowed to
