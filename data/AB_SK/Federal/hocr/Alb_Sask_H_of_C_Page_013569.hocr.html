               they viewed it. I think we must admit that 
               <br />
               it is an unfortunate thing, after the ex- 
               <br />
               perience which the hon. gentleman, now 
               <br />
               the head of his department, has had in

               Manitoba, if an arrangement cannot he 
               <br />
               arrived at which will be satisfactory. There 
               <br />
               might have been some excuse in the years 
               <br />
               gone by with the government that preceded 
               <br />
               the present government in total ignorance 
               <br />
               of Manitoba at that time, but I think that 
               <br />
               it is unfortunate, to say the least, that at 
               <br />
               this time and with the experience that these 
               <br />
               men have had of the west, we are not able 
               <br />
               to agree on some form of government here. 
               <br />
               I am pleased :that this debate has brought 
               <br />
               out something that it is quite evident was 
               <br />
               not known at the time of the Indian Head 
               <br />
               meeting. I heard many of the people say 
               <br />
               after the meeting that they were pleased to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> Mr. Haultain placed in such a position 
               <br />
               that they could understand where he was. 
               <br />
               It is evident that Mr. Haultain has not been 
               <br />
               able to ascertain exactly where the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior stood. However, I 
               <br />
               think that this debate has brought forth 
               <br />
               very clearly the fact that he, for the pres- 
               <br />
               ent, at least, is not prepared to say that 
               <br />
               they should have provincial government in 
               <br />
               the west for the next four or ﬁve years. It 
               <br />
               is quite clear that has been brought forth 
               <br />
               and also it has been brought out that the 
               <br />
               form of school legislation that they now 
               <br />
               have would have been satisfactory to him. 
               <br />
               I, for my part, trust that it may be and 
               <br />
               whatever will satisfy them will satisfy me. 
               <br />
               We have also had brought forth in the de— 
               <br />
               bate the fact that the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Assiniboia (Mr. Douglas) is not in

               Boyd) has endeavoured to explain the refer—

               ence he made to the feeling expressed at 
               <br />
               the Indian Head meeting. I understood 
               <br />
               him to say that the people were divided 
               <br />
               there on the question as between one or 
               <br />
               two provinces.

               Mr. SCOTT. The question as between 
               <br />
               one or two provinces in the North-west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories on which the people are divided, is 
               <br />
               as between-two provinces or one province 
               <br />
               to be made up out of the present organ- 
               <br />
               ized territories. The Indian Head meet- 
               <br />
               ing was called to hear a discussion be- 
               <br />
               tween the premier of the territories and 
               <br />
               the premier of Manitoba on the ques- 
               <br />
               tion as to whether the North-weset Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories should be formed into a province, 
               <br />
               or whether part of the North-west Territor- 
               <br />
               ies should be placed in the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, which is an entirely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diiferent</span> 
               <br />
               question. My 11.01]. friend the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior stated that there were various 
               <br />
               opinions amongst the people of the terri- 
               <br />
               tories, and that in certain parts of the terri- 
               <br />
               tories there was a feeling in favour of a 
               <br />
               portion being placed in the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. I would bring to the attention 
               <br />
               of the House that within the last few days 
               <br />
               this matter was voted upon in the legisla- 
               <br />
               tive assembly at Regina, and by a practi-
