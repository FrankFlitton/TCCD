               <br />
               therefore a mistake to suppose that a language dies 
               <br />
               readily because it is not ofﬁcially used. The fact 
               <br />
               is that the ofﬁcial use of a language makes very 
               <br />
               little impression upon its vitality. The interference 
               <br />
               of the state in the direction of repression and dis-

               <br />
               different thing when you have a colony of a number 
               <br />

               The 19th article of the constitution of the Austrian 
               <br />
               Empire provides that : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ All tribes in the state have equal rights, and each 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               has an inviolable right to maintain its nationality and 
               <br />
               language.” 
               <br />
               It is clear from that that the Austrian Empire is 
               <br />
               not organised politically on the unitary principle 
               <br />
               advocated by the hon. member for Muskoka (Mr. 
               <br />
               O’Brien) and the hon. membr for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy). Even in the despotic govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Russia, there is no attempt to denational-

               <br />
               of instances, except for political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂ‘ences.</span> The 
               <br />
               people of Finland, who were for 500 years under 
               <br />
               the government of Sweden, where Swedish was 
               <br />
               the ofﬁcial language, when that became a Russian 
               <br />
               province after the Treaty of Tilsit, not more than 
               <br />
               one in ten spoke Swedish, have not been interfered 
               <br />
               with in the use of the Finnish language by the 
               <br />
               Government of Russia. Justice is administered 
               <br />
               and the government is carried on in that language. 
               <br />
               There is no attempt to impose the Russian language 
               <br />
               upon that people. The education of the people 
               <br />
               and the schools and all their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> are carried on 
               <br />
               in their own language. The Russian Government 
               <br />
               has fostered the national tendencies, and Finland 
               <br />
               is loyal to Russia, because Russia has encouraged 
               <br />
               her to be Finnish, and has not insisted upon her 
               <br />
               becoming Russian. She has been weaned from any 
               <br />
               desire to reunite with Sweden, by giving full play 
               <br />
               to her national instincts and her national aspira- 
               <br />
               tions. In regard to this a modern Russian author, 
               <br />
               Tikhomirov, says:

               rope where the views of the hon. gentleman

               <br />
               United Netherlands between 1816 and 1830. It 
               <br />
               is well known that, after the fall of Napoleon and 
               <br />
               his exile to Elba, the members of the Congress of 
               <br />
               Vienna came to the conclusion that it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desire</span> 
               <br />
               able to establish a somewhat strong state on the 
               <br />
               north-eastern borders of France, and they conse- 
               <br />
               quently made a provision to unite Belgium and 
               <br />
               Holland. At that time Holland had a population 
               <br />
               of 2,280,000, and Belgium a population of 3,380,000. 
               <br />
               They were given equalrepresentation, and provision 
               <br />
               was made for a government in most respects was 
               <br />
               satisfactory to the population of each country. 
               <br />
               When Napoleon escaped from Elba, it was thought 
               <br />
               desirable in the emergency to confer special powers 
               <br />
               upon the king, but he continued to exercise those 
               <br />
               powers for many years after the emergency had 
               <br />
               passed. During the period in which he exercised 
               <br />
               that power, the king forbade the use of the French 
               <br />
               language. Half the population knew nothing else. 
               <br />
               The king insisted that justice should be adminis- 
               <br />
               tered in all the courts in Dutch, and the result 
               <br />
               was that all the judges in the Belgian section were 
               <br />
               compelled to resign, and nearly all the lawyers had 
               <br />
               to abandon their profession. The king also pro- 
               <br />
               vided that no one should be licensed to teach in a 
               <br />
               public school unless he could speak Dutch, and 
               <br />
               consequently half the teachers in his kingdom had 
               <br />
               to resign. Private schools were then established 
               <br />
               in the Belgian section of the kingdom, and then the 
               <br />
               king issued a new decree forbidding private schools 
               <br />
               to be established without the king’s license and so 
               <br />
               they were shut up. Then the king thought it neces- 
               <br />
               sary not only that the people should speak one lan- 
               <br />

               <br />
               they should have only one faith, and so German and 
               <br />
               Protestant professors were appointed in Roman Ca- 
               <br />
               tholic colleges which had been established for the 
               <br />
               education of Roman Catholic students. The King 
               <br />
               of the Netherlands had, at all events, the courage of 
               <br />
               his convictions. He did not try to enforce these 
               <br />
               provisions in a far off corner of the country where 
               <br />
               there were few Belgians, but he made these regula- 
               <br />
               tions in a country where there were 400 Belgians to 
               <br />
               the square mile. The result was to establish two 
               <br />
               geographical parties. One—half of his kingdom was 
               <br />
               arrayed against the other half ; and in one-half 
               <br />
               60,000 men were soon under arms ﬁghting for the 
               <br />
               rights which the king had disregarded. The result 
               <br />
               was that two states were established Where there 
               <br />

               anxiety for its abolition, because if Belgium had 
               <br />
               not received the active support of En land, it would 
               <br />
