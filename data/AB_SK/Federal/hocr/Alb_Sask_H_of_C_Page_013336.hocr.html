               form a part of What is now the Dominion of Canada. 
               <br />
               However that may be, instead of encouraging them in 
               <br />
               the use of their language, had a policy been pursued 
               <br />
               of inducing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them—not</span> by any harsh means at all, 
               <br />
               not by any aggravating measures—to speak the

               Mr. MCCARTHY. I shall be glad to have an

               explanation, but I must accept the deﬁnition of 
               <br />
               the word as I ﬁnd it. Nationalism means French 
               <br />
               nationality in that sense. What did Mr. Mercier
