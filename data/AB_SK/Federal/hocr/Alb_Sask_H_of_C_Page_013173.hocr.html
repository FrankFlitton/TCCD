               whatever may be his faith, and we only protest 
               <br />
               when a desire to abridge our rights is manifested 
               <br />
               by some other man against us. We have taken a 
               <br />
               position, of course, against sectarian grants; we 
               <br />
               take a position against union between Church and 
               <br />
               State, and any undue favors shown by the State to 
               <br />
               one church at the expense of another. If this is 
               <br />
               not sound ground, then I am much mistaken; if 
               <br />
               the position that we have taken on this matter is 
               <br />
               not unassailable, then I am laboring under a 
               <br />
               grievous error. I suppose, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Speakerp—although</span> 
               <br />
               the charge is not made directly against me; 
               <br />
               it was against my hon. friend from North 
               <br />
               Simcoe, and is likely to be made against me—I 
               <br />
               suppose that I shall be accused of fanaticism. 
               <br />
               Well, Sir, there may be some ground for it. My 
               <br />
               maternal ancestors were some of them Covenanters 
               <br />
               and were subjected to bitter persecution by the 
               <br />
               bloody Claverhouse. I can remember, as a boy, 
               <br />
               my own father being mobbed in the State of 
               <br />
               New York, because he was an abolitionist. And 
               <br />
               I rather fancy that fanaticism is constitutional 
               <br />
               with me; it may be, I will not deny it. But if 
               <br />
               it is fanaticism to stand up for what I believe 
               <br />
               to be in the best interests of this Dominion, if 
               <br />
               it is fanaticism to attempt to stem the tide that 
               <br />
               sets very strongly against me in this matter, to 
               <br />
               venture to take a position which alienates friends 
               <br />
               and embitters the hostility of foes, then I am 
               <br />
               a. fanatic. But I stand up to-day to assert my 
               <br />
               belief that the use of the French language in 
               <br />
               the North-West as a dual language is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">un‘</span> 
               <br />
               necessary, that the use of the French language as 
               <br />
               an ofﬁcial language in the North-VVest should 
               <br />
               be prohibited, that it may easily be done, 
               <br />
               that no shock or agitation will result from 
               <br />
               doing it, and that it will be an act of supreme folly, 
               <br />
               when the matter is brought to our attention, to 
               <br />
               refuse to do it. The hon. gentleman said there 
               <br />
               are 1,500,000 French in Canada, and they are not 
               <br />
               to be driven from this country. Who asks to 
               <br />
               drive them from Canada. ? Who proposes to drive 
               <br />
               them from it ? Who proposes to deprive them of 
               <br />
               any rights they possess to-day <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?.</span> They are wel- 
               <br />
               come in Canada. We are glad to have them as 
               <br />
               citizens of this country, and we welcome them 
               <br />
               to share everthing with us, and in any action we 
               <br />
               take to have in View the interests of the French as 
               <br />
               well as the Saxon inhabitants of this country. 
               <br />
               Then the hon. gentleman makes the plea of in- 
               <br />
               herent rights to the use of the language in the North- 
               <br />
               VVest, because there are a few thousand French 
               <br />
               Canadians, more or less, in this country. The 
               <br />
               argument would apply to every portion of the 
               <br />
               Dominion where French Canadians are found. If 
               <br />
               there is an inherent right to the use of the French 
               <br />
               language wherever there are French Canadians, 
               <br />
               that right will apply to Ontario, New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island ; and if 
               <br />
               that argument is sound, you must not only retain 
               <br />
               the use of the dual language in the N orth—West, 
               <br />
               but also extend its use over the entire Dom- 
               <br />
               inion. Then the hon. gentleman tells us: 
               <br />
               “ Oh, well, the expense is small, it is 
               <br />
               an exceedingly little thing to make such a. row 
               <br />
               abou .” He said the cost up to this time 
               <br />
               had only been $400 a year, and he added, “I 
               <br />
               will pay that amount out of my own pocket rather 
               <br />
               than have any trouble.” Sir, it is not a matter of 
               <br />
               expense ; that oes not enter into the calculation. 
               <br />
               It is a matter of the future well-being of the North— 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_8" title="bbox 1230 492 2240 3563">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               West ; it is a matter involving the whole welfare of 
               <br />
               the future inhabitants of that great country, which 
               <br />
               may in ﬁfty years have millions of inhabitants, 
               <br />
               instead of a few thousands ; it is a question of 
               <br />
               laying the foundation on which the institutions of 
               <br />
               that country will rest, the moulding of the plastic 
               <br />
               elements which are to form the bed-rock of the 
               <br />
               future. It is not a question of a paltry few hun- 
               <br />
               dred dollars, which may have been spent hitherto 
               <br />
               in the cost of maintaining this system of a dual 
               <br />
               language in this country. Then the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man told us, and he did so in a manner which 
               <br />
               amounted almost to a menace, that the French are 
               <br />
               united, the French in this House are united, they 
               <br />
               will stand by their rights, they will vote as one 
               <br />
               man, for there is no olitics in this question. Well, 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman elt, perhaps, as he has often 
               <br />
               felt before when he has had the entire French 
               <br />
               element at his back, that he was master of the 
               <br />
               situation—very likely he felt so. That is one of 
               <br />
               the troubles which exists in political matters, and 
               <br />
               a combination of that kind on race lines has often 
               <br />
               controlled most important legislation here. I can- 
               <br />
               not retort upon the hon. gentleman by telling him 
               <br />
               that the English are united, because they are not. 
               <br />
               They do not unite readily upon a matter of this 
               <br />
               kind. There are differences of opinion ; they can- 
               <br />
               not be readily united for the purpose of maintaining 
               <br />
               race privileges and interests. There is too much 
               <br />
               magnanimity among <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'them</span> ; they feel it would be 
               <br />
               an act of tyranny to unite on this matter, as the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman claims the French of the country 
               <br />
               have done. But if that feeling is to govern the 
               <br />
               conduct of the French members of this House, if 
               <br />
               they are to unite together on race lines, in the 
               <br />
               manner which the hon. gentleman told us they 
               <br />
               have done on this occasion, the natural result may 
               <br />
               possibly be that it will lead to a union of the same 
               <br />
               kind of the other element ; and this is certainly to 
               <br />
               be deprecated. Then he said : Why not treat 
               <br />
               the French as brothers and friends. Well, surely, 
               <br />
               why not ? We have nothing, we seek nothing 
               <br />
               that we will not share with the French equally. 
               <br />
               What are our aspirations? Look at our annex- 
               <br />
               ations. We have acquired the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-V‘Vest,</span> we 
               <br />
               have acquired British Columbia, we have 
               <br />
               acquired Prince Edward Island, and we wish 
               <br />
               as soon as we can to acquire Newfoundland. We 
               <br />
               are determined to possess one-half of this con- 
               <br />
               tinent. We have built a. system of canals, not for 
               <br />
               our present wants only, but to meet <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span> require- 
               <br />
               ments of the future, and we have perfected a water- 
               <br />
               way from the ocean to the heart of the Continent. 
               <br />
               We have burdened ourselves with an enormous 
               <br />
               debt for the purpose of building a railway from 
               <br />
               ocean to ocean. We are making vast grants and 
               <br />
               subsidies for the purpose of extending the railway 
               <br />
               system of the Dominion. We are carefully and 
               <br />
               laboriously perfecting a code of laws which we 
               <br />
