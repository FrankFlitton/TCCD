               <br />
               announced the aspirations of the French Canadian 
               <br />
               people to be the formation of a great French nation- 
               <br />
               ality, not under the glorious Union Jack, of which 
               <br />
               we hear so much in this House from some hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               men who do not say so much about it in the Province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, but under the Tricolor, and he advised 
               <br />
               the members of both parties to join under the 
               <br />

               <br />
               they wished to unite with France; I quite agree 
               <br />
               that is not their aspiration ; the Republic of 
               <br />
               France does not suit the French Canadians of that

               announce that their nationality was typiﬁed by 
               <br />
               the French ﬂag, the Tricolor of France. That 
               <br />
               that language was uttered at a great meeting of 
               <br />
               ‘ their fellow-countrymen, that that- language was

               uncontradicted. The hon. gentleman did speak
