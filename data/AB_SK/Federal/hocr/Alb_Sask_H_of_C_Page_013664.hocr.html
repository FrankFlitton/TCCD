               vey the idea that this question was a mere

               <br />
               it is not a matter of detail. I say that it is

               an essential question, and that upon this

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               astonished to hear the hon. member (Mr.

               as to Whether there should be one province 
               <br />
               or two was a mere question of detail. The

               question of the number of provinces, and 
               <br />
               the question of the subsidies which these

               The question whether the territories, as 
               <br />
               they are at present, have all the powers 
               <br />
               which a province has, is a question of de- 
               <br />
               tail ; because, if they have not those pow- 
               <br />
               ers, they can be given to them in their 
               <br />
               present condition as well as they could if 
               <br />
               they were a province. The hon. leader of. 
               <br />
               the opposition questioned the previous state- 
               <br />
               ment of the Premier, that the only import- 
               <br />
               ant right belonging to a province which the 
               <br />
               territories did not hold was the right to in- 
               <br />
               cur debt. That statement stands, and 
               <br />
               stands correct in all essential particulars. 
               <br />
               If the territories lack any other Power- 
               <br />
               than that, it can be given to them Without ' 
               <br />
               provincial organization ; and provincial or- 
               <br />
               ganization, with the power to incur debt, 
               <br />
               rests, not upon a legislative enactment in 
               <br />
               itself, but upon a ﬁxed subsidy being grant- 
               <br />
               ed. Until there is a ﬁxed subsidy, the pro- 
               <br />
               vince, if the territories were created or call- 
               <br />
               ed a province to-morrow, could not incur 
               <br />
               debt. Though this parliament were to pass 
               <br />
               a thousand Acts <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allowing</span> it to incur debt, 
               <br />
               its credit would not be good until it had a 
               <br />
               ﬁxed subsidy. Therefore, the question of 
               <br />
               incurring debt depends entirely upon the 
               <br />
               terms upon which the subsidy for the pro— 
               <br />

               the territories, if you like -to call them such, 
               <br />
               could incur debt, because their credit would 
               <br />
               be good.
