               <br />
               seen that Mr. Hattltain has already stated 
               <br />
               that he would not consent to amend the or- 
               <br />
               dinances. The Government has not disal- 
               <br />
               lowed the law. but it has given inducements. 
               <br />
               it has given what I may fairly call false

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hopes.</span> to the Catholic and French minority.
