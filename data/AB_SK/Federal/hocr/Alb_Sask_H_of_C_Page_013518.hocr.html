               occurred to me of dealing with these odd 
               <br />

               <br />
               Horne. then Mr. VanHorne. I told him 
               <br />
               what the conditions of the North-west Ter- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the advantage to the Territories and to 
               <br />
               Canada if these odd sections were thrown 
               <br />
               open to settlement. For <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.I</span> apprehend that 
               <br />
               nothing could be done so far as the land 
               <br />
               that has been granted to the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway without the co-operation of 
               <br />
               that company. I pointed out to Mr. Van 
               <br />
               Home that if he was ready to agree to re- 
               <br />
               convey these lands to the Government—or 
               <br />
               what would probably be the literal truth, if 
               <br />
               he were ready to forego selecting this land 
               <br />
               -it would pay his railway to do so even on 
               <br />
               a very small, or what might-seem a small, 
               <br />
               consideration. For it is palpable that if 
               <br />
               these odd sections are thrown open for set- 
               <br />
               tlement and if they are taken up by settlers 
               <br />
               the result' must be the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway will get double the quantity of 
               <br />

               Van Horne, who. as we know here, 
               <br />
               is an enlightened and far-seeing man, 
               <br />
               and knows well what is for the beneﬁt of 
               <br />
               his railway, said to me that the proposal 
               <br />
               seemed to him a good one, but he said I 
               <br />
               am, of course, in the hands of my directors. 
               <br />
               I ventured then to say what I think is pro- 
               <br />
               bably the case, that if Sir William Van 
               <br />
               Horne advised his directors in a course 
               <br />
               that, in his opinion, would be for the good 
               <br />
               of the railway, the chances are that his 
               <br />
               directors and himself would see eye to eye. 
               <br />
               My idea was this, that the Government 
               <br />
               might buy back the lands for $1.25 an acre. 
               <br />
               and. if they did so, the money paid would 
               <br />
               be well spent by the Government, it would 
               <br />
               be a proper use of publiemoney. and it 
               <br />
               would be a proﬁtable transaction to the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. Well, what hap-

               <br />
               the odd sections. and the gentleman who 
               <br />
               was running against me, held me up to op-

               <br />

               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway for these odd 
               <br />
               sections. To my surprise, I found in many 
               <br />
               parts of my constituency. settlers who took 
               <br />
               the view that they did not want the odd

               gina “ Leader ” a long letter. taking my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Alberta (Mr. Oliver) and myself 
               <br />
               to task because of the views we are known 
               <br />
               to hold on this subject of the settlement of 
               <br />
               the odd sections. So my hon. friend who 
               <br />
               is at the head of the Government will be 
               <br />
               aware that a prominent supporter of his 
               <br />
               considers that it will be a dreadfui course 
               <br />
               to take to expend vast sums to get hold of 
               <br />
               these odd Sections. However. that supporter 
               <br />
               is not in this House, and is not likely to be ; 
               <br />
               but the other supporter, who urges him 
               <br />
               here to-day to do something with these odd 
               <br />
               sections, is in the House. and his vote has 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be!</span> considered. and I hope he will have 
               <br />
               more inﬂuence with the hon. gentleman at 
               <br />
               the head of the Government than any per- 
               <br />
               son who denounced the proposal when made 
               <br />
               by myself. It is desirable, as the House
