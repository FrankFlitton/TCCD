               Speaking of the loyalty of the French Canadians at 
               <br />
               the time of the American Revolution, Sir Charles

               Dilke said : 
               <br />

               “ Curiously enough, the only moments at which we were

               <br />
               were trying to expel us.” 
               <br />
               These few lines must be signiﬁcant to those

               <br />
               true as it may be, that Canada would have been

               <br />
               Sir Charles Dilke : we have been able to preserve 
               <br />
               our supremacy in North America with the approval 
               <br />
               and assistance of the French Canadians, and 
               <br />
               “ curiously enough the only moment at which we 
               <br />
               were ever popular in Lower Canada, until we gave 
               <br />
               her free institutions, were the moments when 
               <br />
               the Americans were trying to expel us.” Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, I claim for our people, as I read it in the 
               <br />
               opuscules of a late friend, Oscar Dunn, that “the = 
               <br />
               ﬁrst man who spoke of responsible government in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               this country was a French Canadian, Pierre Bedard, 
               <br />
               and the one who contributed the most to establish it 
               <br />
               was another French Canadian, Lafontaine. Our 
               <br />
               nationality had the honor to furnish the states- 
               <br />
               man who introduced British liberties into this ' 
               <br />
               country. It was the only revenge we drew from 
               <br />
               our conquerors.” I do not speak here as a French 
               <br />
               Canadian ; I speak as a Canadian. The hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North Simcoe has said, that, in order to 
               <br />
               judge of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nationality</span> of a man, you must ascer- 
               <br />
               tain the language he speaks ; that a German sub- 
               <br />
               ject speaking another language can hardly be a full 
               <br />
               German; that a man who speaks French as his 
               <br />
               mother tongue, even if he knew and could speak 
               <br />
               English, cannot be really and truly a British sub- 
               <br />
               ject. But we claim to be Canadians, and although 
               <br />
               we may speak in French or English we are really 
               <br />
               not English or French, but we are truly Canadians, 
               <br />
               and we intend to remain such. I heartily endorse 
               <br />
               the sentiments of that eloquent and fervent apostle 
               <br />
               of Canadian nationality, Principal Grant, when, 
               <br />
               speaking before St. Andrew’s Society, in Montreal, 
               <br />
               he said :

               ago, constitutes a very important new departure 
               <br />
               on the part of hon. gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oppositer—a</span> very 
               <br />
               important new departure, indeed. It is per- 
               <br />
               fectly wonderful to see the zeal Which is now ex- 
               <br />
               pressed by so many of these hon. gentlemen for 
               <br />
               provincial rights, and to remember that these 
               <br />
               same hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemenu—not</span> even the hon. member 
               <br />

               <br />
               than thirteen months ago, certainly within a period 
               <br />
               of two years, did not see their way to stand side 
               <br />
               by side with us in defending the clearest and best 
               <br />
               established rights of his and my native Province. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> ﬁnd now that the sacredness of provincial 
               <br />
               rights is clearly held by a great majority in this 
               <br />
               House, we ﬁnd that it is becoming a fundamental 
               <br />
               article of faith, and by none more (although his 
               <br />
               conversion was very late in the day ) than by the 
               <br />
               venerable and pious Premier, may I say, who gave 
               <br />
               such excellent advice to us last year, as well as on 
               <br />
               the present occasion, on the subject of provincial 
               <br />
               rights. I am an old enough member of Parliament 
               <br />
               to remember when the First Minister of this Domi- 
               <br />
               nion had very little faith indeed in Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion ; when he began by doubting and disbelieving 
               <br />
               the possibility of a federal union, and when in 
               <br />
               point of fact, as I remember and as the record 
               <br />
               shows, he only accepted the situation when he 
               <br />
               saw that it was his last chance of safety from 
               <br />
               political shipwreck. From that time, although 
               <br />
               I will not say that he has plotted steadily 
               <br />
               and persistently to undermine this same Confe- 
               <br />
               deration, I Will say that for twenty years, to
