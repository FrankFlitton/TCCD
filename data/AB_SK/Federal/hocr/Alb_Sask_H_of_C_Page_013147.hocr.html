               <br />
               have been used before, and used better than I 
               <br />
               could hope to apply them. As far as community 
               <br />
               of language is concerned, that question has been 
               <br />
               discussed by men who have better command of the

               later than last summer, when I was in Switzerland, 
               <br />
               I attended the great feast of the vine-growers, 
               <br />
               which takes place only once in every twenty- 
               <br />
               five years; and at that feast, which was 
               <br />
               held in a little town on Geneva Lake, there 
               <br />
               attended about seventy-ﬁve thousand people, 
               <br />
               speaking French, Italian and German. One would 
               <br />
               say “ Good day ” in German and the other would 
               <br />
               answer in French or Italian, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vice</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yer-sci,</span> and 
               <br />
               they seemed the most happy and contented people 
               <br />
               I ever met. Therefore, it seemed to me not neces- 
               <br />
               sary that there should be unity of language in 
               <br />
               order that a people might be happy and contented. 
               <br />
               I do not know what the hon. gentleman is driving 
               <br />
               at. He has gone through the different Provinces 
               <br />
               exciting sectional feelings; and I am sorry to see 
               <br />
               such a course taken in a new country composed as 
               <br />
               this is of different nationalities, who have been put 
               <br />
               here to work shoulder to shoulder in the chariot 
               <br />
               of progress, instead of working against each other. 
               <br />
               It is not by raising sectional or racial feelings that 
               <br />
               we can progress and prosper; and, therefore, I look 
               <br />
               upon such proceedings, Whether conducted by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Simcoe or anybody else, as fraught 
               <br />
               with danger in a community like this. I am 
               <br />
               not a pessimist. I have faith in the future of 
               <br />
               my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> And why? Because I believe 
               <br />
               there are enough men of good, sound sense, 
               <br />
               and broad, Christian, patriotic views, to crush 
               <br />
               out the fanatics, no matter where they come 
               <br />
               from. Were it not for that belief I would despair 
               <br />
               for my country. We can tolerate the fanaticism 
               <br />
               of ignorant people, for they know not what they 
               <br />
               do, but when we ﬁnd men of education raising 
               <br />
               these issues, I cannot explain their motives. I ask 
               <br />
               myself, what does the hon. gentleman mean ‘? Does 
               <br />
               he expect to govern by coercion? and if he could 
               <br />
               do so, would it be desirable? If he meant civil 
               <br />
               war, I could understand him; but he must re- 
               <br />

               <br />
               French Canadians whom he Will have to extermi- 
               <br />
               nate, for we will not run away. We are here to 
               <br />
               stay, and stay we Will. Therefore he will have to 
               <br />
               exterminate us, and that will be a very big under-

               and I am certain we will survive the McCarthy

               pressure. A good deal that I had to say has been 
               <br />

               (Mr. Beausoleil). The amendment of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Assiniboia advances a principle which 
               <br />
               I cannot admit, that because a majority ought

               to govern they can alter our constitution as well ; 
               <br />

               <br />
               Assiniboia were adopted, there would be nothing to

               prevent a majority in this House going to the foot 
               <br />
               of the Throne and saying : We have admitted the 
               <br />
               principle that the majority ought to rule, by leaving 
               <br />
               to the majority of the North-VVest to decide as to 
               <br />
               the abolition of the French language, and, therefore, 
               <br />
               as we are the majority in the Confederation, we 
               <br />
               can decide to abolish it in the Province of Quebec 
               <br />
               or in any other Province. I do not want the 
               <br />
               Federal Government to relinquish this power which 
               <br />
               it has. I think it was the well-considered view of 
               <br />
               the Fathers of Confederation, when they left that 
               <br />
               power to the Federal Government, and that is the 
               <br />
               only safety which the minority in any Province 
               <br />
               possesses. Therefore, I will support the amend-

               Beausoleil), and will vote against the two other

               amendments. If another amendment were to be

               moved, leaving this matter over until after the

               power which this Parliament possesses, I would

               but I do not think he has made good his proposition.

               <br />
               In the British Empire there are three hundred 
               <br />
               millions of people, speaking many different lang-

               speak the English language. Yet, the British

               Empire on which the sun never sets,——this great 
               <br />
               empire with all its diversity of languages and of 
               <br />

               perity of a nation. With regard to this particu-

               lar matter, I may be pardoned if I give a brief

               history of the settlement of the French in the

               North-West. It is well known that the French 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada spread themselves over the 
               <br />
               North-West Territories long before the English 
               <br />
               had come even to Hudson’s Bay, that they were at 
               <br />
               Lake Winnipeg, that they were on the Red River, 
               <br />
               where Manitoba now is, and that they were on the 
               <br />
               plains of the Saskatchewan a hundred years and 
               <br />
               more before the English had even come as far west 
               <br />
               as Lake Winnipeg. In regard to the rights of 
               <br />
               those French people, who were there at that time, 
               <br />
               those rights were secured to them in the same way, 
               <br />
               by the Treaty of Paris and the capitulation of 
               <br />
               Montreal, as they were secured to the people of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. It is expressly stated in the capit- 
               <br />
               ulation itself that it extended to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“countries</span> 
               <br />
               above,” meaning the settlements on the Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan and the other portions of the western country.
