               Well, what have we to say about the' 
               <br />
               Bill which is before us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'1’</span> In the ﬁrst place, 
               <br />
               I may say a word to those who have 
               <br />
               thought it remarkable that the members of 
               <br />
               the Conservative party have not burst out 
               <br />
               into a chorus of congratulation to the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment upon the introduction of this Bill. 
               <br />
               [ want to point out to my right hon. friend 
               <br />
               that one very good reason why we should 
               <br />
               restrain our congratulations at the present 
               <br />
               time is that we have not the real Bill be- 
               <br />
               fore us. As was well said by Mr. McCarthy 
               <br />
               in 1892, the whole force, the whole vitality 
               <br />
               of a Bill of this character is to be found 
               <br />
               in the details. Now we have the mere 
               <br />
               skeleton of a Bill at the present time, we 
               <br />
               have nothing except the bare formal parts 
               <br />
               of the Bill, and we are not prepared to pro- 
               <br />
               nounce any opinion at all upon that which 
               <br />
               we have not yet seen. I admit that a gov- 
               <br />
               ernment desiring to introduce a perfectly 
               <br />
               fair Redistribution Bill—and I accept in the 
               <br />
               fullest sense my right hon. friend’s assur- 
               <br />
               ance of that desire—I say that a government 
               <br />
               desirous of introducing the fairest poSIible 
               <br />
               Redistribution Bill, might adopt this course : 
               <br />
               and I say also that a government which de- 
               <br />
               sired to introduce a Bill that was not fair 
               <br />
               in the ordinary sense of the term, might 
               <br />
               adopt exactly the same course, and place 
               <br />
               before the proposed committee schedules 
               <br />
               which might just as well have been attached 
               <br />
               to the Bill itself. I am not suggesting that 
               <br />
               that is the intention of the government, but 
               <br />
               I am pointing out that at the present time 
               <br />
               we have not in the Bill anything but a mere 
               <br />
               skeleton, and we do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know</span> whether the 
               <br />
               proposal of the government will be a fair 
               <br />
