               as he has imported into the debate; but that

               it is other and more rapid, direct and stringent 
               <br />
               —I will say more violent methods, that are 
               <br />
               really proposed to us in this regard. Now, Sir, as 
               <br />
               I have said, there are underlying questions here, 
               <br />
               much broader questions than the simple questions 
               <br />
               dealt with by the enacting clause. And these under- 
               <br />
               lying questions are historically old, no doubt, 
               <br />
               but they are old with reference to our own policy 
               <br />
               too; they were raised before the last general 
               <br />
               election, they were raised by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe himself in large part, they were 
               <br />
               raised by a newspaper which was, at that time, 
               <br />
               the most powerful supporter in the Province of 
               <br />
               Ontario of hon. gentlemen opposite, and they have 
               <br />
               since been persisted in, and have since been en- 
               <br />
               larged. This group of questions are fundamental 
               <br />
               questions. They embrace topics of creed as 
               <br />
               well as of race, and the Jesuit affair to which the 
               <br />
               hon. member referred, was not the cause, was not 
               <br />
               the origin. It was obviously, it has since been 
               <br />
               confessed to have been, a mere incident, a mere 
               <br />
               occasion, taken advantage of as a ﬁt and opportune 
               <br />
               occasion to bring up one phase, and in various 
               <br />
               aspects, more than one phase, of this group ; a good 
               <br />
               occasion to bring all up in a manner which would 
               <br />
               attract the favorable consideration of those to whom 
               <br />
               they who brought them up sought to address them- 
               <br />
               selves. Now, Sir, I intend to refrain, as far as 
               <br />
               possible, from discussing this question in any party 
               <br />
               aspect whatever. It needs to be discussed in its 
               <br />
               party aspect, it must receive such a discussion at 
               <br />
               some time, but I do not think this time is the ﬁtting 
               <br />
               time. I say I hope as far as possible to avoid any 
               <br />
               question of party in the course of this discussion. 
               <br />
               I am as anxious as the hon. gentleman is anxious, 
               <br />
               to say nothing, so far as truth will allow, except 
               <br />
               conciliatory words, and to deal with this matter in a 
               <br />
               manner becoming a public man ; in such a way that, 
               <br />
               if my feeble words have any effect at all, they may 
               <br />
               tend to prevent the calamitous results of which 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman this afternoon was complaining, 
               <br />
               though he, and those who act with him, from the 
               <br />
               best motives, I have no doubt, havebeen the prime 
               <br />
               cause of the realisation of these results to the 
               <br />
               extent to which they have been up to this time 
               <br />
               realized. I say, Sir, that if you could deal simply 
               <br />
               with the enacting clause in this Bill it would be 
               <br />
               a matter of minor consequence ; if you could dis- 
               <br />
               sociate that clause from its preamble, from its 
               <br />
               surroundings, from its past and from its future. 
               <br />
               But you cannot dissociate it, either from its pre 
               <br />
               amble or from its surroundings or from its past, 
               <br />
               and still less from its future. These difﬁculties are 
               <br />
               in part indicated by the preamble which, as you 
               <br />

               own speech, we should be, it is intended that we 
               <br />
               should be, plunged if we agree to it. Now, what 
               <br />
               does it say? The hon. member for North Norfolk 
               <br />
               (Mr. Charlton), thought that it was a very inno- 
               <br />
               cent thing. There was not much in it. He laid a 
               <br />
               great deal of stress upon the preamble of some 
               <br />
               other Bill which was passed in some other Legis- 
               <br />
               lature, and he thought that preamble was good 
               <br />
               cause for disallowance here. But now he says that 
               <br />
               the preamble of this Bill, which is given as the 
               <br />
               basis of our decision, the cause itself upon which 
               <br />
               we are called upon to vote, is of very little conse- 
               <br />
               quence. It is true, it is the reason for the enact- 
               <br />
               ment, it is the moving cause which is given to us, 
               <br />
               but it is not of much consequence, and is not of 
               <br />
               much harm.

               ing in this preamble, of that community of lang- 
               <br />
               uage, which it is expedient should prevail among 
               <br />
               the whole people of Canada. The second para- 
               <br />
               graph of the preamble tells us that the community 
               <br />
               of language Which is declared to be expedient 
               <br />
               amongst the Whole people of Canada, is that com- 
               <br />
               munity and harmony which prevails, according to 
               <br />
               the well known fable, between the lion and the 
               <br />
               lamb ; the English is to swallow up the French 
               <br />
               and the French is to die, that the English may live 
               <br />
               and ﬂourish upon it. That is the community which 
               <br />
               is to exist, the community of language which is 
               <br />
               expedient ; the enactment allowing the use of French 
               <br />
               is to be expunged; therefore, it is the English 
               <br />
               language alone that is to be used. Now, Sir, when 
               <br />
               I read this preamble I confess myself to have been 
               <br />
               a little puzzled by the word “comity,” whose
