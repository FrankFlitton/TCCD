               always foremost in works of good-will ; I told them 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               imposition of a mightier Hand. What then they 
               <br />

               I told them that the “ old sorcerer,” as they called 
               <br />
               him, had apparently taken a new lease of life. He 
               <br />
               was sorcerer, magician and necromancer all in one 
               <br />
               ——like Aaron’s rod, his wand had swallowed up 
               <br />
               those of all the other magicians ;——like Prospero, he 
               <br />
               had waved his wand, and a nation had sprung into 
               <br />
               existence ;--by his magic power he had bound our 
               <br />
               Dominion together with a network of iron, and 
               <br />
               strewed it with cities, “like shells along the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sea</span> 
               <br />
               shore”;—he had clothed the dry bones with ﬂesh, 
               <br />
               and breathed life into the northern part of this 
               <br />

               I thought I knew that at an early period he 
               <br />
               was captured by Madame Calvin; then that 
               <br />
               he had certain coquetries with Madame Wes- 
               <br />
               ley; then he had a liaison with a certain 
               <br />
               beautiful Baptist lady ; but I said, perhaps, 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Italian beauty, the scarlet lady, had at

               that he has had the best of everything in this

               bers of the Cabinet? I said they were most admir-

               able gentlemen, who were selected, as I have often 
               <br />
               said, not only on account of their singular ability 
               <br />
               and merits, but also because they represented cer- 
               <br />
               tain historical events. I ventured to say that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs represents, or did represent, 
               <br />
               the battle of the Boyne; the Minister of Inland 
               <br />
               Revenue was supposed to represent the broken 
               <br />
               treaty of Limerick ; the Minister of Finance repre- 
               <br />
               sented the crystal globules of cold water; while 
               <br />
               the Minister of Agriculture represented that 
               <br />
               amber beverage which was clear to our Scandi- 
               <br />
               navian forefathers. And, as regards the old 
               <br />
               Chieftain himself, we who deal so much in futures, 
               <br />
               who hold him in our heart of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hearts,</span> do not take

               I may, refer to a hymn which appears to be sin-

               me with its strange power and pathos :

               “ There were ninety and nine that safely lay, in the

               <br />
               be formed ? I replied : I do not see What they can 
               <br />
               do unless the anti—Jesuits muster their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">battalions.</span> 
               <br />
               and move down on Quebec. Before they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had,</span> 
               <br />
               reached Montreal they would be met by you, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, and the gallant 65th. I can fancy 
               <br />
               what the feelings of the old guard would be 
               <br />
               when they met on the plains before the great com- 
               <br />
               mercial city of the Dominion. I can fancy the 
               <br />
               scene which was enacted on the plain. Colonel. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">O’Brien—J</span> beg pardon for using his name—would 
               <br />
               bow pleasantly to Mr. Speaker, and would say: 
               <br />
               “ Gentlemen of the French guard, ﬁre ﬁrst,” 
               <br />
               and the Speaker would say : “ Gentlemen of the 
               <br />
               English guard, you ﬁre ﬁrst ;” and then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the:</span> 
               <br />
               soldiers would look upon each other, and realis— 
               <br />
               ing they were brothers, march together to the 
               <br />
               city of Montreal, universally rejoicing and feeling 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> might have other enemies at some future time 
               <br />
               to ght against rather than amongst themselves. 
               <br />
               I beg pardon of the House, Sir, for treating a serious 
               <br />
               subject with such apparent irreverence. I sit 
               <br />
               opposite my hon. friend from Simcoe and I notice 
               <br />
               the equanimity with which he bears his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">punish-A</span> 
               <br />
               ment, and I have no doubt that when the time 
               <br />
               comes he will hit back with all that strength and 
               <br />
               power of which we all know he is capable. I 
               <br />
               would, however, ask that hon. gentleman and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those:</span> 
               <br />
               who are with him on this question—some of whom 
               <br />
               I have ranked as my dearest friends in this House 
               <br />
               and in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country—t9</span> consider their course. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We:</span> 
               <br />
               cannot afford to have our Confederation destroyed,, 
               <br />
