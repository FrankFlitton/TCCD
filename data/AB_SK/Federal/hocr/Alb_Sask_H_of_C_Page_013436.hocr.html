               Mr. MILLS (Bothwell). The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man knows that under our constitutional 
               <br />
               system the law distinguishes—or. at all 
               <br />
               events, the conventions of the constitution 
               <br />
               distinguish—between the royal will and the 
               <br />
               personal will of the sovereign. But I do 
               <br />
               not see any provision by which that rule 
               <br />
               or principle would be applied in this case. 
               <br />
               Under our constitutional system the Gover-

               <br />
               is that they shall be chosen from the party 
               <br />
               having the majority in power. I apprehend 
               <br />
               that here the majority would make the 
               <br />
               choice. You do not leave the Governor any 
               <br />
               discretion at all as to who his advisers shall 
               <br />
               be. You put the whole discretion in the 
               <br />
               Legislature, which. it seems to me. is not 
               <br />
               the most convenient or most satisfactory sys— 
               <br />

               <br />

               some play. But, if their will or advice

               <br />
               What would be the effect here ? The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> is chosen by the people, not by

               it has not produced friction. it must be be—
