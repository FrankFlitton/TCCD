               events to proceed very long without having

               a ﬁnal settlement of what they claim ought

               <br />
               Alberta (Mr. Oliver) has possibly been the 
               <br />
               clearest exponent of that principle which 
               <br />
               is generally followed by western people, 
               <br />
               and he puts it very well. He says: We

               have asked you for certain things and if 
               <br />
               you are not prepared to do just exactly 
               <br />
               what we say, why pay the shot and pay 
               <br />
               as much as we ask. My hon. friend (Mr.
