               Mr. MITCHELL. I desire to call the attention

               of the right hon. gentleman at the head of the 
               <br />
               Government to a statement which I observed in 
               <br />
               some American papers in relation to an interview 
               <br />
               alleged to have been held with the British Am- 
               <br />
               bassador in Washington in reference to the modus 
               <br />

               stated that the British Ambassador said he had 
               <br />
               received no instructions, and nothing had been 
               <br />
               done, as far as he knew, to continue the modus 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">m'vtmdi</span> or to substitute anything for it. I think 
               <br />
               this is a matter of some importance, and, there-

               question, but I need hardly say that I am quite 
               <br />
               aware that it is the privilege, and even the duty,

               of every member of this House to concern himself 
               <br />

               <br />
               gratulate the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-VVest</span> that my hon. and learned 
               <br />
               friend (Mr. McCarthy) has taken a tardy interest 
               <br />
               in our welfare. I am not aware that he ever took 
               <br />
               a very great interest in our welfare until very 
               <br />
               lately. He himself tells us that he sat in this 
               <br />
               House time and again when this measure was before 
               <br />
               it, and that he actually did not know that the 
               <br />
               110th clause existed until the spring of last year. 
               <br />
               Well, in an ordinary member that would be an 
               <br />
               extraordinary thing, but in a distinguished advo- 
               <br />
               cate it is a very marvellous thing indeed. But I 
               <br />
               think I understand why it is that he has taken 
               <br />
               this interest in us in the North-West. We had 
               <br />
               here a question last year which I do not intend to 
               <br />
               go into at present, but which has been agitated 
               <br />
               throughout the country in a manner that I do not 
               <br />
               think was either edifying or statesmanlike ; and I 
               <br />
               rather think that my hon. and learned friend dis- 
               <br />
               covered that, on that uestion, he had taken an 
               <br />
               illogical stand, that he ound, after defending his 
               <br />
               position for a considerable time, that the osition 
               <br />
               was indefensible, and, in order to let himse down 
               <br />
               easy, he took up questions that would have been 
               <br />
               settled in the Territories without his aid or the aid 
               <br />
               of anybody else outside of those Territories. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span>
