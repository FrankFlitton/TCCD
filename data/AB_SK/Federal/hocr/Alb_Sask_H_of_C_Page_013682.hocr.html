               I must term the lack of fair comprehension

               With regard to the details of Mr. Haultain’s 
               <br />
               Bill. with which I am not at all familiar, as I 
               <br />
               have not had an opportunity of seeing it, I do not 
               <br />
               think that these details have much to do with 
               <br />
               the matter. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It is fair to say that when the leader of 
               <br />
               one of the political parties is not well seized 
               <br />
               of a question—a live political question—it 
               <br />
               is too much to expect that the ordinary mem- 
               <br />
               ber or ordinary citizen is well informed re- 
               <br />
               garding it. In my opinion, the admission 
               <br />
               was a confession of utter lack of comprehen- 
               <br />
               sion of the matter. Mr. Haultain’s draft 
               <br />
               Bill practically contains the whole question. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.The</span> whole question is made up of details. 
               <br />
               Although there is a sentimental side to it, 
               <br />
               it is essentially a matter of business to the 
               <br />
               people of the North-west. When speaking 
               <br />
               of a province, we are not dealing with an 
               <br />
               empty name. When a province is formed, 
               <br />
               the people will assume serious and heavy 
               <br />
               responsibilities. Whereas at the present 
               <br />
               time this parliament is under the responsi- 
               <br />
               bility of meeting the cost of our local gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, with a provincial establishment 
               <br />
               the people of the territories would them- 
               <br />
               selves have to bear that responsibility ; and, 
               <br />
               as has been stated by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Alberta. the measure of their duties and 
               <br />
               their ability to meet those responsibilities 
               <br />
               will depend upon the terms granted by this 
               <br />
               parliament when the province or provinces 
               <br />
               will be established. If the people have not 
               <br />
               adequate sources of revenue, they will be 
               <br />
               unable to enjoy the advantages of good gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in its full sense. Now, in stating 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I,</span> am really repeating what the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">territories</span> says almost every 
               <br />
               time he speaks on the question. In the 
               <br />
               speech of 1900, from which the hon. leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition quoted, Mr. Haultain said :

               the details, the terms, are the essence of 
               <br />

               hon. leader of the opposition made through 
               <br />
               the west last fall, a slight change of mind 
               <br />
               was worked on him with regard to the im-

               portance of matters of detail in relation to 
               <br />
               this question. On one very important de- 
               <br />
               tail then he expressed himself clearly in 
               <br />
               the North-west Territories, just as he has 
               <br />
               done here, and, on behalf of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories, I wish to take occa- 
               <br />
               sion to thank the hon. leader of the op- 
               <br />
               position for the expression of opinion which 
               <br />
               he gave in favour of the view which we 
               <br />
               in that country unanimously take, that 
               <br />
               when a province is formed it is only fair, 
               <br />
               just and proper that the lands, timber and 
               <br />
               mineral resources in that province should 
               <br />
               be handed over to the people dwelling there 
               <br />
               to be managed and owned by them. This 
               <br />
               should be done in the North-west Territories 
               <br />
               in the same way as in every other part of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, except in the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba which was formed when the Con-

               servative party was in power. But on 
               <br />
               several of the other items of detail my hon. 
               <br />
               friend carefully avoided giving any expres-

               sion of opinion when he was in the west last 
               <br />
               fall, as he has done on this occasion. I was 
               <br />
               in hopes when my hon. friend gave notice of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               details which he had failed to give in the 
               <br />
               west. At Qu’Appelle he was asked if he 
               <br />
               supported our claim to compensation for the 
               <br />
               lands which had been alienated for federal

               that the people in the audience went away

               without really knowing What his answer
