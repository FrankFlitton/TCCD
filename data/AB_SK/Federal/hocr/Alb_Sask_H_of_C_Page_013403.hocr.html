               Assiniboia (Mr. Davin). Two years <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ago,</span> when 
               <br />
               the question of the dual languages was before the 
               <br />
               House, that hon. gentleman moved an amendment 
               <br />
               to the Bill to leave the matter entirely in the hands 
               <br />
               of the people of the North-\Vest '.l‘erritm-ies. I 
               <br />
               approved of his amendment and I intended to vote 
               <br />
               for it if it had been reached ; and, Sir, what was 
               <br />
               good in the case of the dual languages, I believe 
               <br />
               would be equality good in the case of separate 
               <br />
               Schools, and that the only sound policy is to leave 
               <br />
               the matter for the people of the North-West to 
               <br />
               deal with. There is another matter introduced in 
               <br />
               this resolution, and. that is that the school sec- 
               <br />
               tions of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nc.)1-tl1-\\'est.as</span> at present constituted

               <br />
               of the parties composing the section. The reason 
               <br />
               that I was induced to admit that clause in the 
               <br />
               resolution was because a friend of mine pleaded 
               <br />
               that certain parties had established seliool sections 
               <br />
               there on the strength of the law as it at present 
               <br />
               stands, that in that way a sort of vested right had 
               <br />
               accrued. and that it was unfair to interfere with 
               <br />
               these rights. I agreed with him in that, and I 
               <br />
               consented to allow that clause to be inserted in 
               <br />

               the people of the North-West shall have the power

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Speaker,</span> that I was one of those who opposed the 
               <br />
               estal.)lishment of separate schools in the Province 
               <br />
               of Ontario when that was first agitated, and I did 
               <br />
               it because I was in favour of a uniform public 
               <br />
               school system. I believe that it was for the ad- 
               <br />
               vantage of the country that such a system should 
               <br />
               be established and maintained. However. when 
               <br />
               once the law gave permission for the establishment 
               <br />
               of separate Schools, and when once they were es- 
               <br />
               tablished by law, from that day to this I 
               <br />
               have done, in my own humble way, every- 
               <br />
               thing that- lay in my power to make those 
               <br />
               schools as efﬁcient as possible. If they had 
               <br />
               to ' exist it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,was</span> the part of good policy, 
               <br />
               the part of justice and right. to make them 
               <br />
               just as efficient as they could possibly be made. ' I 
               <br />
               am free to confess that the law has not worked the 
               <br />
               great harm in Ontario that was anticipated from 
               <br />
               it. I believe that in towns and cities it has done 
               <br />
               no harm at all; in the rural districts the only harm 
               <br />
               it has done has been that it has compelled the 
               <br />
               people to maintain two weak schools instead of one 
               <br />
               strong one ; and in the public schools of, Ontario, so

               far from the rights of any religious body being 
               <br />
               interfered with, those rights have been strictly 
               <br />
