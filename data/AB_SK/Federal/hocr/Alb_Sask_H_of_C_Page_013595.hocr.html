               eluded by this parliament as to whether 
               <br />
               that principle is right or wrong. As has 
               <br />
               been said by the hon. member for Hamilton 
               <br />
               (Mr. Barker) : This is putting the cart be- 
               <br />
               fore the horse. But that is not the worst of 
               <br />
               it. While the Minister of Justice says that 
               <br />
               he does not think we ought go far in dis- 
               <br />
               cussing what the decision of the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court may be; we are at the same time 
               <br />
               told by him that we should go ahead and 
               <br />
               by giving this Bill a second reading antici- 
               <br />
               pate the decision of the Supreme Court in 
               <br />
               favour of the Minister’s contention. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that it that were done the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Supreme</span> Court would be in a proper posi- 
               <br />
               tion to say to us: Parliament has ah'eady 
               <br />
               decided on the principle of the Bill and why 
               <br />
               appear idly before us now and ask us 
               <br />
               whether you did right or wrong. But Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker apart from that I have a stronger 
               <br />
               opinion on this question than even the Min— 
               <br />
               ister of Justice has. It is not to be wonder- 
               <br />
               ed at that two lawyers should not agree; 
               <br />
               it is perhaps customary that lawyers, when 
               <br />
               they are engaged on the opposite side of a 
               <br />
               case, should not agree; it is also probable 
               <br />
               that a Conservative lawyer may not agree 
               <br />
               with the Minister of Justice in a so called 
               <br />
               Liberal government. However I do agree 
               <br />
               with the Minister of Justice that there is 
               <br />
               not much doubt about this question, but 
               <br />
               I disagree with him as to where this doubt 
               <br />
               is. I have given considerable attention to 
               <br />
               this Bill and I have gone into the Acts and 
               <br />
               into the history of this matter, and 1 have 
               <br />
               been obliged to come to the conclusion that 
               <br />
               this Bill provides for a wrong principle, and 
               <br />
               that a reduction in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span> in 
               <br />
               this parliament of the provinces of Ontario 
               <br />
               and New Brunswick and Nova Scotia is 
               <br />
               not warranted by the law as it stands to- 
               <br />
               day. I therefore believe that this Bill ought 
               <br />
               not be read a second time upon its 
               <br />
               merits, and I believe that, apart altogether 
               <br />
               from the doubt which the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice has said he is going to get 
               <br />
               the Supreme Court to decide upon, I 
               <br />
               shall have to ask the indulgence of the 
               <br />
               House it I again call attention to the provi- 
               <br />
               sions of the British North America Act. The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst part of the Act to which I shall rotor 
               <br />
               is the one headed ‘ Union ’ and bearing the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures 11 in Roman numerals, being a sub- 
               <br />
               division of the Act. The heading ‘Union’ 
               <br />
               applies from section 3 to section 8 both sec- 
               <br />
               tions inclusive. Now this heading ‘ Union ’ 
               <br />
               and this subdivision of the Act under that 
               <br />
               heading, is of considerable importance. The 
               <br />
               first part provides :

               me to be begging very hard for some argu- 
               <br />
               ment to say that these positive and distinct 
               <br />
               words ‘Canada as constituted under this 
               <br />
               Act ’ can mean anything else than what is 
               <br />
               stated in subsection 3, which says that 
               <br />
               Canada consists of the four provinces. 
               <br />

               We have to ask ourselves what is the 
               <br />
               next step to take in determining whether 
               <br />
               this term Canada is to apply to the whole 
               <br />

               arriving at the number of members for 
               <br />
               each province. There is one thing which 
               <br />
               strikes me very forcibly, and which has 
               <br />
               not yet been referred to. Why does 
               <br />
               this Act at all say what shall consti- 
               <br />
               tute Canada '2 What would constitute Can- 
               <br />
               ada if this section were not in the Act <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'2</span> 
               <br />
               Why, it would simply be, as the hon. Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice says, whatever Canada may 
               <br />
               be at the time. But the difference between 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice and myself is that 
               <br />
               I contend that when these words were put 
               <br />
               in the Act, they were inserted for some 
               <br />
               purpose. The eﬁect would be altogether 
               <br />
               different had they been omitted. No 
               <br />
               lawyer of any experience will say that the 
               <br />
               putting in of these words was a mere 
               <br />
               surplusage or meant nothing. If they 
               <br />
               do not mean what we say they do. they 
               <br />
               would not be in this Act at all, and then 
               <br />
               Canada would mean exactly what the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice says it does. Canada 
               <br />
               might mean four provinces or ﬁve or six or 
               <br />
               seven, according to the changing circum- 
               <br />
               stances. But What I submit is that the very 
               <br />
               fact that these words are put in show a 
               <br />
               special attention to give a special meaning to 
               <br />
               the word ‘ Cana-da.’ It shows that the par- 
               <br />
               liament which passed this Act did not intend 
               <br />
               that the term ‘Ganada' should bear the 
               <br />
               ordinary meaning, but that it should apply 
               <br />
               for the purpose of readjustment to the four 
               <br />
               original provinces. Has that been changed 
               <br />
               or repealed by any proper authority ? There 
               <br />
               are other provisions in this Act which show 
               <br />
               that the term Canada is only intended to 
               <br />
               cover the four original provinces. Take for 
               <br />
