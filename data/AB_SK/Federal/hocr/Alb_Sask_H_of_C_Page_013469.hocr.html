               with this question. 1 am not voting for or 
               <br />
               against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> schools. and as l <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explained</span> 
               <br />
               to the House. I am not what you would call 
               <br />
               very strongly in favour of a public school 
               <br />
               education. Let me correct my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) in one 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing.</span> In his speech he talked the whole 
               <br />
               time about the Protestant public schools. 
               <br />
               Sir. we have no Protestant public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">s‘hools</span> in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Territories.

               Mr. McL‘All"HY. Allow me to explain 
               <br />
               what I meant by that. 1 ﬁnd that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> 
               <br />
               says: the majority may establish a school. 
               <br />
               and I ﬁnd that that majority may be either 
               <br />
               Pmtestant or Catholic, and musequently I 
               <br />
               used it in this sense: that if the majority 
               <br />
               were Protestants. and did establish a public 
               <br />
               school. it was a Protestant public school. 
               <br />
               just in that sense. as distinguished on the

               ed to be Roman Catholics and who establish

               a public school which would be a Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic public school.
