               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:limited</span> extent, and in that sense my hon. friend 
               <br />
               had me at a disadvantage ; for I had gone upon the 
               <br />
               assumption that the well understood general policy 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> had been more vigorously 
               <br />
               enforced than probably was the case at the outset. 
               <br />
               But so far as the policy of the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> Gov~ 
               <br />
               ernment was concerned, with the new states along

               blished, and in all these settlements outside of 
               <br />
               Louisiana proper, the French language was never 
               <br />
               used officially at all.
