               Ptolemy V, of Egypt, who, though a powerful

               Greek ruler, distributed his laws amongst his

               know whether they will understand English or

               <br />
               Who do not understand English, what then ? The 
               <br />
               hon. member for West Toronto (Mr. Denison) 
               <br />
               said last night that a great number of them speak 
               <br />
               Cree, and therefore the laws of the North—VVest 
               <br />
               should be printed in Cree ; and the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Muskoka (Mr. O’Brien) said it was only a 
               <br />
               local question whichshould be settled in the North- 
               <br />
               VVest. I ask if it ought not be settled after hear- 
               <br />
               ing the facts of the case, and settled by those who 
               <br />
               are most competent to judge? Should we be 
               <br />
               called upon in this court to deliver judgment 
               <br />
               before we hear the evidence? The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               would not ask such a decision from an ordinary 
               <br />
               court of the land. Then, why should he ask it 
               <br />
               from this, the highest court and tribunal in the 
               <br />
               land? If this is to be settled according to the 
               <br />
               views of the people, the proper tribunal must 
               <br />
               be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Est</span> representatives or some 
               <br />
               other tribunal, after learning the facts of the 
               <br />
               case. But the hon. gentleman went further. 
               <br />
               He intimated that no man could be a loyal 
               <br />
               citizen practically unless he spoke the dominant 
               <br />
               tongue of the country. In making that statement 
               <br />
               he has, no doubt, inadvertently cast a slur upon 
               <br />
               many of the loyal citizens of the British Empire.

               <br />
               is there to be found in the pages of history since 
               <br />
               the French Canadian people became citizens of 
               <br />
               Canada to make my hon. friend doubt their loyalty 
               <br />
               to British institutions ? Their loyalty was sorely 
               <br />
               tried. Shortly after 1759, the date so frequently 
               <br />
               referred to by my hon. friend as that of the 
               <br />
               conquest of the French Canadian people, within 
               <br />
               twenty years from that every effort was made 
               <br />
               to cause them to change their allegiance from 
               <br />
               Canada, and with what result? I cannot conceive 
               <br />
               the loyalty of a people being subjected to greater 
               <br />
               strains than that to which the French Canadian 
               <br />
               people were subjected to during the events which 
               <br />
               immediately succeeded the Treaty of Paris. What 
               <br />
               were the events which were going on across the 
               <br />
               border at that time? The thirteen colonies were 
               <br />
               in revolt, and were anxious to destroy British rule 
               <br />
               in America, and they were anxious to get the 
               <br />
               French Canadians to throw in their lot with them. 
               <br />
               At that time, General \Vashington issued a pro- 
               <br />
               clamation appealing to all the passions, the fears, 
               <br />
               the cupidity and the prejudices of the French 
               <br />
               Canadian people, to throw off their allegiance to 
               <br />
               Great Britain and to join the Union. That appeal 
               <br />
               was made accompanied by threats of invasion ; the 
               <br />
               invasion followed, and the war continued for a 
               <br />
               length of time ; and who were the strongest to 
               <br />
               help to sustain the British arms and British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">insti~</span>
