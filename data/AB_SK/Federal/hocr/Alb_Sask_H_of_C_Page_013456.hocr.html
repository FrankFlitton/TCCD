               The task which the Ministry has set for itself 
               <br />
               was the most important it was possible to conceive.

               To found primary institutions under which we

               <br />
               in that important task. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lie</span> agreed with the hon. 
               <br />
               member from Kingston that the task was one that 
               <br />
               required time, consideration and deliberation, and 
               <br />
               they must take care that no false steps were made 
               <br />
               in such a work. He did not agree with that right 
               <br />
               hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rentleman</span> that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> ought to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span>

               peal llS errors. The right hon. gentleman had 
               <br />
               tried the institutions for the North-west Territories 
               <br />
               which he now asked the. House to frame, and for 
               <br />
               the same reason as he had given <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day~that</span> it 
               <br />
               would be better for the Dominion Government to 
               <br />
               keep matters in their own hands and decide what 
               <br />
               was best for the future. He (M r. Blake.) believed 
               <br />
               that it was essential to our obtaining a large im- 
               <br />
               migration to the North-west that we should tell 
               <br />
               the people beforehand what those rights were to he 
               <br />
               in the country in which we invited them to settle. 
               <br />
               It was interesting to the people to know that at 
               <br />
               the very earliest moment t iere was a sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               aggregate of population within a reasonable dis- 
               <br />
               tance, that aggregation would have a voice in 
               <br />
               the selfgovernment of the territories, and he 
               <br />
               believed that the Dominion Government was wise, 
               <br />
               (although the measure might be brought down 
               <br />
               very late this session and it might- be found im- 
               <br />
               possible to give it due consideration) in determin- 
               <br />
               ing in advance of settlement what the character 
               <br />
               of the institutions of the country should be 
               <br />
               in which we invite people to settle. He did not 
               <br />
               agree with the policy of asking people to settle in 
               <br />
               that western country, and tell them that a pater~ 
               <br />
               nal government would look after them, and would 
               <br />
               give them such institutions as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> 
               <br />
               thought suitable. 'We had better let the eople 
               <br />
               know their fate politically and otherwise fore 
               <br />
               they settle there. The task to be discharged now, 
               <br />
               or at some future time, was one of considerable 
               <br />
               importance. And amongst the difﬁculties was the 
               <br />
               determining of what the range of power the coun- 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">character</span> would be that of a mixed nominative
