               provinces which have money in what is 
               <br />
               called the debt account, instead of paying 
               <br />
               interest to the Dominion, the Dominion has 
               <br />
               to pay interest to them and it may be so 
               <br />
               When we come to adjust this account be- 
               <br />
               tween the new province or provinces and 
               <br />
               the Dominion. What we do is to give the

               local government of the North-west Terri- 
               <br />
               tories now one of the privileges which they 
               <br />
               would no doubt have if they had provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy, and that is the right to have in 
               <br />
               the capital account a sum upon which they 
               <br />
               may draw for important public works. If 
               <br />
               they do not wish to use it, of course we can- 
               <br />
               not complain, but our theory is that if they 
               <br />
               undertake any important public structure 
               <br />
               which is a matter of permanent improve-

               ment they may wish to charge it against 
               <br />
               capital account. If we should give provin- 
               <br />
               cial autonomy to the North-west Territories 
               <br />
               we would have to place further sums at

               their credit in some way.

               includes the bridges over the Pelly river

               occurs to me that it is a very pertinent ques- 
               <br />
               tion to ask what possible credit can the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories have to the debt ac- 
               <br />
               count. They can have none whatever. The 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Finance states that this 
               <br />
               $250,000 is to be charged against them pend- 
               <br />
               ing a settlement when they are given auton- 
               <br />
               omy. I do not see any possible credit that 
               <br />
               the North-west Territories can have to the 
               <br />
               debt account. The only possible way in 
               <br />
               which this $250,000 could be charged would 
               <br />
               be upon the per capita allowance of the 
               <br />
               province to be deducted at some future 
               <br />
               time. The hon. gentleman states that he 
               <br />
               does not intend to charge any interest upon 
               <br />
               the amount. Does he propose, in giving this 
               <br />
               $250,000 to the North-west Territories, to 
               <br />
               give them the absolute control of the ex- 
               <br />
               penditure of it for any purpose which they 
               <br />
               may think proper, or must it be spent in a 
               <br />
               certain direction? If the government intend 
               <br />
               to direct how it shall be expended we would 
               <br />
               like to know how it is proposed to expend 
               <br />
               it. I protest that there is no possible credit 
               <br />
               to the debt account which the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories can have against the Dominion 
               <br />
               government upon entering confederation. 
               <br />

               The MINISTER OF FINANCE. My hon.

               friend has undertaken to settle a question
