               of $1,000,000 in the present year was a very 
               <br />
               fair allowance and I was glad to accept

               <br />
               000 for permanent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">improvements.</span> But if 
               <br />
               the opinion of the House has changed, if it 
               <br />
               has become generous in these matters, 1 
               <br />
               can assure the House that the North-west

               Territories government can expend a larger

               Mr. CLANCY. I fully concur in all that

               Mr. CLANCY. It is a deplorable fact 
               <br />
               that we have to do that both as to infor-

               Mr. BOYD. I am also pleased with the 
               <br />
               increase that has taken place in the appro-

               I would be much better pleased if the gov-

               ernment ha-d intimated that they proposed

               giving the people of the North-west Terri-

               tories the provincial power which they are 
               <br />
               seeking. I am sure that in saying that I

               express the opinion of the vast majority of 
               <br />
               the people of the North-west Territories. I

               pleasant to the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—west</span> 
               <br />
               Territories, in fact I know it is humiliating 
               <br />
               to them, to have to come here annually as
