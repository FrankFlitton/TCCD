               the neutral tint; however. if he had any. 
               <br />
               he never manifested them. But I think

               that when we have had a man <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> in our

               we are about to amend an Act which will 
               <br />
               give another body power of either retaining 
               <br />
               that man or dismissing him, I think we 
               <br />
               ought to limit the power of appointing a
