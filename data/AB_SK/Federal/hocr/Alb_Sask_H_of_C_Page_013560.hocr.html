               of the members who have expressed their

               not been badly treated during the last ﬁvd

               I was met by the members of the territorial

               ought to have in the way of subsidy for 
               <br />
               the next four years. If I remember rightly, 
               <br />
               this took place in the fall of 1896, before I 
               <br />
               was sworn in, and before I had actually 
               <br />
               assumed the performance of my duties in 
               <br />
               this place. I indicated to the members of 
               <br />
               the government what I thought, under the 
               <br />
               circumstances, I could recommend. and I 
               <br />
               was led by these gentlemen to believe that 
               <br />
               the amount which I was disposed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span> 
               <br />
               commend would be satisfactory for the next 
               <br />
               three or four years. The amount which I 
               <br />
               recommended was added to the subsidy of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Territories at the next ses- 
               <br />
               sion of parliament, and I think, under the 
               <br />
               then existing circumstances, I had the right 
               <br />
               to believe that in the opinion of the members

               <br />
               amount thus added would prove a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satis‘</span> 
               <br />
               factory addition to the subsidy. Then cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances changed, and demands were 
               <br />

               consistently with the understanding which 
               <br />
               was reached at that time, although I am 
               <br />
               quite prepared to admit there was nothing of 
               <br />
               a binding character. but at the same time, 
               <br />
               it was of such a character that I had reason-

               satisfactorily with the position as it then
