               <br />
               various Provinces that are united in one Fed- 
               <br />
               eral State. The hon. gentleman said, in ad- 
               <br />
               dressing himself not only to the French members 
               <br />
               in this House, but to the French people throughout 
               <br />
               the country : You are a conquered race ; you have 
               <br />
               no right to aspire to equality, and at best you 
               <br />
               are but Gibeonites in the midst of Israel. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman quoted the observations which I made 
               <br />
               some thirteen years ago on this particular clause 
               <br />
               which he proposes to strike out from the North— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">VVest</span> Territories Act, and I supposed the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman had quoted those observations with 
               <br />
               approval. I said then that the question was one 
               <br />
               that the Government thought it was better should 
               <br />
               be left to the Council that was about to be 
               <br />
               established. Why? Because we thought then 
               <br />
               that it was not necessary that we should decide in 
               <br />
               advance of actual settlement whether there should 
               <br />
               be two languages or one used. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“7e</span> did not 
               <br />
               think it was wise to propose the use of both 
               <br />
               French and English in those Territories until we 
               <br />
               were quite sure that there would be both French and 
               <br />
               English colonists found there. When that Bill went 
               <br />
               to the Senate an hon. Senator, representing, I think, 
               <br />
               the Province of Manitoba, proposed this particular 
               <br />
               amendment, and I will say now that if that 
               <br />
               amendment served to conciliate any section 
               <br />
               of the half-breed population, if it prevented those 
               <br />
               people from being misled by mischievous persons, 
               <br />
               then it was a prudent provision, and it has proved 
               <br />
               inﬁnitely cheaper than gunpowder and police. 
               <br />
               I say that at this day, after that clause has been 
               <br />
               thirteen years upon the statute book, it is not 
               <br />
               possible for our French countrymen to complain 
               <br />
               that any impediment has been put in their way 
               <br />
               in emigrating to or in settling in the North-VVest 
               <br />
               Territory ; and if to-day there are but few 
               <br />
               French people colonising the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“fest</span> Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, it is not because they have been put in an 
               <br />
               inferior position by the legislation on the statute 
               <br />
               book. Thirteen years have gone by since that 
               <br />
               provision ﬁrst became a part of the law. During 
               <br />
               that period racial jealousies have been kept dormant. 
               <br />
               There has been little expense to the country in 
               <br />
               consequence, and the statement made by the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Public Works this evening shows that 
               <br />
               the cost of public printing in both English and 
               <br />
               French in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“’est</span> Territories has been 
               <br />
               something less than the cost of maintaining three 
               <br />
               policemen during the same period of time, and the 
               <br />
               cost of furnishing those who speak the French lang- 
               <br />
               uage with ofﬁcial documents in their own tongue has 
               <br />
               been less than the maintenance of a single police- 
               <br />
               man. I venture to say that,so far as any burden 
               <br />
               upon the public treasury is concerned, this House 
               <br />
               cannot for a moment attach any serious importance 
               <br />
               to the question the hon. gentleman has raised. There 
               <br />
               has been no murmuring of Grecians against Hebrews, 
               <br />
               there has been no complaint that there has been 
               <br />
               rtiality shown or wrong done or negligence exhi- 
               <br />
               ited towards any portion of the population. The 
               <br />
               sources of discontent in this particular were cut <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off,</span> 
               <br />
               at the very beginning, and what we proposed at the 
               <br />
               start might now perhaps be carried out without 
               <br />
               fear of injustice and without any serious objec- 
               <br />
               tion. In fact, I have heard no objection stated, 
               <br />
               unless it be in the s ech which the hon. gen-

               <br />
               British institutions that any of Her Majesty’s 
               <br />
               subjects should speak French. He assumed that 
               <br />
               the speaking of French was at variance with alle- 
               <br />
               giance to the British Crown. He reminded the 
               <br />
               French Canadians that this is a Britich colony, 
               <br />
               that they are a conquered race, and cannot 
               <br />
               thefore stand on a footing of equality with Her 
               <br />
               Majesty’s subjects who speak the English lan- 
               <br />
               guage. That it was an unwarrantable presumption 
               <br />
               on their part to aspire to the rights of freemen, 
               <br />
               unless they were willing to lay aside their mother 
               <br />
               tongue. He said the use of the French language 
               <br />
               was not guaranteed by the Treaty of Paris, that it 
               <br />
               was not mentioned in the Act of 1774, or in the 
               <br />
               Constitutional Act of 1791; that, in fact, there 
               <br />
               was no authority to use the French language in 
               <br />
               Canada until the year 1848, and that the calamity 
               <br />
               which was then inﬂicted upon the country was 
               <br />
               repeated in the Confederation Act of 1867, and 
               <br />
               care must now be taken that the evil then intro- 
               <br />
               duced should not be further extended. It seemed 
               <br />
               to me that the hon. gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forgot</span> that we 
               <br />
               have no Act of Parliament authorising us to stand 
               <br />
               upon our feet instead of upon our heads, and yet 
               <br />
               the great majority of the people of this country 
               <br />
               have the ill-manners to do so without the authority 
               <br />
               of an Act of Parliament, and they manage to get 
               <br />
               along with a considerable degree of comfort. I 
               <br />
               would like to know what constitutional rule the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has in view when he comes to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that French could not be lawfully spoken 
               <br />
               in a Colonial Legislature without the express per- 
               <br />
               mission of an Act of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Imperial,</span> Parliament. 
               <br />
               Why, Mr. Speaker, the great majority of Her 
               <br />
               Majesty’s subjects do not speak English—they 
               <br />
               cannot speak English. A law requiring them to 
               <br />
               speak English would doom them to silence. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Vhen</span> a Legislative Assembly was granted 
               <br />
               to the people of Lower Canada, it was granted 
               <br />
               to people who spoke only French. The vast 
               <br />
               majority of those who were elected to the Local 
               <br />
               Legislature to represent those people knew only 
               <br />
               French. French was the only means of commu- 
               <br />
               nication between the representatives and the 
               <br />
               represented, and it would have been a mockery on 
               <br />
               the part of the Crown to have issued letters 
               <br />
               patent authorising some one on its behalf to call a 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly and to doom that Assembly 
               <br />
               to silence after it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">called</span> together, because no 
               <br />
               member might have been capable of speaking the 
               <br />
               English tongue. It is clear that that Assembly 
               <br />
               did not understand that any such permission from 
               <br />
               the Imperial authorities was necessary to authorise 
               <br />
               the use of the French language. It was the only 
               <br />
               lan age they knew. The people of the Province 
               <br />
               spo e French at home ; they heard French spoken 
               <br />
               at church ; they used the French language in the 
               <br />
               market; and I do not know Why the rule of’ 
               <br />
               convenience should be abrogated in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'Legislature</span> 
               <br />
               or by the Government, when it is followed in every 
               <br />
               other sphere of life. I mi ht remind the hon. gen- 
               <br />
