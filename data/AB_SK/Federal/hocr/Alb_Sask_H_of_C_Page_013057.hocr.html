               Mr. MILLS said there were several

               important features in this Bill which 
               <br />
               would require special attention, One was 
               <br />
               that relating to the powers given to 
               <br />
               tho Lieut. Governor in Council. The 
               <br />
               Premier spoke of their having power to 
               <br />
               establish schools, build roads and bridges 
               <br />
               and do other works of a municipal character.

               Mr. MILLS—That is another matter. If 
               <br />
               it was intended, therefore, that these things 
               <br />
               should be done, it seemed to him provision 
               <br />
               must be made in the Bill for their being 
               <br />
               done by Parliament. There was another 
               <br />
               matter it seemed to him ought not to be 
               <br />
               disregarded ; and that was the terms and 
               <br />
               conditions under which these people would 
               <br />
               ultimately be formed into a Province. It 
               <br />
               would be better that the people who settle 
               <br />
               that territory should know beforehand the 
               <br />
               terms and conditions under which they 
               <br />
               would become an organized part of the 
               <br />
               Dominion. He saw no objection, when the 
               <br />
               population became suﬁiciently large, to al— 
               <br />

               Dominion Parliamentbeforeitwas organized 
               <br />
               into a Province. By and by we would 
               <br />
               be called upon, when Provinces came to 
               <br />
               be organized in that territory, to state 
               <br />
               What liabilities the Dominion should 
               <br />
               assume, and what revenues should be 
               <br />
               given to the Local Government, and it 
               <br />
               seemed to him it was just as well that 
               <br />
               this should be done at the beginning so 
               <br />
               that there would be no room for dispute 
               <br />
               or diiﬁculty in the future. If some deﬁ- 
               <br />
               nite plan was adopted, the people would 
               <br />
               become accustomed to it, and no embar- 
               <br />
               rassment or trouble would arise when it 
               <br />
               came to be carried into effect. Those who 
               <br />
               observed the American territorial system
