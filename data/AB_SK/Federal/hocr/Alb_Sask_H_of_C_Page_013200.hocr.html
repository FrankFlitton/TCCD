               traditions, with his prejudices. In each of 
               <br />
               these conﬂicting antagonistic elements, however, 
               <br />
               there is a common spot of patriotism, and the 
               <br />
               only true policy is that which reaches that 
               <br />
               common patriotism and makes it vibrate in all, to- 
               <br />
               wards a common end and common aspirations. I 
               <br />
               may be asked: What, then, is to be the future of 
               <br />
               Canada? The future of Canada is this : that it 
               <br />
               must be British. I do not share the dreams or the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delusions</span> of those few of my fellow-countrymen of 
               <br />
               French origin, Who talk to us of forming a French 
               <br />
               nation onthe banks of the St. Lawrence; andI would 
               <br />
               say to my hon. friend from Simcoe, if he were 
               <br />
               here, that these dreams ought not to disturb his 
               <br />
               sleep. Those who share these delusions are very 
               <br />
               few; they might be counted upon the ﬁngers of one 
               <br />
               hand, and I never knew but one newspaper which 
               <br />
               ever gave them utterance. Yet, while I say that this 
               <br />
               country is bound to be British, it does not follow 
               <br />
               at all that there must be but one language—the 
               <br />
               English <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">language~to</span> be spoken in this country. 
               <br />
               I claim that I am as loyal as the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               to the institutions of this country, and I am the son 
               <br />
               of a French mother, and I declare that I cling to 
               <br />
               the language which I learned at her knee as I 
               <br />
               cling to the life which she gave me. And upon 
               <br />
               this ground I appeal to every man of British origin, 
               <br />
               to every man of that race in which the domestic 
               <br />
               affections are so strong ; and I know that in 
               <br />
               the heart of every one the answer will be, 
               <br />
               that, situated as we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»</span> are, they would do as 
               <br />
               we do. But the hon. gentleman will revert 
               <br />
               to the cold, dry arguments that, after all, a dualty 
               <br />
               of race will produce friction, and that friction will 
               <br />
               produce danger. But where is the remedy? I 
               <br />
               tell the hon. gentleman that the remedy is not in 
               <br />
               ostracism, not in harsh methods nor in cruel 
               <br />
               methods. My hon. friend from North Bruce (Mr. 
               <br />
               McNeill)——who, like many other good men , preaches 
               <br />
               better than he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practices—gave</span> us the other day 
               <br />
               the true remedy. The true remedy, he said, is 
               <br />
               mutual forbearance and respect. I altogether 
               <br />
               agree with my hon. friend from North Bruce. But 
               <br />
               he complained in his speech that the forbearance 
               <br />
               should not be all on one side. Sir, is it all on one 
               <br />
               side? What he complains of is afew expressions, 
               <br />
               I admit very imprudent, that have fallen from the 
               <br />
               lips of some men in the heat of the debate. Well, 
               <br />
               I am pretty sure that when those expressions 
               <br />
               are sifted and explained they readily fall away. 
               <br />
               The newspapers of Ontario, during the st year, 
               <br />
               have been full of citations of the words 0 my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Bellechasse (Mr. Amyot), pronounced at 
               <br />
               the St. Jean Baptiste celebration last year ; and when 
               <br />
               he took occasion, a few days ago, to explain those 
               <br />
               words, he explained them so thorou hly that my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from North Bruce imme iately wanted 
               <br />
               to make him a member of the Imperial Federation 
               <br />
               League. If all the other expressions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whre</span> so sifted 
               <br />
               I do not despair that my hon. friend from North

               <br />
               my hon. friend from North Norfolk (Mr. Charl- 
               <br />
               ton) complained that the Province of Quebec was 
               <br />
               making no progress, and he instanced the fact that 
               <br />
               in that Province we still have the tithing system, 
               <br />
               and he said if there was in Quebec a true Liberal 
               <br />
               party, they would grapple with such an evil as 
               <br />
               that. There is in Quebec a Liberal party, not 
               <br />
               without fault, I admit, but a party which has 
               <br />
               fought as noble a battle as was ever fought by any 
               <br />
               party in any land. But before I tell him why the 
               <br />
               Liberal party in Quebec do not grapple with the 
               <br />
               tithing system, let me remind him that there is in 
               <br />
               England a Liberal party of which any man ought 
               <br />
               to be proud, 3. party led to-day by one of the 
               <br />
               greatest men that England has ever produced, or 
               <br />
               that any land has ever produced—Mr. Gladstone. 
               <br />
               Does my hon. friend also know that there is a 
               <br />
               tithing system in England just as there is a tithing 
               <br />
               system in Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada—no,</span> not just the same, 
               <br />
               because the tithing system in England is far more 
               <br />
               oppressive and unjust than the system in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada. The tithing system in Lower Canada only 
               <br />
               affects Roman Catholics and no one else, but in Eng- 
               <br />
               land the tithing system aﬂ'ects every man, whether 
               <br />
               he is a member of the Church of England or of 
               <br />
               another. And yet never to this day did the Liberal 
               <br />
               party grapple with that system or attempt to bring 
               <br />
               the English people to abolish that system. Why ? 
               <br />
               Because the great majority of the English people 
               <br />
               would not part with it. And for the very same 
               <br />
               reason the Liberal party has never grappled with 
               <br />
               that system here, because the people of Quebec are 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with it. My hon. friend has read some- 
               <br />
               where that the people are oppressed under the 
               <br />
               tithing system, that they are compelled to abandon 
               <br />
               their lands because the oppression is such that they 
               <br />
               cannot pay the tithes. The truth is the people of 
               <br />
               Quebec to-day give double the amount to the Church 
               <br />
               voluntarily than they give by law. I declare, in the 
               <br />
               name of the Liberal party of Quebec, of which 
               <br />
               I am an humble member, that so long as the con- 
               <br />
               science of Quebec is satisﬁed with the system, never 
               <br />
               will the Liberal party attack that system. I will 
               <br />
               say this to the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy), that if we could make acompact between 
               <br />
               the English and the French, each to mind his own 
               <br />
               business and not meddle with the business of
