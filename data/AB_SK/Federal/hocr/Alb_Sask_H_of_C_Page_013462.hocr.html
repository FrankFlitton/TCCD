               ferring to the constitution of the Territories 
               <br />
               it was not to be in their power to change. 
               <br />
               for the reason that the constitution was to

               be in the hands of this Parliament to change 
               <br />
               from time to time. A province from the 
               <br />
               outset had the right of autonomous govern- 
               <br />
               ment. It had a responsible system of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gov-</span> 
               <br />
               ernment. The Territories were not to have

               responsible government, they were not to 
               <br />
               have autonomy in that sense. but were to

               <br />
               advisers. Again, the provinces were to

               have the right to increase their debt from 
               <br />

               guardianship which we have over those Ter-

               <br />
               ed to incur any debt. One other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">important</span> 
               <br />
               eharacteristic was to be considered in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re-</span> 
               <br />
               gard to the Territories while they were to 
               <br />
               remain in the Territorial condition, and that 
               <br />
               was in view of the peculiar circumstances 
               <br />
               of the Territories, the fact that we were in- 
               <br />
               viting there all races. creeds and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">denomin-</span> 
               <br />
               ations. there was to be the widest toleration 
               <br />
               while the Territories existed. That was 
               <br />
               the corner-stone of the whole; the corner-stone 
               <br />
               which the hon. member for Simone (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) proposes to remove, on the ground 
               <br />
               that there can be no good reason given for 
               <br />
               its existence. As the hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               Opposition has said to-night: no men knew 
               <br />
               better than those who were engaged in 
               <br />
               framing the Act of 1875, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span>

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which,</span> sectarian disputes might create in 
               <br />
               that new country. No one realized better 
               <br />
               the fact, that in so far as the population was 
               <br />
               to be gathered into the Territories from 
               <br />
               the older provinces, it was to be gathered 
               <br />
               from different races, and from amongst men 
               <br />
               who had strong lines of difference as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span> 
               <br />
               gards religious belief. While the popu- 
               <br />
               lation should be going in there, and while 
               <br />
               the Territories should remain under our con- 
               <br />
               trol, at least, there was to be the broadest 
               <br />
               toleration for every belief, and for the 
               <br />
               races, as regards worship, and as re—

               gards larguage and as regards instruction 
               <br />
               in the schools. Is it anything new for us 
               <br />
               to be told to-day that toleration was expen- 
               <br />

               posal to break up the system of the past. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst was: that while the population of 
               <br />
               the Territories only consisted of 66.000 per- 
               <br />
               sons, a little more than 13,000 of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro‘</span>

               fess the Roman Catholic belief, and his 
               <br />
               deduction from that is—-if the fact admits

               of any deduction at all and if the hon.

               <br />
               posal~that because only 13,000 persons have

               accepted the pledge and the good faith of 
               <br />
               this Parliament as to the maintenance of 
               <br />

               <br />
               portance that we should break faith With 
               <br />
               these 13,000 people. It is just as much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.a</span> 
               <br />
               matter of sound policy now as it was in 
               <br />
               1875, that teleration should exist there, and 
               <br />
               that we should extend the broadest invnta- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ligions to come and settle there with a per-

               <br />
               how many people in the past have availed 
               <br />
               themselves of our invitation. The bad faith 
               <br />
               this Parliament would show in repealing a 
               <br />
               provision of that kind, while the Territorial 
               <br />
               system existed at least, would be Just as 
               <br />
               great as if the population who availed them- 
               <br />
               selves of our pledge and relied on that sys- 
               <br />
               tem <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> were only thirteen, instead of 
               <br />
               13,000. The hon. gentleman (Mr. McCarthy) 
               <br />
               in the next stage of his argument said that 
               <br />
               it was an expensive thing to keep up a 
               <br />
               system of toleration, that it was an ex- 
               <br />
               pensive thing to maintain separate schools. 
               <br />
               I have suggested to the House that the 
               <br />
               statesmen who framed the Act of 1875 knew 
               <br />
               as much, from their experience of the older 
               <br />
               provinces, about the expense of separate
