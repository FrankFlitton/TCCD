               desire, in closing my remarks, to quote some obser- 
               <br />
               vations from a powerful writer and a keen obser- 
               <br />
               ver, who has visited this country, Sir Charles 
               <br />
               Dilke. How does he speak of the population, of 
               <br />
               whom the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) and the hon. member for North Norfolk 
               <br />
               (Mr. Charlton) spoke, I will not say with contempt, 
               <br />
               but with suspicion as to their loyalty and with fear 
               <br />
               as to the future of the country so far as they were 
               <br />
               concerned. Sir Charles Dilke referred to one of the 
               <br />
               most prominent statesmen who represented the 
               <br />
               French Canadians, Sir George Cartier. Speaking 
               <br />
               of Sir George Cartier, who was very often accused by 
               <br />
               his opponents in politics, of being too much of a 
               <br />
               Britisher in Canada, Sir Charles said this :
