               This Bill when passed will be no tax whatever upon 
               <br />
               the honest trader and it proposes merely to make

               On account of the wording of one section of the

               tories, and so long ago as 1877 an Act should have 
               <br />
               been passed in this Parliament whereby the dual 
               <br />
               language was imposed upon the Territories; of 
               <br />
               course without any consent of theirs, because at 
               <br />
               that time there was practically no people in the 
               <br />
               Territories to assent, or consent, or dissent from the 
               <br />
               proposition. I think it is also requiring of expla- 
               <br />
               nation, not, as I say, to move for a repeal of this 
               <br />
               clause, but to give some account of how and why it 
               <br />
               is we ﬁnd this clause in the North-VVest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories Act. Now, the history of the matter, as I 
               <br />
               understand it, is this: I think it was a year or 
               <br />
               two, or perhaps three or four years, before the Act 
               <br />
               was passed to which I am about to refer more in 
               <br />
               detail, that the North-VVest Territories were con- 
               <br />
               stituted, or, at all events, brought under some kind 
               <br />
               or form of government—during the time my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the Prime Minister who now leads the 
               <br />
               Government and the House was also in the position 
               <br />
               he occupies to-day. In 1877, however, when my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Bothwell (Mr. Mills) was Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior in the Administration of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for East York (Mr. Mackenzie), he brought 
               <br />
               in a. Bill to amend the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-VVest</span> Territories Act, 
               <br />
               but that Bill as it was introduced into this House 
               <br />
               did not contain the clause with regard to the 
               <br />
               dual language which I now propose that 
               <br />
               the House should expunge. The Bill went 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">due'</span> course to the Senate, and in the Senate 
               <br />
               it was amended by the introduction of this clause ; 
               <br />
               and, so far as I have been able to ascertain, there 
               <br />
               appears to have been no objection made in that 
               <br />
               body to the clause, which was introduced, as I am 
               <br />
               told, by an hon. Senator at the instance of the 
               <br />
               then leader of the Government in that House, the 
               <br />
               Hon. Mr. Scott. I do not pretend to vouch for 
               <br />
               that, but I am so credibly informed. I rather 
               <br />
               think that that cannot be true, however, because 
               <br />
               when the Bill reached this House with these 
               <br />
               amendments, and concurrence in them was called 
               <br />
               for, my hon. friend from Bothwell (Mr. Mills) 
               <br />
               seemed to be surprised at the introduction of 
               <br />
               this articular clause, and expressed his re et at 
               <br />
               it. have extracted from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Howard</span> what 6 said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               on that subject, and I can hardly imagine that his
