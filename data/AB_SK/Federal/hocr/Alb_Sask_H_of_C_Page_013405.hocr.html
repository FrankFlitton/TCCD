               have succeeded? I know something of these people, 
               <br />
               having lived amongst them all my days on most

               a desert and called it peace, but you never could

               And why should such an attempt ever be made

               which might now be settled without diiii- 
               <br />
               culty, will cause discord and disunion as it 
               <br />
               is causing to-day in the Province of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba. I think this Parliament at this time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               will be doing a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> wise act in handing over the 
               <br />
               complete powers in regard to education to the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Vest</span> Assembly. We need have no fear that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“fest</span> Assembly will not legislate wisely and 
               <br />
               well. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> They are interested. \Ve cannot say that 
               <br />
               we only have the interest of the North-West at 
               <br />
               heart. The men who are living there, who are 
               <br />
               devising schemes for the opening up of that country, 
               <br />
               have a deeper and more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“intelligent</span> interest and a 
               <br />
               wider knowledge of these matters than we have 
               <br />
               here, representing every portion of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               \Ve will therefore be doing our duty, we will have 
               <br />
               the blessings of people yet unborn, if we give the 
               <br />
               full powers in regard to educational matters to the 
               <br />
               Legislature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“’est</span> Territories. Then, 
               <br />
               with reference to the question of the language, two 
               <br />
               years ago we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passedﬂay</span> resolution which was con- , 
               <br />
               sidered a com romise measure, but was endorsed 
               <br />
               very heartily y members of this House.‘ That was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">broughty‘into</span> force by legislation during the last 
               <br />
               session. I think that legislation, though notgoing 
               <br />
               as far as I would wish to go myself, was in the right 
               <br />
               direction, and, as it was a compromise measure 
               <br />
               largely meeting the views of those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who,</span> think as I 
               <br />
               do, it received no opposition from us. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.1</span> think per- 
               <br />
               haps that clause might have been left as it 
               <br />
               was. It was acompromise, it was answering the 
               <br />
               purpose, because I think the question of the lan-‘ 
               <br />
               guage under the recent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> legislation will solve
