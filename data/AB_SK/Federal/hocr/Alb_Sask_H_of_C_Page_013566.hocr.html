               <br />
               the west, I venture to say that that is what 
               <br />
               would happen. I feel conﬁdent that if some 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen who have agitated for an- 
               <br />
               tonomy, will quietly think of the matter, 
               <br />
               they will agree with me that this would 
               <br />
               probably be the result. So, we should not 
               <br />
               be in a better position if they were given 
               <br />
               autonomy. We have already given them 
               <br />
               responsible government. To all intents and 
               <br />
               purposes they have the advantages of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial life, except that they do not look 
               <br />
               after the administration of justice, registry 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnancial relief to them. One or two things 
               <br />
               like the registry oﬂice we would be prepared

               be admitted that they might have it. These

               are the three principal subjects with regard

               tus, they have no power to incur debt, and 
               <br />
               I am not sure that that is an unmixed evil.

               Speaking from recollection, I think there 
               <br />
               are only two clauses in the constitu-

               tion under which the police jurisdiction of 
               <br />
               the provinces arises. The province has con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trol</span> over municipal institutions, which has 
               <br />
               been held in some cases, I think, to give a 
               <br />
               certain amount of police power. In addi- 
               <br />
               tion, the province has power over the ad- 
               <br />
               ministration of justice. That is in reality 
               <br />
               the clause in the constitution which gives

               <br />

               justice and police by the Dominion govern-

               mens brings upon this government very 
               <br />
               great expense, caused very largely by the 
               <br />
               present peculiar circumstances of the case. 
               <br />
               The proportionate expense would be nothing

               like the same if there was a large popula-

               <br />
               indebtedness, I speak with some deference. 
               <br />
               I do not wish to express the idea that the 
               <br />
               people of the North-west Territories are not 
               <br />
               as competent to conduct their own affairs

               as the people of any other portion of Can- 
               <br />
               ada, for I think they are. But it must not 
               <br />
               be forgotten by a bod-y like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the]</span> House of

               <br />

               hundred thousand people situated in a vast 
               <br />
               and very rich territory. If they had the 
               <br />
               pow-er to mortgage that territory for all 
               <br />
               time to come, which they would have if 
               <br />
               they were granted provincial powers, it 
               <br />
               might be mortgaged for very unwise and 
               <br />
               very unnecessary purposese. In saying 
               <br />
               this, I wish to guard against the imputation 
               <br />
               of saying that the people of the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories are not as capable of taking care 
               <br />
               of themselves and doing their own busi-
