               Well, Sir, if I am to be compared to an Indian, I

               <br />
               infringed u on; they took the view that sectarian

               of Public Works, in his speech last night, dwelling

               upon the matter of the loyalty of the French Cana-

               of loyalty that French Canada did not embark in

               the choice in relation to that matter arose from the

               try, the true interests of each one are the true 
               <br />
               interests of all ; and if in our opinion a 
               <br />
               special line of policy is likely to be more conduc- 
               <br />
               ive to the interests of Canada than another, we 
               <br />
               have a perfect right to advocate that line of policy; 
               <br />
               and the hon. gentleman had no right to make the 
               <br />
               taunt that he did, and to strive to raise, as he did 
               <br />
               strive to raise, in his speech, feelings of animosity 
               <br />
               and bitterness. Then he went on to say that per- 
               <br />
               secution and fanaticism would not stand. Well, 
               <br />
               that is true, at least I believe and hope it is true. I 
               <br />
               do not believe that persecution or fanaticism ever 
               <br />
               beneﬁted a cause yet, and I hope that the time 
               <br />
               will come when evangelists can hold religious 
               <br />
               services in the city of Hull without interruption, 
               <br />
               and when the Salvation Army can parade the 
               <br />
               streets of Quebec with the same facility and case 
               <br />
               that they can the streets of Ottawa. I hope that 
               <br />
               persecution and fanaticism in that respect will not 
               <br />
               stand in the Province of Quebec ; and if the time 
               <br />
               should ever come when some French Luther 
               <br />
               wants to nail ninety-ﬁve theses, more or less, to 
               <br />
               the door of any church in Canada, attackin 
               <br />
               tithes, fabrique assessments, canon law, an 
               <br />
               medieval institutions of any kind—I hope the 
               <br />
               time will come when any person, whether a 
               <br />
               clergyman or otherwise, will be at liberty to nail 
               <br />
               his placard to the door of the church and maintain 
               <br />
               that position, with free speech, and every right 
               <br />
               that pertains to free speech <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in,</span> Canada. Now, Sir, 
               <br />
               with regard to toleration, all that we want in this 
               <br />
               Dominion, all that we ask in this Equal Rights 
               <br />
               movement, is equal rights in religion, the right to 
               <br />
               worship God, the right to proclaim our belief, the 
               <br />
               right to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carry)pn</span> the usages of our religion in any 
               <br />
               part of this minion without molestation. That 
               <br />
               is all we claim. We have no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dwire</span> to abridge the 
               <br />
               rights possessed by any man in this Dominion, 
               <br />
