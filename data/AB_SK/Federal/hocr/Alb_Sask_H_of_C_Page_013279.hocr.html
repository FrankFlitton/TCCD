               The hon. Minister of Justice advanced the argu- 
               <br />
               ment that the Bill would not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effectual</span> in des- 
               <br />
               troying the use of the French language in the 
               <br />
               courts of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—“lest</span> Territories, because those 
               <br />
               courts were courts of Canada established under 
               <br />
               this Act. I deny that proposition. I say the courts 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> Territories are simply local 
               <br />
               courts. It is true, they were created by the 
               <br />
               Parliament of Canada ; but they are not the courts 
               <br />
               to which this section refers. It refers to the 
               <br />
               Supreme Court and the Exchequer Court in the 
               <br />
               city of Ottawa ; but, you might as well say that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> courts in the Province of Ontario were 
               <br />
               courts of Canada under this section, as to claim 
               <br />
               that the courts of the North-W'est Territories are 
               <br />
               courts of Canada established under this Act. Now, 
               <br />
               Sir, I desire to thank the House for the patient 
               <br />
               hearing they have given me speaking on this 
               <br />
               question, which has been discussed for four or ﬁve 
               <br />
               days, and which must be more or less threshed out 
               <br />
               at all points. But I may be permitted in closing 
               <br />
               to read from a little work on the Upper Houses 
               <br />
               published by the late Senator Trudel in 1880, an 
               <br />
               extract which I think justiﬁes me in coming to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that it would bewell indeed, in the North- 
               <br />

               <br />
               religious, and the national feelings which Mr. 
               <br />

               <br />

               therefore, say, in conclusion, that I am glad to be 
               <br />
               able to support the Bill of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe, believing that if there is anything 
               <br />
               offensive in it, it will be amended in Committee, so 
               <br />
               as to make it satisfactory to the keenest sensibili— 
               <br />
               ties of any hon. gentleman in this House. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. COOK. Some days ago, when the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), was 
               <br />
               making an arrangement with the right hon. the 
               <br />
               First Minister to set apart a day for the discussion 
               <br />
               of this question, I stated that I would not be able 
               <br />
               to be present on account of an engagement which 
               <br />
               I had, and would, therefore, be prevented, if the 
               <br />
               question then came to a vote, giving expression to 
               <br />
               my opinions before this House ; and I took occa- 
               <br />
               sion to state, in view of this possibility, that I 
               <br />
               intended to vote against the Bill of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon,</span> mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North Simcoe. Fortunately, however, I 
               <br />
               was present last night to give my ﬁrst vote on this 
               <br />
               question. I may add that as the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe was engaged in a matter pertaining 
               <br />
               to his profession in which I happened to be on 
               <br />
               the side opposite to him, and which was postponed 
               <br />
               by arrangement, he is here, I may say, at my will. 
               <br />
               But the hon. gentleman stated, when I declared 
               <br />
               my intention of voting against his Bill, that I 
               <br />
               had made up my mind to vote without hearing 
               <br />
               the discussion. Well, the hon. gentleman forgot 
               <br />
               that he had made a speech in this House, and 
               <br />
               several speeches in the country, foreshadowing 
               <br />
               his measure, and he forgot also that I had read 
               <br />
               the Bill and the preamble, and was, therefore, in a. 
               <br />
               position to come to a decision. The Bill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofitself,with-</span> 
               <br />
               out the preamble, was sufﬁcient ground for me, with- 
               <br />
               out hearing any further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussionmwithout</span> hear— 
               <br />
               ing any of the speeches made—to determine to 
               <br />
               vote against the Bill; because I am opposed to 
               <br />
               the extermination of the French language in any 
               <br />
               part of the Dominion. I must confess that I was 
               <br />
               somewhat surprised when I ﬁrst heard of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman’s intention to move in this direction. 
               <br />
               This discussion has taken a very Wide range. It 
               <br />
               has travelled from one end of the world almost to 
               <br />
               the other, and references have been made during it 
               <br />
               to questions affecting many other countries, some- 
               <br />
               what similarly situated to ours. I do not pro- 
               <br />
               pose, even if I deemed myself sufﬁciently versed 
               <br />
