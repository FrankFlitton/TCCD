               ' pretation of that preamble which was given in the 
               <br />
               speech with which it was introduced. The Bill 
               <br />
               and the preamble must stand or fall together ; and 
               <br />
               it is all nonsense for the hon. gentleman to come 
               <br />
               into this Chamber after ﬁve days of debate have 
               <br />
               taken place, after passions of creed and passions 
               <br />
               of race have been aroused, not only in this House 
               <br />
               but through the country, by his Bill and by his 
               <br />
               speech—for him to come into the House now and 
               <br />
               say: “I ﬁnd I have made a mistake, and I am will- 
               <br />
               ing to withdraw the preamble if you will allow 
               <br />
               the Bill to go into the Committee and carry it. ” 
               <br />
               I venture to say that style of action will not com- 
               <br />
               mend itself to the common sense of the House. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman attempted to make the House be— 
               <br />
               lieve that the meaning of that preamble had been 
               <br />
               magniﬁed, that the preamble did not mean that 
               <br />
               which a man of common sense would imply from its 
               <br />
               language. Well, Sir, I can put but one meaning 
               <br />
               upon it, and that is the meaning which, if I did not 
               <br />
               derive it from the Bill, I would certainly derive 
               <br />
               from the preamble when read in the light of the 
               <br />
               speech with which the hon. gentleman introduced 
               <br />
               his Bill. What does the preamble say ‘3 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ Whereas it is expedient in the interest of the national 
               <br />
               unity of the Dominion that there should be commu- 
               <br />
               nity of language among the people of Canada.” 
               <br />
               Well, Sir, does the hon. gentleman think this 
               <br />
               House is a debating club ? Are we to put in our 
               <br />
               Bills more abstract propositions ? The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man is too old a parliamentarian not to know that 
               <br />
               when a proposition of that kind is placed in the 
               <br />
               preamble of a Bill it is placed there for the purpose 
               <br />
               of taking legislative action upon it, and when he 
               <br />
               places it there he places it as the key to the enacting 
               <br />
               part which is to follow ; and to say that he asks 
               <br />
               Parliament to carry a mere abstract proposition 
               <br />
               on which legislation is not to be based, is merely 
               <br />
               to turn this House into a debating club. But, Sir, 
               <br />
               that was not the object of the hon. gentleman. 
               <br />
               His speech was plain, and although the closing 
               <br />
               speech which he delivered to this House has been 
               <br />
               commended so much, those who followed the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman clearly could see that he pledged him- 
               <br />
               self that the crusade which he had taken up, 
               <br />
               which was now beginning, was to take up the rest 
               <br />
               of his political life. He is now upon the threshold 
               <br />
               of the work which he is engaged in, and he is not 
               <br />
               going to stop by repealing section 110 of the 
               <br />
               Revised Statutes of Canada relating to the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories, but he is going to carry out 
               <br />
               that principle which he has enunciated in the pre- 
               <br />
               amble of his Bill, and, therefore, those who vote 
               <br />
               for his Bill to-night, who prefer that solution of 
               <br />
               the question, cannot divorce the preamble from it, 
               <br />
               and they cannot vote for the Bill divorced from the 
               <br />
               preamble and the speech made by the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man who introduced it. But, Sir, the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man talked as if in this House—and that language 
               <br />
               is re-echoed in very many parts of this country to 
               <br />
               the discredit of those who use it——he talks as if, in 
               <br />
               this House, hon. gentlemen are divided by race 
               <br />
               and creed distinctions ; indeed, one would suppose 
               <br />
               that in the House of Commons of Canada, to listen 
               <br />
               to some hon. gentlemen here, and to listen to their 
               <br />
               organs in the public press, this House is divided by 
               <br />
               a broad line, French gentlemen on one side trying 
               <br />
               to carry out their opinions, and the English— 
               <br />
               speaking members being on the other endea— 
               <br />
               voring to enforce their opinions. Sir, I believe, in 
               <br />
               relation to this question of languages, that the

               <br />
               in the House the other day ? We heard from the

               hon. member for Ottawa (Mr. Robillard) a con- 
               <br />
               fession, which was re-echoed from this side of the 
               <br />
               House, that every French gentleman in the 
               <br />
               country——such are the forces at work in this com- 
               <br />
               munity—is convinced that he would not be doing 
               <br />
               justice to his children if he brought them up in 
               <br />
               ignorance of the English language and English 
               <br />
               literature. The fact is, as he told us, that the 
               <br />
               French boys of the present age are being educated 
               <br />
               in both languages, so that when they grow 
               <br />
               up they will be able to take their place, not 
               <br />
               only in the parliamentary arena, but in the com- 
               <br />
               mercial circles of the great commercial centres. 
               <br />
               Is there discord between races and creeds in this 
               <br />
               House? What sight do we behold in this Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment to-night ? We see one of the historical parties 
               <br />
               of Canada led by whom <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘2</span> Led by a French gentle- 
               <br />
               man who was elected as leader of the great Liberal 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">party—because</span> he was a French Canadian? N0 ; 
               <br />
               but because his ability and his experience, his tact 
               <br />
               and his urbanity, ﬁtted him for that high position ; 
               <br />
               and I will venture the assertion that the choice 
               <br />
               made by that party two or three years ago has been 
               <br />
               more than justiﬁed by the experience we have had 
               <br />
               of his leadership in the House. Sir, I will venture 
               <br />
               to say, although he is a French Canadian, that he 
               <br />
               enjoys the conﬁdence of his followers to as large an 
               <br />
               extent as his distinguished predecessors did. We 
               <br />
               have every conﬁdence in him, we know his breadth 
               <br />
               of view, we know that he is not animated by racial 
               <br />
               or creed antipathies, but that he desires to build 
               <br />
               up a nation in this country upon broad and gener— 
               <br />
               ous grounds. Sir, I venture this further remark 
               <br />
               that, after two or three years’ experience of his 
               <br />
               leadership, he not only enjoys the thorough 
               <br />
               conﬁdence of those who follow him, but 
               <br />
               he has earned, and has deservedly earned, 
               <br />
               the respect of his political opponents. Well, we 
               <br />
               heard that hon. gentleman charged here the other 
               <br />
               night by the hon. member who introduced the Bill 
               <br />
               —-and I know Why he charged it, he charged it from 
               <br />
               the basest of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motives~—that</span> that hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               was a party to certain treasonable language which 
               <br />
               was used down on the banks of the St. Lawrence, 
               <br />
               or language alleged to be treasonable, by the 
               <br />
               Premier of Quebec ; and he charged that the leader 
               <br />
