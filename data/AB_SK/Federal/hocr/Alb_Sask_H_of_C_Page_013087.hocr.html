               ernor in Council there, now are not purely legislative 
               <br />

               <br />
               How are those administrative and executive powers to be 
               <br />
               exercised ? Are they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">togbe</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exercised?</span> by the Executive of

               them? Does the hon. gentleman propose they shall act on

               the advice which they may, from time to time, receive from 
               <br />
               the Government here ? Now, I say that these are matters 
               <br />
               of the very ﬁrst importance, and that before we are asked 
               <br />
               to take any step in advance in the legislative and govern- 
               <br />
               mental develOpment of that country, we should note precise- 
               <br />
               ly what we are called upon to do; for it does seem me to be 
               <br />
               rather extraordinary to admit that the people of the Terri- 
               <br />
               tory are so far advanced, by way of organisation, into a 
               <br />
               political and social community, as to make it necessary 
               <br />
               that they should have what may be considered a mature 
               <br />
               system devised <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,for</span> the purposes of legislation, and yet that 
               <br />
               the legislative and administrative affairs of the country 
               <br />
               should be in the hands of an irresponsible body. Certainly 
               <br />
               the power of legislation and administration should go 
               <br />
               hand in hand. If the community are entitled, and I 
               <br />
               am inclined to think that the hon. gentleman is doing 
               <br />
               right in recognising that they are entitled, to complete 
               <br />
               legislative control over those matters which are exclu- 
               <br />
               sively assigned to them, they should have equally indepen- 
               <br />
               dent control over the executive and administrative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂ‘airs</span> 
               <br />
               of the Territory, within the same limits. They should be 
               <br />
               made commensurate with the legislative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">authority;</span> they 
               <br />
               should be governmental to the same extent, and it would be 
               <br />
               a wholly anomalous condition of things for the executive 
               <br />
               and administrative affairs to be directed, not in consonance 
               <br />
               with the views of the majority of those whom the peeple 
               <br />
               have returned to the Legislature, but should be controlled 
               <br />
               by instructions given, from time to time, to the Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor from Ottawa. That would be simply <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Downing.</span> 
               <br />
               street over again. It would be simply introducing into the 
               <br />
               North-West Territories precisely that condition of things 
               <br />
               which existed in Upper and Lower Canada beiore respon- 
               <br />
               sible Government was established. They had legislative 
               <br />
               b )dIGB that represented the people, but they had an 
               <br />
               executive Government that represented Downing-street, 
               <br />
               and it would be rather a retrograde step to introduce any 
               <br />
               analogous system of government into the North-West 
               <br />
               Territories. I am sure the House will be anxious to know 
               <br />
               precisely what the hon. gentleman proposes to do in this 
               <br />

               Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD. This is, perhaps, not the

               time to discuss, in extenso, the various questions which the 
               <br />
               hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> has raised. In the ﬁrst lace, I must tell 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman that in the North~ est they have a 
               <br />
               most holy horror of responsible government. The 
               <br />
               representations are, I may say, without any exception, 
               <br />
               against the premature introduction of responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment. If the hon. gentlemen were in the position of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Interior, he would ﬁnd that the one cry is: do 
               <br />
               not at all at present give us a government of that kind. I 
               <br />
               take it the assembly, although sitting separate from the 
               <br />
               Government, will have the same administrative as well 
               <br />
               as legislative powers which they had when under the name 
               <br />

               <br />
