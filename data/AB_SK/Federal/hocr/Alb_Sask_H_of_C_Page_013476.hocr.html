               <br />

               <br />
               tion of justice. They have already got that 
               <br />
               power and have passed ordinances in respect 
               <br />
               to it. so that there is no necessity for its 
               <br />
               forming part of this Bill. Section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">49</span> is 
               <br />
               amended by striking out the word " any." 
               <br />
               The Act as it now stands contains the words 
               <br />
               “ and any three judges of the court. shall 
               <br />
               constitute the court,” and it is proposed to 
               <br />
               make it read: “ and three judges of the 
               <br />
               court shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farm</span> the court.” Section 50 of 
               <br />
               the Act is repealed and amended by adding 
               <br />
               “ provided that the judge by or before whom 
               <br />
               the judgment or decision then in question 
               <br />
               was rendered or made, shall not sit as one 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judgw</span> composing the court.” That 
               <br />
               means that the trial judge whose judgment 
               <br />
               is appealed against shall not sit en banc. 
               <br />
               Section 59 is repealed and a section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub~</span> 
               <br />
               stituted for it: That each sheriff shall be 
               <br />
               paid a salary or $500, and the Lieutenant- 
               <br />
               Governor, by and with the advice of the 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly, may legislate with re- 
               <br />
               spect to remuneration by fees or otherwise 
               <br />
               by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sheriffs</span> and clerks, including the registry 
               <br />
               court. The change is: That the Lieuten— 
               <br />
               ant-Governor now ﬁxes the fees and this 
               <br />
               Act will give power to the Assembly to do 
               <br />
               that. The clause of the Bill in relation to 
               <br />
               the appointment of justices of the peace 
               <br />
               and police magistrates as it appears 
               <br />
               in the old Bill will be amended by adding 
               <br />
               to subsection 4 the following words: ‘°' or 
               <br />
               unless he is a magistrate of not less <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> 
               <br />
               three years’ standing in Canada.” This
