               by which the entire land titles system should

               perhaps partly because of the opinion which 
               <br />
               I think the hon. Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               has formed that the question of provincial

               <br />
               yond next year, he decided not to take up 
               <br />
               any of these points at this session, but to 
               <br />
               leave them over until next session, and then 
               <br />
               ﬁnally dispose of the whole subject by

               gesting that even if the change respecting

               <br />

               advantage to the practical carrying on of the

               business of his government if certain of 
               <br />
               these minor changes were made. It perhaps 
               <br />
               would be only right for me to state further 
               <br />
               that Premier Haultain’s proposals to the 
               <br />
               1101]. Minister of the Interior included half a 
               <br />
               dozen other sections in addition to those that 
               <br />
               I have gone over. I have omitted a number 
               <br />
               of sections at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggestion</span> of the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Justice, which holds that these other 
               <br />
               sections deal with criminal jurisdiction over 
               <br />
               which for the present this parliament’s 
               <br />
               authority had better be maintained. With 
               <br />
               that View of the department, I do not express 
               <br />
               agreement or disagreement. At this stage 
               <br />
               of the session it is perhaps wise not to 
               <br />
               attempt to introduce anything controversial, 
               <br />
               and I have therefore left out half a dozen 
               <br />
               sections which Premier Haultain desired 
               <br />
               to have added to this amendment. These 
               <br />
               various sections which I have added to this 
               <br />
               proposed amendment are not of very great 
               <br />
               moment. I do not imagine that they 
               <br />
               can raise any controversy at all. I trust

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN (Halifax). Before

               you leave the Chair, Mr. Speaker, I wish 
               <br />
               to bring to the attention of the House a 
               <br />
               matter which is of some importance not

               entire Dominion. Early this session I call-

               time we thought would have been ended 
               <br />
               before this—the government would introduce 
               <br />
               some legislation for that purpose. Ac-

               cording to the census of 1901. there were
