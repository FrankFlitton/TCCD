               Now, the line of the Opposition as developed was, ﬁrst, and 
               <br />
               that was the primary point in the principle they adopted, 
               <br />
               that the sale of lands in the North-West should be made to 
               <br />
               actual settlers only, subject to conditions of settlement. 
               <br />
               That was a salutary and just provision which would have 
               <br />
               effectually prevented the Operations of speculative companies 
               <br />
               in that country, and in failing to adopt it the Government 
               <br />
               are largely responsible for the evil consequences that have 
               <br />
               followed in the settlement of the country and the dissatis- 
               <br />
               faction that has existed there. Then, the Opposition took 
               <br />
               ground distinctly in favor of the competitive principle with 
               <br />
               regard to the placing of coal lands, pasture leases and tim- 
               <br />
               b.-r limits. The Opposition have always held that these 
               <br />
               being the property of the public, it was the duty of the 
               <br />
               Government to secure as large a return from them as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pos</span> 
               <br />
               sible. We held that the granting of pasture leases at one 
               <br />
               cent an acre, without inviting competition, that the grant- 
               <br />
               ing of coal lands and of timber limits upon the terms on 
               <br />
               which the Government did grant them, without inviting 
               <br />
               competition, was detrimental to the interests of the people, 
               <br />
               and not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comment</span> with the principles of just and honest 
               <br />
               government. What do we ﬁnd with reference to timber 
               <br />
               licenses? We ﬁnd that at the time the last return was 
               <br />
               made, over 25,000 square miles of timber limits had been 
               <br />
               granted by Order in Council, at a uniform rate, without re- 
               <br />
               ference to the value of the limits; and hon. gentlemen know 
               <br />
               that in many cases these limits, which were granted for 85 
               <br />
               per square mile, without inviting competition, were worth 
               <br />
               vastly more in many cases than the small amount received 
               <br />
               by the Government. it has been ascertained since that an 
               <br />
               hon. member of this House was interested in a limit for 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">850,000</span> was received by those interested, but which 
               <br />
               had been obtained from the Government for the sum of 8260. 
               <br />
               The whole system was rotten, and the Government failed 
               <br />
               to secure for the country the large revenue that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> have 
               <br />
               been secured from the sale of timber lands, coal leases, or 
               <br />
               the leasing of pasture ranches. The only restriction im- 
               <br />
               ] osed with regard to pasture ranches was, that no friend of 
               <br />
               the Government could have a lease of more than 50,000 
               <br />
               acres. The leases should have been put up at auction, and 
               <br />
               the Government should have taken pains to secure for the 
               <br />
               property the price it was worth, and that public competi- 
               <br />
               tion alone could determine. The system adapted of selling 
               <br />
               timber licenses at a uniform rate of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">85</span> per square mile when, 
               <br />
               perhaps, in the one case they might be worth a hundred 
               <br />
               times as much as in another, and of leasing pasture lands at 
               <br />
               one cent per acre, and of granting coal leases on the terms 
               <br />
               On which the Government granted them, has worked in the 
               <br />
               interests of the friends of the Government, but not in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests</span> of the people. We have had attempts made to 
               <br />
               justify the conduct of the Government; we have had feeble 
               <br />
               at'empts made to show that the development of the North- 
               <br />
               West should be considered on the whole as satisfactory. I 
               <br />
               deny in toto that that is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case.</span> I maintain, on the con- 
               <br />
               trary, that the policy of the Government has been uni- 
               <br />
               formly in the interest of the speculator and the moneyed 
               <br />
               man, and uniformly against the interest of the settler 
               <br />
               and the poor man. By the system of credit sales of unlim-

               the fact that our public lands, as compared with these of the

               United States, are remote; they seem to be unaware of the 
               <br />
               fact that a settler going to the lands of Manitoba or the 
               <br />
               N orth-West would necessarily pass almost through, or very 
               <br />
               nearly by, a territory oﬁering vast acres of public land at 
               <br />
               great inducements to settlers, and that, other things being 
               <br />
               equal, settlers would be more liable to take up land in 
               <br />
               Dakota than in our North-West. Yet, in face of the fact 
               <br />
               that in the Territory of Dakota public lands within the 
               <br />
               limits of the railway grants are sold at $2.50, and outside 
               <br />
               of the railway grants at 81.25 per acre, and that this 
               <br />
               land is more eligibly situated, being nearer the railways, 
               <br />
               nearer markets, where agricultural implements and other 
               <br />
               goods can be more readily and cheaply obtained, and offer- 
               <br />
               ing attractions to the settler inﬁnitely greater than those 
               <br />
               offered in our North-West,-—as if those inducements were 
               <br />
               not enough, the Government, in order to shut out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immi.</span> 
               <br />
               gration more effectually, must place our lands at a ﬁgure 
               <br />
               higher than lands can be obtained in the United States, and 
               <br />
               their policy in this respect has been very effective, as shown 
               <br />
               by the immigration returns. Now, wehave here a memorial 
               <br />
               from the North-West Assembly, and these men upon the 
               <br />
               spot, knowing the wants of the country, petition the 
               <br />
               Government in exactly the line the Opposition hasadvo- 
               <br />
               cated for nine years past. They ask the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> to 
               <br />
               make the price of pre-emptions within twenty miles of the 
               <br />
               railways at $2 per acre, and outside of that at 81 per 
               <br />
               acre. If the Government were to do that they would 
               <br />
               then be offering inducements to settlers somewhat better 
               <br />
               than those offered by the United States Government. and 
               <br />
               would have some show of securing that settlement we desire 
               <br />
               and which it is necessary we should have, and which 
               <br />
               we never can have with higher prices on our side 
               <br />
               besides the other disadvantages to settlers. What 
               <br />
               we want in the North-West is not that friends of the 
               <br />
               Government may make money out of timber limits, 
               <br />
               not that friends of the Government may acquire cattle 
               <br />
               ranches and coal mine licenses and timber licenses 
               <br />
               at low rates, but what we want is the entry of settlers who 
               <br />
               will bring that country under cultivation; and to order to 
               <br />
               secure settlers we have to consider their interests. That is 
               <br />
               what we have not yet done. The policy of the Government 
               <br />
               has been, practically, to leave out of view the interests of the 
               <br />
               settler in the North-West. Now I hold, without detaining 
               <br />
               the House much longer, that the true policy of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern.</span>

               ment is to make the inducements for settlement in the North— 
               <br />
               West greater than those oﬂ'ered by the United States. Our 
               <br />
               policy is to offer our lands cheaper than the American Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment offer theirs. Our policy is to give homestead regu- 
               <br />
               lations at least as attractive as those in the United States. 
               <br />
               In the United States, the homestead settler can take up 
               <br />
               public lands wherever he can ﬁnd them. The chequer-board 
               <br />
               system is not adopted there, that system which has created 
               <br />
               the isolation of one settler from another, and has made it 
               <br />
               difﬁcult for the settlers to have schools, and roads, and other 
               <br />
               advantages. But the homestead settlers in the United 
               <br />
               States can take lands in bodies and in blocks wherever they 
               <br />
               can ﬁnd them. The United States will grant lands to home- 
               <br />
               stead settlers without restriction as to location, their policy 
               <br />
               being to get settlers to take up the lands and have the 
               <br />
               wilderness converted into a cultivated country. Let our 
               <br />
               Government adopt that policy in our North-West. If a 
               <br />
               homesteader wants a piece of land, let him take it 
               <br />
               where ever it can be found belonging to the Government. 
               <br />
               If he wants to buy land, sell him that land at a reasonable 
               <br />
               price, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">82</span> an acre within railway limits, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1</span> an acre out-
