               for four or ﬁve years. I would like to 
               <br />
               say to the Minister of the Interior, that some 
               <br />
               of the reasons which he has advanced for 
               <br />
               not dealing with this question at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time seem to be reasons for never 
               <br />
               dealing with it. He speaks of the question 
               <br />
               of population. Now we do not apprehend 
               <br />
               that population in the North-west Terri- 
               <br />
               tories is going to stand still after the ex- 
               <br />
               piration of four or ﬁve years. It will pro- 
               <br />
               bably continue to increase, at least we hope 
               <br />
               it will, at the rate of 60,000, 70,000 or 80,- 
               <br />
               000 every year, and that for many years to 
               <br />
               come. My hon. friend suggests that the 
               <br />
               question should be put off four or ﬁve years, 
               <br />
               or until the population attains 600,000 or 
               <br />
               700,000 people. Well, is there any par- 
               <br />
               ticular reason why the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories, when they have attained 
               <br />
               the number of 200,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or,</span> 300,000, should not 
               <br />
               be entrusted with the government of their 
               <br />
               own territory '2 My hon. friend refers to 
               <br />
               the fact that they have a very rich <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coun»</span> 
               <br />
               try, a country of great resources. Is it not 
               <br />
               true that we may place the same conﬁdence 
               <br />
               in the people of that country as we place 
               <br />
               in the people of other communities in Can- 
               <br />
               ada ? Is there any special reason to sup- 
               <br />
               pose they will unduly mortgage their future? 
               <br />
               There is not a province in Canada that is 
               <br />
               not capable at this very moment of abus- 
               <br />
               ing its borowing powers so as to make itself 
               <br />
               hopelessly bankrupt, not one; and why 
               <br />
               should it be supposed that these people are 
               <br />
               any more likely to abuse their borrowing 
               <br />
               powers than the people of Ontario, Quebec, 
               <br />
               or the maritime provinces ? I am glad to 
               <br />
               note that my hon. friend regards the school 
               <br />
               question in that country as satisfactorily 
               <br />
               settled, and I trust that it is so. With re- 
               <br />
               gard to his view that if terms were made 
               <br />
               with that territory now these gentlemen 
               <br />
               would come again year by year, I suppose 
               <br />
               that is more an argument of Convenience, 
               <br />
               from the standpoint of the government, than 
               <br />
               otherwise. It does not seem to possess 
               <br />
               much value, even from that standpoint, be- 
               <br />
               cause the people of the North-west Territor- 
               <br />
               ies are coming every year, as it is now, and 
               <br />
               if they should continue to come it will oc- 
               <br />
               casion no greater inconvenience to the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment than it has in years past.

               I do not see that the ﬁnancial question,

               <br />
               on a per capita basis, if it is an adequate 
               <br />

               in the future for preventing these territories 
               <br />

               hon. friend did not make himself very 
               <br />
               clear to me on that point, because I do not

               see, if there is a certain difﬁculty now ex-

               <br />
               that it will not present itself in the future

               if the settlement is delayed for four or ﬁve 
               <br />
               years. There is, it seems to me, a strong 
               <br />
               reason for lending an ear to what these peo- 
               <br />

               people of the North-west Territories will be 
               <br />

               here as my hon. friend has stated in his

               speech. If provincial autonomy were granted 
               <br />

               <br />
               self-government, then, such matters would . 
               <br />
               be dealt with in their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislature</span> by gen-

               wants and necessities of that country than

               the majority of the members of this com-

               mittee. I feel, here, that the great majority 
               <br />
               of the members of this House are not ade- 
               <br />

               <br />
               country, because they do not understand 
               <br />
               the people, or their wants, or necessities as

               or as well as hon. members from that coun-

               <br />
               important advance in the government of 
               <br />
               that country if these local matters, which 
               <br />
               are ordinarily assigned to provincial govern- 
               <br />
               ments, should be dealt with by the people 
               <br />
               of the North-west Territories themselves, 
               <br />
               through their representatives in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> own 
               <br />
               provincial assemblies. I do not pretend to

               <br />
               What I have said is merely my impression 
               <br />
               gathered from what has been placed before

               from the North-west Territories, and from 
               <br />
               statements which have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[made</span> by the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of the Interior; but, having

               regard to the information which I have de-

               <br />
               seem to me that the hon. Minister of the
