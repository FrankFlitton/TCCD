               Mr. BORDEN (Halifax). Perhaps I have 
               <br />
               not made myself clear to my hon. friend; 
               <br />
               but certainly he has not made himself very 
               <br />
               clear to me. I asked him how provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy could possibly increase the bur-

               <br />
               given to the North-west Territories, which 
               <br />
               I understand perfectly are being asked, not

               as a matter of charity, but as a matter of 
               <br />
               right. I did not suggest that they were 
               <br />
               asked as a matter of charity. Whether or 
               <br />

               <br />
               the people, if a subsidy which the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories regard as adequate is given 
               <br />

               subsidy is being asked now. Then, how 
               <br />
               can the establishment of provincial govern- 
               <br />

               Mr. DOUGLAS. I think I can answer the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s question. The burdens I 
               <br />
               have reference to are simply these: If we 
               <br />
               have two provinces, or probably three. 
               <br />
               we shall require three separate sets 
               <br />
               of buildings, three sets of organiza- 
               <br />
               tion, and a large body of oﬂicials all 
               <br />
               over the country, which at present We 
               <br />
               do not need. It is one thing to speak 
               <br />
               of one of the older provinces main- 
               <br />
               taining municipal organization to the full 
               <br />
               extent to which it is enjoyed in Ontario 
               <br />
               and Quebec, and quite another thing to deal 
               <br />
               With a country where the people live four 
               <br />
               or six or eight miles apart, and Where you 
               <br />
               may have a stretch of ﬁfteen miles With 
               <br />
               nobody living upon it. Hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               need to know the country, the immens- 
               <br />
               ity of the area, and the necessity of this 
               <br />
               area being ﬁlled up, in order to maintain 
               <br />
               and carry out with comfort and success 
               <br />
               municipal organization. So that we believe 
               <br />
               the burdens of the people would be very 
               <br />
               largely increased, and the taxation would 
               <br />
               became much higher than it is in any of 
               <br />
               the older provinces. Hence we say it is 
               <br />
               better to delay somewhat the organization 
               <br />
               of the country into provinces, and to wait 
               <br />
               until it is more fully settled.

               tion except by provincial establishment. 
               <br />
               That language was used, I take it, all over 
               <br />
               the territories during the contest previous 
               <br />

               <br />
               these very same representatives went to 
               <br />
               the North-west Territories legislature, this

               to those which existed in the several provinces 
               <br />
               then forming the Dominion. 
               <br />
               That was passed unanimously with the 
               <br />
               other clauses in this resolution. That shows 
               <br />
               that the people of the territories are in 
               <br />
               favour of provincial organization, and the 
               <br />
               sentiment in the constituency represented 
               <br />
               by the hon. gentleman must be strongly in 
               <br />
               favour of that course. That being the case, 
               <br />
               I cannot understand how he can oppose 
               <br />
               that policy here. I can understand why 
               <br />
               he personally should be opposed to it. Take, 
               <br />
               for instance, the tax levied now for school 
               <br />
               and road purposes. Is it not a fact that 
               <br />
               it is fairly high in the territories just now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2’</span> 
               <br />
               Would it be reduced if they had provincial 
               <br />
               organization or increased ?
