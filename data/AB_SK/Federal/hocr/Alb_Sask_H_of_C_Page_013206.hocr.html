               be one Province ; it is too large, in my opinion, to 
               <br />
               be four Provinces, and this is a matter for the 
               <br />
               future, and, therefore, a resolution of this kind, 
               <br />
               giving them the power to deal with the subject, 
               <br />
               after being commissioned by the people, will be 
               <br />
               quite safe. 
               <br />
               if there is a large German population—and I should 
               <br />
               be very glad to see it—who shall take possession of 
               <br />
               a large section of that area, why not give them the 
               <br />
               right to use the German language? They would 
               <br />
               insist upon it whenever their numbers were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffi-</span> 
               <br />
               cient. If the French Canadian settlement, which 
               <br />
               was commenced under rather unfavorable auspices 
               <br />
               at Edmonton, should increase and grow so that 
               <br />
               they would become a French Canadian Province, 
               <br />
               they would insist upon having their own language. 
               <br />
               This is a measure of peace and a measure for only 
               <br />
               a time. Under all the circumstances, the fact that 
               <br />
               they are not yet a Province, is of very little con- 
               <br />
               sequence. Whether they are called a Province or 
               <br />
               a Territory, they have rights as British subjects. 
               <br />
               Whether the people occupy a Territory or occupy 
               <br />
               a Province, if they want to use the French language, 
               <br />
               they should be allowed to use it ; and if they want 
               <br />
               to use the English langua e, they should be allowed 
               <br />
               to use it, and it should e left to themselves. If 
               <br />
               there should be anything else attached to a mea- 
               <br />
               sure of this kind when transmitted from the North- 
               <br />
               VVest, if there is anything further than a mere 
               <br />
               statement respecting the language, if any improper 
               <br />
               legislation attached to this, there is a remedy. All 
               <br />
               that this House and that this Government has to do 
               <br />
               is to check any improper legislation exceeding 
               <br />

               Mr. BLAKE. I would ask the privilege of the 
               <br />
               House for one moment with reference to the re- 
               <br />
               marks of the First Minister which were addressed 
               <br />
               to me personally before the recess. I Wish to say 
               <br />
               that I have given the consideration which was due 
               <br />
               to everything the hon. gentleman has said, and 
               <br />
               that while my own judgment remains that the 
               <br />
               proper solution of this question is embodied in the 
               <br />
               suggestion which I submitted for the consideration 
               <br />
               of the House, I believe that the best interests of 
               <br />
               Canada are to be served by, if possible, a harmo- 
               <br />
               nious settlement of the question. For my part, I 
               <br />
               should not desire to adhere to any individual 
               <br />
               opinion, or to the terms of my suggestion, if there 
               <br />
               could be devised any reasonable modiﬁcation of 
               <br />
               those terms which might meet the assent of the 
               <br />
               leading men of both‘sides and of both races Within 
               <br />
               this chamber, and I have some hope that such a 
               <br />
               result may be reached before this debate is ended. 
               <br />
               I think it my duty to have made that statement to 
               <br />
               the House, because the great disaster which has 
               <br />

               Mr. COCKBURN. I am sure that every hon. 
               <br />
               member has been delighted to hear from the lips of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vest</span> Durham (Mr. Blake), the 
               <br />
               declaration just made that he desires that the pre- 
               <br />
               sent diﬂiculty should be amicably settled, and I feel 
               <br />
               conﬁdent that in this House there is enough 
               <br />
               patriotism, enough religious and political toleration, 
               <br />
               and enough statemanship to enable us to arrive at 
               <br />
               a solution which will be acceptable to all. Indeed, 
               <br />
               Sir, it has been to me, I may say, a source of grief 
               <br />
               to witness the acrimonious spirit in which this 
               <br />
               debate has been conducted, and to see old feuds, 
               <br />
               old emnities and religious animosities excited, 
               <br />
               which I am sure every one in this House 
               <br />
               must have felt had better have lain forever 
               <br />
               dormant until they had died their natural death. 
               <br />
               At the same time I do not see why the Bill of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) 
               <br />
               should have excited so much alarm. I speak of 
               <br />
               the Bill itself, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when’</span> I look at the preamble I 
               <br />
               must confess I cannot father it. It is the preamble 
               <br />
               which in its nature may tend, and has tended, to 
               <br />
               excite the strongest animosity and the strongest 
               <br />
               distrust on the part of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.French</span> members, and 
               <br />
               many have seen in it an attem t on the part of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend to deprive them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0?</span> their political and 
               <br />
               religious liberties throughout the Dominion. I am 
               <br />
               sure, from the intercourse I have enjoyed for some 
               <br />
               years with the hon. gentleman, that such purposes 
               <br />
               are not in his heart. It may be that this preamble 
               <br />
               is a kind of indication of What was lurking in his 
               <br />
