               Right Honourable Sir John Macdonald sat 
               <br />
               where the Minister of Trade and 
               <br />
               Commerce now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”sits,</span> he brought down 
               <br />
               a Bill to amend the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-west</span> Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories Act, and I gave notice of 
               <br />
               an amendment to that Bill that would have 
               <br />
               introduced then precisely the change <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               has now happily introduced, and I congratu- 
               <br />
               late him. I may, as a little piece of history, 
               <br />
               say what occurred. The leader of the then 
               <br />
               Government (Sir John <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Macdonald)</span> resented 
               <br />
               my action, and withdrew his Bill, and 
               <br />
               brought down another Bill, with a clause 
               <br />
               in it which will be found in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> of 
               <br />
               1888. by which he introduced into our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gov.-</span> 
               <br />
               ernment what was called the Advisory 
               <br />
               Council. I would not then speak on the 
               <br />
               Bill, as there was no use trying to pass my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;</span> 
               <br />
               amendment, and my respect for my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greati</span> 
               <br />
               leader would not allow me to comment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on;</span> 
               <br />
               that clause and pour on it the ridicule <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it}</span> 
               <br />
               deserved ; but I said to a friend ofi 
               <br />
               mine, when he asked me why I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did}</span> 
               <br />
               not comment on it, “ It is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mere}</span> 
               <br />
               toy,” as it turned out to be. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">In;</span> 
               <br />
               consequence of pressure brought by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myself;</span> 
               <br />
               on the Government, we had a few <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years;</span> 
               <br />
               afterwards an amendment, which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introduced}</span> 
               <br />
               a different state of things—which introduced <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">g</span> 
               <br />
               a committee of four to aid the governor ;; 
               <br />
               but that committee of four is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">incon-§</span> 
               <br />
               venient piece of machinery, as the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gen—i</span> 
               <br />
               tleman knows, because, instead of being 
               <br />
               chosen by the Government, it was chosen 
               <br />
               by the legislative assembly. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               here (Mr. Bergeron) and, to some extent, my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the Minister of the Interior, are. 
               <br />
               under a complete mistake in supposing that 
               <br />
               there has been any agitation amongst the 
               <br />
               people of the North-west <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> responsible 
               <br />
               government. There is not. In this House, 
               <br />
               whenever I advocated it, I found the mem- 
               <br />
               bers from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Territories oppos- 
               <br />
               ing me. .If the debates of 1888 are looked 
               <br />
               at. it will be found that Mr. Macdowail, 
               <br />
               and others, got up in the House and 
               <br />
               said that the Territories did not want re- 
               <br />
               sponsible government; and in Regina, at 
               <br />
               the instance of a certain individual, a meet- 
               <br />
               ing was held at which resolutions were pass- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2</span> 
               <br />
               ed to prevent my action in this House being 
               <br />
               successful. I can say that the most 
               <br />
               thoughtful people in the Territories have al- 
               <br />
               ways held the views that I have held ; but 
               <br />
               at the same time there has been no agitation 
               <br />
               and I have battled for this thing single- 
               <br />
               handed. I believe it would have been a 
               <br />
               good thing for the Territories if we had 
               <br />
               had this legislation in 1888 : and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subsequent</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span>
