               tleman from Assim'boia has told us of the method

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,Mr.</span> LARIVIERE. In the early part of this 
               <br />
               Session, a question closely connected with the pre- 
               <br />
               sent legislation which we are now called upon to 
               <br />
               examine was raised in this House, and it was then 
               <br />
               stated although the population of the N orth-VVest 
               <br />
               Territories was largely composed of a class of 
               <br />
               people using the French language, it was astonish- 
               <br />
               ing that in the North-VVest Council, composed of 
               <br />
               22 members, not one had been returned who 
               <br />
               belonged to the French Canadian nationality. This 
               <br />
               was due to the fact that the electoral divisions 
               <br />
               were so arranged, that the French population could 
               <br />
               not muster a sufﬁcient number of electors to elect 
               <br />
               one of themselves to represent their interests in 
               <br />
               that Council. I expected that the present Bill 
               <br />
               would contain such provisions, as would alter the 
               <br />
               electoral divisions so as to give the French popula- 
               <br />
               tion of the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth-W'est</span> Territories a chance of 
               <br />
               having representatives upon the ﬂoor of their 
               <br />
               Council. The hon. member for Saskatchewan (Mr. 
               <br />
               Macdowall) made at the time a suggestion, that 
               <br />
               when amendments should be framed to the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories Act, they should contain such 
               <br />
               chan es as would help the French <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> 
               <br />
               to e properly represented ; an if my 
               <br />
               memory serves me right, the promise was 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               iven to him, that when such legislation would be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Erought</span> before this House, it would contain a. ro- 
               <br />
               vision whereby the desired change would be e ect- 
               <br />
               ed, and whereby the interests of those which are 
               <br />
               to-day unrepresented in that body, would be pro- 
               <br />
               tected. I am sorry to see, that when a suggestion 
               <br />
               was made to the Senate to that effect, it was not
