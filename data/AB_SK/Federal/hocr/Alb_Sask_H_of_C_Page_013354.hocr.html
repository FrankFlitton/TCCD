               the sudden accession of popularity which it has 
               <br />
               obtained, because in 1887, 1888 and 1889, when I 
               <br />
               brought forward the question and moved for a rep- 
               <br />
               resentative government there, I found there was 
               <br />
               very little interest taken in the subject either by 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen on the Reform side, or by hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the Ministerial side of the House. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) must 
               <br />
               remember that he should not taunt me, who have 
               <br />
               been a veteran in the service of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest,</span> 
               <br />
               because he is now animated by the warm zeal of a 
               <br />
               convert. I am glad to welcome him as a 
               <br />
               convert, but confessedly it is a recent interest on 
               <br />
               his part, confessedly it is a new love, and it has all 
               <br />
               the warmth and'perhaps some of the imprudence 
               <br />
               of a new attachment. So he must not taunt me, 
               <br />
               who have been ﬁghting the battles of this people, 
               <br />
               and have contended in this House for responsi- 
               <br />
               ble government for them. If you give them 
               <br />
               representative government now, I want to be 
               <br />
               logical, and I think that clause should be changed. 
               <br />
               I think now, when you are going to give them con- 
               <br />
               trol over the funds, you should do what the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) contends, 
               <br />
               namely, strike an average as to the population—— 
               <br />
               you can 'easily ﬁnd out what the population is, you 
               <br />
               can go far below what the actual population is, and 
               <br />
               still give us far more than we get now; you can 
               <br />
               give us an adequate income, loose our hands and 
               <br />
               set us free ; give us our majority and let us do the 
               <br />
               best we can for our country ; give us our executive, 
               <br />
               and then we can go back to this clause and change 
               <br />
               it, if necessary. But the reason why I desire not 
               <br />
               to change the clause now is that, after the census 
               <br />
               which is close at hand, is taken, you cannot deny 
               <br />
               us responsible government. My hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) says he has been in that country, and 
               <br />
               he must know that the people of the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth-W’est</span> 
               <br />
               are, in intelligence, above the population of any 
               <br />
               other part of Canada. I mean that there is a 
               <br />
               greater average intelligence amongst them than 
               <br />
               there is amongst the people in any other part of 
               <br />
               the country. In fact we have had an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immigration</span>

               we may now congratulate ourselves upon the 
               <br />
               inestimable blessings conferred upon the whole of 
               <br />
               Canada, upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest,</span> and upon ourselves, 
               <br />
               in having introduced my hon. friend to this House. 
               <br />
               He says in the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth-VVest</span> there has been an 
               <br />
               immigration d’e’lite, and we here have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elite</span> 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elite,</span> and we may judge what is 
               <br />
               left there by the sample which they send us. 
               <br />
               But the hon. gentleman is quite right. So far as 
               <br />
               the emigration from Ontario is concerned, and I 
               <br />
               presume it is the same from the other Provinces, 
               <br />
               there can be no doubt that by a process of natural 
               <br />
               selection they have got amongst the best and most 
               <br />
               energetic men that were to be found among us ; and 
               <br />
               I have no doubt whatever that that immigration, 
               <br />
               taken on the whole, is of a very superior character- 
               <br />
               just as, upon the same principles, the upper Pro, 
               <br />
               Vince was originally settled. I am old enough to re- 
               <br />
               member the character of those settlers, at least of 
               <br />
               some of them, living at an extreme old age, and I 
               <br />
               can bear testimony that a great many of the earlier 
               <br />
               settlers who came to this country at a period when 
               <br />
               it was very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> from what it is to-day, when 
               <br />
               there was no assisted emigration, no steamships, 
               <br />
               no cleared lands, when bears and Indians were 
               <br />
               supposed to be the attractions of that country, 
               <br />
               were men of the ﬁrst rank. Those circumstances 
               <br />
               indicate of themselves that the early settlers were 
               <br />
               men of superior force of character, men, I am afraid, 
               <br />
               we must confess with humility, better, upon the av- 
               <br />
               erage, than many of theirsons and grandsons are. So, 
               <br />
               in degree, though not to the same extent, is the char- 
               <br />
               acter of the immigration to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'cst</span> ; and 
               <br />
               we must not, of course, keep such people as that in 
               <br />
               leading strings ; we must deal with them as men of 
               <br />
               capacity, as men of Will, as men of resolution and 
               <br />
               ability; and we must trust them with their own 
               <br />
               fortunes, conﬁdent that if they make mistakes, as 
               <br />
               it is they who will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffer</span> the consequences, so they 
               <br />
               will be able to repair their errors. Such is the gen—

               eral principle upon which we ought to deal with

               Mr. MCCARTHY. Perhaps an apology is due 
               <br />
               by me to the hon. member for West Assiniboia 
               <br />
               (Mr. Davin) for the insinuation I ventured to make, 
               <br />
               but really, if I misunderstood him, he is himself 
               <br />
               to blame. In the observations he made on the 
               <br />
               second reading of the Bill, he rather intimated that 
               <br />
               the representatives in the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orthJVest</span> Assembly 
               <br />
               were in the habit of disposing of public moneys 
               <br />
               by lot, by some system of log-rolling, to use his 
               <br />
               own expression, dividing it amongst them and 
               <br />
               expending the money in some way, being even 
               <br />
               driven to imagine how they could expend 1t. Well, I 
               <br />
               should have not imagined that was the way in which 
               <br />
               the N orth—VVest Legislative Assembly were in the 
               <br />
               habit of discharging their duties. But if that was 
               <br />
               a true and correct statement, as no doubt it was 
               <br />
               according to the hon. gentleman’s light, he does 
               <br />
               not represent them to be a very high class of legis- 
               <br />
               lators. That is What I referred to ; therefore, I 
               <br />
               think the hon. gentleman should see that I was 
               <br />
