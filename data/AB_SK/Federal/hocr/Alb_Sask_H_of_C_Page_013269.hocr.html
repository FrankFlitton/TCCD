               what he stated our grievances were. In this 
               <br />
               speech, he quoted with approval the report of 
               <br />
               Lord Durham in reference to the French lan— 
               <br />
               guage. Now, whether this report was written 
               <br />
               by Lord Durham himself, or by Mr. Charles 
               <br />
               Buller, or by Mr. Turton, whose reputation was 
               <br />
               very unsavory in his own country, or by Mr. 
               <br />
               Gibbon Wakeﬁeld, who was also in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entow</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rage</span> of Lord Durham, and whose reputation 
               <br />
               was even more unsavory than that of Mr. Turton, 
               <br />
               it is certain that this report was never accepted by 
               <br />
               the French people as a policy which was likely to 
               <br />
               reconcile the different people of this land. How~ 
               <br />
               ever, my hon. friend thinks that he will disinter 
               <br />
               Lord Durham’s report and make it do service 
               <br />
               again in this country. Again we read in his 
               <br />
               December speech : 
               <br />

               “ Lord Durham realised that so long as the use of the

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               Then he says :

               <br />
               The hon. member goes on, and says in the next 
               <br />
               sentence :

               to what Lord Durham applied it to, the Province

               Therefore, he promises that even in this Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, in the year 1890 or 1891, an Address may be 
               <br />
               presented to the Crown in England asking the 
               <br />
               Imperial Parliament to alter the British North

               <br />
               what he thinks so terrible, the French language 
               <br />
               in Quebec, and the French language in this 
               <br />
               House, and, perhaps, the French language in 
               <br />
               Manitoba. He knows perfectly well that if he has 
               <br />
               the courage of his convictions he can put a notice 
               <br />
               on the paper to-day for an address from this House 
               <br />
               to the Queen, asking her to introduce legislation 
               <br />
               to amend the Imperial Act in this particular. Sir, 
               <br />
               when this solemn threat was read, no wonder the

               members of Parliament felt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alarmed.</span> Why this

               my hand, was sent to me, unless as a member 
               <br />
               of Parliament, I cannot say. I do not know 
               <br />
               whether the hon. gentleman sent copies to all his 
               <br />
               fellow members, in order to give them full notice 
               <br />
               of what he was doing; but if he did not, some 
               <br />
               of his friends did, who were anxious that the whole 
               <br />
               Parliament and country should know What the
