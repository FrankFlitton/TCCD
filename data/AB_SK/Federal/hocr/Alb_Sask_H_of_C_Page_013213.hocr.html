               ties exempliﬁed in this House, would we do so? 
               <br />
               Would we strike out such an element as this from 
               <br />
               our population? I do not believe that there is a 
               <br />
               man throughout the Dominion who would say so. 
               <br />
               Sir, there can be no doubt that the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Simcoe has, with strange power, aroused a 
               <br />
               singular fanaticism in this land. Last summer I 
               <br />
               visited one of the greatest counties in the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario, one of the greatest in the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion, a county of which any Province might well 
               <br />
               be proud. Sir, it was a land of which it might al- 
               <br />
               most be said that it was literally ﬂowing with milk 
               <br />
               and honey, with creameries and with cheese fac- 
               <br />
               tories. It was a land of extraordinary fertility, a 
               <br />
               land of which any man might well boast. The 
               <br />
               pastures were covered with herds of the choicest 
               <br />
               cattle; forests alternated with cultivated ﬁelds; the 
               <br />
               sluggish rivers ﬂowed with smooth serenity through 
               <br />
               rich meadows and ﬁelds of waving corn. Its people 
               <br />
               were bold and brave and manly, whose ancestors 
               <br />
               had held their country against the invaders ; and 
               <br />
               the sons looked as though they would hold that 
               <br />
               land as bravely as their fathers had won it. A 
               <br />
               little graveyard was pointed out to me where the 
               <br />
               victors and vanquished slept quietly together await- 
               <br />
               ing the judgment day : 
               <br />
               “ These in the robings of glory; 
               <br />
               Those in the gloom of defeat, 
               <br />
               Both with the battle blood gory, 
               <br />
               In the dusk of eternity meet ; 
               <br />
               Under the sod and the dew, 
               <br />
               Waiting the judgment day, 
               <br />
               Under the laurel—the blue, 
               <br />
               Under the willow—the grey.” 
               <br />
               It was literally an agricultural paradise, but 
               <br />
               the trail of the hon. member for Simcoe was over 
               <br />
               it all. A great anti-Jesuit meeting had been held. 
               <br />
               There the 188 were denounced in the ﬁercest 
               <br />
               terms. I remember reading in the local news- 
               <br />
               papers that one reverend gentleman had called us, 
               <br />
               I think, a “ complicated comminuted community 
               <br />
               of cowardly cannibals.” That was the term applied 
               <br />
               to the 188. On the other hand, the noble l3, gen— 
               <br />
               tlemen of whom we have always been very proud, 
               <br />
               were held up in the highest honor and esteem. 
               <br />
               When I went there the storm had passed over, 
               <br />
               and I only remained to receive its ground swell. 
               <br />
               As I have said, the county was a most magniﬁ- 
               <br />
               cent one, and the people were a generous and 
               <br />
               brave people. But there was a gloom upon their 
               <br />
               countenances which struck me with surprise, con- 
               <br />
               sidering that they had such a. beautiful country, 
               <br />
               that their crops were splendid, that they had every 
               <br />
               element of material prosperity. They said to me : 
               <br />
               “ What do you think of these Jesuits who have 
               <br />
               taken possession of the land ? You come from the 
               <br />
               land of Loyola, you come from the land of these 
               <br />
               Jesuits, you come from this priest-ridden Province 
               <br />
               of Quebec.” I said: “ Yes ; but it does appear to 
               <br />
               me that there are other Provinces which are 
               <br />
               priest-ridden as well as Quebec.” “ Well,” they 
               <br />
               said, “ what is going to become of those 
               <br />
               oor, miserable, oppressed Protestants of that 
               <br />
               rovince ‘2” I said: “ Yes ; we may be op- 
               <br />
               pressed, but as you can see, they do not 
               <br />
               starve me, at any rate.” “ With regard to the 
               <br />
               English inhabitants of that Province, those poor 
               <br />
               slaves who are hunted by Mercier and his congeners, 
               <br />
               what about them ‘2” I said : “ I think they bear 
               <br />
               their punishment very patiently, at any rate they

               said : Father Brown of Chelsea told me the men

               who ﬁrst came to assist him when his church was 
               <br />
               burning were the Orangemen of the district. I 
               <br />
               saw myself at the funeral of an excellent lady, the 
               <br />
               wife of the Presbyterian clergyman, the Catholic 
               <br />
               priest among the friends in the sad procession. 
               <br />
               Everywhere the same kindly feeling prevailed, and 
               <br />
               I said that among the priests of my district, some 
               <br />
               six or seven, there are not ﬁner gentlemen, not 
               <br />

               <br />
               Catholic priests of whom I have spoken. I said 
               <br />
               that if some of these men were animated by the 
               <br />
               feelings which appeared to animate a few of the 
               <br />
               clergymen of Ontario, we would have had a very 
               <br />
               sad time indeed ; but they preached the gospel of 
               <br />
               peace, love, law and order. Under these circum— 
               <br />
               stances, I said, we got on exceedingly well. But, 
               <br />
               they said : You have a lot of nuns.. Yes, I said, we 
               <br />
               have, and most excellent and worthy ladies they are, 
               <br />
               ladies who by their truly Christian charity are cal- 
               <br />
               culatedto convince one of the reality of the Christian 
               <br />
               religion. The Rev. Mr. Carson said that when some 
               <br />
               of his family were dying from diphtheria, that those 
               <br />
               who ﬁrst came to his assistance were Catholic 
               <br />
               nuns, and I said in my own region they attend 
               <br />
               Protestant and Catholic alike. I said I felt it to be 
               <br />
               my duty to state this to you, because great misap- 
               <br />
               prehension has arisen with respect to the feelings 
               <br />
               which prevail among those who reside in the 
               <br />
               Province of Quebec. When I was seated by the 
               <br />
               bedside of the dying Father Delliages, he said to 
               <br />
               me : Every night my dreams carry me back to 
               <br />
               dear old France, but my heart is with the people 
               <br />
               of the Gatineau region. So it is with most of the 
               <br />
               clergy in our midst. They get on admirably with 
               <br />
               the Protestant clergy there. The Methodist goes 
               <br />
               about most energetically to promote the interests 
               <br />
               of the Master ; so does the Presbyterian clergyman; 
               <br />
               and so does the English clergyman, unless, unhap- 
               <br />
               pily, he is too poor to have a horse, and he then walks 
               <br />
               as did the Apostles of old. Then they proceeded 
               <br />
               to put me through a course of cross-questioning. 
               <br />
               They said : Tell us of the night ; tell us of the future : 
               <br />
               what party will it be which will sweep away those 
               <br />
               rotten old parties, as the leaves are sweept away by 
               <br />
               the autumn blast? I ventured to say a word on 
               <br />
               behalf of my friend of the Left Centre. I said : 
               <br />
               Here was an opportunity for the Left Centre, who 
               <br />
               is a chief of singular energy and intelligence, but 
               <br />
               without a party ; and here is a splendid party, but 
               <br />
               without a head : still should the two join together, 
               <br />
               great results may be anticipated. I told them of 
               <br />
               his heroic struggles in favor of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vidow</span> Murphy 
               <br />
               and her cow. I told them that in Sir Peter they 
               <br />
               had one who was always foremost in works of good- 
               <br />
               will; I told them of his marvellous energy, ability 
               <br />
               and perseverance ; Itold them of his heroic struggles 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fervor</span> of the helpless and the poor ; I told them 
               <br />
               that when the widow’s wail and the cry of orphan 
               <br />
               children came from the woods of New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               that he performed one of the most generous and 
               <br />
               gallant acts on record; I told them that he was
