               to the question of language, it touched creed as well;

               <br />
               called those obnoxious clauses. I, therefore, ex- 
               <br />
               pected that the hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) would not adopt the line which the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) 
               <br />
               has adopted. I expected that, while he would 
               <br />
               perhaps leave rather in the background those 
               <br />
               other questions, he would say nothing which was 
               <br />
               inconsistent with his preceding utterances, nothing 
               <br />
               which would be likely to limit the effect of the 
               <br />
               preamble to which he asked the assent of the House ; 
               <br />
               nothing which would interfere with or check the 
               <br />
               triumphant march of his friends in ursuit of the 
               <br />
               great purpose which had been before eveloped, and 
               <br />
               which was further and fully developed in advance 
               <br />
               of the meeting of Parliament by the speech to 
               <br />
               which I have referred. This Bill, then, is only 
               <br />
               the opening of the campaign ; and it lays down in 
               <br />
               itself, so far as the question of language is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, which is all it deals with, lines quite broad 
               <br />
               enough for the contemplated movement ; and, I 
               <br />
               repeat, that its past and its present and its surroun- 
               <br />
               dings are all important elements; they indicate its 
               <br />
               future ; and they entirely overshadow the little 
               <br />
               enacting clause. For those who, like the hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               men, have spoken in that sense in this House, who 
               <br />
               believe that these things are essentially in the in-

               is for them but one course to pursue, the course of 
               <br />
               agitation. It is their right, nay more, it is their

               bounden duty, if their conscientious convictions

               thecondition of things in this whole Dominion, 
               <br />

               will be served and advanced by such an agitation 
               <br />

               <br />
               by the means proposed, absolutely impossible

               <br />
               not present any element whatever of success, but 
               <br />
               destroys the least prospect of reform from that

               hon. gentlemen desire can be looked for, namely, 
               <br />
               from within, from the spontaneous action of the

               people themselves ? for those who believe that 
               <br />
               it not merely does not improve, but that it

               tends to imperil the conditions of certain minori-

               different parts of the Dominion ; that it excuses, if 
               <br />
               it does not absolutely justify, the combinations of

               be, and I hope I am a Reformer. I have never 
               <br />
               concealed my opinion ; I have always at those 
               <br />
               times and places, and under those circumstances 
               <br />
               in which I thought I might do good by it, an- 
               <br />
               nounced the opinion that there are many things to 
               <br />
               be reformed in the different Provinces of this 
               <br />
               Dominion, and many things to be reformed in 
               <br />
               the Dominion as a whole. There are many things 
               <br />
               I should desire to see reformed in the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec as well as in other Provinces. But I know

               full well,—-such little knowledge of history as I

               ﬁfty-six years have given me, have taught me that 
               <br />
               impertinent interference; still more that threats 
               <br />
               of coercive interference, and agitations to withdraw 
               <br />
               acquired and provincial rights are the very surest 
               <br />
               means to destroy the slightest vestige of hope of 
               <br />
               reform. They give to the resisting party incal- 
               <br />
               culable advantages. They enlist the sentiment of 
               <br />
               nationality, the sentiment of provincial autonomy, 
               <br />
               the feeling of outraged dignity and of insulted 
               <br />
               authority in opposition to the intruders. And 
               <br />
               under cover of these defences, resistance is easy and 
               <br />
