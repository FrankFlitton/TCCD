               the proﬁts, he would have to abide by the 
               <br />
               terms on which he came in. If the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice will look at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms</span> on which 
               <br />
               these provinces came into the union he will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that there was a provision that they 
               <br />
               should have the beneﬁt of certain terms from 
               <br />
               the old provinces, they were given a beneﬁt 
               <br />
               here and there, but there is not a single word 
               <br />
               to show that the old provinces lost the 
               <br />
               rights they had already acquired by imperial 
               <br />
               legislation. It would be easy for any one 
               <br />
               to infer that the provinces should have equal 
               <br />
               rights, but they did not get equal rights, 
               <br />
               as is shown by the exceptional representa- 
               <br />
               tion given to British Columbia. There- 
               <br />
               fore we ﬁnd that the provinces have come in 
               <br />
               with different rights between themselves. 
               <br />
               Now, it they have come in with different 
               <br />
               rl-ghts between themselves, why should it 
               <br />
               be argued that they would necessarily come 
               <br />
               in with equal rights as against the old part— 
               <br />
               ners ? I venture to submit that the true 
               <br />
               view of the British North America Act is 
               <br />
               that laid down by Sir John A. Macdonald 
               <br />
               in his state paper of 1870, when he said that 
               <br />
               the purview of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act was evidently conﬁned to the original 
               <br />
               four provinces. That Act was framed by 
               <br />
               the ablest statesmen of Canada. They were 
               <br />
               building wisely and well, and they knew the 
               <br />
               country was liable to have an unlimited ex- 
               <br />
               pansion; they knew it was impossible to 
               <br />
               foresee the possibilities of this country, and 
               <br />
               therefore, in providing for the present, as 
               <br />
               far as possible they provided for the future 
               <br />
               in general but not in details. They pro- 
               <br />
               vided that other provinces might come in, 
               <br />
               but the details they left to be arranged 
               <br />
               while the original partners of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act secured imperial legis- 
               <br />
               lation, a charter which they hold to-day. 
               <br />
               I will not say anything further on this 
               <br />
               point than to claim that in view of the 
               <br />
               circumstances under which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> clause was 
               <br />
               inserted in the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               in view of the guarantee of the charter that 
               <br />
               the provinces have under the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> view of the fact that not 
               <br />
               one word is to be found in any Order of 
               <br />
               Council or in any address on which an Order 
               <br />
               in Council is issued, leading to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that the original provinces were 
               <br />
               divested of any powers they had, whereas 
               <br />
               on the contrary they have been given new 
               <br />
               powers, certain speciﬁed powers, it seems 
               <br />
               to me that the case is not free from doubt, 
               <br />
               and this is as far as it is necessary to go 
               <br />
               for the purposes of my argument. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">7.</span> But if

               to do what is fair, is it the part of a practi- 
               <br />
               cal man of business to obtain an opinion 
               <br />
               from an inferior court when he could obtain 
               <br />
               one from a superior court? Is it wise to 
               <br />
               obtain an opinion that has no intrinsic value 
               <br />
               beyond the value that may be given to it

               <br />
               what they say. As I understand it, the

               obligation is imposed upon the government 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the different provinces of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               That is an obligation which is imposed on 
               <br />
               parliament. There is no discretion that can 
               <br />
               be exercised by the government in respect 
               <br />
               to that redistribution. The charter under 
               <br />
               which we live, under which we are gov-

               tribution is to be made, and section 51 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act operates an-

               respect to the apportionment of represen-
