               quaintance with many of them from 
               <br />
               having made a tour through that country 
               <br />
               during the past year ; and I am prepared to 
               <br />
               say that if there is any body of people in 
               <br />
               Canada who would wisely administer a 
               <br />
               public domain entrusted to them, it is the 
               <br />
               people of the North-west Territories; be- 
               <br />
               cause I found in every meeting which I ad- 
               <br />
               dressed in that country that the people were 
               <br />
               strongly imbued <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘with</span> the idea that the pub- 
               <br />
               lic domain should be conserved for public 
               <br />
               purposes, and not handed over to corpora- 
               <br />
               tions and promoters. I believe that feeling 
               <br />
               is very deep and very widespread in the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories; and a feeling of 
               <br />
               that kind is absolutely inconsistent with the 
               <br />
               possibility that if the public domain were 
               <br />
               entrusted to them, and they were granted 
               <br />
               the power to incur debt, they would be like- 
               <br />
               ly to use either the one power or the other 
               <br />
               in such a way as would not inure to the 
               <br />
               public interest of that country or of Canada 
               <br />
               as a whole. Who are those people who in- 
               <br />
               habit the North-west ? Why, up to the 
               <br />
               present year, they have been largely the 
               <br />
               same people who have been sending repre-

               this country as any citizen of Canada in 
               <br />
               the east or the west. I was particularly 
               <br />
               struck with the interest which some of these 
               <br />
               people took in the country. I was struck 
               <br />
               with the fact that before they emigrated to 
               <br />
               this country they ltook the pains, some of 
               <br />
               them at least, to ascertain what were the 
               <br />
               laws with regard to the schools. They 
               <br />
               wished to know whether their children 
               <br />
               would have the advantage of public schools 
               <br />
               or not; and they evinced an interest in 
               <br />
               the administration of the public affairs of 
               <br />
               the country which, I think, indicates that 
               <br />
               we might safely entrust to them, as well as 
               <br />
               to our own people from the east, who, with 
               <br />
               their descendants, are in that country, the 
               <br />
               management of their own .local affairs. Un- 
               <br />
               der these circumstances, it does not seem 
               <br />
               to me that the reason that has been suggest- 
               <br />
               ed is a good reason. And where are we to 
               <br />
               draw the limit? If 350,000 people in the 
               <br />
               North—west Territories cannot .be entrusted 
               <br />
               to borrow money, are you to entrust that 
               <br />
               power to half a million or to a million ? 
               <br />
               What number will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁord</span> any reasonable

               <br />
               holding that power from 350,000 people and

               It is within the bounds of extreme prob-
