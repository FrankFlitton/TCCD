               Mr. OLIVER. I am very glad my hon. 
               <br />
               friend interrupted me on this point, because 
               <br />
               I had nearly missed it. As I said before, 
               <br />
               the power which goes with provincial or- 
               <br />
               ganization is the power of borrowing money. 
               <br />
               This .is the pow-er which the hon. leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition is most anxious to give to the 
               <br />
               people of the North-west Territories. It 
               <br />
               and the power to sell the lands are appar- 
               <br />
               ently the only powers he is willing to give 
               <br />
               the territories. In the memorandum which 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain submitted to the government 
               <br />
               it will be found that one of the grounds of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">complaint</span> is that we are not permitted to 
               <br />
               draw on the future. He points out that ex— 
               <br />
               tensive works are needed, and he com- 
               <br />
               plains t1hat under their present status they 
               <br />
               are not permitted to draw on the future-— 
               <br />
               to borrow money. That is his strong ground 
               <br />
               in demanding provincial organization, and 
               <br />
               now, when the government offers to advance 
               <br />
               and does advance, a matter of $250,000, the 
               <br />
               opposition want to know why it is done, and 
               <br />
               say that nobody asked for it and that it 
               <br />
               will not be 1sp-.ent Surely, this money is 
               <br />
               just as useful to the people of the terri— 
               <br />
               tories when advanced from the Dominion 
               <br />
               treasury as it would be if borrowed in the 
               <br />
               outside mark-.et Surely, it is as much use to 
               <br />
               them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> will build as many public works. 
               <br />
               Besides that, if they had borrowed it in the 
               <br />
               ordinary market, they would have had to 
               <br />
               pay interest, but by the present arrange- 
               <br />
               ment they are not required to pay interest, 
               <br />
               and indeed it is not at all certain, as the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance pointed out, that they 
               <br />
               will ever have to account for the principal; 
               <br />
               that is a matter which will be settled when 
               <br />
               a final provincial organization is arrived at.

               the government have done. The terms of
