               Mr. MULOCK. Suppose a railway was incorporated to 
               <br />
               build to or near a certain town which may be near a cer- 
               <br />
               tain other town. It might be within ﬁve or ten miles of

               the other town, and the engineering diﬁiculties might be 
               <br />
               precisely the same in both cases. There might be no such 
               <br />
               circumstances as the hon. gentleman suggests to enable the

               company, giving it the utmost freedom in the chorce of a 
               <br />
               particular route, thus causing one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">municipality</span> to compete 
               <br />
               with another, and perhaps obliging it, by force of 
               <br />
               circumstances, to give a large bonus to bring the 
               <br />
               line within its neighborhood. If the route is not deﬁned 
               <br />
               by the Act of incorporation, you give the company 
               <br />
               practically a roving commission, enabling it not only to 
               <br />

               Mr. EDGAR. I think it is just as easy for a court to deter—

               <br />

               <br />
               latter as in the former. Not a Session passes in which a 
               <br />
               number of Bills are not put through the Railway Committee 
               <br />

               <br />
               imity must bepretty close, but when we come to deal 
               <br />
               with the word “ near ” in relation to the termini of a rail- 
               <br />
               way, as the hon. member tor York mentioned, a very much 
               <br />
               larger limit must be given. Then, take a charter in 
               <br />
               whichitis provided thatarailway shall be built from a 
               <br />
               point beginning at or near a certain town. There would 
               <br />
               also be a good deal of practical difﬁculty in deﬁning that 
               <br />
               word, because we would be giving a material limitation to 
               <br />
               a large number of charters which Parliament has already 
               <br />

               Mr. THOMPSON. In relation to those railways which 
               <br />
               have not been commenced, it probably would. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">limit</span> 
               <br />
               ation of six miles in some cases would hardly do. Some of 
               <br />
               the statutes, for instance, are for lines not six miles in 
               <br />
               length, and it would defeat the limitation in the charter 
               <br />
               altogether if we were to apply so lax a limit to such lines. 
               <br />
               The whole thing depends on the kind of country through 
               <br />
               which a line passes and the kind of termini it has. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s suggestion, however, deals with a separate 
               <br />
