               <br />
               intimation given by the hon. leader of the House 
               <br />
               that the remnant of this day which is left to us is 
               <br />
               to be taken from us. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“’ell,</span> Sir. I agree most 
               <br />
               heartily with the sentiment that has fallen from 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman who has just resumed his seat, 
               <br />
               a sentiment which found utterance in the beginning 
               <br />
               of this debate, in the speech of the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               who moved the resolution—that this matter must 
               <br />
               be faced, that it will not down; and it is in the 
               <br />
               interest of all of us, seeing how unfortunately the 
               <br />
               question excites both racial and religious feelings 
               <br />
               and rejudices, that at the earliest possible moment 
               <br />
               we 3 iould face it, deal with it, and determine it. 
               <br />
               Now, we have given to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vestj‘Assembly</span> 
               <br />
               already very large powers. With the exception, 
               <br />
               perhaps, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the control of money, which I hope at 
               <br />
               an early day will also be granted to them, they 
               <br />
               have almost all the powers of a provincial assembly. 
               <br />
               That being so, those who in this House have 
               <br />
               declared that they are not to have the full <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> power 
               <br />
               and control in the matter of education, have at least 
               <br />
               the respbnsibility resting upon them of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> showing 
               <br />
               why the authority of the North-West Assembly 
               <br />
               should be limited in that regard. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’We</span> know per- 
               <br />
               fectly well that it is in accordance with the spirit 
               <br />
               of the federal system under which this Dominion is 
               <br />
               governed, that the subject of education is one of 
               <br />
               local concern ; and while I do not go the length, and 
               <br />
               have never gone the length of saying that in no case, 
               <br />
               in the general interest of the Dominion, should this 
               <br />
               Parliament or this Government interfere in matters 
               <br />
               which in a narrow sense are of localconcern, I holdas 
               <br />
               strongly as any hon. member on the ﬂoor of this 
               <br />
               Parliament that in ordinary cases, within the scope 
               <br />
               of our legislation, local matters should be dealt 
               <br />
               a with by the local bodies and the local assemblies. 
               <br />
               Now, Sir, if that be accepted as a preliminary doc- 
               <br />
               trine, I want to know why it is that in the matter 
               <br />
               of education this Parliament undertakes to say 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Assembly shall not have the 
               <br />
               full control? I want to know why it was that 
               <br />
               ‘ years and years <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ago,,long</span> before the North-West 
               <br />
               was settled, this House enacted as one of the organic 
               <br />
               laws regulatin to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vNorth-West</span> Territories 
               <br />
               that they shou d not have full, absolute and un- 
               <br />
               limited power‘in the matter of education ‘3 I have 
               <br />
               never heard an y answer gi ven to that question. I have 
               <br />
               never heard any suggestion offered why it was that 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Fest</span> should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,nothave</span> the same liberty 
               <br />
               that the other provinces have, all except the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario and Province of Quebec; and we 
               <br />
               know the special reason which existed in the case 
               <br />
               of those provinces. I have heard it said, forsooth : 
               <br />
               \Vait till We grant them full autonomy 3 wait till 
               <br />
               we create different provinces in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">borthow</span> est ; 
               <br />
               and when we create different rovinces there, and 
               <br />
               endow them with full provincia powers, then it will 
               <br />
               be time enough to gi ve themfull authority to deal with 
               <br />
               education; Why should you deny them the right to 
               <br />
               consider and to deal with the question of education? 
               <br />
               I can perfectly well understand the feelin which 
               <br />
               actuate my Roman Catholicfellow-citizens. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Isms</span> ect

               this country to give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁ'ect</span> to their views, I should not 
               <br />
               be heard saying anything against them. But I am 
               <br />
               unable to see the fair-play on the part of Roman 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               free altogether from religious teaching, I should 
               <br />
               desire their view should prevail. I respect the

               views put forward by the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               \Vellington (Mr. McMallen), and realize that there 
               <br />
               is a great deal in what he has said with regard 
               <br />
               to secular education, but I hold that the m'ovinces 
               <br />
               should be allowed to work out this matter for 
               <br />
               themselves. They are the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">antics</span> most competent 
               <br />
               to deal with it ; and I won d like to know why it 
               <br />
               is this Parliament undertakes to say to the people 
               <br />
               of the North-West that in any ordinance they may 
               <br />
               make regarding education, they must always enact 
               <br />
               there may be a separate school in every locality in 
               <br />
               I think the burden of proof is upon

               <br />
               without the consent of the parties composing it. It 
               <br />
               is an insult to the North-\Vest to say to them: 
               <br />
               You must keep perpetually these schools, scattered 
               <br />
               here and there, as separate schools unless the par-

               ticular locality consents to the legislative body 
               <br />

               views of provincial rights, he will not have any

               reason for regrettin the trust he will repose in

               <br />
               I brought forward the question of dual language 
               <br />
               two years ago, and the reason I did not was 
               <br />
               this: I have not altered my Opinions in the slightest 
               <br />
               respecting it, but I felt we on ht to have an appeal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»</span>

               from the people of the North- Vest, I felt thatwe

               <br />
               be so absolutely of local concern. If they were 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with the law as it exists, it would be un-
