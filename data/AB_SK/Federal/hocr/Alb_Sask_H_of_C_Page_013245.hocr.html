               <br />
               Was temperate, and I will refer to it to support 
               <br />
               these views. My language was temperate wher- 
               <br />
               ever I s oke, and it was more especially temperate 
               <br />
               on the cor of Parliament, as an hon. gentleman’s 
               <br />
               language ought to be temperate here. No such 
               <br />
               words escaped my lips as those which the Secre- 
               <br />
               tary of State used towards me here to-day; no 
               <br />
               language of that kind has ever escaped my lips in

               this debate, and I trust, notwithstanding the pro- 
               <br />
               vocation of the Minister of Public W'orks, notwith- 
               <br />
               standing the provocation I received from the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State, who denounced me in language 
               <br />
               not ﬁt for this Assembly, I trust no word will 
               <br />
               escape my lips which will resemble those used in 
               <br />
               the course they have pursued towards me. My 
               <br />
               arguments may tend to a certain conclusion, but 
               <br />
               my tone was temperate, and I venture to say that 
               <br />
               my argument was fairly drawn. Now, what was it? 
               <br />
               I ventured, in the ﬁrst place, to give a short ac- 
               <br />
               count of the history of this legislation. I ventured, 
               <br />
               in the second place, to demonstrate, what I am 
               <br />
               glad to know I did succeed in demonstrating <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               yond the region of contradiction, that the French 
               <br />
               language was not, according to any treaty rights, to 
               <br />
               be given, if you choose to call it so, to be made a part 
               <br />
               of the system in the North-VVest Territory. For 
               <br />
               that purpose it was necessary that I should trace 
               <br />
               the history of the cession. I was sorry I intro- 
               <br />
               duced even the word conquest, if it was offensive 
               <br />
               to any hon. gentleman, and I am quite willing 
               <br />
               to put the fact in any words, although most men 
               <br />
               will admit that the words make very little diffe- 
               <br />
               rence when the history is known to us all. I said, 
               <br />
               tracing that history step by step from the cession 
               <br />
               of 1763 to the passage of the British North Ame- 
               <br />
               rica Act in 1867, that no word was to be found in 
               <br />
               all that history to show why that Act was passed, 
               <br />
               for which the hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. 
               <br />
               Mills) is responsible, which was represented in 
               <br />
               that day to the House, but which I am sorry to 
               <br />
               say was not fairly or correctly represented to the 
               <br />
               House at that time, by the hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               as a piece of legislation warranted upon a ground 
               <br />
               of that kind. My next argument, and I think it 
               <br />
               was a not unreasonable one, was this.

               which was not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">correct.</span> 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. MCCARTHY. Whether correct or not, the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman knows the rules of debate. Sir, I 
               <br />
               am speaking by the book of what I know from infor— 
               <br />
               mation on the very highest authority. The leader of 
               <br />
               the Senate then stated that during the recess he would 
               <br />
               consult his colleagues, and after recess he came down 
               <br />
               and put the clause, which is now clause 110, into the 
               <br />
               hands of Mr. Girard, who moved it, and it was 
               <br />
               carried in the Senate. If that be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so——and</span> we had no 
               <br />
               clear explanation about it, although I threw out the 
               <br />
               challenge in my opening remarks—then the respon- 
               <br />
               sibility for this trouble rests not upon my shoul~ 
               <br />
               ders but upon the shOulders of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Both well and his friends in the Government at 
               <br />
               that time. Those are the men who are responsible 
               <br />
               for the trouble, and it became my duty to bring it 
               <br />
               forward. I do not say I have not failed in my duty 
               <br />
               heretofore ; I failed in my duty probably in not being 
               <br />
               present when that was done, but I do not suppose 
               <br />
               that a young member, for I was then only in my 
               <br />
               second year of my parliamentary life, would have 
               <br />
               ventured to interpose at that stage of the Session. 
               <br />
               That I have failed in my duty since I do not 
               <br />
               pretend to deny, but when I did ascertain the facts 
               <br />
               I would have been wanting in my duty, feeling and 
               <br />
               believing as I do feel and believe with respect to 
               <br />
               this matter, if I had not brought it to the attention 
               <br />
               of the country in the ﬁrst place, and, in the second 
               <br />
               place, to the attention of this House. With respect 
               <br />
               to other matters on which I desire to speak before 
               <br />
               I deal with the question itself : It is true I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad</span> 
               <br />
               dressed a meeting in Montreal ; it is true I addressed 
               <br />
               a meeting in this city of Ottawa, but those who 
               <br />
               know the facts must know that those meetings 
               <br />
               which I have had the honor to address were not of 
               <br />
               my seeking. I have a list of places and a bundle of 
               <br />
               papers which would satisfy hon. gentlemen that
