               Sir, the hon. gentleman might look to the 
               <br />
               experience of our neighbours. Take the 
               <br />
               case of the territories of the United States 
               <br />
               that have not sufﬁcient population to entitle 
               <br />
               them to become states of the union, you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that what they possess is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deter-</span> 
               <br />
               mined by Congress and Congress is author- 
               <br />
               ized to make all needful rules for the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the territories. And the as- 
               <br />
               sumption throughout the territories and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">else-</span> 
               <br />
               where ever since the Union has been that 
               <br />
               Congress could be more safely entrusted with 
               <br />
               the superintending control of that govern- 
               <br />
               ment than could the ﬁrst settlers in the 
               <br />
               territory. Then, Sir, you have the fact that 
               <br />
               the Territories are the common property of 
               <br />
               the Dominion. They are held in trust, if 
               <br />
               I may use the expression, on behalf of 
               <br />
               all the provinces; and, that being so, this 
               <br />
               House has undertaken, in so far as it pos- 
               <br />
               sesses control, to use that control with a 
               <br />
               view to producing as little friction as pos- 
               <br />
               sible either with the interests or with the 
               <br />
               prejudices of the people. no matter what 
               <br />
               those interests or prejudices may be. New, 
               <br />
               Sir, when you look at the subject of educa- 
               <br />
               tion prior to the union, you will ﬁnd not 
               <br />
               that any system was expressly imposed upon 
               <br />
               the province, not that the principle of 
               <br />
               separate schools was virtually established. 
               <br />

               things in the Maritime Provinces and the 
               <br />
               provinces of Ontario and Quebec. So ‘ far 
               <br />
               as the Territories were concerned—I do not 
               <br />
               at all admit that the introduction of separ- 
               <br />

               <br />

               west Territories, as the hon. Minister has 
               <br />
               said,-it has been a matter not of right, not 
               <br />
               of guarantee to any particular class of 
               <br />
               the population, but a matter of policy. They 
               <br />
               were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introduced</span> with a view of preventing 
               <br />
               conﬂict in this House upon the subject of

               separate schools and for the reason that 
               <br />
               they were introduced there they should be

               <br />
               The hon. member for North Simcoe has re— 
               <br />
               ferred to the fact that these separate 
               <br />
               schools in the North-west Territories are ex- 
               <br />
               pensive, that it costs a very considerable 
               <br />
               sum to educate children in these schools. 
               <br />
               It the hon. member had looked at the re- 
               <br />
               turns of the schools of the whole North-west 
               <br />
               Territories, he would have found that there 
               <br />
               was very little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂerence</span> in that respect 
               <br />
               between one class of schools and the other. 
               <br />
               I took the trouble of going into the accounts 
               <br />
               of the North-west Territories. I was anx- 
               <br />
               ious to get some information before the 
               <br />

               <br />
               but have been unable to do so. Any one 
               <br />
               can see that the expenses have been very 
               <br />
               large. and I do not think it is because <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separ‘</span>

               ate schools and public schools exist there, 
               <br />

               the hon. member has said, and others 
               <br />
               hold that view, that it would be well if 
               <br />
               we could educate all our population in the 
               <br />
               same public schools. I at once accept 
               <br />
               that proposition, I say that, too, and I would 
               <br />
               be rejoiced if all our people could see alike 
               <br />
               and all accept the public schools as the 
               <br />
               only schools for the elementary education 
               <br />
               of our people. But, Sir, that is not the 
               <br />
               view taken by all the population. A very 
               <br />
               considerable number of our people wish to 
               <br />
               accompany secular with religious instruc- 
               <br />
               tion. They believe that it is a matter of 
               <br />
               immense consequence, they hold strongly 
               <br />
               to that view, and they hold to that view so 
               <br />
               strongly that wherever they are able, they 
               <br />
               will establish parish schools instead of

               separate schools. if these are denied them ;

               schools and pay for their maintenance, be-

               subject satisﬁes me, as I think it will 
               <br />
               satisfy any one who makes it, that if you
