               <br />

               <br />
               so clearly and distinctly. The hon. gentle-

               gives forever to the provinces, which will 
               <br />
               enter into the Dominion, the right to separate 
               <br />
               schools. But he says that since we have

               given to the North-west Territories nearly 
               <br />
