               amalgamation, but their perpetuation as two dis-

               Mr. MCCARTHY. My hon. friend has me at a

               they thong it this matter out for themselves, if they

               did not allow themslves to be swayed by their pas- 
               <br />
               sions, would think as‘I do. The proposition which 
               <br />
               I intend to submit to the House as an amendment 
               <br />
               to the resolution is in accordance with the view 
               <br />
               that we here should deal with this question of lan- ‘ 
               <br />
               guage. It is not a matter of local concern that 
               <br />
               Germans, for instance, should go into our provinces 
               <br />
               and decide that the German tongue should hold 
               <br />
               sway. Surely no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘one</span> will say that a matter of that 
               <br />
               kind partakes of local concern. I repeat what I 
               <br />
               have said on other occasions that, if there is any- 
               <br />
               thing more important than another in the formation 
               <br />
               of national character, it is the question of language, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               and that is a question for this Parliament, having 
               <br />
               assumed the position of the mother of several 
               <br />
               states. We are establishing states in‘ the North- 
               <br />
               West, and in that sense we are an imperial. 
               <br />
               power. and it is for us to say, and we have in fact 
               <br />
               said, that, with the exception of the Prevince <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of?</span>
