               tors of the soil. The Province of Ontario is being 
               <br />
               bled to-day partly to meet that demand. Her farms 
               <br />
               have fallen in price ; and that fall, very notably in 
               <br />
               the eastern section of the Province, is partly due to 
               <br />
               the altered conditions of supply and demand, partly 
               <br />
               also due, no doubt, to unfavorable seasons, partly 
               <br />
               due to low prices, due to a combination of circums- 
               <br />
               tances, in which however, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-VVest</span> is a large 
               <br />
               factor. I say that fall would have been very much 
               <br />
               more marked than it is to-day, if it had not been for 
               <br />
               that inﬂux of French Canadian settlers into the east, 
               <br />
               which this agitation seems almost designed to pre- 
               <br />
               vent, which certainly is regarded as no unmixed 
               <br />
               blessing by those who are engaged in the agitation, 
               <br />
               so far as the Province of Ontario is concerned. For 
               <br />
               my own part, I take ground altogether different 
               <br />
               from those gentlemen on that subject ; I heartily 
               <br />
               welcome our French fellow-countrymen who prefer 
               <br />
               Ontario to the States. I hope they will continue 
               <br />
               to prefer it ; I hope that they will come in, just as 
               <br />
               many of them as have come in, and buy our farms 
               <br />
               from those who want to sell them, and who will 
               <br />
               not complain, however much other people may 
               <br />
               create grievances in another Province, if they get a 
               <br />
               better price than they otherwise might by reason 
               <br />
               of altered conditions in the law of supply and 
               <br />
               demand. I say that While Ontario is being bled at 
               <br />
               this moment and in this way, the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec is being bled too, not so much by migration 
               <br />
               to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> ; but she is being bled mainly to 
               <br />
               the entire loss of Canada, and to the proﬁt of the 
               <br />
               neighboring Republic. I think the most important 
               <br />
               object to which we can practically address our- 
               <br />
               selves, is the diversion of that emigration to the 
               <br />
               States to migration to the North-W'est Territories. 
               <br />
               I do not hope myself for any substantial measure of 
               <br />
               success whatever from projects of repatriation. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that the French Canadian whom you let go to 
               <br />
               the States, and who settles there, you have practi- 
               <br />
               cally lost forever. There may be cases of return, but, 
               <br />
               speaking in the large, such, I regret to say, is my 
               <br />
               belief of the result. Nor can I say that I entertain 
               <br />
               any very high or sanguine hopes, judging by ex- 
               <br />
               perience, of Quebec migration on a large scale 
               <br />
               to the North-VVest. But still there is in that 
               <br />
               respect a hope, there ought to be a hope. 
               <br />
               If it is the case that we are unable to persuade 
               <br />
               our own people from the Province of - Quebec, 
               <br />
               agriculturists, to move to those fertile plains of 
               <br />
               which my hon. friend from North Norfolk gave such 
               <br />
               a glowing description, if it is the case that we are 
               <br />
               unable to persuade them to move there, and that 
               <br />
               they still prefer the Eastern or the Western States 
               <br />
               to Canada, then how can we hope for any great im— 
               <br />
               migration from abroad ? I say that we ought to 
               <br />
               address ourselves to that problem to which I have 
               <br />
               referred, in an earnest, an active, an energetic 
               <br />
               manner. But I conceive that the temper and 
               <br />
               spirit displayed in this Parliament and displayed 
               <br />
               in the North-VVest itself in this matter, may be very 
               <br />
               important factors asto the success of any such effort. 
               <br />
               I decline to abandon the hope of considerable immi- 
               <br />
               gration. I believe that if the people of the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories will consider of the matter, if 
               <br />
               those few thousands of souls who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are.</span> scattered, 
               <br />
               specks hardly discernible, through that vast terri- 
               <br />
               tory, will but realise the fact that industrious, 
               <br />
               hardy, frugal, economical, cultivators of the soil 
               <br />
               are leaving old Canada, not for new Canada, but 
               <br />
               for the States, they will hold out their arms, they 
               <br />
               will welcome warmly those whom we might induce

               to go out there. Are you going to induce them to 
               <br />
               do so by such proposals as this? I am for tryin out 
               <br />
               the experiment ; I am for continuing every in uce-

               <br />

               <br />
               is fully and fairly tried out. In face of this agita-

               tion to which I have, all through what I have 
               <br />
               said, alluded, as the main and important, the 
               <br />
               overshadowing feature of this discussion, I should 
               <br />
               regard the immediate adoption of a proposal to 
               <br />
               expunge such little use of the French tongue as is 
               <br />
               now provided for, as fatal to whatever prospect 
               <br />
               there may be of an increasing or of a continuing 
               <br />
               French migration to the North-VVest. I say that 
               <br />
               the future will indicate to us the solution of this 
               <br />
               question, and that it should be reserved until the 
               <br />
               future speaks and gives us that indication. I 
               <br />
               agree with something that has been said by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Norfolk as to the people of 
               <br />
               the N orth-VVest. They are, so far as their 
               <br />
               rights, their constitutional rights are concerned, 
               <br />
               in a transition condition. They have not asked, 
               <br />
               they feel themselves that they are not yet in a posi- 
               <br />
               tion to claim the full measure of provincial rights. 
               <br />
               It would be entirely premature so to deal with these 
               <br />
               enormous areas of fertile territory in the present 
               <br />
               conditions of settlement and of occupation, and to 
               <br />
               turn them into Provinces. All sides are agreed on 
               <br />
               that. The people of the locality, but also the 
               <br />
               people of Canada, are deeply interested in the 
               <br />
               policy to be pursued in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorthNV</span> est. Canada 
               <br />
               has, in truth, if you consider the enormous areas 
               <br />
               that she has to settle, the enormous expenditure she 
               <br />
               has made and ismaking—she has, in truth, the main 
               <br />
               interest, an interest far surpassing that of the few 
               <br />
               people who are now there. But fortunately for old 
               <br />
               Canada, and fortunately for those people, it is a 
               <br />
               common interest. There is not the slightest diver- 
               <br />
               gence of inte est. There may be differences of opinion 
               <br />
               as to what are the best means of advancing that 
               <br />
               interest, but the interests are one and the same ; the 
               <br />
               prosperity of the North—VVest is the one interest of 
               <br />
               both ; and the proper step to take in order to advance 
               <br />
               that prosperity is the question submitted to both ; 
               <br />
               and upon that question the Parliament of Canada, 
               <br />
               in the present condition of the North-VVest and of 
               <br />
               the people of that country, must speak ; I will not 
               <br />
               say with a despotic voice, I will not at all say with a 
               <br />
               voice regardless of the opinion of the Territories, 
               <br />
               but still at this moment, having the responsibility, 
               <br />
               with a decisive and potential voice. Now, under 
               <br />
               these circumstances, I say, we should meet the 
               <br />
               question when it comes. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has suggested that we have heard the opinion of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-VVest.</span> I should have great, though 
               <br />
               not absolutely decisive regard to that expression 
               <br />
               deliberately and constitutionally reached, butI deny 
               <br />
               that we have yet heard it. The N orth-V’Vest Assem- 
               <br />
               bly had no commission or authority from this Par- 
               <br />
               liament, its creators, to deal with this question at

               proposition upon this subject. So, neither was 
               <br />
