               agent that he wants to apply for his patent. He has not to

               <br />

               <br />
               he sends, an inspector is sent out, and that inspector takes 
               <br />
               the evidence of the settler and the evidence of his neighbors 
               <br />
               to show that he has fulﬁlled the conditions. The conse- 
               <br />
               quence is that within a very short time the report of the 
               <br />
               inspector is made, and the settler receives a notiﬁcation 
               <br />

               <br />
               ed for patent. Now, Sir, if the settler in the North-West 
               <br />
               is aforeigner, we do not ask, when he goes to the land 
               <br />
               ofﬁce, that he should become a subject of Her Majesty 
               <br />
               the Queen. We do not ask him to forswear allegi- 
               <br />
               ance from the country whence he came, but if a 
               <br />
               young man goes to a land ofﬁce in the United States 
               <br />
               they require that he should be twenty-one years 
               <br />
               of age and in addition, if he is the subject of a foreign nation 
               <br />
               he is required to take the oath of allegiance to the President 
               <br />
               of the United States, and to forswear allegiance from the 
               <br />
               country from which he came, and particularly the Queen of 
               <br />
               Great Britain and Ireland. As I have stated betore, the 
               <br />
               young settler requires to put in three years homestead duty 
               <br />
               in our lands in Manitoba or the North-West Territories. 
               <br />
               But if a young man reQuires a homestead in Dakota or the 
               <br />
               Territories of the United States, he has to put in ﬁve years. 
               <br />
               We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> to settlers 160 acres of a homestead, and 160 acres 
               <br />
               pre-emption, but they have no such regulation in the United 
               <br />
               States. A man cannot pre—empt after he has homesteaded, 
               <br />
               and his pre-emption means that he has gone to the land 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oiﬁce</span> and sworn that he is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">21</span> years of age, that he has put 
               <br />
               in six months’ residence on that preemption, and then he 
               <br />
               buys it at $2.50 an acre. The best way I can describe the 
               <br />
               matter, so far as this question of pre-empting lands in 
               <br />
               Dakota is concerned, is to read an extract from the very 
               <br />
               able pamphlet of W. A. Webster, which is now in the 
               <br />
               hands of most of the members of this House. At page 5, 
               <br />
               Mr. Webster says as follows :— 
               <br />

               “ The land laws here are greatly abused. To enter on land one must 
               <br />
               be a citizen 21 years old, and must reside on the land ﬁve years before 
               <br />
               he can get his patent; but the homesteader takes advantage of a clause 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">set,</span> which allows him to commute, after six months’ residence, 
               <br />
               by pa ing $2.50 an acre, it, during these six months, he shall have built 
               <br />
               ahabitable house and cultivated ten acres of land. Now, this is the 
               <br />
               practice: Four young men enter for the land at the land office. They 
               <br />
               go to the place where the four corners of their sections meet, and there 
               <br />
               build a sect cabin 12 feet square, as a joint house for all four. They dig 
               <br />
               four holes a few feet deep and call them wells; borrow a yoke of steers 
               <br />
               and plough a few furrows around the house, and call that forty acres ; 
               <br />
               sleep a few nights in the cabin and ‘prove up ;’ mortgage their home- 
               <br />
               steads to the s cnlators and et money to get their patents. If they 
               <br />
               have a few dol ars left they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">100%</span> on that as clear gain, put them in their 
               <br />
               pockets, go <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off</span> to some other county where they are not known and go 
               <br />
               through the same operation again and again, while the speculator gets 
               <br />
               the land and tries to sell it for $10 an acre. One man told me that he 
               <br />
               had homesteaded nine times and was going to do so once more. The 
               <br />
               remains of those cabins are to be met with all over the prairie, without 
               <br />
               a sign of life about them. One of those deserted cabins, with a board 
               <br />
               nailed across the door, had a notice on it, of which the following is a

               <br />
               pamphlet. I have met men in Canada who have lived in 
               <br />
               Dakota, and I have met men who are coming across again 
               <br />
               from the States to Manitoba and the North-West, and they 
               <br />
               curse the day that ever they set foot on American soil. I 
               <br />
               heard the member for Marquette (Mr. Watson), the other 
               <br />
               day, say that Canadians were returning from Dakota and 
               <br />
               Minnesota. There is no question about that fact, for they 
               <br />
               are making entries at our customs house every day. 
               <br />
               When the hon. member for South Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) 
               <br />
               stated this afternoon, that our land laws were not as liberal

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               as the land laws of the United States, that gentleman must 
               <br />
               have known, from the reiterated statements of myself and 
               <br />
               other members of the North- West, who probably know 
               <br />
               more about these matters than he does, that he was stating 
               <br />
               what was not correct. I cannot understand why, SessiOn 
               <br />
               after Session, he should make that statement, if it were not 
               <br />
               for the fact that he is more interested in peopling the 
               <br />
               American North-West, than he is in pcopling the North- 
               <br />
               West of Canada. The hon. gentleman says that we have 
               <br />
               a very poor showing as regards the population in Manitoba 
               <br />
               and the North-West. He stated to the House this after- 
               <br />
               noon, that the population of Manitoba is 132,000. New, 
               <br />
               Sir, according to the census of 1885, only three years ago, 
               <br />
               the pepulation was 108,000. So we have increased ?4,000 
               <br />
               people in pOpulation in three years. I do not think that is 
               <br />
               a bad showing, and if the hon. gentleman w.ll examine the 
               <br />
               ratio of increase according to the census returns of the 
               <br />
               United States, he will ﬁnd that our percentage of increase 
               <br />
               is as large as the percentage of increase of any state in 
               <br />
               the Union. Now, as regards immigration, I do 
               <br />
               not think that the member ior South Norfolk 
               <br />
               will say that the Government is pursuing a wrong policy, 
               <br />
               as I contend they are, in not voting a larger annual sum 
               <br />
               for immigration. I think the hon. gentleman holds the same 
               <br />
               ideas with the hon. member for South Oxford (Sir Richard 
               <br />
               Cartwright), in effect that the Government should not 
               <br />
               be blamed for not making a larger appropriation for immi- 
               <br />
               gration. Let us consider where the population of Dakota 
               <br />
               and Minnesota come from. It comes from the peeple of 
               <br />
               the Eastern States as well as from foreign countries. Immi- 
               <br />
               gration from foreign countries has been ﬂowing into Dakota 
               <br />
               and Minnesota for the last thirty or forty years. I contend 
               <br />
               that the best immigration agent for any country is a man 
               <br />
               who comes to our country and prospers and who goes back 
               <br />
               to the land from which he came and tells the friends 
               <br />
               amongst whom he lived in his early days, of his success. Give 
               <br />
               us the same length of time Dakota and Minnesota have had 
               <br />
               to populate, and I maintain that in Manitoba and the North- 
               <br />
               West we will have a larger population than they have to- 
               <br />
               day. I was told by an agent of the Local Government of 
               <br />
               Manitoba in Ontario, a month ago, that there were over 2,000 
               <br />
               Manitobans in Quebec and Ontario. Those 2,000 men will 
               <br />
               do more to populate our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Countrymand</span> possibly to de- 
               <br />
               populate your older Provinces down here—than all the 
               <br />
               immigration pamphlets you could have printed. If we 
               <br />
               look at the Argentine Republic, which is seeking to 
               <br />
               increase its population, we will ﬁnd that it is spend- 
               <br />
               ing ﬁve million dollars this year on immigration. 
               <br />
               It is making every possible effort to take people there. 
               <br />
               What I maintain is, that if our Government gave us a more 
               <br />
               liberal immigration grant, our population would probably 
               <br />
               increase at a greater ratio. But, however that may be, I 
               <br />
               am perfectly satisﬁed that it is only a matter of time when 
               <br />
               our population will be just as great as that of" Dakota and the 
               <br />
               other western territories of the United States. Any hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman from that country will tell you today that we 
               <br />
               have a contented, a happy and a prosperous people. When 
               <br />
               I tell you that the ittle town I come from, although 
               <br />
               scarcely seven years old, in 1887 shipped 8,000,000 pounds 
               <br />
               of freight, you will come to the conclusion that we have 
               <br />
               made great progress. We, last year, shipped 1,500,000 bushels 
               <br />
               of wheat. All that ought to be required of the members of 
               <br />
               this House, either those from our Province, or those from 
               <br />
               the other Provinces, is to have faith in our great North- 
               <br />
               West—to believe that it is only a matter of time when that 
               <br />
               country will be peopled; and if the people who are to come 
               <br />
               in should be of the same class as those there now, we shall 
               <br />
               have the fairest Province in this great Confederation. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, by his remarks this afternoon, would give 
               <br />
               those who are imperfectly informed to understand that it 
               <br />
               is better for a man who wants to emigrate to go to Dakota, 
               <br />
               or some other part of the United States, than to go to 
               <br />
