               <br />

               <br />

               question of race and nationality. It is a question 
               <br />

               have the same sentiments, the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aspirations</span> 
               <br />
               and the same blood as we have, to be choked, he 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd himself mistaken. We will go together 
               <br />
               to preserve our autonomy, our language, our insti- 
               <br />
               tutions—everything which is sacred to a nation. 
               <br />
               Our forefathers have been buried in the Province 
               <br />
               of Quebec. There are the very grounds where we 
               <br />
               go and pray for their souls, as good Catholics, and 
               <br />
               does he think that we will abandon that country, 
               <br />
               that he is going to chase us away without a struggle? 
               <br />
               We would be untrue to our blood. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman wants us to abandon our language, he 
               <br />
               wants us to change our names as well, because our 
               <br />
               names cannot remain as they are. My name, Lan— 
               <br />
               gevin, is a French name. I do not know how he 
               <br />
               would call me in English. But he may be sure 
               <br />
               that we will not repudiate our names, we will not 
               <br />
               repudiate our blood, we will not repudiate our 
               <br />
               ancestors. We do not want the hon. gentleman to 
               <br />
               despise us. We would deserve to be despised, we 
               <br />
               would be unworthy of our blood, if we allowed 
               <br />
               him to do so. Mr. Speaker, I wish to mention 
               <br />
               another point, but I will do so brieﬂy, because my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Montreal Centre (Mr. Curran) 
               <br />
               has alluded to it in a very eloquent way, and in 
               <br />
               French, this afternooon. French is not his own 
               <br />
               tongue, but he wished to show that he, of another 
               <br />
               race, he, an Irishman, had the same feelings that 
               <br />
               we had, and that he would not allow us to be 
               <br />
               trampled upon, as the hon. gentleman wishes. The 
               <br />
               hon. member from North Simcoe quoted The 
               <br />
               Month, as follows :—

               <br />

               from Montreal Centre gave some examples, and I 
               <br />
               will give some more. When Irish immigrants were 
               <br />
               coming into this country, and when a ship fever 
               <br />
               broke out among them, and they were detained at 
               <br />
               the quarantine station at Grosse Isle, and the 
               <br />
               living cargoes of these ships were landed, what did 
               <br />
               the clergy of the Province of Quebec do ? We saw 
               <br />
               that Cardinal Taschereau, then only a priest, 
               <br />
               went to their assistance. He had no business to 
               <br />
               go, because he was then at the Seminary at Quebec, 
               <br />
               but he offered his services, and a number of others 
               <br />
               along with him, to rescue these poor Irishmen. A 
               <br />
               number of Sisters of Charity, also speaking French, 
               <br />
               went to Grosse Isle to attend to the wants of 
               <br />
               these poor, sick people, and a number of them 
               <br />
               lost their lives while caring for these poor 
               <br />
               Irishmen, women and children. And when these 
               <br />
               men and women, the fathers and mothers of poor 
               <br />
               orphans, were gone, what became of these chil- 
               <br />
               dren ‘2 Were they left there on the island to die? 
               <br />
               No. French <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span> families adopted them, 
               <br />
               they were well taken care of, and they became 
               <br />
               French Canadians. The hon. gentleman calls that 
               <br />
               absorption of race. I wish we could see more of 
               <br />
               such an absorption of races, not only among the 
               <br />
               French, but among the other races. I believe if 
               <br />
               a thing of this kind occurred in Ontario, and that 
               <br />
               French Canadians were the sufferers, I am sure 
               <br />
               that their orphans would be well taken care of and 
               <br />
               adopted into English-speaking families. So much to 
               <br />
               show the hatred of the races. We adopted their 
               <br />
               children when they were orphans; we came to 
               <br />
               their rescue when they were suffering. More than 
               <br />
               that, when our people suffer, when French Cana- 
               <br />
               dian families are in want, and there are any Irish 
               <br />
               families in the neighborhood, the hearts of the 
               <br />
               Irish people beat with sympathy for our people, 
               <br />
               and the Irishman and his wife come to the relief 
               <br />
               of the French Canadian families. That is the 
               <br />
               hatred that exists in the Province of Quebec. I 
               <br />
               hope that before this debate is through we will 
               <br />
               hear a few words from the members of the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec who speak the English language, 
               <br />
               and who are Protestants. I hope that they will 
               <br />
               come out and express their opinions and say how 
               <br />
               we treat them, and how we treat the English, Irish

               and the Scotch in our Province. Let them come out.

               I do not know how many of them will speak, or 
               <br />
               whether any of them will do so, but I hope they 
               <br />
               will speak in order to repel that assertion of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Simcoe. The hon. gentleman, at

               “Now, are we going to perpetuate this system of

               things ? Are we going to permit it to grow into what
