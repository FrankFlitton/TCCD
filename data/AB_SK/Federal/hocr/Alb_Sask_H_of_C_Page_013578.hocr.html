               Minister of Justice were more convincing 
               <br />
               to me than it is—and I am bound to say 
               <br />
               that I appreciate its weight—nevertheless 
               <br />
               we have 011 the other hand the opinion of the 
               <br />
               law ofﬁcers of the province of New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick, and all who are acquainted with the 
               <br />
               Attorney General of New Brunswick (Hon. 
               <br />
               “’m. Pugsley), and all who have met him 
               <br />
               at the bar, realize and recognize his emin- 
               <br />
               ence in the legal profession. Therefore, so 
               <br />
               long as there is a question with regard to 
               <br />
               it, I think it would be right that it should 
               <br />
               be submitted to the Supreme Court. It 
               <br />
               ought to be submitted not only to the Sn- 
               <br />
               preme Court. but it seems to me necessary 
               <br />
               or at least desirable that provision should 
               <br />
               also be made for having the opinion of the 
               <br />
               Privy Council upon the question. I 
               <br />
               say that for this reason : Suppose the 
               <br />
               parliament of Canada should pass this Act 
               <br />
               in its present form, and a question 
               <br />
               should afterwards he raised—and it may 
               <br />
               be raised before the courts-as to whe- 
               <br />
               ther this parliament had jurisdiction. and 
               <br />
               the case so raised should go not only to the 
               <br />
               Supreme Court of Canada, but to the Privy 
               <br />
               Council, a very awkward condition of affairs 
               <br />
               may come to pass. It seems to me that it 
               <br />
               would be impossible to separate in such an 
               <br />
               Act as this, that portion which upon the 
               <br />
               assumption that I have made, would be 
               <br />
               good, and that portion which would be bad. 
               <br />
               May I make my meaning a little plaincr-— 
               <br />
               I am trying to address myself more par- 
               <br />
               ticularly to my hon. friend the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice. Here is a statute which undoubted- 
               <br />
               ly contains provisions which this parliament 
               <br />
               may pass—there can be no doubt that we 
               <br />
               can deal with the revision of constituencies 
               <br />
               throughout Canada. While that revision or 
               <br />
               redistribution of constituencies throughout 
               <br />
               Canada is part of the statute, it contains, 
               <br />
               let us say, a provision which is absolutely 
               <br />
               ultra vires of this parliament; namely, the 
               <br />
               reduction of the representation of Ontario 
               <br />
               to eighty—six and the reduction of the re— 
               <br />
               presentation of the other provinces by one 
               <br />
               or two members. In construing a statute 
               <br />
               of that kind it may be held by the court 
               <br />
               eventually: That not only that portion 
               <br />
               which deals with the representation of the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario is bad, but the whole is 
               <br />
               bad, because the two things are so much 
               <br />
               dependent on each other and so absolutely 
               <br />
               joined together in the Act, that you cannot 
               <br />
               separate in it that portion which is good 
               <br />
               from that portion which is bad. Therefore, 
               <br />
               it seems to me that we should have an ad- 
               <br />
               Judlcation upon this question and we should 
               <br />
               not only have the adjudication of the Sn- 
               <br />
               preme Court of Canada upon it, but we 
               <br />
               should also have the adjudication of the 
               <br />
               Privy Council by way of appeal as well.

               the parliament of Canada could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">create—mot</span> 
               <br />
               only that it could create but that it should 
               <br />
               create—a power to make the redistribution 
               <br />
               although it could not do the work itself. 
               <br />
               This view was held by these two gentlemen 
               <br />
               and it was strongly supported, but as my 
               <br />
               hon. friend knows this view was not gener- 
               <br />
               ally accepted. I do not notice that my hon. 
               <br />
               friend (Mr. Borden) himself expresses an 
               <br />
               opinion, and he no doubt has one, upon this 
               <br />
               question. Whatever may be his view I shall 
               <br />
               not press to know it at the moment, but I 
               <br />
               will point out that the government thought 
               <br />
               that upon this question, though perhaps the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> may not be free from doubt—I 
               <br />
               would not go so far as that probably—though 
               <br />
               the contrary view is held by eminent authori- 
               <br />
               ties. we thought the safest course was to
