               After reading this preamble, it is easily ascertain— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,able</span> that it is not merely to redress the grievances 
               <br />
               in the N orth-VVest that the hon. member has 
               <br />
               brought in this Bill. It has quite another object. 
               <br />
               It is not a piece of partial and local legislation 
               <br />
               which he undertakes to carry out, but general 
               <br />
               legislation attacking everything which is French 
               <br />
               Canadian in Canada. If the hon. member has local 
               <br />
               legislation in view, I ask what is his commission, 
               <br />
               what is his miSsion ‘2 I do not see that he has any, 
               <br />
               and I consider that he is meddling in What does not 
               <br />
               concern him, that he is meddling in the business 
               <br />
               of other people. It is said that many American 
               <br />
               citizens have made fortunes in minding their own 
               <br />
               business. This is the line of conduct which should 
               <br />
               be adopted by the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy). When the North-VVest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories Act <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was.</span> passed in 1877, it will be remem- 
               <br />
               bered that the section which is sought to be re- 
               <br />
               pealed was adopted ﬁrst by the Senate ; this 
               <br />
               section was then submitted to the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons. The Government of Mr. Mackenzie was 
               <br />
               then in power. The hon. member for North Sim- 
               <br />
               coe was then in the House, and he consented with 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others—he</span> had not then the mission which he 
               <br />
               has to-day,——he consented, as (lid the other mem- 
               <br />
               bers, to the adoption of this section, which passed 
               <br />
               unanimously. Later on, in 1880, this North-\Vest 
               <br />
               Territories Act again came before the House, and 
               <br />
               this section is found imbedded in the Revised 
               <br />
               Statutes, and never did the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) think it proper to com- 
               <br />
               plain of it. Last year, he set out on the war path, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> he was seen careering over Ontario and the 
               <br />
               N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth—W'est</span> Territories. He thought himself 
               <br />
               charged with a special mission to regenerate the 
               <br />
               population, and to rub out from the map of Can- 
               <br />
               ada all that belonged to the French Canadians. I 
               <br />
               would not Wish to insult the hon. member by 
               <br />
               comparing him to the celebrated knight Who 
               <br />
               roamed over Spain and the other European coun- 
               <br />
               tries in order to ﬁght windmills. I certainly would 
               <br />
               not desire to compare him to this renowned knight 
               <br />
               of the sorrowful ﬁgure, who, in his moments of 
               <br />
               sanguinary instinct, disembowelled armies of sheep;
