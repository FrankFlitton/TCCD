               different races, it was never suggested that they 
               <br />
               should undo the mischief which had been done in 
               <br />
               the reign of Peleg. To secure the desired union they 
               <br />
               were to bring men together on a common platform 
               <br />
               although the relation proposed was much closer 
               <br />
               than that of common citizens of the same State. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman assumes that, when Canada became 
               <br />
               a British Province, its people lost the right to use 
               <br />
               the only language they knew, because its use was 
               <br />
               not guaranteed to them by the articles of capitula- 
               <br />
               tion or the treaty of peace. He assumed that it was 
               <br />
               an unwarrantable presumption for the people of 
               <br />
               Canada, without such authority, to use that lan- 
               <br />
               guage. Well, I have always understood, that the 
               <br />
               subjects of Her Majesty are sworn to bear true and 
               <br />
               faithful allegiance to Her Majesty, but I have 
               <br />
               never heard that they were sworn to speak the 
               <br />
               English language. I do not know, if we were 
               <br />
               put to the test, how many of us who can speak 
               <br />
               no other language would be able to pass the 
               <br />
               ordeal, if we were put on trial for an improper 
               <br />
               use of the Queen’s English. There is no constitu- 
               <br />
               tional rule <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> which I am aware making the use of 
               <br />
               English an indispensable accompaniment of Parlia- 
               <br />
               mentary Government or of allegiance to the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish Crown. A man may be a British subject put 
               <br />
               on trial for treason and convicted without knowing 
               <br />
               a word of English. He may talk Italian in Malta, 
               <br />
               French in the Province of Quebec, Dutch at the 
               <br />
               Cape, Hindoo at Calcutta, and Chinese at Hong- 
               <br />
               Kong, Without in any degree sacriﬁcing his 
               <br />
               rights or lessening his obligations as a British 
               <br />
               subject. The law does not extend his responsi— 
               <br />
               bilities beyond his powers. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               himself had no voice in saying who his parents 
               <br />
               should be, or in determining the place or time 
               <br />
               of his birth or the language of his childhood 
               <br />
               and education. All these matters were determined 
               <br />
               for him by the supreme authority of Providence, 
               <br />
               and thisis his vindication in regard to his nationality 
               <br />
               and the use of the language which he employs. 
               <br />
               There are upon the Royal Arms certain mottoes, and 
               <br />
               it happens that they are all in French. One of them 
               <br />
               means in English “God and my right.” That traces 
               <br />
               the rights of men to their original source. That 
               <br />
               source, high above every human authority to the 
               <br />
               contrary, is the one to which every free man 
               <br />
               traces his right to resist wrong and oppression. It 
               <br />
               is from that source that the French Canadian 
               <br />
               derives his right to speak the language of his 
               <br />
               fathers, and any law which attempts to deprive him 
               <br />
               of those high rights which belong to him, in the 
               <br />
               manner in which the hon. gentleman proposes to 
               <br />
               wipe out and obliterate the use of the French 
               <br />
               language, would be a law doing violence to those 
               <br />
               very objects for the maintenance of which a 
               <br />
               Government exists. The hon. gentleman speaks 
               <br />
               of the conquest of Canada as something which 
               <br />
               made the French Canadians less than ordinary 
               <br />
               British subjects. He spoke <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">23:1,..if</span> they were

               <br />
               quered race ? This matter is very important 
               <br />
               because the notion has gone abroad that, in conse- 
               <br />
               ueuce of Canada having been a conquered country, 
               <br />
               t e same right does not exist to use the French

               <br />

               <br />
               be no (1' erence in that respect. The views with

               quest that have been sedulously propagated of late are 
               <br />
               altogether erroneous. It is true, as Lord Mansﬁeld 
               <br />
               has said, in a very important judgment, that you 
               <br />
               may put your enemy to the sword and conﬁscate 
               <br />
               his property as an act of war and during war. This 
               <br />
               in theory was the law. This may be theoretically 
               <br />
               the law still, although Turkey, sixty years ago, in 
               <br />
               making war upon Greece, acted upon practices that 
               <br />
               fell far short of this absolute rule, and humanity, it 
               <br />
               was held, justiﬁed the interference of the great 
               <br />
               powers of Europe. Now, what may be done as an 
               <br />
               act of war and during war is a wholly different thing 
               <br />
               from what may be done after the waris consummat- 
               <br />
               ed. If the country surrenders, if articles of capitul- 
               <br />
               ation are signed, those parties who were enemies 
               <br />
               and aliens before, at once become subjects, and 
               <br />
               their persons and property is entitled to protection 
               <br />
               at the hands of the new sovereign. The person and 
               <br />
               the property of the new subjects do not stand in 
               <br />
               any different position from the property and the 
               <br />
               person of those who were subjects by birth. The 
               <br />
               Sovereign succeeds to public property. The ancient 
               <br />
               law continues until he expressly changes it. For as 
               <br />
               long as the conqueror fails to create a legislative 
               <br />
               assembly he has a right of government, subordinate, 
               <br />
               of course, to his right as an integral part of Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. But if the sovereign chooses, by letters 
               <br />
               patent, to authorise the calling of a legislative 
               <br />
               assembly, the moment those letters patent are 
               <br />
               signed, and before that legislative assembly is 
               <br />
               called, he has exhausted his power. The subjects 
               <br />
               of the country he has acquired by conquest then 
               <br />

               assembly to determine what shall be the language 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the Imperial Parliament. Thus, in the Ionian

               Islands, English, Greek and Italian were in use 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               by Italians ; other islands were mainly peopled by 
               <br />
               Greeks. English merchants were found in all of 
               <br />
               them and when a Government was given them, all 
               <br />
               three languages were used, and they were used 
               <br />
               because it was convenient. The public authorities, 
               <br />
               did not feel that it was necessary, to deny to these 
               <br />
               people, the rights or practices which were felt to 
               <br />
               be necessary to every section of the community.
