               the grants are being made too large, because 
               <br />
               it is my belief that twice the amount of 
               <br />
               money that is being voted could be proﬁt- 
               <br />
               ably and advantageously expended in the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories, and to Canada’s 
               <br />
               general advantage. I say that there is 
               <br />
               no part of any country in the world which 
               <br />
               offers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> such a good ﬁeld for invest- 
               <br />
               ments, with such an assurance of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speedy</span> 
               <br />
               and large returns. Still, I am bound to 
               <br />
               say that I think the government are this 
               <br />
               year fairly well meeting the ﬁnancial de- 
               <br />
               mand. The comparisons which I have made 
               <br />
               with former years can lead to no other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con4</span> 
               <br />
               clusion.

               My own attitude in former years on the 
               <br />
               question of provincial autonomy has been 
               <br />
               referred to, and I am free to state that if 
               <br />
               no new condition had arisen, if the condi- 
               <br />
               tions were exactly the same at the present 
               <br />
               time that they have been in former years, 
               <br />
               I would be expressing the same view that 
               <br />
               I expressed two years ago on the question. 
               <br />
               But a new condition has arisen—the condi— 
               <br />
               tion of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway tax 
               <br />
               exemption, to which I intend to refer a little 
               <br />
               later—which, in my opinion, furnishes a 
               <br />
               very strong neason Why it is better to hesi- 
               <br />
               tate, why it is better not to have action 
               <br />
               taken at the present time. But, on the 
               <br />
               general question, apart from that condition, 
               <br />
               which I hope will be removed in a very 
               <br />
               short time, I would simply take the occa- 
               <br />
               sion to repeat the opinion which I have ex- 
               <br />
               pressed in other years, that the people in 
               <br />
               the territories have the same right to full 
               <br />
               powers of local government as the people of 
               <br />
               any province. ‘
