               friend opposite, that the population of the 
               <br />
               territories now is vastly larger than was 
               <br />
               that of Manitoba when that part of the 
               <br />
               country was formed into a province. It is 
               <br />
               probably 600 or 700 per cent greater. and if 
               <br />
               the population of the North-west Territories 
               <br />
               is not as large to-day as that of the province
