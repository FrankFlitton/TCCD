               are told by the hon‘. the leader of the Opposition 
               <br />
               that there were those in the Province of Quebec 
               <br />
               who had a dream of establishng a French nation~ 
               <br />
               ality on the banks of the St. Lawrence, but the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) in- 
               <br />
               formed the House—as is well-known—that in the 
               <br />
               Province of Ontario there are those who have a 
               <br />
               dream of a greater nation, a nation speaking the 
               <br />
               Anglo—Saxon tongue, not conﬁned to the banks of 
               <br />
               the St. Lawrence or to any one country, but ex- 
               <br />
               tending over the whole world. Such 'is no doubt 
               <br />
               the dream of many in the Province of Ontario, and 
               <br />
               elsewhere, that there may be a nation with a com~ 
               <br />
               munity of language extending from pole to pole. 
               <br />
               Such dreams may be indulged in without doing 
               <br />
               any particular harm to anybody. They may please 
               <br />
               the dreamer without hurting his neighbors. Such 
               <br />
               questions, however, I think are not for us to dis- 
               <br />
               cuss here. Such questions should be left to Him 
               <br />
               who moves in a mysterious way His wonders to 
               <br />
               perform, and who, for His own wise purposes, has 
               <br />
               created different nations and given us different 
               <br />
               languages and taught us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> creeds. In His 
               <br />
               hands I think we can leave the future which is 
               <br />
               certainly so far away, but for the present, let us 
               <br />
               each and all do what we can to maintain the pa- 
               <br />
               triotic sentiment of our people and to establish 
               <br />
               unity among the different classes of this Dominion, 
               <br />
               the different races and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> creeds, to es—

               tablish peace, harmony and good fellowship ; let us

               become a nation great, glorious and united—united 
               <br />
               not only by interest but by love; and then, Mr.

               sired that any hon. gentleman should make along 
               <br />
               speech. We have had the question viewed from 
               <br />
               an historical aspect, and from I do not know how 
               <br />
               many other aspects, but to my mind the importance 
               <br />
               of the question has not been minimised by the 
               <br />
               manner in which it has been treated on both 
               <br />
               sides of the House. At ﬁrst it did not appear 
               <br />
               to be a matter of such wonderful importance, 
               <br />
               but it has been magniﬁed by the press out- 
               <br />
               side, and by hon. gentlemen on both sides of the 
               <br />
               House, until now, no doubt, it has assumed a posi- 
               <br />
               tion of national importance. I must frankly say 
               <br />
               that the House need not be ashamed of the debate. 
               <br />
               It has been maintained, on both sides of the House, 
               <br />
               at a higher standard than any debate I have list- 
               <br />
               ened to for many years in this Parliament. As to 
               <br />
               the historical aspect of this question, I will make 
               <br />
               only one remark. We have had learned gentlemen 
               <br />
               referring us to precedents in Europe in days gone 
               <br />

               therefore that, although you may deduce certain les—

               <br />
               question which is before us on practical data which 
               <br />
               we can gather for ourselves from the circumstances 
               <br />
               and condition of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories. We 
               <br />
               had from the hon. and learned gentleman who sits 
               <br />
               beside <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inc—«Mr.</span> Mills (Bothwell)——the other night 
               <br />
               a speech replete with information, a speech in which 
               <br />
               he argued the question in a very calm and logical 
               <br />
               manner, enforced with a world and a wealth of 
               <br />
               illustration which was remarkable, a speech which 
               <br />
               was very concise and lucid, and which, I think, 
               <br />
               maintained the hon. gentleman in the high posi- 
               <br />
               tion which he has in this House as one of its most 
               <br />
               profound thinkers and most able debaters. But 
               <br />
               What was the conclusion which he drew? I think 
               <br />
               the conclusion was based on common sense, and 
               <br />
               it was that whether we should or should not have in 
               <br />
               this country one language or two or three languages 
               <br />
               was simply a matter of convenience. That was the 
               <br />
               practical conclusion which he drew, and I think it is 
               <br />
               a very fair and just conclusion. If that is admitted, 
               <br />
               the next question is, who is to determine the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of convenience? That is the stage which we 
               <br />
               have now reached. Is it to be the Parliament of 
               <br />

               <br />

               desires of the people there, or is it to be the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the North-West themselves? I think any 
               <br />
               practical man would give an answer to that ques— 
               <br />
               tion in a very short time. The answer which I 
               <br />
               give to that question is the one which leads me 
               <br />
               to the conclusion to which I have come, and 
               <br />
               which I will support with my vote. In the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place, we have before us the Bill of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), 
               <br />
               which has been so much discussed. But I will 
               <br />
               say this frankly and fully, that divorced from 
               <br />
               its preamble, disassociated from the speeches of 
               <br />
               its introducer, both in this House and outside 
               <br />
               the House, disassociated, if you can disassociate 
               <br />
               it, from the crusade which he is charged with 
               <br />
               carrying on, that Bill would offer a solution of the 
               <br />
               question not very unfair. But it has two defects 
               <br />
               in my mind, and they are fatal defects. One is 
               <br />
               that no man, in my humble opinion, who has 
               <br />
               followed the course of events in this country for 
               <br />
               the past ﬁve or six months, who knows the pro- 
               <br />
               mises and the pledges that that hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               gave to the public, who knows the circumstances 
               <br />
               under which he gave those promises and pledges, 
               <br />
               and who witnessed the introduction of that Bill, 
               <br />
               and heard the speech with which it was introduced 
               <br />
               ——no man, I say, can disassociate the enacting part 
               <br />
               of that Bill from its preamble or from the inter- 
               <br />
