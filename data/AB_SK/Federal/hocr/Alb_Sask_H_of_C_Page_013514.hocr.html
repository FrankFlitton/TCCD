               account of the system of land grants which

               sixteen out of the thirty-six sections. The. 
               <br />
               scattered settlement in that country, is what 
               <br />
               makes it more necessary that there shall 
               <br />

               out that large grant these schools could not 
               <br />
               be conducted, and without schools you can- 
               <br />
               not hope to attract settlement, nor can you
