               The PRIME MINISTER. The number of

               our population has been ascertained, so that

               were a very serious doubt as to whether or

               it would be well perhaps to stay our hands. 
               <br />
               We have agreed to refer the question to 
               <br />
               the Supreme Court, not because we have

               <br />
               views held by some people in the different

               advanced by some hon. gentlemen opposite,

               then its decision would be a matter for

               consideration at the proper time. I submit 
               <br />
               that all the arguments advanced this after-

               from them. It is admitted on all sides that

               when confederation was organized, it was

               view was in the minds of those who framed

               proposition, I believe, will be accepted by

               <br />
               the same law should apply to all these pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the framers of the constitution, it was 
               <br />
               that representation was to be based on popu- 
               <br />
               lation. That principle certainly was in the 
               <br />
               minds of the people at that time. It had 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> been the subject of a long and very ardent 
               <br />
               controversy in two of the provinces. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[province</span> of Upper Canada had been insist-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;presentation</span> by population. The province 
               <br />
               of Quebec did not object but insisted that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> there should not be representation by popu-

               antees in favour of the minority in the con-

               federation. Representation by population 
               <br />
               was therefore certainly strong in the minds

               <br />
               come in later, it was certainly understood 
               <br />
               that when they did enter the same rule of 
               <br />
               representation and the same readjustment 
               <br />
               at every census should apply to them. But

               while it has been enacted that the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec should be the pivot around which

               the representation of all the other provinces 
               <br />

               friend does not dispute that Quebec is to

               the contention which we hold on this side 
               <br />
               of the House is that this 25,367 is to be the 
               <br />
               unit for all the provinces, not for the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec alone, but for the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario, the province of Nova Scotia, the pro- 
               <br />

               And, if that rule is to be applied and 25,367 
               <br />
               souls is to be the unit of representation for 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec, does my hon. friend
