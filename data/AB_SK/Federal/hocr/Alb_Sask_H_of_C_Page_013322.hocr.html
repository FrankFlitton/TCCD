               <br />
               of the hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) 
               <br />

               many surrounding clauses, which contains so many 
               <br />
               things that appear to a layman to be a mystery. 
               <br />
               The amendment of the hon. member for West 
               <br />
               Assiniboia is plain, and I do not feel disposed to 
               <br />
               vote for the amendment of the Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
               as it recites certain things with which I do not 
               <br />
               agree. It says :

               <br />
               I believe, that at any time when it is in the 
               <br />
               interests of any Province of the Dominion that 
               <br />
               even the British North America Act should be 
               <br />
               changed, it should be changed for the convenience 
               <br />
               of the people living under that Act. Believing 
               <br />
               that, I could not consistently vote for the amend- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Province from which I come may have occa- 
               <br />
               sion to seek to amend the British North America 
               <br />
               Act in some measure, to relieve them from some 
               <br />

               <br />
               majority. The French language is practically 
               <br />
               done away with in Manitoba, as far as the Legis- 
               <br />
               lature is concerned. It has been abolished by a 
               <br />
               vote of twenty-four to six, and in a full House of 
               <br />
               the representatives there would have been a vote 
               <br />
               of thirty-two to six. The people of the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories are similarly situated to those of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and I have no doubt they desire to have only 
               <br />
               one ofﬁcial language in the North-VVest. Another

               reason why I cannot vote for the Bill introduced 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Siincoe is the fact that I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that six of the gentlemen composing the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> Council expressed themselves as being 
               <br />
               favorable to the power being granted them by this 
               <br />
               Parliament to deal with this question. They did 
               <br />
               not ask that an Act should be passed to repeal 
               <br />
               clause 110, as I understood from the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Simcoe, but they asked that they should have 
               <br />
               the pOWer to do away with the French language .if 
               <br />
               they saw fit. I will quote some extracts from the 
               <br />
               speeches delivered by a few of those gentlemen in 
               <br />

               <br />
               Provenclier stated that Mr. Judge Rouleau had

               <br />

               “ Mr. Hoey said this dual language seemed to be a bug- 
               <br />
               bear to some people, and yet not one member had been 
               <br />
               able to show any injury done by it. No action should be 
               <br />
               taken until the question was brought before the different 
               <br />
               constituencies.”

               Now, Mr. Speaker, with that evidence before me, 
               <br />
               I cannot do otherwise than to support the 
               <br />
               amendment moved by the hon. member for West 
               <br />
               Assiniboia, because I believe it gives the people 
               <br />
               the exact power they ask for. To my mind, the 
               <br />
               amendment to the amendment is simply putting 
               <br />
               this matter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off</span> to another year. It is not giving 
               <br />
               the power they ask for, and if the amendment of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice is carried, no doubt we Will 
               <br />
               have a repetition of the debate that has taken 
               <br />
               place here for the last six days, a debate which, I 
               <br />
               think, is very much to be regretted. There is no 
               <br />
               doubt it has given rise to race and religious 
               <br />
               feelings that will not be quieted for years to come. 
               <br />
               I was a little astonished at a statement made 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice, and also one made 
               <br />
               by the lV'linister of the Interior. The Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, in speaking in defence of his amend- 
               <br />
               ment, said it would be cruel to deprive 
               <br />
               those poor people in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorthNVest</span> of the privilege 
               <br />
               of using their mother tongue ; that a man might be 
               <br />
               tried there and convicted, and, after the trial was 
               <br />
               over, he might not know What he was convicted 
               <br />
               for. Now, it appears to me that there is a good 
               <br />
               deal of special pleading in a statement like that. 
               <br />
               I have yet to learn that any British subject, or 
               <br />
               anyone else, in the Dominion of Canada, be he of 
               <br />
               British nationality or of any other has suffered 
               <br />
               from a miscarriage of justice because he did not 
               <br />
               understand the language in which the statutes 
               <br />
               were printed. That being the case, I have no 
               <br />
               doubt that, when the French language is done 
               <br />
               away with in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—\Vest,</span> there will be no 
               <br />
               occasion for saying that these people do not under- 
               <br />
               stand the law because it is not printed in their own 
               <br />
               language. The hon. Minister of the Interior, in 
               <br />
               his remarks last night, made rather a startling 
               <br />
               statement. He said that he visited six townships 
               <br />
               in Manitoba during his trip last fall, and he found 
               <br />
               nine <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> nationalities in those six different 
               <br />
               townships.
