               Mr. WHITE (Cardwell). I cannot hope to enter- 
               <br />
               tain the House with the splendid eloquence and 
               <br />
               vivacity of my hon. friend from Assiniboia (Mr. 
               <br />
               Davin), but with your permission, Mr. Speaker, I 
               <br />
               would like to make a few observations on the Bill 
               <br />
               now under discussion. What I have to complain 
               <br />
               of in the speech of the hon. member for Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy), is that from beginning to end it 
               <br />
               had a tendency to offend our French Canadian 
               <br />
               fellow—citizens and was not at all addressed to the 
               <br />
               question which he presented to the House. That 
               <br />
               question in itself, it seems to me, is a very 
               <br />
               simple one. It is, Whether looking to the 
               <br />
               character of the population of the North-VVest, it 
               <br />
               is expedient to continue the use of the French 
               <br />
               language in ofﬁcial documents. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), instead of conﬁning him- 
               <br />
               self to the question of the expediency of the use of 
               <br />
               the French language in the North-VVest,went back 
               <br />
               to the treaty of 1763, and he made it appear by 
               <br />
               every word that he uttered that nothing in the 
               <br />
               legislation of Canada, nothing in the legis- 
               <br />
               lation of Great Britain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affecting</span> Canada was 
               <br />
               so distasteful to him as the recognition of French 
               <br />
               as an ofﬁcial language with us. I dissent entirely 
               <br />
               from the conclusions he has drawn from his prem- 
               <br />
               ises. He said that the treaty of 1763 made no men- 
               <br />
               tion of the use of French as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> language, that 
               <br />
               the treaty of 1774 made no mention of the use of 
               <br />
               French as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an.</span> oﬂicial language, that the Constitu- 
               <br />
               tional Act of 1791 omitted any recognition of it, 
               <br />
               and that after Lord Durham had made his report 
               <br />
               upon his visit to Canada in 1839 it was declared 
               <br />
               that only one language should be ofﬁcially recog- 
               <br />
               nised. The hon. gentleman stated also that it was 
               <br />
               not until 1848 when the British Parliament repeal- 
               <br />
               ed the statute of 1841, that French obtained an 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial recognition in Canada. Now, the recital 
               <br />
               of the facts is perfectly accurate, but the inference 
               <br />
               drawn seems to me to be wholly misleading. Surely 
               <br />
               when we know that from 1774 down to 1841 
               <br />
               French was actually in use as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> language, 
               <br />
               the whole argument of the hon. member for Simcoe 
               <br />
               falls to the ground. It was true, as he says, 
               <br />
               that there was nothing in the treaties and nothing 
               <br />
               in the Acts of Parliament in reference to it, 
               <br />
               but, in spite of treaties and in spite of Acts 
               <br />
               of Parliament, French was the language principally 
               <br />
               used in oﬁicial documents in the Legislature. I 
               <br />
               have here, for instance, the Journals of the Legis- 
               <br />
               lative Assembly of 1844-45 containing a report made 
               <br />
               by a select Committee, of which Hon. Mr. Papi- 
               <br />
               neau was chairman, on the subject of the use of 
               <br />
               the French language, and although it is a little 
               <br />
               lengthy, I think it is of sufﬁcient importance to 
               <br />
               justify my reading it to the House. This is the 
               <br />
               address reported by that committee, which was 
               <br />
               unanimously adopted by both chambers of the
