               tion fifty-one ? My hon. friend (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Borden)</span> 
               <br />
               says that you have got to be careful, and you 
               <br />
               have to watch scrupulously the effect of each 
               <br />
               word contained in the British North America 
               <br />
               Act; that the British North America Act is 
               <br />
               a treaty between the different provinces. I 
               <br />
               agree with that. It was so stated at the time 
               <br />
               the British North America Act was introduc- 
               <br />
               ed by Lord Carnarvon in the House of Lords, 
               <br />
               and it has been since stated on two differ- 
               <br />
               ent cases by the Supreme Court of Canada. 
               <br />
               But What is the effect? The British North 
               <br />
               America Act is a treaty as between the four 
               <br />
               provinces which were parties to it at its i11- 
               <br />
               ccption; but it is also a treaty with respect 
               <br />
               to the provinces which came in afterwards, 
               <br />
               and if the four provinces which were parties 
               <br />
               to the British North America Act originally. 
               <br />
               accept other partners in the concern, they 
               <br />
               are bound by the terms and conditions upon 
               <br />
               which the other partners come in. They 
               <br />
               were free to modify the treaty. A treaty 
               <br />
               could not be modiﬁed by outside parties, but 
               <br />
               by those who were parties to it, and these 
               <br />
               parties can agree to modify the terms as 
               <br />
               they choose. Therefore, when the four ori- 
               <br />
               ginal provinces say to Manitoba : We agree 
               <br />
