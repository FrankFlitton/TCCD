               <br />
               importance to the constitution itself. What 
               <br />
               the constitution decides is to govern us. We 
               <br />
               have decided at diiferen‘t times that this is 
               <br />
               the best means of securing the settlement 
               <br />
               of the country and its contentment, and of

               opinions on the subject of religion in this

               Parliament, and I believe we decided right- 
               <br />
               ly. I see no reason why we should change 
               <br />
               that policy , I believe it is the proper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">polict</span> 
               <br />
               to pursue; but it is not a compact undu.

               <br />
               pact. It is a matter of policy, as a matter 
               <br />
               of policy we have supported it, and as a 
               <br />
               matter of policy it is attacked by the reso- 
               <br />
               lution which the hon. gentleman has pre- 
               <br />
               sented to the House to-day. If it was a 
               <br />
               constitutional rule inepe alable by this House 
               <br />
               the motion of the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) would amount to 
               <br />
               nothing; but everybody knows that if the 
               <br />
               motion of the hon. gentleman were adopted 
               <br />
               it would alter the policy we have pursued 
               <br />
               heretofore. which I believe we adopted in 
               <br />
               the public interest. When the people of 
               <br />

               <br />
               tories are sutﬁciently numerous to constitute 
               <br />
               a province, when in fact, they attain thei1 
               <br />
               majority in regard to local matters and 
               <br />
               when they propose to set up for themselves, 
               <br />
               this Parliament has no right to exercise con-

               <br />
               has no right to give commands. But we are

               not dealing with the future. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W’hen</span> the

               must decide for themselves whether they

               will have separate schools or not. I have

               <br />

               <br />
               after they have attained their majority. I 
               <br />
               think what we have before us is the Act of 
               <br />
               1875. Shall we amend it in this particular—— 
               <br />
               shall we go on as we are ? Mr. Speaker, I 
               <br />
               think we have difﬁculties enough without 
               <br />
               undertaking to create more, and I am per- 
               <br />
               fectly sure this will be an additional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one.</span> if 
               <br />
               we adopt the amendment of the hon. mem-

               <br />
               am satisﬁed we would govern this country

               is not in a position to ask us why this 
               <br />
               power ought not to be added. A my one 
               <br />
               who reads the powers which have been 
               <br />
               given to the provinces by the British North 
               <br />
               America Act and contrasts them with the 
               <br />
               powers which have been given by this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pare</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liantent</span> to the Legislature of the No1tl1- west 
               <br />
               Territories will perceive at a glance the 
               <br />
               diiference which exists in the treatment of 
               <br />
               the two cases, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerent</span> provinces as 
               <br />
               compared with the Territories. In the 
               <br />
               British North America Act the British Par- 
               <br />
               liament was dealing with provinces having 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy before the Act of 
               <br />
               Union, and the distribution of powers was 
               <br />
               simply to be a redistribution, in view of are 
               <br />
               fact that this Parliament was to he created 
               <br />
               and the Federal system to be established. 
               <br />
               In dealing with the Territories we were 
               <br />
               legislating from time to time for a country 
               <br />
               which was to remain, until provinces should 
               <br />
               be established under the legislative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cow</span> 
               <br />
               trol of this Parliament. And what share 
               <br />
               did we give to the Territorial Legislature in 
               <br />
