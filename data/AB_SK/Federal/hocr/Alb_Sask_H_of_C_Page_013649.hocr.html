               my hon. friend from North Norfolk (Mr.

               <br />
               gave a very strong expression of opinion in 
               <br />

               While financial embarrassments rather than 
               <br />
               constitutional aspirationshave led the North— 
               <br />
               west government and legislature to discuss the 
               <br />
               provincial status, I think that sufﬁcient prac- 
               <br />
               tical reasons can be given for the early estab- 
               <br />
               lishment of provincial institutions in the west. 
               <br />
               We have a rapidly growing population, much 
               <br />
               larger, as the census will show, than that of 
               <br />
               British Columbia ten years ago, and than 
               <br />
               that of Prince Edward Island to-day; a popu- 
               <br />
               lation trained to the exercise of powers of self- 
               <br />
               government falling a little short only of those 
               <br />
               enjoyed by the provinces. For nearly thirteen 
               <br />
               years the North-west legislative assembly has 
               <br />
               been occupied with founding local institutions 
               <br />
               and a body of laws suitable to the condition and 
               <br />
               circumstances of the country.

               Further on, the memorial, referring to

               The territories have arrived at a point, where 
               <br />
               by reason of their population and material de-

               <br />
               of a province have become necessary. I have 
               <br />
               already in former communications pointed out 
               <br />
               to you how our limited powers are still more 
               <br />
               limited by the reservation of subjects such as 
               <br />
               the Land Titles law, the administration of the 
               <br />
               criminal law and the control of the public do-

               main. It is undoubtedly in the interest of any 
               <br />
               province or provinces herafter to be establish— 
               <br />
