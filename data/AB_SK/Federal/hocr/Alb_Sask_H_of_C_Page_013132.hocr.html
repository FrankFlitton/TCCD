               exists among the various races, let them declare 
               <br />
               that the retention of the French language in 'the 
               <br />
               North-VVest is a measure in the interest of the 
               <br />
               country and let them reject this Bill. At the time 
               <br />
               of the organisation of the Territories, it was thought 
               <br />
               of importance to the erection 'and the peopling of 
               <br />
               the Territories that the use of the two languages 
               <br />
               before the courts and before the Legislature should 
               <br />
               be authorised. Nothing has occurred since to 
               <br />
               modify this position, The principle which the 
               <br />
               amendment lays down is a dangerous principle ; if 
               <br />
               it is good to leave to a Local Legislature the right 
               <br />
               to decide questions of this importance, touching 
               <br />
               the privileges granted to a whole race ; if it is good 
               <br />
               to grant this to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“’est</span> Territories, how 
               <br />
               can you refuse it to the Manitoba Legislature, 
               <br />
               which desires, in her turn, to enact the abolition 
               <br />
               of the French language? If it is pretended that 
               <br />
               the wish of the legislatures should be acceded to 
               <br />
               at Ottawa; if it is admitted that a legislature can 
               <br />
               decree the abolution of a right established and 
               <br />
               recognised, how will you be able to refuse the 
               <br />
               exercise of this right when the House of Commons 
               <br />
               is in question; how shall we be able to go to the 
               <br />
               foot of the throne and represent to the Queen and 
               <br />
               to Her Government that the use of the French

               by virtue of what principle do you oppose this 
               <br />
               decision? It is plain, Mr. Speaker, that if we

               wish, with success, to defend the rights of our 
               <br />

               our institutions, we should not allow him to lay 
               <br />
               down this principle, because if we admit the prin-

               <br />
               my own part—and I trust that I represent the 
               <br />
               opinions of no small number—I cannot support 
               <br />
               more strongly the amendment made by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin)—-although he has 
               <br />
               backed itin terms of great sympathy with the French 
               <br />
               language—than I can support the Bill itself. I do 
               <br />
               not Wish to give to a legislature, which has 
               <br />
               declared itself hostile, the right of decreeing, when 
               <br />
               it shall see ﬁt, that the French language shall cease 
               <br />
               to be spoken ofﬁcially in the North-West Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. I have heard the reasons given in support 
               <br />
               of the Bill and of the amendment. One of the 
               <br />
               reasons given is that the French population in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> is small in number. The French popu- 
               <br />
               lation of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> is about one to six, which 
               <br />
               is at least as great as the proportion of the English 
               <br />
               population of the Province of Quebec. And yet 
               <br />
               with what indignation would that person be re- 
               <br />
               ceived who would say : The population of English 
               <br />
               descent is small in numbers in the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec; it costs several thousands of dollars to 
               <br />
               translate the public papers into the two languages, 
               <br />
