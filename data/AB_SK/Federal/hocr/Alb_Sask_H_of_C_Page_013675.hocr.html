               should they not be as capable as others ? 
               <br />
               Whence come these people ? Many of them 
               <br />
               come from south of the American boundary 
               <br />
               line, as has been pointed out. These are 
               <br />
               people accustomed to representative insti- 
               <br />
               tutions, and they look for them in Canada, 
               <br />
               and will not be satisﬁed without them. 
               <br />
               Many were residents of eastern Canada, 
               <br />
               who enjoyed local autonomy dn the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces from which they came; and they 
               <br />
               will look for the same autonomy on the 
               <br />
               part of the community among whom they 
               <br />
               have settled, and will not be satisﬁed with- 
               <br />
               out it. We all know that the best immi- 
               <br />
               gration agent is the contented settler. And, 
               <br />
               unless we make these people feel that they 
               <br />
               are not dependent upon others, unless they 
               <br />

               their affairs who will be directly responsible
