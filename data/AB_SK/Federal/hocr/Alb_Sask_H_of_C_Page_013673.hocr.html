               This was the view of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Western Assiniboia last session, although I 
               <br />
               will admit that he was rather faint-hearted, 
               <br />
               lest he might embarrass the government of 
               <br />
               which he is a supporter. 011 the other hand, 
               <br />
               the lion. member for Alberta (Mr. Oliver) 
               <br />
               was rather more canny last session than 
               <br />
               this. and did not commit himself so much 
               <br />
               against autonomy; but still he stated that 
               <br />
               the great majority of the people were op- 
               <br />
               posed to it, and he himself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thought</span> it would 
               <br />
               be better not to have it until there was a 
               <br />
               larger population in that country, and they 
               <br />
               would draw a larger per capita allowance; 
               <br />
               whereas the hon. member for Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               (Mr. Davis) has both in this House and out 
               <br />
               of it taken such strong grounds that he has 
               <br />
               been taken to task not only by the press of 
               <br />
               western Canada, but by the independent 
               <br />
               press of eastern Canada for his opposition 
               <br />
               to provincial autonomy. So here we have 
               <br />
               a House divided against itself on this most 
               <br />
               important question, on which unanimity is 
               <br />
               required, at least on the part of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sup-7</span> 
               <br />
               porters of the government. It is not sur- 
               <br />
               prising, that the government should deny 
               <br />
               the people local autonomy when we have 
               <br />
               this diversity of opinion expressed in this
