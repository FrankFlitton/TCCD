               have a great deal more help than we have 
               <br />
               had in the Territories for creameries, and I 
               <br />
               think it is desirable that all that should be 
               <br />
               done by the local government. But how in 
               <br />
               the past, or}, how in the present, could the 
               <br />
               local government do it, when the grant to 
               <br />
               them is so contemptihly small and so utterly 
               <br />
               inadequate to the needs of the situation ? 
               <br />
               But if an adequate sum is given them, the 
               <br />
               local government, being on the spot, could 
               <br />
               attend to all needs. For instance, we know 
               <br />
               that in a vast area like the North-west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories we may have good crops in one 
               <br />
               part extending over hundreds <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oil,</span> thousands 
               <br />
               of square miles; and in another part we 
               <br />
               may have a failure of crops. Now, the pro- 
               <br />
               per government to deal with that question 
               <br />
               is the government of the North-west Terri- 
               <br />
               tories; but how could the government of 
               <br />
               the North-west Territories deal with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it“</span> 
               <br />
               when, up to the present, the amount <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doled‘</span> 
               <br />
               out to them has been weighed, as it were, 
               <br />
               in an apothecary’s scales with the utmost 
               <br />
               nicety, so as to measure it out as regards 
               <br />
               the admitted needs of these Territories ? 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, it was a great pleasure to me

               <br />
               ever side it may, that will be for the good
