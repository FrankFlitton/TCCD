               <br />
               the Hudson’s Bay and Rupert’s Land. It is a fact 
               <br />
               worthy of consideration, a fact which should not 
               <br />
               be overlooked, that, acting according to his instruc- 
               <br />
               tions, or applying simply the general laws which 
               <br />
               govern the relations between the conquerors and 
               <br />
               the vanquished, General Murray, the ﬁrst Governor 
               <br />
               of Quebec, used the French language in all his 
               <br />
               dealings with the King’s new subjects. I hold in 
               <br />
               my hand his proclamation, dated 1764, which 
               <br />
               enacts in what manner his future proclamations 
               <br />
               shall be published, and it is in French. General 
               <br />
               Carleton, afterwards Lord Dorchester, issued a pro- 
               <br />
               clamation in 1770, before the “Quebec Act,” in 
               <br />
               which he states that proclamations shall be made 
               <br />
               in English and in French. All the ordinances of 
               <br />
               the Quebec Gazette, which is made up chieﬂy of 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial documents, are printed in English and in 
               <br />
               French, from the date of its ﬁrst issue in 1764. 
               <br />
               Have I not reason to wonder, Mr. Speaker, that 
               <br />
               over one century ago we can ﬁnd such liberal ideas 
               <br />
               prevailing, in comparison with those of self-styled 
               <br />
               high-toned and hi h-minded gentlemen of this 
               <br />
               enlightened age? aking at a glance a general 
               <br />
               view of the policy of the British Government in 
               <br />
               this country, I am glad to say that I ﬁnd that it 
               <br />
               has always been most intelligent, most liberal, 
               <br />
               except for some period when the home 
               <br />
               Government was inspired by the misrepresenta- 
               <br />
               tions of some of their friends in Canada. 
               <br />
               I regret also that the hon. member should have 
               <br />
               thought ﬁt to bring in this Bill—which, according 
               <br />
               to the plan of campaign expounded in the press 
               <br />
               and in the public meetings of the Equal Righters, 
               <br />
               is the ﬁrst practical step in the hostile movement 
               <br />
               directed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against,</span> a people whose loyalty to the 
               <br />
               Crown and British institutions is above suspicion. 
               <br />
               I say that this is the ﬁrst step, because we all 
               <br />
               know that what is asked for in this Bill is only a 
               <br />
               small portion of what is desired. Judging from 
               <br />
               the utterances of the hon. member, outside of 
               <br />
               Parliament, we must expect blows to be directed 
               <br />
               at the Catholic minority of Ontario, of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               of the North—West Territories ; it is hoped 
               <br />
               for that the day will soon come when the 
               <br />
               Catholics and the French, if they wish to have 
               <br />
               schools of their own, will have to support them 
               <br />
               and also the public schools of those portions 
               <br />
               of the country. This Bill, therefore, is the initial 
               <br />
               step in a direction leading to all sorts of 
               <br />
               strife, is the ﬁrst step in the reversal of a generous

               British subjects enjoying all the privileges and

               <br />

               <br />

               few years ago it was suggested that a separate

               Later on it was likewise suggested that a special

               lunatic asylum should be constructed for Protest- 
               <br />
               ant patients, and the scheme is now bein carried 
               <br />
               out. The Protestants of Quebec are satis ed ; but, 
               <br />
               strange to say, they are taken to task by men like 
               <br />
               the promoter of the coercive legislation now pro- 
               <br />
               posed to this House, and are blamed for their being 
               <br />
               satisﬁed. People have been speaking of the power 
               <br />
               of the Catholic Church. Power from whom? My 
               <br />
               English Protestant friends, I suppose, do not pre- 
               <br />
               tend that the Roman Catholic Church extends its 
               <br />
               power over them; what, then, their grievances are, 
               <br />
               I am at a loss to know. But I would read here 
               <br />
               the opinion of a man who has been living all his 
               <br />
               lifetime in the Province of Quebec, of a man whose 
               <br />
               liters merit is onl equalled by the keen percep-
