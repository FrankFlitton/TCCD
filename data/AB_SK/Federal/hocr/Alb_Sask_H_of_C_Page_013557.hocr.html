               are dealing now with the grant to the

               North-west assembly for the purpose of 
               <br />

               <br />
               would not do our people any particular good 
               <br />
               this year if the House were to decide that 
               <br />
               full <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provincial</span> powers ought to be granted 
               <br />
               and at the same time allow the vote for the

               <br />
               in some measure, in a state of starvation. 
               <br />
               I think we should direct our attention, as 
               <br />
               I endeavoured to direct my remarks in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst instance, to the question of the vote 
               <br />
               and to providing this session for a consid- 
               <br />
               erable enlargement of it. Possibly, it would 
               <br />
               not be out of order to make the comparison 
               <br />
               of the vote for this service, a service for 
               <br />
               which this parliament is entirely respon- 
               <br />
               sible, and the votes for other services. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Alberta (Mr. Oliver) did 
               <br />
               make a comparison in one particular. I 
               <br />
               have taken the pains to copy the total 
               <br />
               ﬁgures devoted to some services voted for 
               <br />
               by parliament. I may say that, for fear 
               <br />
               some of our friends might say I was intro- 
               <br />
               ducing sectional questions, I have taken 
               <br />
               v-otes which apply to one part of this country 
               <br />
               as much as to any other. For penitentiar— 
               <br />
               ies. we spend a total of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$401,490,</span> consider- 
               <br />
               ably in excess of the amount deemed to be 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient for the whole purposes of the gov- 
               <br />

               <br />
               islation costs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$446,200,</span> entirely apart from 
               <br />
               the.indemnity paid to the members of par- 
               <br />
               liament. This is the amount it costs to 
               <br />
               manage these parliament buildings and sup- 
               <br />
               ply the printing in connection with the 
               <br />
               work of parliament. To the Agriculture De- 
               <br />
               partment we vote about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400,000,</span> apart 
               <br />
               from the vote for the taking of the census. 
               <br />
               Then, as my hon. friend from Alberta (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver) pointed out, we spend almost half 
               <br />
               a million dollars on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immigration.</span> That is, 
               <br />
               we spend fully as much to bring people 
               <br />
               into the North-west <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> as we spend 
               <br />
               for all their local needs after we get them 
               <br />
               there. Fisheries inspection costs $337,000, 
               <br />
               or almost as much as this Whole vote to 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Territories. The expense of 
               <br />
               looking after the Indians is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considerably</span> 
               <br />
               in excess of a million dollars. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And,</span> as the

               Douglas) remarked, we spend $417,000 for 
               <br />
               the education of Indian children, much more 
               <br />

               <br />
               similar to the item under discussion and

               that the administration of the government 
               <br />
               of the North-west Territories must have 
               <br />
               been carried on in a very excellent way in 
               <br />
               order to have given <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people any semb- 
               <br />
               lance of provision for the public service, 
               <br />
               seeing they have What seems to me a very 
               <br />
               meagre sum, considering the large number 
               <br />
               of people and the enormous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">territory</span> that 
               <br />
               has to be dealt with. It does seem that this 
               <br />
               service cannot, out of such a subsidy, be 
               <br />
               provided for quite as well as the people of 
               <br />
               the North-west have a right to expect 
               <br />
               having regard to the interests which have 
               <br />
               been mentioned by hon. gentlemen oppo- 
               <br />
               site. I am still not quite clear as to What 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from East Assiniboia (Mr. 
               <br />
               Douglas) means when he says that provin- 
               <br />
               cial autonomy would increase the burdens 
               <br />
               of the people. There are certain services 
               <br />
               to be provided for in the North-west. They 
               <br />
               must either be provided for by the people 
               <br />
               in that country themselves, or they must 
               <br />
               be provided for by all the people of the 
               <br />
