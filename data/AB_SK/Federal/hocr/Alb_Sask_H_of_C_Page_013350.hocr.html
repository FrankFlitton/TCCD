               <br />
               amount of money ought to be appropriated upon 
               <br />
               some principle such as was recognised in making 
               <br />
               an appropriation out of the revenue for the use of 
               <br />
               a Province, and it ought to be as absolutely under 
               <br />
               the control of the Legislature and its responsible 
               <br />
               executive as an appropriation that is made by this

               Parliament under the constitution is under the

               control of the Legislature of the Province to which 
               <br />
               it is made. It is impossible that the government 
               <br />
               of that country can be fairly carried on with the 
               <br />
               very small appropriation that is made, nor is it at 
               <br />

               population with the number of the people in any 
               <br />

               <br />
               we look at the fact that the Territories have no 
               <br />
               resources whatever except those received by direct 
               <br />

               <br />
               it is advisable to change the name of the country 
               <br />

               <br />
               Territories of Canada. The new name is not as 
               <br />
               convenient as the old one, because there are more 
               <br />
               words in it. The country has been for many 
               <br />
               years known as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Territories, and it 
               <br />
               will very likely continue to be so known despite 
               <br />
               this legislation changing its name. I question very 
               <br />
               much the propriety of making any change, and I 
               <br />
               move that we retain the old name, North-W'est

               <br />
               not use a name that is easily spoken, it will not be 
               <br />

               Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD. The name might 
               <br />
               be changed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Western</span> Territories. Objection has 
               <br />
               been taken to the word “ North” as conveying to 
               <br />
               the general public the idea of an arctic condition, 
               <br />
               that the country was not very like the American 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—\Vest,</span> but was further north, and possessed 
               <br />
               a more severe climate, a shorter summer and a 
               <br />
               longer winter, and for these reasons it was suggested 
               <br />
               to drop the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worr</span> “ North.”

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. BLAKE. It seems to me that the old name, 
               <br />
               after all, was not devoid of truth, and the change 
               <br />
               proposed will not alter the thermometer in winter 
               <br />
               or in summer in any way whatever. My impres- 
               <br />
               sion is that any announcement made to the world 
               <br />
               at large, and particularly to the immigrating public, 
               <br />
               with the view of persuading them that they are 
               <br />
               not going to cold winters in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Vest,</span> Will 
               <br />
               not have any effect on any sensible man.

               Mr. MILLS (Bothwell). These Territories have 
               <br />
               been designated by the present name for half a cen- 
               <br />
               tury, and are known to the geographical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">world</span> by 
               <br />
               that name, which we should retain. The name 
               <br />
               merely expresses its relation to the other portions 
               <br />
               of Canada. In 1787, the territories between the 
               <br />
               Ohio, Lake Erie and Mississippi, were called the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Vest</span> Territories of the United States, and 
               <br />
               they were so-called because of the geographical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">po.</span> 
               <br />
               sition of the territory to that embraced within the 
               <br />
               thirteen States of the Union. So I think those 
               <br />
               territories may very well retain the name of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—“Vest</span> Territories, considering their relation 
               <br />
               to the rest of Canada. This section would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span> 
               <br />
               quire to be somewhat altered so as to describe 
               <br />
               the Territory of Keewatin, and the north and west 
               <br />
               of the Province of Manitoba ; otherwise you have 
               <br />
               not a proper description.

               Sir JOHN A. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MACDONALD.</span> As to the name, 
               <br />
               I do not suppose there will be any serious quarrel 
               <br />
               about it. My hon. friend from Bothwell (Mr. 
               <br />
               Mills), as did my hon. friend from Algoma (Mr. 
               <br />
               Dawson), suggested that the description was in- 
               <br />
               accurate. My hon. friend said that Rupert’s 
               <br />
               Land was understood to be the land that lay to 
               <br />
               the south and south-east of Hudson Bay. If that 
               <br />
               is the case, the North-\Vest Territories, which 
               <br />
               was one time held under license, would be sup- 
               <br />
               posed to lie to the south-west of Rupert’s Land. I 
               <br />
               would suggest that the clause should be allowed to 
               <br />
