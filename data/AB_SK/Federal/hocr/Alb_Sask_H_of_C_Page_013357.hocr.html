               in this House, sitting on this side of the House, 
               <br />
               inveighed against the absence of representation

               their remoteness, the murmurs of complaint which 
               <br />
               came from that country, and we said it was abso-

               lutely essential there should be a safety-valve, at 
               <br />
               all events, for them, and guidance for ourselves. 
               <br />
               We did not indeed know then how extensive, or 
               <br />
               expansive, or expensive,that safety-valve would be; 
               <br />
               but we called for a safety-valve for them, for light 
               <br />
               and information for ourselves. We asked for it, 
               <br />
               we called for it, we pressed for it, we moved for it.

               Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT. I imagine 2 
               <br />
               cents per pound live weight would be an enormous 
               <br />
               increase in the heavy duty which the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man originally proposed. The average value of a 
               <br />
               hog could hardly exceed $6 or $8, so that this 
               <br />
               would be a duty of at least 50 or 60 per cent. It 
               <br />
               appears to me that this is practically a prohibitory 
               <br />
               duty, and a mischievous duty in every sense, inas- 
               <br />
               much as it will probably lead to a suspension of 
               <br />
               trade, and expose our people to retaliation. N ow, as 
               <br />
               far as the Province of Ontario is concerned, the 
               <br />
               practical result of this tax would be that, as we im— 
               <br />
               ported two live swine, our farmers would receive 
               <br />
               a protection to the extent of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4.</span>
