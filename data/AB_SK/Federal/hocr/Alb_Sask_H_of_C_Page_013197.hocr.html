               <br />
               one creed, or one man is not the foundation on 
               <br />
               which this Confederation can rest. There is but 
               <br />
               one foundation for it, that is, to give the fullest 
               <br />
               scope and the fullest sway to all those sentiments 
               <br />

               <br />
               causing a loss of pride. The hon. gentleman seems 
               <br />
               to think that all Canadians should be cast in 
               <br />
               the same mould. He is proud of his race, and he 
               <br />
               has every reason to be proud of it ; but, Sir, it 
               <br />
               does not follow that we should all be English- 
               <br />
               speaking Canadians, that we should all be merged 
               <br />
               in the Anglo-Saxon element. Certainly no one 
               <br />
               can respect or admire more than I do the Anglo— 
               <br />
               Saxon race ; I have never disguised my sentiments 
               <br />
               on that point ; but we of French origin are satisﬁed 
               <br />
               to be what we are, and we claim no more. I claim 
               <br />
               this for the race in which I was born, that though 
               <br />
               it is not perhaps endowed with the same qualities 
               <br />
               as the Anglo-Saxon race, it is endowed with 
               <br />
               qualities as great ; I claim for it that it is endowed 
               <br />
               with qualities unsurpassed in some respects ; I 
               <br />
               claim for it that there is not to-day under the sun 
               <br />
               a more moral, more honest or more intellectual race; 
               <br />
               and if the hon. gentleman came to Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               it would be my pride to take him to one of those 
               <br />
               ancient parishes on the St. Lawrence or one of its 
               <br />
               tributaries, and show him a people to whom, pre- 
               <br />
               judiced as he is, he could not but apply the words 
               <br />
               which the poet applied to those who at one time 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Sir, I claim no more than this is fairly due to 
               <br />
               my countrymen, and I say let the two races stand 
               <br />
               together, each with its own characteristics ; they 
               <br />
               will be all the more speedily united in the same 
               <br />
               aspirations towards a common object—British in 
               <br />
               allegiance and Canadian in sentiment. But, Sir, if 
               <br />
               you attempt to rend from one whatever is dear and 
               <br />
               sacred to it, instead of having peace and harmony, 
               <br />
               you will have ever increasing discord. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) the other 
               <br />
               day told us that it was in the interest of the French 
               <br />
               Canadians to become a part of the Anglo-Saxon 
               <br />
               race ; and proceeding to relate the achievements of 
               <br />
               that great race, both in war and peace, he almost 
               <br />
               asked permission from and apologised to the French 
               <br />
               Canadians for feeling proud of the British feats of 
               <br />
               arms on the Plains of Abraham, in the Bay of Tra- 
               <br />
               falgar, on the ﬁeld of Waterloo. Sir, my hon. friend 
               <br />
               needed not to apologise; his sentiments are quite 
               <br />
               natural to those who have the same blood as he has 
               <br />
               in his veins, and the cannot be offensive to 
               <br />
               anyone ; but I, who be ong to the race which was 
               <br />
               defeated in those battles, claim no permission to 
               <br />
               say that I lay no claim to that stoical hero- 
               <br />
               ism, if heroism it be, which can contemplate 
               <br />
               without a pang, even retrospectively, the defeat of 
               <br />
               one’s own race, though my judgment is clear 
               <br />
               that in two, at least, of those battles—that on the 
               <br />
               Plains of Abraham and that on the ﬁeld of Water- 
               <br />

               between England and France for the possession of 
               <br />
               this continent ; as I trace, page by page, the fatal 
               <br />
               climax, dim at ﬁrst, but gradually taking shape 
               <br />
               and becoming inevitable; as I follow the brave

               <br />
               retreating, even after victory, retreating into a 
               <br />
               circle made every day narrower and narrower ; as 
               <br />
               I come to the last page and the last struggle where 
               <br />
               that truly great man, the gallant Montcalm, found 
               <br />
               death with his ﬁrst defeat, I do not disguise from 
               <br />
               my fellow-countrymen of English origin that my 
               <br />
               heart is clenched and that my French blood runs 
               <br />
               colder in my veins. Talk to me not of your purely 
               <br />
               utilitarian theories ! men are not mere automatons ! 
               <br />
               It is not by trampling on the tenderest sentiments 
               <br />
               of the soul that you will ever accomplish your end 
               <br />
               if such an end you have in view. And yet it is 
               <br />
               in the name of British allegiance, it is with the 
               <br />
               apparent object of securing the future of this 
               <br />
               country, that this new policy is introduced—this 
               <br />
               so-called British policy which is at total variance 
               <br />
               with the policy ever followed by the British author- 
               <br />
               ities on this continent. This country had but a 
               <br />
               few years before passed under the régime of the 
               <br />
               English Crown, when the great conﬂict arose 
               <br />
               between England and her colonies to the south, 
               <br />
               which ended in the separation of those colonies 
               <br />
               from the mother land. England at once real- 
               <br />
               ised that, if she was to retain a foothold upon 
               <br />
               this continent, it was necessary for her to Win the 
               <br />
               affections of her new subjects, since she had lost 
               <br />
               the allegiance of those of her own kith and kin ; 
               <br />
               and that unless she made just concessions she could 
               <br />
               not hope to do so. In a just and generous spirit 
               <br />
               she made the concessions necessary to gain this 
               <br />
               object. To her new subjects she gave their laws, 
               <br />
               their language, and their religion, although at the 
               <br />
               time that very religion was subjected to many dis- 
               <br />
               abilities in England. Does not the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man who moved this Bill know, as everybody 
               <br />
               must know, that these timely concessions saved 
               <br />
               this colony to England? Does he not know that 
               <br />
               if the new subjects of England had joined the 
               <br />
               armies which Congress sent over to force Cana- 
               <br />
               dians into the movement of insurrection, the result 
               <br />
               would have been for Canada what it has been for the 
               <br />
               rebellious colonies—total separation. And the
