               member. Mr. Speaker. that early in the 
               <br />
               fourth century the capital of the Roman 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,Empire</span> was changed from the city of Rome. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘i</span> to Constantinople. \Ve ﬁnd at about the same 
               <br />
               time that Constantine, the Emperor of Rome, 
               <br />
               adopted the Christian faith. and that the 
               <br />
               :haugers-on of the Government and the great 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">razajority</span> of the priests of the old heathen 
               <br />
               religion boxed the compass and turned with 
               <br />
               him. That has been the rule from the time. 
               <br />
               of Constantine down to to-day. About. that 
               <br />
               time we find the whole Roman empire divid- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"ed</span> into metropolitan divisions. and a metro- 
               <br />
               politan placed over each of those divisions. 
               <br />
               The capital was removed from Rome to Con- 
               <br />
               stantinople. ‘We ﬁnd almost the only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">author-</span>

               ity existing in Rome to be the bishop of the 
               <br />
               church ; from that time dated the power of 
               <br />
               the church in Rome and its assumption of 
               <br />
               power in the Western Empire. During <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suc‘</span> 
               <br />
               ceeding years we ﬁnd various attempts made 
               <br />
               by the priests of the Christian Church to 
               <br />

               <br />
               Shortly after this time we ﬁnd the church 
               <br />
               ready to support the party prepared to pay 
               <br />
               the highest price for its support—just as 
               <br />
               we do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> The price to be paid for 
               <br />
               the support of the church has not changed 
               <br />
               from that day down to the present. In the
