               In the seventeenth paragraph of the report 
               <br />
               we are told, ‘ The basis of representation in the 
               <br />
               House of Commons shall be population, as de- 
               <br />
               termined by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> census every ten years; 
               <br />
               and the number of members at ﬁrst shall be 
               <br />
               194. Of this number Upper Canada is to have 
               <br />
               82. and Lower Canada 65—in all for Canada 147. 
               <br />
               The remainder of the 194 is distributed as fol- 
               <br />
               lows: Nova Scotia, 19; New Brunswick, 15; 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland,</span> 8; Prince Edward Island, 5—in 
               <br />
               all for the lower provinces, 47. By this ar- 
               <br />
               rangement it will be seen that Canada will 
               <br />
               have 100 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representatives</span> in the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons more than the aggregate of all the other 
               <br />
               colonies. Representation by population might 
               <br />
               be very well for Canada herself, but in a gen- 
               <br />
               eral union of the colonies it would operate in- 
               <br />
               juriously for the maritime provinces, as they 
               <br />
               could not expect to protect their interests when 
               <br />
               they would have to contend with 100 of a clear 
               <br />
               majority over their own representation. This 
               <br />
               principle would give the city of Montreal with 
               <br />
               its 101,000 inhabitants one representative more 
               <br />
               than this island. Quite different is the repre- 
               <br />
               sentation of Great Britain, for while London 
               <br />
               has about the same population as Scotland, that 
               <br />
               city has only 16 members in the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons, while Scotland has 53. But it may be 
               <br />
               argued that as our population increases our 
               <br />
               representation will increase. This is very 
               <br />
               doubtful. Indeed under the operation of the 
               <br />
               twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst clauses of the report 
               <br />
               it seems probable that we might lose our re- 
               <br />
               presentation altogether. Lower Canada is nl~

               <br />
               tion of the other colonies is to be arranged 
               <br />
               every ten years so as to give each the same 
               <br />
               ratio to population as she will then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possess.</span>

               Those speeches were made in 1865. In

               1866 the debate upon these resolutions was

               Another objection which I had to the union 
               <br />
               was that according to the scheme laid down in 
               <br />
               the report, representation in the House of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com’</span> 
               <br />
               mons is to be based upon population. Repre- 
               <br />
               sentation on that basis is as objectionable as 
               <br />
               applied to those other two provinces, does not 
               <br />
               render less so to Prince Edward Island. Upper 
               <br />
               Canada is a growing country and her population 
               <br />
               will rapidly increase; and as that increases, 
               <br />
               so, according to the Quebec scheme of repre- 
               <br />
               sentation, her representation in the federal 
               <br />
               House of Commons would increase, whilst that 
               <br />
               of Prince Edward Island would decrease. And, 
               <br />
               in fact, if the increase in the population of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and New Brunswick does not, in the 
               <br />
               future, grow more rapidly than it has in the 
               <br />
               past, they will also, if the plan be strictly car- 
               <br />
               ried out, be losers instead of gainers as res- 
               <br />
               pects legislative representation. Thus, as res- 
               <br />
               pects representation on the basis of population, 
               <br />
               the scheme appeared to me to be unjust to us, 
               <br />
               and I was therefore prepared to go against it ; 
               <br />
               and the result of our deliberations upon it in 
               <br />
               this House was its rejection by a large ma.- 
               <br />
               jority. I, for one, am not changed. I enter- 
               <br />
               tain the same objections to the scheme which 
               <br />
               I entertained then, and I am therefore glad to

               Representation by population is not fair as 
               <br />
               regards this country. Where there are large 
               <br />
