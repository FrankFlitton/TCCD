               wonder how the hon. member can pretend that the 
               <br />
               use of the French language is not fully recognised 
               <br />
               by the treaties and the ancient laws. I will not 
               <br />
               take up the time of the House in reading any of 
               <br />
               these statutes, but I will remark that the British 
               <br />
               North America Act virtually makes the English 
               <br />
               and French languages ofﬁcial in this country. 
               <br />
               Then we have the Act which erects the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\\'est</span> Territories and which establishes the use of 
               <br />
               the French language. Now, my hon. friend says 
               <br />
               that the perpetuation of a race is only possible by 
               <br />
               means of one language. I admit that there is a 
               <br />
               great deal in that, though I will not admit it fully. 
               <br />
               But inhis mind thelanguage is the essence of a nation. 
               <br />
               The second proposal is this : “ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“’e</span> have the right 
               <br />
               to destroy you French, and we will do it.” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'ell,</span> I 
               <br />
               wonder where he gets that right. Is it in Divine 
               <br />
               law, or human law, or in the jus <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentium?</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Per‘</span> 
               <br />
               haps he gets it out of some wicked hearts, as I do 
               <br />
               not know where else he could get it. I do not ﬁnd 
               <br />
               any source or trace for such a right. He says: 
               <br />
               “ Why do you get excited when I say that ‘2 I am 
               <br />
               calm," he says, “I am moderate, but you get ex- 
               <br />
               cited." Mr. Speaker, a big man may come to you 
               <br />
               and calmly say, “Please give me your money.” 
               <br />
               He may take a man by the throat and say, “Keep 
               <br />
               quiet and I will choke you ; ” and he will be calm, 
               <br />
               but he will not be just or right. It is perfectly 
               <br />
               astounding to hear the representatives of three or 
               <br />
               four millions say to the representatives of one 
               <br />
               million and a half, “ We are going to make you 
               <br />
               disappear, we are calm, be calm.” \Vell, a man 
               <br />
               who makes such proposals deserves simply to 
               <br />
               he laughed at, and that is the only answer I will

               <br />
               that when there are two or three, or four races

               <br />
               his neighbor, and it is for the good of the 
               <br />
               nation. Is it for the peace of the country? Sir, 
               <br />
               we have had the two languages here since 1760, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> have we had any trouble, have we had any 
               <br />
               fighting? In the United States they have only one 
               <br />
               language, it is true, but Within a century they have 
               <br />
               had a war that cost more lives and more money 
               <br />
               than any other war the world has seen during the 
               <br />
               last 400 years. I do not see that any good reason 
               <br />
               has been given for the use of one language only. 
               <br />
               At all events, if it is necessary, it is now too late 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> Say so. Confederation has gone into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect,</span> and 
               <br />
               if one language only was necessary we should have 
               <br />
               been warned of it before we entered Confederation. 
               <br />
               It is too late now to tell us that we want only one 
               <br />
               language, one nation. If we want to change the 
               <br />
               terms and condition of the charter, we shall have 
               <br />
               to begin over again. If we are not Willing to stand 
               <br />
               by the treaty that has been made, if we desire to 
               <br />
               change the conditions, then we shall have to begin 
               <br />
               at the beginning; because in law the consent of 
               <br />
               the parties is given upon certain facts, and when 
               <br />
               those facts are erroneous the convention is null and

               <br />
               and, as we had to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> it a name, we called it the 
               <br />
               National party. There is no more harm in calling it 
               <br />
               by that name than there is in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">callinr</span> our fiscal 
               <br />
               policy the National Policy. “'e ha&lt; a right 
               <br />
               to use the word National as other men in other 
               <br />
               countries use it. We chose that name, and since 
               <br />
               then that party has existed in the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec. It commands a majority in the Province, 
               <br />
               even although my hon. friend opposite (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) calls it a bastard party. I do not 
               <br />
               know anything regarding his domestic habits ; but 
               <br />
               I may tell him that, in our Province, if a man used 
               <br />
               such an expression, we would say that he had 
               <br />
               been very badly brought up ; and if he were to say 
               <br />
               that in a private house, he would be put out. I 
               <br />
               will not give the hon. gentleman any other reply, 
               <br />
               except the emphatic statement that our party is 
               <br />
               not bastard. It has for its parents, love of country 
               <br />
               and self-respect; but we would prefer that it 
               <br />
               should be bastard rather than it should have a 
               <br />
               father like the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy). It was under those circumstances 
               <br />
               that we broke away from our alle iance to our old 
               <br />
               chiefs. It pained me to leave t e ranks of those 
               <br />
               with whom I had been ﬁghting for twenty years; 
               <br />
               it was hard to give up all my old friends; 
               <br />
               but my conscience dictated my action, and I 
               <br />
               accepted the consequences. That party exists; 
               <br />
               and I must say to the hon. member for Iberville <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span> 
               <br />
               (Mr. Bechard) that, if he does not know it, he 
               <br />
               reminds me of the old Frenchmen who are still 
               <br />
               working for Napoleon L 
               <br />
