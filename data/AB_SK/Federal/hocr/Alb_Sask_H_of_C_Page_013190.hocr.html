               League ; but I thought I would wait till the con- 
               <br />
               clusion of the debate, when I was satisﬁed, from 
               <br />
               what my hon. friend said, that I would capture the 
               <br />
               whole Parti National en bloc. But I warn my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend the leader of the Government, 
               <br />
               who is not here at present, but I warn him through 
               <br />
               the members of the Cabinet who are here, that when 
               <br />
               that day arrives and I get the silver-tongued 
               <br />
               member for Quebec East (Mr. Laurier) to become 
               <br />
               a member of the Federation League, my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend will have to keep a sharp eye on me lest I 
               <br />
               fall a victim to the magic of my hon. friend oppo- 
               <br />
               site. As I have said we must try to make the 
               <br />
               best of our race differences. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               said he had the fullest conﬁdence in British fair 
               <br />
               play, British justice and British generosity, and I 
               <br />
               say he and his compatriots may have the fullest 
               <br />
               conﬁdence in British fair play, justice and generos- 
               <br />
               ity. The British people in Canada and in the 
               <br />
               Mother Country are as ready to mete out fair play, 
               <br />
               justice and generosity to-day as they have been in 
               <br />
               the past, and they will be in the future as they are 
               <br />
               to-day. That is my conviction. Because for my 
               <br />
               part, I will never believe that our French Canadian 
               <br />
               friends can be prevailed upon either by agitator 
               <br />
               or demagogue so far to do violence to the generous 
               <br />
               and chivalrous impulses which are so characteristic 
               <br />
               of their race, as to endeavor to convert those pri- 
               <br />
               vileges. which have been so lavishly conferred 
               <br />
               upon them iato a weapon to wound the hand that 
               <br />
               bestowed the boon. Therefore, I do not believe 
               <br />
               that any attempt will ever be made to interfere 
               <br />
               with those privileges. It is right that they 
               <br />
               should look with jealousy at any attempt to 
               <br />
               interfere with the constitutional privileges which 
               <br />
               have been conferred upon them, but, for my part— 
               <br />
               it may be my blindness—I cannot see how the 
               <br />
               proposal which is now before us will interfere with 
               <br />
               them. I am not speaking of the preamble of the 
               <br />
               Bill, I am speaking of the Bill itself. I take the 
               <br />
               position which was taken by the 188 last session, 
               <br />
               and I assume that the preamble is not an essential 
               <br />
               part of the Bill. I say the question with which we 
               <br />
               are now face to face is not one of interfering with 
               <br />
               the constitutional privileges of our French Cana- 
               <br />
               dian friends. It is rather a question whether we 
               <br />
               should continue to interfere with the natural pri- 
               <br />
               vileges of the British people in the North-West 
               <br />
               Territories, who have, by the voice of their Legisla- 
               <br />
               tive Assembly, asked us to relieve them of a 
               <br />
               burden which this House has imposed upon them. 
               <br />
               When they had no Legislative Assembly, this 
               <br />
               House, with the strong hand and in the exercise of 
               <br />
               its right, no doubt, if not of its wisdom, decreed 
               <br />
               that there should be dual language in the North— 
               <br />
               West Territories. At that time we had at least 
               <br />
               this excuse for what we did, that we had no 
               <br />
               authoritative information that what we did would 
               <br />
               be distasteful to the majority of the people 
               <br />
               there. Now we have the fact that the Legis- 
               <br />
               lative Assembly, which we felt bound to call 
               <br />
               into existence, has, by a practically unanim— 
               <br />
               ous vote, asked us to relieve them of the 
               <br />
               burden which we cast upon them. They say that 
               <br />
               they regard this as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a‘</span> burden, they say that they 
               <br />
               do not require dual language in the North-West 
               <br />
               Territories, they say that they regard it as burden- 
               <br />
               some and vexatious, and they ask us to remove 
               <br />
               the incubus which we have cast upon them. I do 
               <br />
               not see for my rt how we can refuse to accede to 
               <br />
               their request. 1: is perfectly useless, to my mind, to

               they ‘3 One was that it had been recommended by 
               <br />
               the British Parliament that the people of certain 
               <br />
               countries in Europe should be left to decide for 
               <br />
               themselves whether they should have a dual

               <br />
               language they should have as their ofﬁcial language. 
               <br />
               Well, the people of the North-West have told us 
               <br />
               their wishes ; and if he does not give effect to their 
               <br />
               expressed opinion upon this subject, he is going back 
               <br />
               upon this precedent which he has brought before 
               <br />
               the House. And what was the other ‘3 It was 
               <br />
               with reference to Poland, and the question was 
               <br />
               whether the Poles should be allowed fuller use 
               <br />
               of their own language in their own country. 
               <br />
               What in the world has that got to do with this 
               <br />
               question ‘3 If the N orth-VVest was a French settle-

               <br />
               our French Canadian friends in the North-West, 
               <br />
               these two precedents ‘ which have been brought 
               <br />
               forward by the hon. gentleman would have some 
               <br />
               bearing. But I venture to say—and I hope that 
               <br />
               he will not think me impertinent in saying so ; I 
               <br />
               suppose, insigniﬁcant as I am, I have a right to my 
               <br />
               opinion on the question— —but in my opinion, at least, 
               <br />
               his precedents have no bearing upon the questionat 
               <br />
               all, but are ratheranargument infavor of the conten- 
               <br />
               tion that the people of the North-West ought to de- 
               <br />
               cide this question, and that the opinion of the people 
               <br />
               of the N orth-West ought to be taken as conclusive 
               <br />
               on this question. Now, if there were a large number 
               <br />
               of ourFrench Canadianfriends in that country, even 
               <br />
               though they were not in a majority, I think it 
               <br />
               might be reasonable that we shoud stay our hands. 
               <br />
               But I want to ask, is there not some limit to this? 
               <br />
               Suppose there was only one French Canadian in 
               <br />
               the N orth-VVest, and a hundred thousand British 
               <br />
               people ; should we be called upon to establish a 
               <br />
               dual language in the North-West Territories, or to 
               <br />
               maintain it there ‘3 Well, then, it is a question of 
               <br />
               degree. The question is, whether there is such a 
               <br />
               population of our French Canadian friends there as 
               <br />
               to require the use of this ofﬁcial dual language, such 
               <br />
               a population as would make it worth our while to 
               <br />
               go right in the teeth of the almost unanimously ex-
