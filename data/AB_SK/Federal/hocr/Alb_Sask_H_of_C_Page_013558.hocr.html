               the subsidy to the Territories for ﬁve or six 
               <br />
               years. The same remark is true of the con-

               <br />

               six years, enormous sums of money have 
               <br />
               been, as I believe, spent unjustiﬁably and 
               <br />
               extravagantly. I have no doubt that if a 
               <br />
               proper system of administration had been 
               <br />
               adopted with regard to a great many of these 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
