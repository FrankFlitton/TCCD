               guarantee that they will be respected elsewhere; 
               <br />
               and the French population will come to ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               that they must place themselves in a position of

               <br />
               to me that all the statesmen in this House should 
               <br />
               hold out the hand to one another, and come to an

               Mr. DENISON. As the seconder of this Bill, 
               <br />
               it is only right that I should place on record my 
               <br />
               reasons for the course I intend to take. In ap- 
               <br />
               proaching this subject, I wish to say I have no 
               <br />
               feeling against my loyal fellow—subjects of French 
               <br />
               origin, or against the French language, and I 
               <br />
               would be only too glad if I could speak the French 
               <br />
               language well ; but Ithink it is not in the interests 
               <br />
               of the N orth-VVest Territories, or in the interests 
               <br />
               of Canada as a Whole, that we should adopt the 
               <br />
               French language or continue it in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> 
               <br />
               Territories. If it is decided by this House that it is 
               <br />
               Wise to have two languages in the North-VVest, 
               <br />
               the question which presents itself is, what other 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anguage</span> shall we choose in addition to English? 
               <br />
               Shall we choose French, German, Cree, Icelandic, 
               <br />
               01‘ Russian, or any other language. If we take the 
               <br />
               Population numerically, and adopt the language 
               <br />
               of the strongest in that sense, we would have to 
               <br />
               'Edopt, as was suggested by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Bothwell (Mr. Mills), the Cree language. In the 
               <br />
               early days up there, the English half-breeds spoke 
               <br />
               English and Cree, and the French half-breeds 
               <br />
               Spoke French and Cree, and the Cree language 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Was</span> the common language between them all. But, 
               <br />
               If We rule that language out, shall we adopt 
               <br />
               French or German? I understand that now the

               <br />
               in the N orth-VVest. I was in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> 
               <br />
               twenty years ago, in the year 1870. It was then a. 
               <br />
               Crown colony, or had been shortly before that. It 
               <br />
               was a British Crown colony, governed by the 
               <br />
               Hudson Bay Company, by means of a Governor and 
               <br />
               a Council. The Hudson Bay Company held that 
               <br />
               country from the time when they got their charter 
               <br />
               in 1670, until it was bought from them by the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion Government. It has been claimed by some 
               <br />
               that that is a French land ; in fact Bishop Grandin, 
               <br />
               in his letter which we have on the Votes and Pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings of the House, has claimed that it is French 
               <br />
               land, he speaks of it as “ our land.” I cannot see 
               <br />
               how he can claim anything of the kind because, as 
               <br />
               you all know, it has always been held by the Hudson 
               <br />
               Bay Company as a Crown colony under the direct 
               <br />
               authority of the British Government from the time 
               <br />
               of their charter. I would like to read a few lines 
               <br />
               from Hargrave’s Red River. On page 87 he says : 
               <br />
               “ With regard to the administration of justice, the 
               <br />
               laws of England of the date of Her Majesty’s accession, 
               <br />
               so far as they are applicable to the condition of the 
               <br />
               colony, are understood to regulate the judicial roceed- 
               <br />
               ings. The regulations passed by the CounCiI o Assim- 
               <br />
               bma are of the nature of by—laws.” 
               <br />
               And to show further, the interest that was taken in 
               <br />
               that colony by the British Government on more 
               <br />
               than one occasion, they found it necessary to send 
               <br />
               up troops to Red River colony, through a vast 
               <br />
               wilderness, by the Hudson Bay route up the N el- 
               <br />
               son River, and by a very long, harassing and 
               <br />
               tedious journey. On page 93 the same author says : 
               <br />
               “ For a space of time extending over 15 years a regular 
               <br />
               military force was quartered at Red River. In 18-16 a

               of Colonel Crofton. were ordered to the settlement, where 
               <br />
               they arrived in the autum of the same year. The entire 
               <br />
               party consisted of 18 ofﬁcers and 339 men. They reached 
               <br />
               their destination by way of York Factory on Hudson Bay, 
               <br />
               over the route between which point and the settlement 
               <br />
               they conveyed their guns and stores by the usual means 
               <br />
               of inland transport used in the country. They were sent 
               <br />
               out under secret instructions from the war ofﬁce. Colonel 
               <br />
               Crofton himself remained for only one year. at the close

               You will see, Mr. Speaker, by that, the interest 
               <br />
               that was taken in the N orth-VVest country, by the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government. You will see that there was 
               <br />
               no pretence then, that it was in any sense a French 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               eleven thousand, mostly half-breeds. As we know 
               <br />

               over the Canadian PaciﬁcRailway line this summer, 
               <br />
