               ing to say, when the Province of Manitoba was 
               <br />
               organised, it was not the Catholic or the French 
               <br />
               minority that was protected by the enactment, be- 
               <br />
               cause at that time the Catholics and the French 
               <br />
               were in the majority. Therefore, the laws 
               <br />
               which were passed in order to give a 
               <br />
               constitution to the Province of Manitoba, were 
               <br />
               passed with the View to protect the Protestant 
               <br />
               and English minority. To-day the reverse exists. 
               <br />
               The Protestant and English-speaking population 
               <br />
               has increased, so that now the minority is on the

               other side. \Vhat do we see now ‘? During the 
               <br />
               existence of the former state of things, did we 
               <br />
               ever see the majority attempt to take advan-

               tage of their position to take away the rights 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               do not render Her Majesty’s Government less desirous of

               the restoration of tranquillity under the authority of the 
               <br />
