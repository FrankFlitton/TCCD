               there has been any important change since

               then as to the number and the division of 
               <br />
               the schools. According to this report there 
               <br />
               were 210 Protestant public schools and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">34</span> 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic public schools: and when I

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speak</span> of the public school. it is the school of

               public schools and another set of separate 
               <br />
               schools; but there may be a Protestant 
               <br />
               public school in one locality. and a Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic public school in the adjoining local~

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now.</span> I cannot ﬁnd that there are in the
