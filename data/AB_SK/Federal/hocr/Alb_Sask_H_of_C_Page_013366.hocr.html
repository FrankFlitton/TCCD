               much prefer a system of education which would be

               essentially a religious system. Unfortunately, under

               <br />

               <br />
               lished schools, by means of which it has sought 
               <br />
               in various ways to extend its inﬂuence politically 
               <br />
               or otherwise, and has never been content to 
               <br />
               stand in the position in which it was placed by the

               provinces it has extended its power until in Ontario 
               <br />
               there is a very general determination,which to some 
               <br />
               extent has been carried out, that that body shall

               <br />
               is placed in the British North America Act. I 
               <br />
               shall simply content myself on the prCSent occasion 
               <br />
               with contending that as regards this question of 
               <br />
               restriction imposed by section 9 of the present Act- 
               <br />
               it should be removed, and the Assembly should be 
               <br />
               given power and control over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">education,</span> and no 
               <br />
               restriction should be imposed by this legislation as 
               <br />
               to whether separate schools shall be established in 
               <br />
               the North-\Vest Territories or not. I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro</span> 
               <br />
               pose to enter into the question as to whether it is 
               <br />
               advisable to have a separate school system, but I 
               <br />
               confine myself to the contention that this Assembly 
               <br />
               should have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power.</span> to deal with the question. I 
               <br />
               go further, and say that as this Act makes no special 
               <br />
               reference to education, and as before very long 
               <br />
               there will be another opportunity of dealing with 
               <br />
               this question, and taking up the whole subject of 
               <br />
               education, which is virtually not taken up by this 
               <br />
               Act, and as noparticular harm can result from post-- 
               <br />
               poning the question for a short time, I will not 
               <br />
               at the present time go further than to say that 
               <br />
               I trust the Government will take the subject 
               <br />
               into its serious consideration, and will decide, 
               <br />
               in view of all the circumstances of the case, 
               <br />

               <br />
               trol over education. It maybe said there are no 
               <br />
               petitions from the North-West Territories asking 
               <br />
               for this. I think we have had some evidence that 
               <br />
               there is a strong feeling on the subject, but even

               for giving more extensive powers or for creating 
               <br />
               separate provinces for, very probably, a good many 
               <br />
               years to come. And, Sir, what will be the posi-

               tion of those who may then be prepared to con- 
               <br />
               tend, as I contend now, that this subject should be 
               <br />
               (.lealt. with by the Provincial Assembly? Why, 
               <br />
               Sir, we shall have the cry that has been raised so 
               <br />
               often in reference to this question, as well as to 
               <br />
               kindred questions in the Dominion of Canada: we 
               <br />
               shall have the cry that those who were in favour 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sepa‘ate</span> schools have had them established by 
               <br />
               law, that they have been existing for so many 
               <br />
               years, that a vested right has been created in them, 
               <br />
               and that this right ought not to be set aside. The 
               <br />
               difficulty placed upon those who feel as I do on this 
               <br />
               questionwill be very greatly increased if we allow 
               <br />
               this period of time to elapse without removing the 
               <br />
               restriction imposed by the 9th section of the Act 
               <br />
               to which I refer. I say that for this reason this 
               <br />
               restriction ought to be removed before this system 
               <br />
               becomes finally established in the North-\Vest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories I think the proposition is a reasonable one; 
               <br />
               I think it is a proposition which the Government 
               <br />
               ought to accede to, and it is a preposition which I 
               <br />
               hope they will accede to. I hope that now when they 
               <br />
               are establishing this principle, giving these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exten-</span> 
               <br />
               sive powers to this Assembly, they will give them 
               <br />
               the power of saying whether or not there shall be 
               <br />
               separate schools in the territories, if they are 
               <br />
               to have the subject of education in their hands at 
               <br />
               all. I repeat again that this is a reasonable pro- 
               <br />
               position ; it is a proposition which the Government 
               <br />
               ought to accede to, and it is a proposition which I 
               <br />
               hope they will accede to. However, under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ekisting</span> 
               <br />
               circumstances, I do not wish at this period of 
               <br />
               the session to raise a debate which probably would 
               <br />
               create a- good deal of angry feeling, and which an— 
               <br />
               doubtedly would produce a discussion which, con- 
               <br />
               sidering the many pressing matters now before the . 
               <br />

               <br />
               tration, it is desirable to avoid if possible. And 
               <br />
               I venture to say, in speaking on this subject, that I 
               <br />
               am giving expression, not only to my own Opinion, 
               <br />
               but to the opinion of many other members of this
