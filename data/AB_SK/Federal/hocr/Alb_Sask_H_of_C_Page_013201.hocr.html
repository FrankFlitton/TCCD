               <br />
               body of the nation, composed of the two races, come

               closer together and know each other better, I have 
               <br />
               no doubt that friction of races here will be as rare 
               <br />
               as it is in Switzerland after hundreds of years of

               that I do not trouble myself with such considera- 
               <br />
               tions as to a dim and distant future. The only 
               <br />
               thing which troubles me at this moment is, to keep 
               <br />
               peace and harmony in this land, and not have peace 
               <br />

               <br />
               securing the future against feuds and contentions. 
               <br />
               I have great pleasure in telling the hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mane—and</span> I am sorry he is not present—that, in my 
               <br />
               judgment, the English language is to-day and must 
               <br />
               be for several generations, perhaps for several 
               <br />
               centuries, the commanding language of the world. 
               <br />
               So long as the centre of civilisation was on the basin 
               <br />
               of the Mediterranean, three languages in succession 
               <br />
               held sway : the Greek, the Latin and the French. 
               <br />
               At the end of the seventeenth century the French 
               <br />
               language was undoubtedly the dominating language 
               <br />
               of civilisation, It is still the language of diplomacy, 
               <br />
               the vehicle of communication for international ex- 
               <br />
               change in the higher productions of the human 
               <br />
               mind, but it is no longer the language of the many. 
               <br />
               That position now belongs to the English language. 
               <br />
               That revolution has been accomplished by the 
               <br />
               wonderful development of the Anglo-Saxon race 
               <br />
               during the eighteenth and in the nineteenth 
               <br />
               centuries. That race have carried their language 
               <br />
               with them in their emigration around the world, 
               <br />
               and now it is the language of more than 100,000,000 
               <br />
               of people scattered over Europe, Africa, Am- 
               <br />
               erica, Asia, and the islands and continents of the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Ocean. Sir, the very fact that the English 
               <br />
               language is to-day the dominating language of this 
               <br />
               continent of America, makes it imperative on 
               <br />
               French Canadians, although they will retain their 
               <br />
               language, to learn and speak English. Nothing 
               <br />
               was more appropriate, more wise than the words 
               <br />
               that fell a few days ago from the junior member 
               <br />
               for Ottawa (Mr. Robillard). The French Canadian 
               <br />

               <br />
               tion to his son does not do justice to his child, 
               <br />
               because hecompels him to stand back in the hard 
               <br />
               struggle for life. I would say more. It is im-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perative</span> for us French Canadians to learn English,

               Canadian friends, it would be that they would do 
               <br />
               well to learn French too. The English are a proud 
               <br />
               race ; but the Romans were a proud race also ; 
               <br />
               and after they had conquered the world, a Roman 
               <br />
               acknowledged that the education of his son was 
               <br />
               not complete unless he was as familiar with Greek 
               <br />
               letters as he was with Latin letters. Perhaps, 
               <br />
               however, my hon. friend for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) would not admit such an example for 
               <br />
               himself or the people of this country, because the 
               <br />
               object of my hon. friend is not simply to remove 
               <br />
               the use of the French language in the North- 
               <br />
               West Territories and from every legislative hall in 
               <br />
               Canada, but his object is to prevent the teaching of 
               <br />
               French in the schools of Ontario. There are to-

               endorsed every word of it. This is what he said :

               minion, I heartily endorse the sentiment which the meet- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               children, either French, anadian or English, in any other 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ippgl’rage</span> than the language of the country in which we 
               <br />
               Is this really the measure of my hon. friend ? We 
               <br />
               always knew him to be a restrictionist, but not to 
               <br />
               that extent, I am sure ; we always knew him to be 
               <br />
               a restrictionist in trade, but he is a restrictionist 
               <br />
               even in knowledge. If the hon. gentleman, on that 
               <br />
               occasion, had said that the people of Ontario would 
               <br />
               insist that English should be taught in all their 
               <br />
               schools, I would raise both my hands in favor of it. 
               <br />
               But that is not enough ; not only must English be 
               <br />
               taught, but he objects to any other language being 
               <br />
               taught in Ontario schools. Can it be that an hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman possessing the attainments, power and 
               <br />
               ability of my hon. friend should stoop to 
               <br />
               things so low? It is a thing low, and vile, and 
               <br />
               contemptible, to say that the people of Ontario, 
               <br />
               Whatever be their creed or their origin, shall not 
               <br />
               have the right to teach a second language to their 
               <br />
               children if they choose. Men are not usually 
               <br />
               wantonly cruel ; men do not, as a rule, pur- 
               <br />
               posely degrade their lives, and what is the 
               <br />
               reason, I want to know, which impels my hon. 
               <br />
               friend to use such language as that ? Sir, 
               <br />
               the reason is, that Tories of the stamp of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend never can bring themselves up to the point 
               <br />
               of trusting the better instincts of the human heart ; 
               <br />
               they never can divest themselves of the base notion 
               <br />
               that, if they treat their opponents <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> generosity 
               <br />
               or with justice, their opponents will abuse the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privi-</span> 
               <br />
               lege. They can never divest themselves of the

               base notion that, if the French Canadians are to be 
               <br />
               allowed their language and their characteristics as 
               <br />
               a race, they will turn traitors as a race. They 
               <br />
               want to make this country British in the same 
               <br />
               manner they have tried to make Ireland British. 
               <br />
               For the last seven hundred years, En lish states- 
               <br />
               men have attempted to make Ireland ritish, not 
               <br />
               by justice, not by generosity, not by appealing to 
               <br />
               the better instincts of the generous hearts of that 
               <br />
               people, but by every form of violence and cruelty. 
               <br />
               They have proscribed her religion, they have 
               <br />
               killed her agriculture, they have destroyed her 
               <br />
               commerce, they have done everything to degrade the 
               <br />
               land and the people. And with what result ? With 
               <br />
               the result of making Ireland a thorn in the side 
               <br />
               of England, with the result of ﬁlling the heart of 
               <br />
               the people of Ireland with bitterness against 
               <br />
               England. Sir, Mr. Gladstone has done more in 
               <br />
               ﬁve years to make Ireland British than English 
               <br />
               statesmen have done for seven hundred years before.
