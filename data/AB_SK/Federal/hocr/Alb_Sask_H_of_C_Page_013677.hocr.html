               <br />
               collection serves me, he informed the House 
               <br />
               that the printed return had been received 
               <br />
               by him from the legislative assembly at

               It is regrettable that this important discus-

               sion should have been delayed until this 
               <br />
               late stage of the session, when, for about 
               <br />
               three months, from the beginning of May to 
               <br />
               the end of July, this House was simply 
               <br />
               marking time. However, I am gratiﬁed to 
               <br />
               hear the expressions from the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition and from my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Marquette (Mr. Roche) following so closely 
               <br />
               the expressions which I gave voice here 
               <br />
               two years ago at the ﬁrst opportunity I had, 
               <br />
               and again last year. I think, owever, 
               <br />
               that the people of the North-west Terri— 
               <br />
               tories would have more conﬁdence in our 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">k‘eenness</span> were not made so open to suspicion. 
               <br />
               It is plain that the opposition is best pleased 
               <br />
               when the welfare of the North-west appears 
               <br />
               to be threatened. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“’11,"</span> the hon. member for

               to throw doubt upon a denial that was made

               here less than a month ago by the Minister

               <br />
               was represented as holding out a threat that 
               <br />
               the North-west lands were to be sold and 
               <br />
               that this government was to continue the 
               <br />
               insane and iniquitous policy pursued by 
               <br />
               previous governments, and that they were

               said, and I understood him to say that no

               The hon. member for Marquette seems to

               of the Prime Minister made a couple of

               weeks ago, and tried to give it a distorted

               that provincial autonomy would not be 
               <br />
               granted for many years to come. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister states to—night that he did 
               <br />
               not mean that the people of the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories were to be left for years with-

               put in a position ﬁnancially to carry out its 
               <br />
               duties, then there is no complaint to be made 
               <br />
               on behalf of the people of that country, and 
               <br />
               very little complaint would be made by the 
               <br />
               legislature of that country. Speech after 
               <br />
               speech made by Mr. Haultain could be 
               <br />
               quoted to that effect. Therefore, if we are 
               <br />
               able to show that in this present year the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial needs of the North-West Terri- 
               <br />
               tories are being met we will go far to show 
               <br />
               that the urgency for provincial autonomy 
               <br />
               is removed for the time being. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) raised 
               <br />
               a query respecting the attitude of the North- 
               <br />
               west goverument with regard to the capital 
               <br />
               advance of $250,000 voted by parliament. It 
               <br />
               would be a matter of great surprise to me to 
               <br />
