               hon. and learned friend the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               quoted it last year to prove that certain views, 
               <br />
               which had been quoted from a review by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, had not been acknowledged or accepted as 
               <br />
               the views of a certain section of the Christian Church. 
               <br />
               That, as I remember, was the way it was used ; 
               <br />
               but if it was made an authority last year impro- 
               <br />
               perly, that would be no reason for repeating the 
               <br />
               error. Then my hon. friend quoted from the 
               <br />
               Catholic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">World—to</span> prove what? To prove that the

               French Canadian is hostile to and is parting 
               <br />
               company with the English. Well, my hon. friend 
               <br />
               knows very well a large class—a class for which I 
               <br />
               have the greatest possible respect ; my own blood, 
               <br />
               I suppose, ﬂows in their veins—exists which have 
               <br />
               not the same regard for England that I have. He 
               <br />
               knows very well that the people for whom the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholic</span> World is written are people who would 
               <br />
               like to hear that certain sections of the British 
               <br />
               Empire were hostile to its ﬂag ; and to quote that 
               <br />
               as an authority seems to me an extraordinary 
               <br />
               thing. But, as the hon. gentleman was looking 
               <br />
               for reviews, there is a review—I do not know 
               <br />
               whether it came into his hands—which is one of 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst reviews of the world. I refer to the

               <br />
               and headed, “ Language as a Political Force.” 
               <br />
               On page 175, Mr. Hale says :

               <br />
               where, that the acquisition of the North-West was 
               <br />
               not a losing speculation. Is there a man in the 
               <br />
               country who feels the cost of the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway? Is there a man in the country who ob- 
               <br />
               jects to the cost of that railway.

               Mr. DAVIN. Except some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dreaming</span> pessim- 
               <br />
               ists ‘? Look at the increased wealth, in the 
               <br />
               last seven years, of Montreal; look at the 
               <br />
               increased wealth of Toronto; look at the in- 
               <br />
               creased wealth of the manufacturing towns in 
               <br />
               Ontario ; look at the extension of manufactures in 
               <br />
               Ontario ; look at the fact that merchants and manu- 
               <br />
               facturers tell me that the N orth-West is a magni- 
               <br />
               ﬁcent customer to Ontario. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               goes on to say something about the depreciation in 
               <br />
               the value of farms. I have looked into the reports 
               <br />
               of Mr. Blue, and I know he generally takes a gloomy 
               <br />
               View of things, but he does not say that the farms 
               <br />
               of Ontario have depreciated in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">value.</span> We know 
               <br />
               that, as farms grow old—and they are not always 
               <br />
               cultivated as they should be here——they cannot be 
               <br />
               expected to be kept up to their original value ; but 
               <br />
               I do not think the utterances of the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man on this subject were the utterances of 
               <br />
               a statesman. Look at the fact that the North- 
               <br />
               VVest has been opened up, that we have a vast 
               <br />
               railway there ; that we have farms there to which 
               <br />
               our children can be sent; that we raise wheat 
               <br />
               in the North-VVest, of which I have aspecimen 
               <br />
               here, the like of which cannot be produced in any 
               <br />
               other part of Canada. I have specimens of wheat 
               <br />
               which have been grown near Regina, Moose Jaw 
               <br />
               and other parts of the district which I have the 
               <br />
               honor to represent, and nine-tenths <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(if</span> all that 
               <br />
               wheat have been graded No. 1 Hard from year to 
               <br />
               year. Is not that an acquisition of wealth to this 
               <br />
               country? If the hon. gentleman were right, we 
               <br />
               might apply to his statement Horace’s illustration 
               <br />
               where he speaks of plucking one hair after another 
               <br />
               out of a horse’s tail. If this N orth—VVest country 
               <br />
               is‘of no value, of course the more you diminish the 
               <br />
               size of Canada itself, by a parity of reasoning, the 
               <br />
               richer it will become. This is one of those 
               <br />
               utterances which, I think, are inexcusable 
               <br />
