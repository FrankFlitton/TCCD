               statesman’s point of view. This Bill may be wrong, 
               <br />
               it may be that the Bill ought to be rejected, but 
               <br />
               there can be no justiﬁcation for sending it to the 
               <br />
               people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“rest</span> to be dealt with. I deny

               that I have gone back upon any views that I have 
               <br />
               advocated in regard to provincial rights. If the 
               <br />
               people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lN'orth-IVest</span> did not wish to have 
               <br />
               this measure passed, we might postpone it at the 
               <br />
               present time, but the people have shown that they 
               <br />
               are in favor of it, and every newspaper in the 
               <br />
               N orth-VVest—excepting always the Regina Leader 
               <br />
               —has spoken <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in\favor</span> 0f the abolition of the dual 
               <br />
               language. I cannot look upon the Regina Leader 
               <br />
               as an authoritative representative of public opinion 
               <br />
               in the North-West. We know that the Re ina 
               <br />
               Leader occupies a peculiar position in regar to 
               <br />
               the existing state of affairs in the North-VVest. I 
               <br />
               am told—I may be wrong—I do not connect it 
               <br />
               with any hon. member of this House, but I 
               <br />
               am told that it was owing to the fact that the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant Governor of the North-West insisted 
               <br />
               upon giving to the Regina <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Leader</span> the printing of 
               <br />
               that Government at a higher rate than it could be 
               <br />
               done for elsewhere, that the deadlock was brought 
               <br />
               about in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Vest</span> Council, that the Lieu- 
               <br />
               tenant Governor’s advisers refused to agree to 
               <br />
               that, and then resigned. Of course, the longer the 
               <br />
               dual language is preserved, the better it is for the 
               <br />
               publisher of the Regina Leader, and, therefore, I do 
               <br />
               not think that the Regina <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Leader</span> is to be quoted 
               <br />
               as an authority on this question. Putting the 
               <br />
               Regina Leader aside, we have the unanimous opin- 
               <br />
               ion of the press of the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orthWest,</span> as we have the 
               <br />
               opinion of the people of the North~West, that they 
               <br />
               do not want the dual language. Why should we

               it can then be debated Whether it is for us here or 
               <br />

               if the amendment of the hon. gentleman is carried, 
               <br />
               it is away to do this little Bill to death, instead of

               the desire of the great majority of the people of the

               <br />
               the better. It is a question which is calculated to

               disturb us on a question of race cleavage. That 
               <br />
               alone should be a reason for dealing with the 
               <br />
               matter now. Does the House suppose that, if the 
               <br />
               Bill is defeated, whether upon the amendment of 
               <br />

               <br />
               any way end the question? Can any one imagine 
               <br />
               that, if I stand alone with my seconder in voting for 
               <br />

               certain hon. gentlemen profess to lament will not be 
               <br />
               brought up again ? Is it not in the interest of the

               <br />
               in such a manner as to be as satisfactory to the

               political extinction has been prophesied by hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on both sides of the House. If that be 
               <br />
               my fate, in doing what I consider to be my duty, 
               <br />
               I shall cheerfully submit to it. I am acting simply 
               <br />
               according to my convictions, and not only as one 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has suggested, because of the 
               <br />
               debate of the Jesuits’ Estates Act. I wonder that 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman should not have had better 
               <br />
               judgment than to introduce that question into 
               <br />
               this .debate. I have nothing to be ashamed of, I 
               <br />
               have nothing to lament in regard to the vote 
               <br />
               which I gave on the Jesuits’ Estates Act. I did 
               <br />
               not prosecute any agitation on that subject after- 
               <br />
               wards, because I realised that the vote of this 
               <br />
               House in regard to it was conclusive ; but it is not 
               <br />
               conducive to harmony in the party to which I did 
               <br />
               belong and to which, to a certain extent, I still 
               <br />
               belong, that an hon. gentleman should taunt me 
               <br />
               for the ﬁasco which he says was the end of 
               <br />
               that matter. I have been taunted with the 
               <br />
               statement that I objected to the preamble of 
               <br />
               the Jesuits’ Estates Act, and yet I was 
               <br />
               making nothing of the preamble to this Bill. 
               <br />
               There again the two matters are Wholly and ab- 
               <br />
               solutely separate. In the Jesuits’ Estates Act we 
               <br />
               had to take the Bill as it was, we had no power of 
               <br />
               amendment. It came to this House and it had 
               <br />
               either to be vetoed as it was, or allowed to go into 
               <br />
               operation as it was ; Whereas a Bill introduced in- 
               <br />
               to this House has to under 0 the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gauntlet,</span> of the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst, second and third re ings, of a consideration 
               <br />
               in committee, to be amended and improved to suit 
               <br />
               the opinions of the majority of the House. There- 
               <br />
               fore, there is nothing in common between the two 
               <br />
               cases. But, as I said before, those who voted with 
               <br />
               me on that question had nothing to regret, and I
