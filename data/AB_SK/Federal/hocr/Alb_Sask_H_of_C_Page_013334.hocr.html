               making to Parliament, the Bill I have had the 
               <br />
               honor to ask leave to introduce, is an unnecessary 
               <br />
               measure, and will no doubt be so received and 
               <br />
               dealt with by this House. But in my judgment it 
               <br />
               is by no means an unimportant matter. On the

               <br />
               said and done, I think it will be found that nations

               and races are distinguished and are distinctive 
               <br />

               <br />
               refers to Switzerland or to the Swiss. When the

               proper time comes for the discussion of this Bill, 
               <br />

               if his view were correct, adopt the rule from the

               eral languages in Switzerland is an exception to 
               <br />

               “ And now, having ruled that races and nations,though 
               <br />
               largely formed by the working <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oflan</span> artiﬁcial law, are 
               <br />
               still real and living things, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">groups</span> in which the idea of 
               <br />
               kindred is the idea around whic everything has grown, 
               <br />
               how are we to deﬁne cur races and Our nations? How 
               <br />
               are we to mark them off one from the other? Bearing 
               <br />
               in mind the cautions and qualiﬁcations which have been 
               <br />
               already given, bearing in mind large classes of excep- 
               <br />
               tions which will presently be spoken <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> I say unhesitat- 
               <br />
               ingly that for practical purposes there is one test, and one 
               <br />
               only, and that test is language. We may at least apply 
               <br />
               the test negatively. It might be unsafe to rule that all 
               <br />
               speakers of the same language have a common nation— 
               <br />
               ality, but we may safel say that, where there is not 
               <br />
               ccmmunit ' of language. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> is no common nationality 
               <br />
               in the big est sense. As in the teeth of community of 
               <br />
               language there may be what for all political purposes are 
               <br />
               separate nations, so without community of language 
               <br />
               there may be an artiﬁcial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nationality,</span> a nationality 
               <br />
               which may be good for all political pur oses, and which 
               <br />
               may engender a common national fee ing, still, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this.</span> is 
               <br />
               not uite the same thing as that fuller national unity 
               <br />
               whic is felt where there is community of language. In 
               <br />
               fact, mankind instinctively takes language as the badge 
               <br />
               of nationality. We so far take it as the badge that we 
               <br />
               instinctively <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assrime</span> community <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> lan age as a nation 
               <br />
               as the rule, and we set down anything t at departs from 
               <br />
               that rule as an exception. The ﬁrst idea suggested by 
               <br />
               the word Frenchman, or German, or any other national 
               <br />
               name, is that he is a man who speaks French pr German 
               <br />
               as his mother tongue. We take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> granted, 1p the ab- 
               <br />
               sence of anything to make us think otherWIse, that a 
               <br />
               Frenchman is a Speaker of French, and that a Speaker of 
               <br />
               French is a Frenchman.”
