               <br />
               not help thinking of the cartoon in which asinged cat

               was depicted as hissing and spitting at a great

               the hon. member for West Durham, exalted as is

               <br />
               particulars, I cannot follow him in the speech he 
               <br />
               addressed to this House a few nights ago. It is 
               <br />
               not my fault, but my misfortune, and no one 
               <br />
               regrets it more than I, that the constituency 
               <br />
               which I have the honor to represent did not send 
               <br />
               a gentleman of greater ability and of more astute 
               <br />
               mind to follow the hon. member for West Durham 
               <br />
               in the vote he proposes to give, and in the language 
               <br />
               he addressed to this House. But I shall refer to his 
               <br />
               remarks a few minutes later, when I come to that 
               <br />
               portion of my speech. For the present I wish to 
               <br />
               refer to the remarks addressed to this House last 
               <br />
               night by the hon. the Minister of Justice. It is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> with pride and pleasure that I see that hon. 
               <br />

               <br />
               delight that I look forward to a literary treat when 
               <br />
               I see he intends to speak ; and it was with pleasure 
               <br />
               that I saw him rise to move, as he did move, the

               amendment which is now before the House. But 
               <br />
               I confess to a feeling of great disappointment when 
               <br />
               he sat down ; I confess that my idol was struck to 
               <br />
               the ground, because we found that the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice had actually swallowed himself ; that he, who

               <br />
               was of the greatest possible importance. In the

               by the hon. the Minister of the Justice, when it 
               <br />
               appeared to be his purpose to minimise the import- 
               <br />
               ance of a preamble to an Act. But it will be in 
               <br />
               the recollection of hon. members that, on that 
               <br />
               occasion, the preamble was made, by a special 
               <br />
               enacting clause, part and parcel of the Act itself ; 
               <br />
               and, therefore, it was that some hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               men opposed, as I did, the Act, because the pre- 
               <br />
               amble which was made a part of it was most offen- 
               <br />
               sive. What lawyer in this House will assume 
               <br />
               that the preamble is of any importance so long as 
               <br />
               the Act itself is clear and beyond doubt? First, 
               <br />
               however, let me draw attention to the fact that 
               <br />
               the member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), 
               <br />
               having heard the objections made to the preamble, 
               <br />
               said at once, in effect, I do not consider it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offensive,</span> 
               <br />
               but, if any hon. gentleman does so, I will 
               <br />
               consent to have it struck out in Committee. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice, the other night, did not 
               <br />
               take a particle of notice of the concession or offer 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for North Simcoe. It 
               <br />
               appeared to me that he refused to take notice of 
               <br />
               that offer or to comment upon it. It appeared to 
               <br />
               me that he was anxious that this apparently 
               <br />
               offensive preamble should continue in the Bill, so 
               <br />
               that he might have some argument and grievance 
               <br />
               on which to build an argument in this House. 
               <br />
               I say that there was nothing in the preamble to 
               <br />
               this Act. I mean by that, that no matter how 
               <br />
               offensive it might be—and I am not going to argue 
               <br />
               that just <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now-”this</span> House has no right to consider 
               <br />
               the preamble so long as the enacting clause is 
               <br />
               beyond any doubt, and I think there are very few 
               <br />
               lawyers in this House who Will deny the truth of 
               <br />
               that proposition. I will not venture, young as I 
               <br />
               am, to address a legal argument to this House 
               <br />
               coming from myself, and I prefer to read authori- 
               <br />
               ties proving my contentions. I shall read from 
               <br />
               Maxwell on Statutes, an authority which, I think, 
               <br />
               will be acknowledged as sufficient. On page 56, 
               <br />
               Maxwell says : 
               <br />

               <br />
