               <br />
               Bill would be applicable to the territory 
               <br />
               of the Dominion east of Manitoba as well 
               <br />
               as to that to the west and north. He 
               <br />
               might mention that application had been 
               <br />
               made on behalf of the Government of

               Manitoba for an enlargement of their terri-

               made something like nine or ten times 
               <br />
               larger than it was at present. But there 
               <br />
               were other proposals of that Government 
               <br />
               in connection with this matter which ren-

               section provides for the establishment of the

               <br />

               The Government last season constructed

               of the laws and ordnances now in force in 
               <br />
               those territories, and the ninth section 
               <br />
               that no ordnance shall be passed by the 
               <br />

               ernor inconsistant with any Act of the 
               <br />
               Dominion Parliament. This section re- 
               <br />
               stricts the jurisdiction of the Council prac— 
               <br />

               of the North— West Territories, and his 
               <br />
               Council. The next few sections provide 
               <br />
               for popular Government so far as it could 
               <br />

               the country. The eleventh section pro- 
               <br />
               vides that so soon as the Lieut. Governor 
               <br />

               <br />

               The sub-sections provide the machinery for 
               <br />
               holding the elections. The ﬁfth sub—sec- 
               <br />
               tion provides that as soon as the Lieut. 
               <br />

               <br />
               sixth sub-section provides that when the 
               <br />
               number of elective members amounts to 
               <br />
               twenty-one the council hereinbefore 
               <br />
               appointed shall cease 'md be determined, 
               <br />
               and the members so elected shall be con— 
               <br />
               stituted and designated as the Legislative 
               <br />
               Assembly of the N orth—West Territory, 
               <br />
               and the powers by this Act vested in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               exercisable by such Legislative Assembly. 
               <br />
               One of the sub—sections provides that every

               <br />
               to vote shall be eligible for election.
