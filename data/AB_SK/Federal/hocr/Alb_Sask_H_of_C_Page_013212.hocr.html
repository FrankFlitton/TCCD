               a parliamentary sense—who could doubt what the 
               <br />
               result must be ? Sir, he destroyed him with dithy— 
               <br />
               rambics. His punishment was something almost 
               <br />
               too dreadful for him to bear. Mr. Davin poured out 
               <br />
               upon him all the vials of wrath of the English lang- 
               <br />
               uage. He pointed out the extraordinary temerity of 
               <br />
               a lawyer, and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nis'i</span> prius lawyer at that, engaging 
               <br />
               in this attempt. Why, it was the very apotheosis 
               <br />
               of six-and-eight-pence. In the older civilisation, 
               <br />
               if the ﬁrm of Quirk, Gammon &amp; Snap had attempt- 
               <br />
               ed to work a revolution, they would have been 
               <br />
               driven out of every European country. This is 
               <br />
               the man who is attempting to destroy a magni- 
               <br />
               ﬁcent language and literature and to divert the 
               <br />
               course of an empire. Sir, he pointed out too, 
               <br />
               indirectly, that all the great traitors were not 
               <br />
               lawyers. He detested every deserter from his 
               <br />
               party. Someone had said that a gentleman never 
               <br />
               changed either his religion or his politics. He 
               <br />
               could not go so far, but he could not forget that, at 
               <br />
               the famous “ Siege of Corinth,” the “ First to ﬁre 
               <br />
               the shot and wield the blade, was Alp the Adrian 
               <br />
               renegade.” He was in religion a Low Church 
               <br />
               radical ; but in almost all other matters he was in- 
               <br />
               clined to be High. Some concessions must be 
               <br />
               made to the sentiments of a democratic country 
               <br />
               like this. A sot must be occasionally thrown to 
               <br />
               the Cerberus. It was difﬁcult to maintain the dis- 
               <br />
               tinctions of caste. In “Guy Livingston,” the old 
               <br />
               Irish Colonel was unwilling even to die with an 
               <br />
               attorney; in this country it is still more difﬁcult 
               <br />
               to live with them. They had an unpleasant fashion 
               <br />
               of interfering with the private affairs of a gentle- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manw—which,</span> to say the least, was inconvenient. 
               <br />
               Lucifer, Catiline, Iscariot, the Constable of Bour- 
               <br />
               bon, Benedict Arnold and their congeners might 
               <br />
               have been indiscreet ; but, however, they had 
               <br />
               never been indentured. In the older civilisations, 
               <br />
               in order to ﬂoat a company, you must have the 
               <br />
               name of 3. lord in the prospectus. It was one of the 
               <br />
               prerogatives of those who charged with the con- 
               <br />
               queror at Senlac. There was a great English 
               <br />
               statesman, who if his career had not been cut 
               <br />
               short, by circumstances over which he had no 
               <br />
               control, would have solved this difﬁcult problem. 
               <br />
               He understood the peculiar genius of the Anglo- 
               <br />
               Saxon race; he combined the practical with the 
               <br />
               poetical ; the sensualistic with the idealistic philo- 
               <br />
               sophy. When John Locke will have been forgotten, 
               <br />
               when “ Paradise Lost ” will have paled before the 
               <br />
               lustre of Ens, or the Dawn, when Shakespeare will 
               <br />
               have been relegated to obscurity then the name of 
               <br />
               the lamented John Cade will be held in veneration 
               <br />
               and honor, as one who loved his fellowmen and un- 
               <br />
               derstood the genius of his people ; the object of his 
               <br />
               life was to increase the pleasures of his people, by 
               <br />
               adding to the size of the drinking pots, by increas- 
               <br />
               ing their number of hoops thereon, and to complete 
               <br />
               their happiness by hanging all the lawyers. If that 
               <br />
               system had been carried out, if that project had 
               <br />
               been realised, what a start would have been made 
               <br />
               in the direction of the millennial period ! Then, Sir, 
               <br />
               the Vice-Chancellor took up the parable. It was said 
               <br />
               of Lord Bacon that he wrote of exhaustive science, 
               <br />
               like a Lord Chancellor ; it may be said of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vice.</span> 
               <br />
               Chancellor that he attacked the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Simcoe, with singular force and power. He went 
               <br />
               back to past ages; he made an exhaustive review 
               <br />
               of the Egyptian, Assyrian and ancient civilisations. 
               <br />
               Then the hon. member for Bothwell deluged him 
               <br />
               Mr. WRIGHT. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               with authorities, the result was the complete dis- 
               <br />
               comﬁture of the unhappy gentleman. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for West Assiniboia destroyed him as the 
               <br />
               Parthian horse destroyed the legions of Crassus. 
               <br />
               The member for York charged him as the Greek 
               <br />
               phalanx did the Persians at Arbela. While, like 
               <br />
               the Roman legion, the hon. member for Both- 
               <br />
               well, destroyed his opponent. And so the doom 
               <br />
               was acaccomplished and pem' <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forte</span> et dure was 
               <br />
               inﬂicted upon the unha py member for Simcoe. 
               <br />
               I regret, for one, an I am sure this House 
               <br />
               will regret, that such a course has been taken 
               <br />
               by an hon. gentleman for whom we all have 
               <br />
               so high an esteem. For my part I have been 
               <br />
               twenty-ﬁve years in this House, and, in my 
               <br />
               capacity as a soldier in the ranks, have done 
               <br />
               my best to build up this nation, and to keep 
               <br />
               together the various elements of our system of Con- 
               <br />
               federation. Our difﬁculties have been very great, 
               <br />
               but now, after the ediﬁce has been completed, after 
               <br />
               this splendid structure has been erected, I, for one, 
               <br />
               do not wish to live to see it destroyed, and if this 
               <br />
               motion of the hon. gentleman had carried, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,I</span> state 
               <br />
               my honest conviction to this House when I say 
               <br />
               that I believe it would be followed by disastrous 
               <br />
               results. If we were, by this insidious attempt, to 
               <br />
               succeed in destroying the French language in the 
               <br />
               North-VVest, and then carry the policy still 
               <br />
               farther, as is the evident intention, to the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of which I have the honor to be an inhabi- 
               <br />
               tant, I believe that the system of Confederation 
               <br />
               would be destroyed. Sir, contact has brought 
               <br />
               us into sympathy. We have constructed a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">magnié</span> 
               <br />
               ﬁcent system of railways, we have become acquaint- 
               <br />
               ed with the Maritime Provinces and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘the</span> North- 
               <br />
               VVest, and we have spanned this land from ocean 
               <br />
               to ocean, and from sea to sea. The people of this 
               <br />
               Dominion like each other. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{For</span> my part, I have 
               <br />
               always had a profound and supreme admiration 
               <br />
               for the toilers of the sea in Nova Scotia and New 
               <br />
               Brunswick. I have always liked the people of 
               <br />
               British Columbia. I have even admired the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">splen-</span> 
               <br />
               did people of Ontario. We have always held them in 
               <br />
               our heart of hearts. And so with the men that come 
               <br />
               from that grand prairie Province, the wheat-ﬁeld 
               <br />
               of the world, we hold them in special regard on 
               <br />
               account of their ability, their energy, their enter- 
               <br />
               prise, and I do not wish to see the separation of 
               <br />
               those Provinces which send us such men. But, 
               <br />
               Sir, with all that, there is one place which I 
               <br />
               hold still dearer, it is my native Province, the 
               <br />
               Province of Quebec. Sir, that Province contains 
               <br />
               divers races. We have there the Englishman, the 
               <br />
               Irishman, the Scotchman, coming from bold and 
               <br />
               hardy races, who are able to hold their own against 
               <br />
               all comers. We have also the French Canadian 
               <br />
               people, and I who know them well, who was born <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"</span> 
               <br />
               in their midst, who have lived among them have 
               <br />
               learned to respect their zeal for their ancient faith, 
               <br />
               their kindly courtesy, and the chivalrous gallantry 
               <br />
               which they inherit from their Norman and Breton 
               <br />
               ancestors. I, for one, would be the ﬁrst to protest 
               <br />
               against any interference with, or any outrage

               upon, the rights and privileges of my native 
               <br />
               Province. Sir, I do not believe that this House 
               <br />
               or this country would tolerate any such a thing. 
               <br />
               If we could eliminate the French Ian uage, would

               answer this question honestly in his own mind. 
               <br />
               If we could eliminate the French Canadians, 
               <br />
               whom we know so well for their kindly 
               <br />
