               he must have known that there was a con-

               tinual conﬂict of opinion between the govern-

               as enthusiastic ever since 1896 as he has 
               <br />
               expressed himself to-night, the people of 
               <br />
               the territories would have beneﬁted there- 
               <br />
               by in the years which have intervened, and 
               <br />
               would have beneﬁted substantially even this 
               <br />

               have a great deal to do with shaping the 
               <br />

               <br />

               consider the possibility of opposition'from

               <br />
               that this is a subject that has taken my

               attention very strongly from year to year, 
               <br />

               not come to my memory that we ever did 
               <br />
               receive any assistance. I would like to say 
               <br />
               that had that interest been taken by the 
               <br />
               members of the opposition in the early part 
               <br />
               -of the session that was taken later on and 
               <br />
               to-night, the territories would no doubt have 
               <br />
               gained a very considerable ﬁnancial bene— 
               <br />
               ﬁt and would have been still better able to 
               <br />
               meet the requirements that they are called 
               <br />
               upon to meet. The point I wish to make is 
               <br />
               that the people of the territories want money 
               <br />
               and not talk. That is the question at issue, 
               <br />
               and the closer we keep to it the better will 
               <br />
               be the understanding, and the better the re- 
               <br />
               sults that we will have. While I do not wish 
               <br />
               to go into anything very controversial at this 
               <br />
               particular time, I will take the opportunity 
               <br />
               of pointing out that a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposition</span> which 
               <br />
               involves the placing before the people of the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories of the idea that they 
               <br />
               have been very badly used both ﬁnancially 
               <br />
               and otherwise, that their premier, in fact, 
               <br />
               has been insulted by this government, and yet 
               <br />
               that does not offer in any degree or in any 
               <br />
               way any substantial suggestion for immedi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               is likely to meet with very much favour 
               <br />
               at their hands. Had it been intended to

               willing to concede us the right to incur debt

               <br />
