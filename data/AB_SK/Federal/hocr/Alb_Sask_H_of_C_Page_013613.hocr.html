               <br />

               <br />
               other provinces to come in. The province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba comes in. The population of 
               <br />
               that province has increased according to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               British Columbia will gain one. The pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec will remain the same. This 
               <br />
               is the only basis upon which the operation 
               <br />
               could be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carried</span> on. Does any one suppose 
               <br />
               that the provinces of the west increasing 
               <br />
               their representation and the provinces of the 
               <br />
               east not decreasing proportionately to their 
               <br />
               population, the province of Quebec, which is 
               <br />
               the pivotal province would submit to such

               a state of things ? I do not pretend that the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec would not submit to it 
               <br />
               if it were the law—it would undoubtedly. 
               <br />
               But if representation is to be based on popu— 
               <br />
               lation it must be that there is a balance 
               <br />
               swinging upwards and downwards—this 
               <br />
               province will lose, not having kept pace 
               <br />
               with the province of Quebec, and the other 
               <br />
               will gain having gone on more rapidly than 
               <br />
               Quebec. Therefore, it cannot be stated that 
               <br />
               the position we take is unreasonable. That
