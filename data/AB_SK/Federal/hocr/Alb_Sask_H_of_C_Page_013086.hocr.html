               He said : I make this motion now for the purpose of having 
               <br />
               the Bill stand for a second reading at as early a day as 
               <br />
               convenient after the recess, The Bill is on the lines of the 
               <br />
               measure introduced by the hon. member for Bothwell 
               <br />
               (Mr. Mills) when he was Minister of the Interior. It 
               <br />
               provides that the North-West Council shall have the 
               <br />
               character of a legislative assembly, having not less than 21 
               <br />
               nor more than 25 members. A schedule of the constitu- 
               <br />
               encies is now under consideration, and is not yet attached 
               <br />
               to the Bill. It is proposed that the nominated members of 
               <br />
               the council shall cease; but as there are at present 
               <br />
               no legal men in the council, nor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is~</span> there much chance 
               <br />
               of there being many legal men in the ﬁrst assembly, it is 
               <br />
               preposed that the Government may have power to appoint 
               <br />
               certain legal experts, not exceeding three, who shall sit and 
               <br />
               assist in the drafting of Bills, and have the power of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discus</span> 
               <br />
               sion but not the power of voting, something like the repre- 
               <br />
               sentative delegates <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the Territories in the United States 
               <br />
               Congress. That provision is intended to apply to the 
               <br />
               present term of the legislative assembly; it is hoped that 
               <br />
               in the second term some legal gentlemen may ﬁnd their 
               <br />
               way into the assembly, and enable us to do away with that 
               <br />
               provision. It is proposel to extend the term of the 
               <br />
               existence of the legislature from two or three years. The 
               <br />
               qualiﬁcation will remain the same, household suﬁ'rage with 
               <br />
               the addition of an income <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬂrage.</span> The Lieutenant Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor shall no longer sit with the council or assembly, but 
               <br />
               shall, as in the Provinces, be a separate estate, and the 
               <br />
               assembly will be presided over as this assembly is, by a 
               <br />
               Speaker. There is an extension of the powers of the 
               <br />
               assembly which I need not trouble the House with now, 
               <br />
               but the subject will be fully entered into when the Bill is 
               <br />
               under discussion.

               kind in one of the petitions of the North- West Council 
               <br />
               which is before the House, but after consideration those 
               <br />
               gentlemen are opposed to it themselves. They say that it 
               <br />
               is really a retrog ressive step, rather than one in advance. 
               <br />
               These are the principal features of the measure.

               Mr. LAURIER. I am not aware that the resolutions of 
               <br />
               the North-West Council with respect to this matter have 
               <br />
               been placed before the House. If they have not been, I

               suppose the hon. gentleman will place them before the

               <br />
               glad it the hon. gentleman would afford us some further 
               <br />
               information on this important Bill. The people in that 
               <br />
               country have made considerable progress in number and in 
               <br />
               the development of the country, and a government a little 
               <br />
               more approaching that of a Province than that which at 
               <br />
               present exists there is no doubt required; but in all our 
               <br />
               Provinces we have parliamentary responsible government, 
               <br />
               and I do not understand from the hon. gentleman’s obser- 
               <br />
               vations how he preposes that the executive government 
               <br />
               shall be carried on. The preposition he has made relates 
               <br />
               purely to matters of legislation. Does he propose that the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant Governor of the Territories shall have the 
               <br />
               power of vetoing the measures of the Legislative Assembly 
               <br />
               of the Territories ? Does he propose that when the Legis- 
               <br />
               lature meets and passes a law which it believes to be for the 
               <br />
               good of the Territories, within the legislative limits 
               <br />
               assigned to it, the Governor in Council here shall
