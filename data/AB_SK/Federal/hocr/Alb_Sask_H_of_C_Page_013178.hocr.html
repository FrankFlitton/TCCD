               has made to-day in the plural at all. I accept it 
               <br />
               as far as he is himself concerned. As far as he 
               <br />
               himself professes that these are his views, his

               accept his statement fully and unfeignedly. But, 
               <br />
               when the hon. gentleman spoke of “ we,” of what 
               <br />
               “ we” were intending, what “we” were propos— 
               <br />

               <br />
               took up a position which, in face of what has been 
               <br />
               going on in this country for some months past, in

               primarily responsible for this agitation—the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy)—in face 
               <br />
               of the language of this Bill itself, in face of all these 
               <br />
               things with which we have to deal, I cannot 
               <br />
               accept. If I could accept it, the question would 
               <br />
               receive an easy and rapid solution from me. I do 
               <br />
               not intend to enter into a criticism of the criticisms 
               <br />
               of the hon. gentleman from North Norfolk (Mr. 
               <br />
               Charlton). One or two words will sufﬁce for that. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman said, but I hope and think he 
               <br />
               must have misread his history, that the decrees of 
               <br />
               ancient Rome, were published in all those portions 
               <br />
               of the world over which she had authority, only in 
               <br />
               the tongue of Rome herself. I think history shows 
               <br />
               us that nothing so inhuman and barbarous as that 
               <br />
               was done, even in what may be called inhuman and 
               <br />
               barbarous times. Turning to a more modern ex- 
               <br />
               ample, which he justiﬁably quotes, an example 
               <br />
               which is to be regarded by us with the highest 
               <br />
               attention, interestand respect, he refers to theneigh-

               being the whole modern world has so deep an inter- 
               <br />
               est, of Whose constitution the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               opposite has not seldom spoken in terms of deserved 
               <br />
               admiration as to the great work which was achieved 
               <br />
               by the men who framed that constitution. Speak- 
               <br />
               ing of that example, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span> member for North 
               <br />
               Norfolk was unfortunate enough to quote, as an 
               <br />
               instance of a state where the French language had 
               <br />
               been stamped out and the great principle which he 
               <br />
               proclaimed, had been realised in the very initiation 
               <br />
               of its connection with the nation of which it forms 
               <br />
               a part, the State of Louisiana. Why, Sir, is not 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman aware that, by the original 
               <br />
               constitution of the State of Louisiana, the French 
               <br />
               as well as the English language was permitted to 
               <br />
               be used in the debates of that State, and that that 
               <br />
               continued until the State of Louisiana by a subse— 
               <br />

               <br />
               information upon this point—that it should be 
               <br />
               blotted out. The fact, however, is this, as stated 
               <br />

               <br />
               the use ofthe French language was complete in all 
               <br />

               <br />
               the printing of certain things in the two languages ? 
               <br />
               What is the harm if the people who have to obey 
               <br />
               the laws are enabled to read them printed in the 
               <br />
               language which they understand ? That is a 
               <br />
               small question ; the great question is included in 
               <br />
               the power of freely debating in the Legislature in 
               <br />
               the tongues of the peoples of whom the State is 
               <br />
               composed. All I care to know in regard to that 
               <br />
               is that the constitution gave the people of French 
               <br />
               origin the right to speak in their mother tongue 
               <br />
               in their own State Legislature. The hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               man has said that this question is a very narrow - 
               <br />
               one, and, as he puts it, it is a comparatively 
               <br />
               narrow one. He has spoken of the impropriety of 
               <br />
               what he calls dodging responsibility. He has told 
               <br />
               us of the want of manliness that would be involved' 
               <br />
               in our placing upon other shoulders the responsi-- 
               <br />
               bility which we ought to take ourselves, and I con— 
               <br />
               fess that I have considerable sympathy with that 
               <br />
               View. As far as our present information goes, the 
               <br />
               general principle upon which this question should 
               <br />
               be dealt with, and I am quite prepared now to state 
               <br />
               the time when I think it should be dealt with ; but I 
               <br />
               thought a large part of the hon. gentleman’s speech 
               <br />
               was but a poor commentary on the declaration as to- 
               <br />
               dodging responsibility which he made and to which 
               <br />
               I have just referred, when he iterated and reiterated 
               <br />
               the statement that “ we ” have no intention of inter- 
               <br />
               fering with vested rights, that ‘ ‘ we ” have no inten- 
               <br />
               tion of interfering with the rights of any minority 
               <br />
               which are secured under the British North America. 
               <br />

               <br />
               properly reserved, that “we ” do not intend to 
               <br />
               touch it, and that “we ” are not touching it now. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               appeared to me that these statements were evasive 
               <br />
               of responsibllity, were not merely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inconsistent.</span>

               porting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~</span> including the preamble <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span> but were 
               <br />
               fatally inconsistent with the attitude of the hon.

               this Bill is merely the ﬁrst fruits. A little later, 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman declared that “ we,” the Anglo- 
               <br />
               Saxons of this continent—once again takin the 
               <br />
               plural pronoun, which the hon. gentleman use <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst.</span> 
               <br />
               when speaking of those with Whom he was actin , 
               <br />
               then when speaking of the English-speaking peep e 
               <br />
               of this country, and ﬁnally when speakin of the. 
               <br />
               Anglo-Saxon race from the Pole to the sthmus 
               <br />
               —he declared their stern determination, by what 
               <br />
               means might be open to them, to make this country 
               <br />
               from the North Pole to the Isthmus an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anglo‘Saxon</span> 
               <br />
               community, and to create a homogeneity of race. 
               <br />
               Well, it is only a question of means and methods, 
               <br />
               times and circumstances, opportunities and oc- 
               <br />
               casions, by which this result is to be achieved ; 
               <br />
               and the hon. gentleman will ﬁnd, as I shall pro- 
               <br />
               ceed to point out resently, that his leader <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">does.</span>

               not propose to re egate the consideration of this.
