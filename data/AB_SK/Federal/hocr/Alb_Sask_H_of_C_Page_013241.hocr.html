               Sir RICHARD CARTVVRIGHT. Why, the

               hon. member for Simcoe himself, and he ought to 
               <br />
               know. But if, as I have said, the language of the 
               <br />
               preamble of this unfortunate Act was needlessly 
               <br />
               aﬂ'ronting and offensive to gentlemen of French 
               <br />
               nationality, what must I say of the speech in 
               <br />
               which, without provocation, in cold blood, the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Simcoe thought fit to introduce 
               <br />
               it? Sir, I regretted exceedingly to hear that 
               <br />
               speech, and most of all for this reason : I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knewﬂ</span> 
               <br />
               my parliamentary experience taught me, as the 
               <br />
               parliamentary experience of any hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               who has sat for a few sessions in this House would 
               <br />
               teach him—that one such mischievous and 
               <br />
               injudicious speech was sure to be the parent 
               <br />
               of others equally mischievous and injudicious, 
               <br />
               which would go far to widen the breach and 
               <br />
               render the task of moderate and reasonable men in 
               <br />

               <br />
               there were extenuating circumstances in the case 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for Berthier. I am sometimes 
               <br />
               myself accused, most unjustly, of having hasty blood 
               <br />
               in my veins, and I dare say I would have felt angry 
               <br />
               at the language used by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Simcoe; but however angry I might have felt, 
               <br />
               I do not think I would have walked into the 
               <br />
               trap he set and supplied him with material for 
               <br />
               future mischievous operations. Now, as far as I 
               <br />
               am concerned, my own course in this matter is 
               <br />
               clear enough. Last year—and I ask my French

               <br />
               not elected to discharge all the duties of a Provin- 
               <br />
               cial Parliament or Assembly. I say, without any 
               <br />
               desire to belittle their important functions, 
               <br />
               that they are somewhat of a hybrid between 
               <br />
               a municipal council and a Provincial Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, and I cannot admit that they are entitled 
               <br />
               to speak with perfect authority on a question 
               <br />
               which was notoriously not before the people 
               <br />
               when the North~VVest Council were elected. More 
               <br />
               than that : I have another reason Why I decline to 
               <br />
               accept what may, for ought I know, have been 
               <br />
               a hasty resolution passed by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> 
               <br />
               Council. So far as I am advised, there is every 
               <br />
               reason to believe that it was in no way the 
               <br />
               spontaneous declaration of the Council of the 
               <br />
               North-West, but was a suggestion from outside. 
               <br />
               Probably the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) knows best whence it came. It did not

               <br />
               and in voicing which the Council merely voiced
