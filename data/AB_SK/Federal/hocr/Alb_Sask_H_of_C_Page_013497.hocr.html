               <br />
               the Government of the day the righting of 
               <br />
               this wrong. As I have already said, if they 
               <br />
               have no intention of doing us this wrong, 
               <br />
               let them relinquish the power to do it. I 
               <br />
               make the demand at the instance of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pee.</span> 
               <br />
               ple of the North-west Territories. They are 
               <br />
               alarmed about this matter, and they have 
               <br />
               shown their alarm in the clearest possible 
               <br />
               way by a resolution passed by an assembly 
               <br />
               which. as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I‘Said</span> before, is composed largely 
               <br />
               of Conservatives. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               West <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assiniboia</span> will agree with me in that. 
               <br />
               It is true that, among the members of that 
               <br />
               assembly, are the Liberal candidate for 
               <br />
               Alberta and some other Liberals. But 
               <br />
               I know a great many of them. and I 
               <br />
               think I am quite correct in saying that there 
               <br />
               is a considerable majority who are sup— 
               <br />
               porters of the present Government. Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain, as I said before, the Premier. is 
               <br />
               the Government candidate in Alberta; and 
               <br />
               these gentlemen with. one voice have con— 
               <br />
               demned this outrage in language as strong 
               <br />
               and as clear as any that I have used <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> 
               <br />
               They have pointed out the possibility of 
               <br />
               great wrong being done. and they have 
               <br />
               asked to have the law changed back into 
               <br />
               its old form, or else into their local Fran- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘chisc</span> Act, but it makes no diiit'erence for the 
               <br />
               purpose of the people which is done. I may 
               <br />
               say that I got a letter this day from a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of the legislative assembly urging me 
               <br />
               not to overlook this matter, to be sure and 
               <br />
               bring it up. and endeavour if possible to 
               <br />
               have the wrong made right. I again say 
               <br />
               that if this House does not at this session 
               <br />
               change that law, the prediction of the hon. 
               <br />

               tories. I have no doubt about it, it is too 
               <br />
               clear for argument. I do not think that the 
               <br />

               Sir RICHARD CAR'DWRIGHT. ‘I am 
               <br />
               not going to prolong the discussion which 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Winnipeg (Mr. Martin) 
               <br />
               has initiated, although I feel bound to say 
               <br />
               that I have failed to hear one single argu- 
               <br />
               ment from the other side of the House in 
               <br />
               the slightest degree justifying the assump- 
               <br />
               tion of the monstrous power—and I use the 
               <br />
               word advisedly—which the Government 
               <br />
               have, without the real knowledge of the 
               <br />
               House, taken to themselves. The thing 
               <br />
               smacks of fraud of the grossest possible 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">drscription.</span> But what I ‘ want chieﬂy to 
               <br />
               call the attention of the House to. is this: 
               <br />
               As I understand it, this confusion has arisen, 
               <br />
               or the ignorance of the House has been 
               <br />
               caused, in no small degree, by the very 
               <br />
               mischievous practice which prevails in our 
               <br />
               legislation of repealing a clause by number. 
               <br />
               without‘giving full details of the clause that 
               <br />
               is repealed. I have over and over again 
               <br />
               protested against that practice in this House. 
               <br />
               I hold that it is the most slovenly possible 
               <br />
               legislation, when we are dealing with im- 
               <br />
               portant subjects like this, to say you repeal 
               <br />
               such and such a clause, number so and so, 
               <br />
               of such and such an Act. Not one man out 
               <br />
               of ﬁfty in the House knows anything about 
               <br />
               the matter in general when; it is introduced 
               <br />
               in that fashion, still less, when it is intro- 
               <br />
               duced in the shape of an amendment from 
               <br />
               the Senate. Such a practice ought to be 
               <br />
               prohibited. 1 think, by a rule of this House ; 
               <br />
               at any rate, the Government in particular 
               <br />
               ought to be exceedingly cautious not to allow 
               <br />
               any legislation which passes through their 
               <br />
               hands, to be conducted in‘ such an exceed- 
               <br />
               ingly slipshod fashion. I hope and trust that 
               <br />
               my hon. friends will get an opportunity of 
               <br />
               testing the sense of the House on this 
               <br />
               question, because <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> myself am of the opin- 
               <br />
               ion that if this thing had been fairly pre-

               sented to the House, the members on both 
               <br />
               sides would have refused to accord to the 
               <br />
               nominees of the Government any such power 
               <br />
               as that which appears to‘ be given to them; 
               <br />
