               Mr. CHARLTON. I wish to say a few words on this 
               <br />
               motion of my hon. friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), 
               <br />
               and I propose to review very brieﬂy the leading points in 
               <br />
               the policy of the Government with reference to the admin- 
               <br />
               istration of North-West affairs in connection with the sale 
               <br />
               and management of public lands. It is a matter of the ut- 
               <br />
               most importance to this country that that vast stretch of 
               <br />
               wilderness should be settled, and I presume, Sir, that all 
               <br />
               parties of Canadians are ready to unite in recommending 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">approving</span> any policy calculated to produce that desir- 
               <br />
               able result. must further say that I consider the policy 
               <br />
               of the Government from the time its ﬁrst regulation was 
               <br />
               issued in July, 1879, down to the present moment, as hav- 
               <br />
               ing been a policy not calculated to secure the development 
               <br />
               of that great country. It has been a policy not 00nceived 
               <br />
               and not carried out in the interests of the settlers who live 
               <br />
               in that country or who may be induced to go there. 
               <br />
               The Reform party of this Dominion—the Opposi- 
               <br />
               tion in this House—challenged this policy of the 
               <br />
               Government as long ago as April, 1880, and for 
               <br />
               nine years we have continued to protest against the 
               <br />
               course that the Government have chosen to pursue with 
               <br />
               regard to the administration of our great public domain in 
               <br />
               the North-West. The regulation issued on the 9th July, 
               <br />
               1879, provided for the setting apart of ﬁve belts upon each 
               <br />
               side of the assumed line of the railway. The ﬁrst belt was 
               <br />
               to be ﬁve miles wide, the second belt was to be ﬁfteen miles 
               <br />
               wide, the third belt twenty miles wide, the fourth belt twenty 
               <br />
               miles wide, and the ﬁfth belt ﬁfty miles wide. Lands in 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst belt were to be held at 86 per acre, in the second 
               <br />
               belt at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5,</span> in the third belt at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">83.50,</span> in the fourth belt at 
               <br />
               82, and in the ﬁfth belt at 81 per acre. The lands not set 
               <br />
               apart for homestead and pre—emption were to be sold upon 
               <br />
               credit, requiring the payment of one-tenth down and the 
               <br />
               balance in nine equal annual instalments, bearing interest 
               <br />
               at 6 per cent. It was then held by the Opposition that the 
               <br />
               Opening for sale upon credit of a vast amount of land 
               <br />
               at $1 per acre, requiring the payment of only 10 cents 
               <br />
               per acre upon the land, the granting of easy terms 
               <br />
               on the balance, and the sale of this land in un- 
               <br />
               limited quantities, was a policy calculated to foster 
               <br />
               and produce speculations in this land. These regulations 
               <br />
               were modiﬁed on the 14th October, 1879. The lands under 
               <br />
               the modiﬁed re ulations in belt “ A ” were held at 85 per 
               <br />
               acre, in belt “ ” at $4, in belt “C” at 83, in belt “ D ” at 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2,</span> and in belt “ E” at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1</span> per acre, with the same policy 
               <br />
               continued as to selling upon credit, and with the same 
               <br />
               objectionable feature of the policy in encouragin specula-

               <br />
               one modiﬁcation of those regulations in May, 1881, and on 
               <br />
               the let January, 1882, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regulations</span> were issued which, I 
               <br />
               believe, are still in force. These regulations provided two 
               <br />
               schemes for colonisation, which were in point of fact, two 
               <br />
               schemes calculated to still further promote the operations 
               <br />
               of s eculators in these publiclands. Colonisation " plan No. 
               <br />

               <br />
               chased by colonisation companies at 82 per acre, the price 
               <br />
               at which they were held to settlers, with a provision that 
               <br />
               upon compliance with some requirements as to settlement, a 
               <br />
               rebate of one-half should be made ; the effect of this being 
               <br />
               to give the colonisation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">companies—organisations.</span> of 
               <br />
               capitalists—an opportunity to buy lands at half-price, 
               <br />
               and this led to a good deal of speculation. Plan
