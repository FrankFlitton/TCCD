               In all the North-West, we collected during the last year 
               <br />
               for lands, ranching grants, coal dues, and for all purposes 
               <br />
               that come within the range of Dominion lands, $193,640.43, 
               <br />
               and we actually expended for the services of registrars, 
               <br />
               inspectors, agents and others, $153,740.24, leaving a net 
               <br />
               balance to our credit of $38,900.15. I will give you a 
               <br />
               little idea of the expenses at Winnipeg. They are really 
               <br />
               surprising. To begin with, Mr. William Pearce, superin- 
               <br />
               tendent ot mines, has a salary of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3,200;</span> Mr. H. H. Smith, 
               <br />
               commissioner, has a salary of 85,000 a year; Mr. Rufus 
               <br />
               Stephenson, inspector of color isation companies, gets $3,000; 
               <br />
               and I venture to say that there are people in the Province 
               <br />
               of Ontario who will make a declaration before any judge 
               <br />
               0r jury that Mr. Stephenson was not in the North- 
               <br />
               West altogether four months, and was in his comtort- 
               <br />
               able home in Ontario at least eight months of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gear</span> for which he drew 83,000 as inspector, 
               <br />
               and over 83,000 for expenses. Then we come to Mr. D. J. 
               <br />
               Macdonnell. He is employed in the Land Ofﬁce at Winnipeg, 
               <br />
               and gets <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">83</span> a day. Mr. J. M. Gordon, inspector of agencies, 
               <br />
               receives $2,000 a year. Mr. Dolbear receives 83 a day. Mr. 
               <br />
               Burpé receives 81,800 a year ; and so it goes on. The total 
               <br />
               expense of the Land Board at Winnipeg is $30,745.57. But 
               <br />
               we have seven agencies in the North-West, and to give an 
               <br />
               idea of the expenses of these agencies, I will read some of 
               <br />
               the items. Mr. E. T. Smith, the agent at Brandon, has a 
               <br />
               salary of $1,200 a year. Mr. W. H. Hiam has a salary of 
               <br />
               $1,200 a year. Mr. A. W. Reynold s, in the same agency, 
               <br />
               receives 83 a day. Mr. O. D. Rickards has about the same 
               <br />
               salary, and there are a lot of other men. At Calgary, we 
               <br />
               have Mr. Amos Rowe receiving $1,200. Mr. Meyer receiv- 
               <br />
               lng over 81,000 a year. Mr. Michael Harris the same, and 
               <br />
               Mr. McQuilken receiving about the same. In addition to 
               <br />
               that, there is Mr. T. A. McLean, registrar, receiving $1,200 
               <br />
               a year, and Mr. Rochester receiving 83 a day, and many 
               <br />
               others. The sums paid in that agency run up in the same 
               <br />
               ratio. I cannot understand how hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               can expect that the people will put up with the extrava- 
               <br />
               gance which exists in the North West. It appears to be ﬁlled 
               <br />
               Up by ofﬁcials who never did anything and, since they 
               <br />
               have been sent there, do nothing. At Prince Albert, 
               <br />
               I ﬁndthat Mr. J. McTaggart, agent, receives <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,200</span> ; Mr. 
               <br />
               Schmidt, clerk, is employed at 83 a day; Mr. Sproat, regis- 
               <br />
               trar, receives 81,200 ; and Mr. Waggoner, crown timber 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">figent,</span> receives the same amount. In addition to that, 9240 
               <br />
               18 paid to Mrs. E. W. Sproat for rent for the registry 
               <br />
               ofﬁce, and there are a number of other ofﬁcials who receive 
               <br />
               Smaller salaries. At Regina, Mr. W. H. Stevenson, agent, 
               <br />
               receives 81,200; A. J. Fraser, clerk, $1,095. There is also 
               <br />
               there a Mr. P. M. Barker, instructor of registrars. This is 
               <br />
               a most peculiar thing. We have only seven registrars in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> North-West, and, in order to give these men informa- 
               <br />
               tion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as.</span> to how they should do their duty, we have to send 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Egan</span> instructor. I do not know for a certainty who this 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               . Barker is, but I think he once lived in Orangeville, and 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_10" title="bbox 1686 374 3051 4169">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I think he is related to the hon. member for Simeoe. If I 
               <br />
               am wrong, I can be corrected. However, Mr. Barker is 
               <br />
               there, and for instructing the registrars in these seven 
               <br />
               oﬂices he receives $1,600 a year and travelling expenses. 
               <br />
               I say it is an outrage on the people of this country to ask 
               <br />
               them to put up with this condition of things. The Govern- 
               <br />
               ment have inaugurated a most extravagant course in the 
               <br />
               North-West. The average salary paid at the diﬁ‘ereut 
               <br />
               oﬁices, leaving out Winnipeg, where the cost is over 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$30,000</span> a year, is 87,700 for each of the 16 agencies. 
               <br />
               I think it is time that a host of these unnecessary oﬂicers 
               <br />
               were discharged from the service, and that the Government 
               <br />
               should cut down the expenses within reasonable and decent 
               <br />
               limits. When we consider the glowing statements that 
               <br />
               were made in this House from year to year, as to what 
               <br />
               would likely be the result in the North-West, we cannot 
               <br />
               forget what Sir Charles Tuppcr stated we might expect. 
               <br />
               The Premier, when he was trying to induce the House to 
               <br />
               pass the vote of $30,000,000 to the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way Company, said he had made a careful calculation 
               <br />
               based on his extended experience and also on information 
               <br />
               received from other sources, and that he was in a position 
               <br />
               to assure the House that we might reasonably anticipate 
               <br />
               that by the year 1890 we would have gathered out of that 
               <br />
               country 871,305,000. Instead of that, in 1889, we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               we are $160,000 short of expenses. Then Sir Leonard 
               <br />
               Tilley in his Budget Speech delivered shortly before he left 
               <br />
               us, gave a very glowing account of what he looked forward 
               <br />
               to as the result of our enterprise in the North-West. He 
               <br />
               told us that he had carefully made out his ﬁgures, and he 
               <br />
               was a little more careful than the First Minister, but he 
               <br />
               said he believed that b the year l891 we would have a. 
               <br />
               net balance from the orth-West of $53,693,251. If 
               <br />
               it but not been for these statements, if it had 
               <br />
               not been for the assurance given by men of experience 
               <br />
               and possessing, as they did largely, the conﬁdence 
               <br />
               of the people of the country, I say that the people would 
               <br />
               never at the last election have endorsed the course which 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen took in connectiou with the construction of 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. We are periectly willing to 
               <br />
               acknowledge that it was a necessity, that it was desirable 
               <br />
               that it should be built, but the course of extravagance 
               <br />
               which was followed in building it, and in the wa in which 
               <br />
               money was dealt out in order to keep mem rs of this 
               <br />
               House in line, was nothing short of a. disgrace, and the 
               <br />
               people were deceived in regard to the prospect of the result 
               <br />
               of the building of that road. Instead of our getting 
               <br />
               seventy-one millions as we were promised in 1890, 
               <br />
               or ﬁfty-three millions as we were promised in 1891, we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               a large balance chargeable to that country for managing 
               <br />
               expenses alone, and we do not take into account the im- 
               <br />
               mense amount of money which was Spent on the unfortunate 
               <br />
               war there, in which about $8,000,000 were spent unneces- 
               <br />
               sari ly, because, if the proper steps had been taken, that war 
               <br />
               would not have occurred. We do not take into account 
               <br />
               the cost of the Mounted Police, the number of which was 
               <br />
               raised from 500 to 1,000. The expense of that force last 
               <br />
               year was $860,000, and $876,000 was expended for feeding 
               <br />
               Indians. Putting these sums with the amount on the 
               <br />
               debit side for the administration of the land ofﬁce alone, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that we are over $2,000,000 short on the transac- 
               <br />
               tions of last year. When these men from Manitoba and 
               <br />
               the North-West are urging extended and liberal action 
               <br />
               towards that country, 1 think it behaves the people to cry 
               <br />
               a halt in the expenditures there. There are a number of 
               <br />
               useless oﬂicials in the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">crth«West</span> who are enjoying a good 
               <br />
               time atthe expense of the country, and the sooner they 
               <br />
               are removed, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">staff</span> cut down to the number required 
               <br />
               for the necessities of the service, the better for the people.

               When a short time ago the leader of the House, who is not 
               <br />
               at present in his seat, characterised it as being a “ happy 
               <br />
               hunting ground for political hacks,” he called it really what
