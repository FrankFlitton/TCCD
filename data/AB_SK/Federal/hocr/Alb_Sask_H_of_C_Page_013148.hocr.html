               The French Canadians inhabiting what was then 
               <br />
               known as Canada, including that territory, were 
               <br />
               all put in the same position by the Treaty of Paris. 
               <br />
               I believe that that will not be called in questiOn. 
               <br />
               What the French did in that country, rendered the

               African explorer, Stanley, is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> had as great 
               <br />
               difﬁculties to encounter as Stanley has had in 
               <br />
               Africa, in a country which was unknown, which 
               <br />
               was peopled by savage tribes, where his followers 
               <br />
               were on one or two occasions nearly exterminated 
               <br />
               by the natives ; but he showed great fortitude and 
               <br />
               made his way through that unknown country until 
               <br />
               he planted the colors of France at the Rocky 
               <br />
               Mountains. It must be acknowledged that the 
               <br />
               French have done a great deal for the settlement of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“7</span> est. It has been stated by an hon. 
               <br />
               member that that country was for a long time 
               <br />
               treated as a Crown colony. This was not precisely 
               <br />
               the case. It was a colony, but not a Crown colony. 
               <br />
               It was a colony under a proprietary government, 
               <br />
               the government of the Hudson’s Bay Company, 
               <br />
               something like the proprietary governments that 
               <br />
               were formed at one time in the Statesto the south of 
               <br />
               us, in Pennsylvania for example, and in Maryland, 
               <br />
               ' in which latter proprietary rights were given 
               <br />
               to Lord Baltimore. That was the sort of colony 
               <br />
               it was, and that colony ﬂourished and grew. At 
               <br />
               the time that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories fell to 
               <br />
               Canada there was a large population of French 
               <br />
               there. In fact, I may say that the population was 
               <br />
               almost entirely French and Indian. There were a 
               <br />
               certain number of English and Scotch settlers, but 
               <br />
               the majority of the people were French, descendants 
               <br />
               of those who were engaged in the fur trade, some 
               <br />
               being descendants of the Scotch who, in the year 
               <br />
               1780 or earlier, went in very large numbers to the 
               <br />
               North-VVest and spread their establishments, not 
               <br />
               only along the Saskatchewan, but to the Arctic 
               <br />
               seas and to the shores of the Paciﬁc ocean. By 
               <br />
               whose aid did they go there ? By the aid of the

               voyageurs ‘3 I think enough has been said to show 
               <br />
               that the prosperity of nations does not depend alto- 
               <br />
               gether on the community of language. That has been 
               <br />
               shown in the very able speech of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), and also in 
               <br />
               that of my hon. friend from North York (Mr. 
               <br />
               Mulock). They have entered into that question 
               <br />
               and I think their arguments are quite enough to 
               <br />
               upset those of the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarth ), so I shall not delay the House 
               <br />
               upon that su ject, except to say that, even in 
               <br />
               England itself, there were differences of language, 
               <br />
               and indeed many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> languages were spoken 
               <br />
               within a comparatively short period. There were 
               <br />
               the French, the Welsh and the Gaelic besides other 
               <br />
               languages, and I think it was not much over a 
               <br />
               century ago that a number of Highlamders who could 
               <br />
               hardly speak a word of English leagued themselves 
               <br />
               to ether in several regiments under the name of the 
               <br />
               “ lack Watch.” Very little English was spoken 
               <br />
               amongst them, and yet that Black Watch ﬁghting 
               <br />
               for England became as celebrated in European 
               <br />
               warfare in modern times as ever the Macedonian 
               <br />
               legions were in ancient histor . As to the loyalty 
               <br />
               of the French, I do not t ink much requires 
               <br />

               will be published in French in order that the 
               <br />
               French people may understand them. There is 
               <br />
               still a considerable French population there, and I 
               <br />
               think that the matter might be left to settle itself. 
               <br />
               No doubt English will largely preponderate, as 
               <br />
               English settlement ﬂows in. Those who cannot 
               <br />
               speak English now will, in the course of time, 
               <br />
               learn to speak it, and the whole country will 
               <br />
               become English. We hear much about an exodus of 
               <br />
               French who are said to be leaving Lower Canada, 
               <br />
               and I would be very glad indeed to see them going 
               <br />
               up to the Saskatchewan and settling in that coun-

               <br />
               are our best pioneers in a new country, and they 
               <br />
               get on in harmony with all people. There is no 
               <br />
               more peacable people, no better settlers, no more 
               <br />
               admirable people for settling a new country than 
               <br />
               the French Canadians. They are a moral people, 
               <br />
               a good people, and good workers. I say that time 
               <br />
               will cure all this, and, in my opinion, the matter 
               <br />
               had better be left to the people of the North-West 
               <br />
               Territories themselves. Let them work out their 
               <br />
               own destiny. Throw the country open to the 
               <br />
               French and English, but do not throw disabilities 
               <br />
               on any class of the community. Allow the French 
               <br />
               to grow and prosper. Let them use their language 
               <br />
               ’for a few years. It is only for a few years ; in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories it will die naturally of itself, 
               <br />
               and the whole French population will be engulfed 
               <br />
               by the larger English element. Of course, the 
               <br />
               French language will endure permanently in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, but in that western country which is now 
               <br />
               ﬁlling up with another population, the French 
               <br />
               language cannot be expected to last a great while. 
               <br />
               In the meantime, I think it had better be left to its

               an those representatives, coming fresh from the 
               <br />
               people, were certainly the natural defenders of that
