               Mr. NORTHRUP. I am speaking of the

               statement in the report of the hon. gentle- 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the parliament of Canada. But on re- 
               <br />
               ferring to the record, I ﬁnd that While 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada had attempted to 
               <br />
               do so, the Minister of Justice of that day 
               <br />
               doubted its power, and the imperial parlia- 
               <br />
               ment passed a piece of legislation, which 
               <br />
               was not at all necessary except on the 
               <br />
               ground that the parliament of Canada had 
               <br />
               not the power to do what it professed to do. 
               <br />
               I am justiﬁed, therefore, in my contention 
               <br />
               that in an important statement of fact the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman is not accurate, and that 
               <br />
               when he says that the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               has been carved out of Rupert’s Land by 
               <br />
               legislation of the parliament of Canada, he 
               <br />
               should have qualiﬁed that statement by 
               <br />

               of parliament to do this considered, that an 
               <br />

               <br />
               to legalize what the Dominion parliament
