               should prevail throughout the Dominion. I quite 
               <br />
               agree with my hon. friend that, if it were possible 
               <br />
               to have a community of language from one end of 
               <br />
               the country to the other, it is most desirable ; but 
               <br />
               it is impossible. Not only in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorthWest</span> and 
               <br />
               in the Province of Quebec, do racial difﬁculties exist. 
               <br />
               In Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Ed- 
               <br />
               Ward Island, there is a large French Canadian and 
               <br />
               Acadian population, a population which I regret 
               <br />
               to say is not in as afﬂuent circumstances as many 
               <br />
               of the Anglo-Saxon people there, a population 
               <br />
               which has not had the same facilities for educating 
               <br />
               their children and themselves as are possessed by 
               <br />
               many of us in the more advanced and older com- 
               <br />
               munities. If the hon. gentleman’s community of 
               <br />
               language were to be applied in those schools, the 
               <br />
               result would be, ﬁrst, teachers could not be found 
               <br />
               to educate the pupils in English ; and second, 
               <br />
               the scholars themselves would be unable to under- 
               <br />
               stand anything except French. The effect 
               <br />
               would be that the poor children would remain 
               <br />
               ignorant and would have to go without an educa- 
               <br />
               tion. For that reason, I do not believe the pro- 
               <br />
               position of the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy), would work satisfactorily throughout 
               <br />
               the country. Again, the hon. gentleman has 
               <br />
               referred to alleged diﬂiculties which would arise 
               <br />
               respecting Provincial rights. I fail to preceive 
               <br />
               that any difﬁculty would occur regarding Provin- 
               <br />
               "cial rights in the North-VVest Territories. That 
               <br />
               country will receive its charter from this 
               <br />
               Parliament. It will come in on an entirely 
               <br />
               different footing from the original Provinces 
               <br />
               of the Dominion. They came in as independent 
               <br />
               Provinces with laws and rights recognised by the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, which were in exist- 
               <br />
               ence at that time, and which were to remain in 
               <br />
               existence until altered. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, hOWever, were purchased by the Dom— 
               <br />
               inion, and when they receive their Provincial 
               <br />
               constitution the Canadian Parliament will decide 
               <br />
               the terms <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,upon</span> which it will be given. No 
               <br />
               question of Provincial rights can come into this 
               <br />
               issue. When this Parliament creates a Province or 
               <br />
               a number of Provinces in the North-VVest, Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment will deﬁne and particularise in the consti- 
               <br />
               tution of those Provinces the powers they will 
               <br />
               exercise. I differ with the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Bothwell (Mr. Mills) as to what rights can be 
               <br />
               accorded to those Provinces, the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Bothwell taking the ground that we cannot give 
               <br />
               less or more extensive powers to the new 
               <br />
               Provinces we create than are ossessed by the old 
               <br />
               Provinces under the British orth America Act. 
               <br />
               With all due deference to the hon. gentleman’s 
               <br />
               view, I do not agree with it ; but I admit that it 
               <br />
               is a question open to discussion. But I will say 
               <br />
               this, that if the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy), who introduced the Bill now 
               <br />
               under discussion, had allowed the matter to remain 
               <br />
               in abeyance for ten years and had not introduced 
               <br />
               this Bill, the question would have settled itself. 
               <br />
               Either the French population in the country, which 
               <br />
               is now admittedly very small, would have increas- 
               <br />
               ed suﬁiciently to have enabled them to have de- 
               <br />
               manded the exercise and use of their language, at if 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anglo'Saxon</span> population or a foreign population 
               <br />
               had increased, the French pnlation there never 
               <br />
               would have demanded it, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">andpthe'</span> consequence is that 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">language</span> Would have been eliminated by the 
               <br />
               operation 0 time and by the natural course of events. 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That is the view I take of this part of the question. 
               <br />
               While I quite reco nise the power of the member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe( r. McCarthy), and his right 
               <br />
               to bring this question before Parliament, I regret 
               <br />
               that he should have raised it at this time, because 
               <br />
               I believe that if he had not raised it, not ﬁve 
               <br />
               years—certainly not more than ten <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years~would</span> 
               <br />
               have elapsed before, by the natural operation of 
               <br />
               events, the question would have settled itself. 
               <br />
               Now, Sir, after the very elaborate speeches which 
               <br />
               have been made on this question, and almost every 
               <br />
               branch of the question having been exhausted 
               <br />
               by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> very able speakers, I think it will 
               <br />
               be unnecessary for me to take up the time of the 
               <br />
               House longer. What I rose to do, was not to make 
               <br />
               a speech, but to give utterance to the views which 
               <br />
               I entertain on the matter, in order to justify the 
               <br />
               vote I gave the other day, and to explain the 
               <br />
               vote which I will give on the amendment of the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice. I would say that I have lived 
               <br />
               among the French people for very many years and 
               <br />
               I can vouch that they are, as an almost universal 
               <br />
               rule, good citizens, living peaceably amongst them- 
               <br />
               selves and in friendship with the people of other 
               <br />
               races, and most friendly in their relations 
               <br />
               with their English-speaking fellow countrymen. 
               <br />
               Where they are in power, as they:are in the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec by a large majority, they deal 
               <br />
               with the English-speaking people with a liberality 
               <br />
               which does credit to them. In that Province the 
               <br />
               Protestants have their separate schools and their 
               <br />
               separate eleemosynary and benevolent institutions, 
               <br />
               such as insane asylums, which receive Government 
               <br />
               aid in proportion to that given to the French and 
               <br />
               Catholic institutions. The English minority has 
               <br />
               all these privileges freely accorded by a Legisla— 
               <br />
               ture in which there is only a fragment of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">English</span> 
               <br />
               speaking representatives. If where the English- 
               <br />
               speaking people have the power, as they have in 
               <br />
               the North-VVest Territories and in this Parliament, 
               <br />
               we deal less liberally with the French minority 
               <br />
               than they do with the English minority, what kind 
               <br />
               of position will we place ourselves in ‘? One thing 
               <br />
               is certain: that in the interest of peace and har- 
               <br />
               mony in this country, and in a mixed community 
               <br />
               such as ours, there must be compromise. If there 
               <br />
               are not concessions on both sides, it can only end in 
               <br />
               the disruption of the Dominion, and the breakin 
               <br />
               up of what, when we laid its foundation, we believe 
               <br />
               would be a great nation. I again repeat that while 
               <br />
               voting for the amendment of the Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
               although I do not entirely approve of it, I throw 
               <br />
               the responsibility for the measure on the right 
               <br />
