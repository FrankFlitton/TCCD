               <br />
               in the French language, there is nothing against

               public good, you must respect the conditions

               those parts of the Dominion joined the Con-

               <br />
               has been agreed upon ; and if we go astray from it 
               <br />
               we lay down principles and make precedents which 
               <br />
               will bring us into a state of division and trouble, 
               <br />
               and which might. demolish the whole work of Con-

               <br />
               union do not understand the system under which 
               <br />
               There is a great and essential distinction 
               <br />
               The essence 
               <br />
               of a Government by a King or an Emperor, as in 
               <br />
               England or France. is .unity‘.’ The essence of 
               <br />
               a Confederation is not unity, it is union, and there 
               <br />
               is a wide distinction to be made between the two. 
               <br />
               On this point, I will quote from a high authority, 
               <br />
               “ Lectures introductory to the study of the Law of 
               <br />
               the Constitution,” by Dicey. I draw to this work 
               <br />
               the attention of the hon. member for Muskoka, 
               <br />
               whom I know to be animated with honest and hon- 
               <br />
               ourable motives, who is sincere in his convictions, 
               <br />
               who acts in what he believes to be the real interests 
               <br />
               of theconntry. I ask him to look at that authority 
               <br />
               and to follow my quotation, and to learn how to re- 
               <br />

               <br />
