               <br />
               take the case of Germany at a period when she 
               <br />
               may be considered to have been homogeneous 
               <br />
               in language. Germany has undergone many philo- 
               <br />
               logical changes ; I speak of the old Roman Empire, 
               <br />
               founded by Charlemagne in the eighth century. 
               <br />
               That empire became practically German in the 
               <br />
               thirteenth century, in consequence of the inﬂuence 
               <br />
               of the Teutonic knights. For a short period they 
               <br />
               succeeded, by great force of character, in establish- 
               <br />
               ing the German language and displacing the 
               <br />
               Sclavonic. Thereafter, from the fourteenth 
               <br />
               century to the Peace of Westphalia, three hundred 
               <br />
               years afterwards, Germany was considered as 
               <br />
               illustrating that which my hon. friend depends on: 
               <br />
               it was a country homogeneous in language, and 
               <br />
               should have been a united and powerful land, 
               <br />
               bound together by that strong national spirit, to be 
               <br />
               developed, according to my hon. friend, only by 
               <br />
               community of language; but what does history 
               <br />
               tell us? Can my hon. friend point to a nation in 
               <br />
               ancient or modern times that, for three hundred 
               <br />
               years, was more torn by internal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clisseiisions’by</span>

               wars, rebellions and fratricidal disturbances—than 
               <br />

               <br />
               absolute impossibility in that country. If com- 
               <br />
               munity of language would accomplish anything, it 
               <br />
               had its community of language. But what did it

               They have not since been able to agree, though 
               <br />
               speaking the same language, and in our own time

               we have found those two German - speaking

               peoples falling upon each other, until at last

               Prussia expelled Austria, her sister country, from 
               <br />

               policy of the hon. gentleman, and go in for an 
               <br />
               obliteration of the French language. That is the

               <br />
               that is to go on all along the line later on. But 
               <br />
               suppose that attempt, absurd as it is, should suc- 
               <br />

               See with what results such attempts have been

               followed? In the consideration of this question it 
               <br />
               might probably be instructive to remind the House

               Mr. MULOCK. And the nobility. Every 
               <br />
               effort was made to impose the French language 
               <br />
               on the Anglo—Saxon people. The result at 
               <br />
               the end of 300 years, at the time of Edward the 
               <br />
               Third, was that the French and the Anglo-Saxons 
               <br />
               had become strangers to each other. The lawyers 
               <br />
               in the courts were not understood by the witnesses, 
               <br />
               the jurors drawn from the Anglo—Saxons could not 
               <br />
               understand the witnesses. At last, it became 
               <br />
               absolutely impossible to carry on business. The 
               <br />
               Anglo-Saxon language at that time was in a far 
               <br />
               greater danger of extinction than it is to-day, be- 
               <br />
               cause at that time the subjection 0f the Anglo- 
               <br />
               Saxons in Great Britain was most complete. The 
               <br />
               Normans were a strong and powerful race, and, of 
               <br />
               course, the times were more barbarous than the 
               <br />
               times in which We live, although my hon. friend 
               <br />
               would have us go back to those times. The relative 
               <br />
               position of the dominant and the subject classes 
               <br />
               was far more dangerous to the predominance of 
               <br />
               Anglo—Saxon institutions than can possibly be said 
               <br />
               to be the case to-day; but under the most dis- 
               <br />
               couraging circumstances one force prevented the 
               <br />
               extinction of the Anglo—Saxon language. The 
               <br />
               people had that vitality in themselves that enabled 
               <br />
               them to resist the threatened danger, and at last 
               <br />
               the French language had to be withdrawn as an 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial language, and in less than half a century 
               <br />
               it almost ceased to be spoken

               <br />
               that the law was changed to the extent of making 
               <br />
               the Anglo-Saxon language the language of the 
               <br />
               courts, and shortly afterwards it was taught in the 
               <br />
               schools; and not by coercion, but by toleration, 
               <br />
               the Anglo-Saxon assumed its pre-eminent position 
               <br />
               and has maintained it ever since. Well, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, let me remind the hon. gentleman of 
               <br />
               another case, namely, the case of Poland. Russia 
               <br />
               made every possible attempt to persecute the 
               <br />
               language of the Poles out of existence ; and, with- 
               <br />
               out being tedious, I may say that the pages of 
               <br />
               history disclose that the persecution to which the 
               <br />
               Polish language was subjected made that language 
               <br />
               more dear to the Polish people and more studied, 
               <br />
               and has added more to its dissemination and per— 
               <br />
               manence than anything else could have done. 
               <br />
               And the same can be said of the Bohemian 
               <br />
               language; and as a singularity of the tenacity of 
               <br />
               language under coercion, I may point to the case 
               <br />
               of a small race or tribe called the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Tenders</span> who 
               <br />
               live in the vicinity of Elbe, who are Prussians 
               <br />
               politically, surrounded on all sides by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Germans.</span> 
               <br />
               An attempt was made to obliterate their language. 
               <br />
               Their population consists of but a few villages, 
               <br />
               surrounded on all sides by people speaking the 
               <br />
