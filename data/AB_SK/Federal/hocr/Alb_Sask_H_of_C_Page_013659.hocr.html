               I have already considered the wisdom or

               unwisdom of conceding this power to the

               <br />
               not repeat my argument as to that; but I 
               <br />
               say that the arguments used to-day in Can-

               <br />
               Territories are precisely the arguments used 
               <br />
               by English statesmen of forty or ﬁfty

               or three years ago and I went into it 
               <br />
               somewhat fully in an address which I de-

               livered in the town of Lindsay in this pro-

               no reason why the views which prevailed

               The same policy was pursued by those who 
               <br />
               prepared the Canadian Confederation Act. 
               <br />
               The provinces were given the control of their 
               <br />
               own public lands in almost every respect. 
               <br />
               The province of Nova Scotia has control of 
               <br />
               its Crown lands and of its mines and miner- 
               <br />
               als. The same rule prevails in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Quebec.</span>

               Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island. In the province of Manitoba the 
               <br />
               lands are still administered. I believe, by 
               <br />
               the Dominion, but some compensation was 
               <br />
               made to that province when it received a 
               <br />
               constitution and I believe that since the 
               <br />
               erection of the province—although my friend 
               <br />
               from Manitoba will know this better than 
               <br />
               I do—the swamp lands have been entrusted 
               <br />
               to the administration of the province and I 
               <br />
               am under the impression. although am not 
               <br />
               sure, that any revenue derived from the 
               <br />
               administration of these swamp lands belongs 
               <br />
               to the province. I am correct in that. am 
               <br />
               I not ?
