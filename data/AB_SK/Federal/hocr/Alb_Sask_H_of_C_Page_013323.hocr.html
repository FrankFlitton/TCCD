               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘VATSON.</span> I took down the sentence which 
               <br />
               followed that statement, in which he said it would 
               <br />
               be cruel if the laws of the land were not printed 
               <br />
               in the language of these nationalities. I do not 
               <br />
               really think he meant it, but, if he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did,</span> it would 
               <br />
               be a very expensive luxury. Sir, I believe the 
               <br />
               amendment of the hon. member for \Vest Assini- 
               <br />
               boia commends itself to a great number of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen in this House. There is no doubt that 
               <br />
               the appeal made by the First Minister yesterday 
               <br />
               to whip his followers into line had considerable 
               <br />
               effect. It was a very strong appeal ; he rose 
               <br />
               equal to the occasion, and to my mind made the 
               <br />
               best speech I ever heard delivered in the House. 
               <br />
               There were none of those little stories with which 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman is accustomed to regale the 
               <br />
               House. But I hope that the amendment of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice will not be adopted, for the 
               <br />
               amendment of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> for West Assiniboia is 
               <br />
               the only one that will satisfy the people of the

               arrived after listening to the discussion. I regret 
               <br />
               that the amendment introduced by the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil) was not carried, 
               <br />
               as I should like to have seen it adopted. That 
               <br />
               amendment having been defeated, I think the next 
               <br />
               best course to take is to adopt the amendment of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice, and I am, therefore, willing 
               <br />
               to vote for it. I am willing to do so because it 
               <br />
               contains an emphatic declaration against the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of the Bill proposed by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). Of course. if that 
               <br />
               amendment went further in the direction of extin- 
               <br />
               guishing the question at once I would feel more 
               <br />
               satisﬁed, for I am afraid it may come back ; but 
               <br />
               under the circumstances, when I see that the 
               <br />
               flame is extending over the country, I think 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst thing to do is to quench it at once. 
               <br />
               I place this question above party considerations, 
               <br />
               and I consider it on the broad principle that we 
               <br />
               must have eace and amity in this country, 
               <br />
               and that its uture depends upon it. It is no 
               <br />
               doubt unfortunate that this subject has been 
               <br />
               brought before the House. It has arrayed a 
               <br />
               compact body of French members against the 
               <br />
               English-speaking members, which is a circumstance

               discussion which has taken place in this House for 
               <br />
               the last few days. The hon. member for Pro- 
               <br />
               vencher said he considered it a fortunate thing 
               <br />
               that this question had been brought before the 
               <br />

               <br />
               a very unfortunate thing. No doubt the hon. 
               <br />
