               <br />
               New Brunswick know of this matter? I have 
               <br />
               never set my foot in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—VVest,</span> and I am 
               <br />
               not as competent as are gentlemen living there, 
               <br />
               to judge as to whether one, two, or three lan- 
               <br />
               guages should be used. It is a question which 
               <br />
               they should determine; to them it should be 
               <br />
               relegated, and I never found yet, if you put 
               <br />
               full and ample trust in the people, that 
               <br />
               the people will fail you. The Liberal party have 
               <br />
               proclaimed time and again their belief in Provincial 
               <br />
               rights. But it is said there are no Provincial 
               <br />
               rights mixed up in this matter because there are no 
               <br />
               Provinces. That is a mere quibble. The basis 
               <br />
               underlying Provincial rights is the same whether 
               <br />
               the people belong to a Territory or belong to a 
               <br />
               Province. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vl’hat</span> is that basis? It is, that upon 
               <br />
               all matters of purely local concern the people more 
               <br />
               immediately affected should determine how the 
               <br />
               matters should be decided. It is the same principle 
               <br />
               either applied to a Province with full political 
               <br />
               rights or to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> Territories with partial 
               <br />
               political rights; the underlying principle is the 
               <br />
               same in both cases. It is said that the people have 
               <br />
               spoken, and that the North-VVest Council has 
               <br />
               already told this House what is the opinion of the 
               <br />
               people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“'est.</span> But that argument has 
               <br />
               been sufﬁciently answered. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives were not elected to do more than legis- 
               <br />
               late within the bounds of the constitution under 
               <br />
               which they were elected ; they were not elected to 
               <br />
               change that constitution or to express to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pare</span> 
               <br />
               liament the voice of the people with respect 
               <br />
               to any such change. The question never came 
               <br />
               before the people at the last election, and if I 
               <br />
               am correctly informed, not two, three or four, 
               <br />
               but six or seven representatives, when the question 
               <br />
               came before them, expressed a desire that the 
               <br />
               question should be relegated to the people, and 
               <br />
               that they should receive instructions from their 
               <br />
               constituents. This Dominion has had enough of 
               <br />
               forcing a change of constitution on Provinces by 
               <br />
               the action of the Legislature, irrespective of the 
               <br />
               people. It was done in Nova Scotia and you have 
               <br />
               an open sore there to this day. You have had a par- 
               <br />

               refer the questions to the people more immediately
