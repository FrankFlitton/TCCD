               increase was made a couple of years ago, 
               <br />

               I am free to say that in the last year or two 
               <br />
               circumstances have changed rapidly, and 
               <br />
               the march of events has been quicker than 
               <br />
               in former years. That is due to the rapid 
               <br />
               increase of the population and the pros- 
               <br />

               friends would think that the situation were 
               <br />
               so urgent if it were not for the fact that 
               <br />
               the population has increased with great 
               <br />
               rapidity. I believe the subject is one that 
               <br />
               requires the greatest of consideration, and 
               <br />
               I fully agree with the members from the 
               <br />
               territories who say that it would be a 
               <br />
               national disaster if we neglected to provide 
               <br />
               for the public service of the territories, so 
               <br />
               that the people would go in there and be-

               lation which is ﬂowing in that direction

               But I venture to say, Mr. Chairman, that 
               <br />
               there is no such grievance existing in the
