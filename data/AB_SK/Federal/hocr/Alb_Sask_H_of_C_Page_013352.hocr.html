               provision for twenty-One elected members When— 
               <br />
               ever the population arrived at a certain point; 
               <br />
               and there was frequent request from the North— 
               <br />
               West to alter the constitution to allow of twenty- 
               <br />
               one elected members. When the Council met to- 
               <br />
               gether, they found that it would be more conveni- 
               <br />
               cut, that it would make a. better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">readjustment—«a</span>

               better gerrymander, as the hon. gentleman would

               call it—if there were twenty-two elected members 
               <br />

               liberate recommendation, and I think we ought to 
               <br />
               leave the provision as it is until they ask for an 
               <br />
               alteration ; because the House must remember 
               <br />
               that the expenses of the Legislature are defrayed 
               <br />
               out of the Dominion treasury. By-and-bye, when 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-IVest</span> Territories become Provinces, they

               Mr. LAURIER. There are at present nineteen

               my hon. friend from Bothwell (Mr. Mills), that as

               during this Session over the clause relating to the 
               <br />
               dual language, a clause which was wholly unneces- 
               <br />
               sary to secure the use of both languages. Now. 
               <br />
               you propose by this restriction to force these peo-

               ple to come here and occupy the time of this

               you gave them the power, better make for them-

               the next few years increases in population while 
               <br />
               the others scarcely increase at all, that district 
               <br />
               will require additional representation ; and that is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> point which the Legislative Assembly is best

               Mr. DAVIN. I have always contended that we 
               <br />
               should have a revenue granted on the same prin- 
               <br />
               ciples as those on which revenues are given to the 
               <br />
               Provinces. But the reason I do not think it neces— 
               <br />
               sary that this clause should be changed, is that I 
               <br />
               have heard no desire expressed on the part of the 
               <br />
               members for a change, and have seen no evidence of 
               <br />
               grievance Whatever in that connection. The only 
               <br />
               thing I have noticed in connection with this clause, 
               <br />
               is that there is a kind of deﬁance on the part of the

               members of three judges who are there. I do not 
               <br />
               know why they should dislike to have them there,

               <br />
               vote, and take no part in the discussions. There is

               only one subject on which the learned judge ever 
               <br />

               <br />

               cessity of changing this clause ; but if, later on, 
               <br />
               when you come to the clause giving the Assembly 
               <br />
               power in great part over the revenue, you should 
               <br />
               make a change so as to give it a little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">executive,</span> 
               <br />
               then, on the third reading, you could recom— 
               <br />
               mit this Bill, and alter, as you logically should, 
               <br />
               this clause. The hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. 
               <br />
               Mills) says that three or four years hence it may 
               <br />
               be found necessary to add to the number of the 
               <br />
               Assembly. Why, Sir, before three or four years 
               <br />
               pass, we shall require to have another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-VVest</span> 
               <br />
               Territories Bill in this House. We shall have a 
               <br />
               census taken ; and I venture to say that we shall 
               <br />
               ﬁnd a far larger number in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> Terri- 
               <br />
               tories than hon. gentlemen, who always speak dis- 
               <br />
               paragingly of that country, give it credit for; and 
               <br />
               that being the case, something will have to be done 
               <br />
               then in order to readjust the representation. If 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman had proposed a practical plan, 
               <br />
               I should see no insuperablc difficulty in altering 
               <br />
               this clause ; but, as a matter of fact, there is no 
               <br />
               grievance. I have never heard a single complaint 
               <br />
               about the number ; I have never heard any of the 
               <br />
               members declare that they ought to be able to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con;</span> 
               <br />
               trol it ; and the only murmur I have heard—— 
               <br />
               in fact they have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">petitionedwwas</span> that they 
               <br />
               objected, for some inscrutable reason, to having 
               <br />
               the three legal experts, there. At present I think 
               <br />
