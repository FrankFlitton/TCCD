               sixth day of this debate, and, certainly, I think 
               <br />
               my hon. friend opposite will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span> with me

               <br />
               we sit until 6 o’clock in the morning, we cannot 
               <br />
               have the division at this sitting. I will, however,
