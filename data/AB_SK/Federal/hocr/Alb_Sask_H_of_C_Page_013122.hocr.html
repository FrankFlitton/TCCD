               Mr. DAVIN. Mr. Speaker, I am addressing a 
               <br />
               lawyer mainly, and I am addressing a legislative 
               <br />

               <br />
               adoption. I want to help my hon. friend, because 
               <br />
               I have devoted some time to the study of history. 
               <br />
               I tell him that no assault from outside, no matter 
               <br />
               how great, no catapults that have been brought 
               <br />
               against that church from outside have ever 
               <br />
               done it the least harm. The only harm that ever 
               <br />
               came to that church has been from volcanic erup- 
               <br />
               tions from within, and then the overﬂowings have 
               <br />
               carried away some of her fairest possessions. So 
               <br />
               that I help my hon. friend. I tell him this: the 
               <br />
               ‘way to strengthen the Catholic Church is to assail 
               <br />
               -it, and the way to solidify and make French 
               <br />
               Canadians united —- and I do not think the 
               <br />
               French Canadian is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> very objectionable person, 
               <br />
               for some of the most charming men and most 
               <br />
               intelligent men I ever met were French 
               <br />
               Canadians —— but still, as my hon. friend, with 
               <br />
               his superior culture, does not like them, I may 
               <br />
               tell him that if he wants to make the French 
               <br />
               Canadian permanent and the French language en- 
               <br />
               during, the way to do it is to put the backs of the 
               <br />
               ‘people up by such assaults as he is making 
               <br />

               <br />
               character of the other glorious tasks he performed. 
               <br />
               The only comparison I can think of is this: I 
               <br />
               once called on a college friend of mine who had 
               <br />
               married for money a wife who was somewhat old, 
               <br />
               and he said to me when I was leaving at night, 
               <br />
               “ What do you think of her, Davin ? ” “ Well, 
               <br />
               Jack,” I said, “ I wish I had known your taste, 
               <br />
               for I think I could have got you something older 
               <br />
               than that.” Well, Sir, if I had known the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman’s taste was in that direction I think I 
               <br />
               could have got him at least as glorious a task. 
               <br />
               Why, Sir, when I read that, I remembered a joke 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend the Premier the other day. 
               <br />
               That right hon. gentleman, speaking of the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Victoria (Mr. Earle), said, with his usual 
               <br />
               ready wit, that we were better off in this House 
               <br />
               than the House of Commons in England, 
               <br />
               for we had an “ earl ” amongst us. When 
               <br />
               I read that glorious statement of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), 
               <br />
               I thought we were better off still, for we have a 
               <br />
               hero in this House—a hero who chants his own 
               <br />
               epic, and there he sits. I say, Sir, that there is 
               <br />
               no foundation whatever for these propositions laid 
               <br />
               down by my hon. friend (Mr. McCarthy), and I 
               <br />
               will prove that these propositions are false and 
               <br />
               misleading, and that, therefore, for a statesman as 
               <br />
               my friend is, and for a man of great inﬂuence and 
               <br />
               popular power to disseminate those fallacies 
               <br />
               throughout the country, is a very great crime and 
               <br />
               a very great misdemeanor at the bar of history. I 
               <br />
               would not care in the least what he proposed to do 
               <br />
               if he did not fall into such fallacies, misleading as 
               <br />
               they are and calculated to beget ideas which may 
               <br />
               indeed tend to the disruption of this country. 
               <br />
               Now, Sir, I will prove that there is not a tittle of 
               <br />
               foundation for his arguments. My hon. friend, when 
               <br />
               he was making his speech on this subject in the 
               <br />
               House, resorted to authority. It was a very nat- 
               <br />
               ural thing for a lawyer to do, yet I may say this, 
               <br />
               that what I should expect from a statesman would 
               <br />
               be “ reasoning ” on this question. I should expect 
               <br />
               from him that he would reason this question from 
               <br />
               historical facts ; and the historical facts bearing on 
               <br />
               it are numerous enough. I should expect reasoning 
               <br />
               from him from the existing political phenomena in 
               <br />
               Europe, and then I should expect that he would 
               <br />
               draw deductions. But what does my hon. and 
               <br />
               learned friend do? He comes to us with 
               <br />
               authorities like a lawyer going before a court of 
               <br />
               appeal, and what, let me ask, are his authorities? 
               <br />
               Magazine articles, and some of them written by 
               <br />
               trumpery writers whose names will not even 0 
               <br />
               down the gutter of time. Now, the hon. gent 6- 
               <br />
               man might have gone to many existing countries 
               <br />
               for a parallel. He might have gone especially to 
               <br />
               Switzerland. My hon. friend from Bothwell (Mr. 
               <br />
               Mills) suggested Switzerland, and then my hon. 
               <br />
               and learned friend (Mr. McCarthy) interjected the 
               <br />
               remark, “ The French language is an exception in 
               <br />
               Switzerlan .” What the meaning of that observa-
