               our Protestant friends in the Province of Quebec,

               who have not complained, are taken to task and

               rather the negation of principle, at the bottom of 
               <br />
               the Bill presented by my hon. friend from Simcoe? 
               <br />
               It is coercion in a matter Where coercion cannot 
               <br />
               exist. Coercion has been tried in several coun- 
               <br />
               tries in matters of language and religion, and 
               <br />
               everywhere it has been tried the result has been 
               <br />
               contrary not only to expectations, but in a large 
               <br />
               measure contrary to the wish of those who have 
               <br />
               employed such means. Now, it is a very sad 
               <br />
               thing to see how the lessons of history are lost for 
               <br />
               our Equal Rights people, and how much, by 
               <br />
               neglecting this part of their education, they are 
               <br />
               drifting into a channel of narrow ideas. During 
               <br />
               the early part of the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regime</span> in Canada, 
               <br />
               compulsion and coercion was trio with a. view of 
               <br />
               welding together the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different.</span> elements of popula- 
               <br />
               tion, so as to form a homogeneous nation, and it- 
               <br />
               was always found that this coercion had a result 
               <br />
               quite contrary to what was expected. The most 
               <br />
               enlightened Of our governors have declared time' 
               <br />
               and again that the only way to strengthen British 
               <br />
               rule in Canada was to conciliate the King’s new 
               <br />
               subjects. Such was the opinion of'General <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mar;</span>

               broad policy inaugurated by the English Govern-

               ment years ago, but they should not overlook the 
               <br />
               fact that if they can boast to-day of the title of

               British citizens, which they profess to value so

               <br />
               people they seem to hate and despise. What would

               would still be a. British country. It is a matter of 
               <br />
               history that the Governors of Canada in olden 
               <br />
               times would arrive here imbued with prejudices 
               <br />
               against the “ Canadians,” and that, after studying 
               <br />
               the country, these prejudices would make way for 
               <br />
               sounder notions leading to a. change of policy. Im-

               mediately after the conquest, General Murray

               men they were so friendly to some months ago. I 
               <br />
               am amazed to ﬁnd men of the day, aspiring to be 
               <br />
               the leaders of the people, reversing the policy in- 
               <br />
               augurated by men whose position placed them above 
               <br />
               the passions of the moment. When I see that the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst Governors under the British rule, before the 
               <br />
               Quebec Act of 1874, and even during the military 
               <br />
               rule, condescended to publish the laws and the 
               <br />
               ordinances in French, ‘I have a right to ex- 
               <br />
               press my surprise that this meagre measure of 
               <br />
               justice appears in the eyes of certain gentlemen to 
               <br />
               be too large for the French population of the western 
               <br />
               Territories. French was used, more than a century 
               <br />
               ago, to bring the ordinances before the people, 
               <br />
               and that, after a terrible war, when vanquished 
               <br />
               and conquerors were face to face ; and now, after a. 
               <br />
               union of over one century, this simple act of justice, 
               <br />
               of international courtesy, which costs the country 
               <br />
               the enormous sum <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of»</span> ﬁve hundred dollars a year, 
               <br />
               is considered out of place and too generous. If you 
               <br />
               expect to make a great country with such ideas you 
               <br />
               are sadly mistaken. Sir Henry Summer Maine and 
               <br />
               Sir Alfred Lyell have claimed as one of the brightest 
               <br />
