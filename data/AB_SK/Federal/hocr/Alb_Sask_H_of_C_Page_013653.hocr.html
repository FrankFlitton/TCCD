               It is with much satisfaction that I note that the 
               <br />
               government has so far appreciated the position 
               <br />
               of affairs in the territories as to approve, in the 
               <br />
               most practical manner possible, of our methods 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               pear, however, to have escaped your observation 
               <br />
               that the placing of the appropriation to cover our 
               <br />
               expenditures of last year in the supplementary 
               <br />
               estimates for the coming Dominion ﬁscal year 
               <br />
               will have the effect of keeping the money from 
               <br />
               the territorial revenue until after the ﬁrst day of 
               <br />
               July next. All the representations we have made 
               <br />
               —both written and oral-—have been to the effect 
               <br />
               that the supplementary appropriation is desired 
               <br />
               to the current ﬁscal year’s appropriations, so 
               <br />
               that the money may be rendered available at 
               <br />
               the earliest possible moment. To do otherwise 
               <br />
               can only embarrass us still further, and I would 
               <br />
               submit that with a prospective surplus of thir- 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the present ﬂourishing condition of these ter- 
               <br />
               ritories, the Dominion will not be put to any 
               <br />
               very serious inconvenience by granting us the

               further consideration of the subject you will see

               Your telegram makes no mention whatever of

               <br />
               ever with that subject. In discussing the various 
               <br />
               phases of the question of territorial ﬁnances, it 
               <br />
               has been found necessary at times to point out 
               <br />
               that our limited and inadequate revenues were 
               <br />
               more restricted. and rendered only more in- 
               <br />
               adequate, by the necessity for making expendi- 
               <br />
               tures out of current income which in themselves 
               <br />
               were more properly chargeable to a capital ac- 
               <br />
               count. That is to say, we have occasionally found 
               <br />
               it necessary to incur heavy expenditures for the 
               <br />
               construction of bridges the cost of which has 
               <br />
               been a heavy drain upon our revenues, and which 
               <br />
               should have been spread over a series of years 
               <br />
               instead of being provided for out of the revenue 
               <br />
               of one year. to the exclusion of other and equally 
               <br />
               important works. But we have never asked for 
               <br />
               the establishment of a capital account, and we 
               <br />
               do not wish for the establishment of such an 
               <br />
               account until a more satisfactory subsidy or 
               <br />

               proposal as that made in your telegram. In one 
               <br />
               sense, I quite agree with you that ‘it will be 
               <br />
               better that all bridges in territories be left to 
               <br />
               the territorial govern-ment,’ but that proposi- 
               <br />
               ion must be coupled with another, namely, that 
               <br />
               adequate ﬁnancial provision therefor be made 
               <br />
               by parliament. The Dominion government in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place built the two bridges at M-acleod and 
               <br />
               Lethbridge without reference to the government 
               <br />
               of the territories. It was possible that at the 
               <br />
               time they were built it was not practicable to 
               <br />
               do so, but the fact remains that, in pursuance 
               <br />
               of its general public works policy, the Domin- 
               <br />

               <br />
