               made by parliament itself. I have no doubt 
               <br />
               that parliament can create a power to do 
               <br />
               the redistribution, but the power is also 
               <br />
               vested in parliament, and all governments 
               <br />
               up to the present time have interpreted it 
               <br />
               in that way. I believe it was more in ac- 
               <br />
               cordance with the public interpretation of 
               <br />
               popular government to have that supreme 
               <br />
               power carried into effect by parliament it— 
               <br />
               self. The other question to which the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman (Mr. Borden) has referred is a 
               <br />
               far more serious one; namely, the method 
               <br />
               of counting the votes and distributing them. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend has stated, and rightly 
               <br />
               stated, that upon this point we are abso- 
               <br />
               lutely bound by the British North America 
               <br />
               Act; we are not at liberty to assign so much 
               <br />
               to this province or so much to the other 
               <br />
               province; we must follow the results of the 
               <br />
               census, according to the terms laid down 
               <br />
               in the British North America Act. But there 
               <br />
               can be a way of counting the votes and as- 
               <br />
               certaining that proportion. We have re- 
               <br />
               ceived a very strong appeal from some of 
               <br />
               the provinces, particularly from the province 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick, and my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice has taken the precaution 
               <br />
               to have this matter referred to the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court and to have as speedy a decision as 
               <br />
               possible. Whether or not it would be advis- 
               <br />
               able to carry it to the Judicial Committee 
               <br />
               of the Privy Council is a matter on which 
               <br />
               it is premature to pronounce. I suppose 
               <br />
               that in this we will be guided very much 
               <br />
               by the judgment of the Supreme Court. If 
               <br />
               that judgment be of such a character as to 
               <br />
               leave no doubt, either one way or the other, 
               <br />
               there would be no necessity to push the 
               <br />
               matter further. Perhaps it may be advis- 
               <br />
               able to do so, but the government are not 
               <br />
               prepared to decide that point deﬁnitely at 
               <br />
               present. My hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colleague</span> the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice, has taken steps to have the mat-

               ter referred to the Supreme Court and have 
               <br />

               hope that in a few weeks we will be able to 
               <br />

               <br />
               such a measure as that submitted to us. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman has pointed out 
               <br />
               that the government has decided to sub-

               mit to the Supreme Court a reference on 
               <br />

               the representation of any of the provinces. 
               <br />
               But practically what difference can there 
               <br />
               be in submitting the case to the Supreme 
               <br />

               <br />
               ed of county court judges, other than the 
               <br />
               intrinsic merits and abilities of the members 
               <br />
               of the respective courts? We know that 
               <br />
               if legislation be based on the decision of the 
               <br />
               Supreme Court and if the constitutionality 
               <br />
               of that legislation be disputed before the 
               <br />
               Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, 
               <br />
               that body would be in no way bound by 
               <br />
               the decision of the Supreme Court. In a 
               <br />
               matter of such importance, not only as affect- 
               <br />
               ing the present, but as laying down a pre- 
               <br />
               cedent and doctrine for future redistribu- 
               <br />
               tions, it seems to me that the least the gOV- 
               <br />
               ernment should do would be to obtain the 
               <br />

               <br />
               that our legislation will be unassallable. I 
               <br />
               do not intend to argue that the construction

               <br />
               not necessary for the argument I intend 
               <br />
               making. What I wish to point out is that 
               <br />
               if it be doubtful that this House has a

               <br />
               certainty that we have the power to pass 
               <br />
               such legislation, we ought certainly to ob-

               In the second place, I do not propose to 
               <br />
               argue that the government is wrong in its 
               <br />
               contention, for if I were to do so, I would 
               <br />
               be submitting to this House an argument 
               <br />
               which would be more properly made in a 
               <br />
               court of law, as this House is not so con- 
               <br />
               stituted as to be the proper forum before

               which to argue an intricate question of 
               <br />
               law'. I would prefer that such a question
