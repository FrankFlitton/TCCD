               <br />
               not contain the information sought for, and I wish 
               <br />
               to call the attention of the Minister to that fact. 
               <br />
               The notice of motion asked for the number of 
               <br />

               Prince Edward Island, but the Minister does not 
               <br />
               give that; he merely gives the names and the 
               <br />
               number of those who were ﬁned, and those who 
               <br />
               paid those ﬁnes and those who did not. I say 
               <br />
               the answer in the return is not complete. As 
               <br />
               there seems to be a desire in the House to not

               Mr. CHARLTON. Mr. Speaker: I realise, Sir,

               that the question under discussion is one likely to 
               <br />
               provoke angry feelings and race prejudices, and I

               <br />
               make to—day in a conciliatory spirit. I shall of 
               <br />
               course feel bound to state my convictions, but I 
               <br />
               shall endeavor to do so courteously, and without, 
               <br />
               at all events, giving needless offence. I shall not 
               <br />
               agree With many of my fellow members of the

               <br />
               I shall ask of them that toleration that I accord 
               <br />
               to them in the discussion of this matter. It is, 
               <br />
               Sir, a disquietening question, and necessarily so. 
               <br />
               It is to be regretted that it is disquieting, but it 
               <br />
               cannot be helped. We might purchase quiet by

               The speakers who have addressed the House on 
               <br />
               this subject in the earlier part of this debate have, 
               <br />
               as a rule, taken the ground that a community of 
               <br />
               language in a country is not essential; many of 
               <br />
               them, indeed, I infer from their remarks, entertain 
               <br />
               the opinion that it is not even desirable. We have 
               <br />
               had the example of states in ancient times, cited 
               <br />
               here in a sense which would lead one to suppose 
               <br />
               that the speakers thought the example of those 
               <br />
               states worthy to be copied by us. We have had 
               <br />
               allusion made by the hon. member for Assiniboia 
               <br />
               (Mr. Davin) to the fact that of the federal unions 
               <br />
               now existing in the world two of them do not 
               <br />
               possess community of language ; and I think, Sir, 
               <br />
               if we regard the history, the present position and 
               <br />
               the progress of those three federal unions, we shall 
               <br />
               ﬁnd a very striking argument in favor of the 
               <br />
               doctrine I have advanced, that a community of 
               <br />
               language is desirable; for certame neither the 
               <br />
               federal union of the cantons of Switzerland, 
               <br />
               nor that of the Provinces of Canada, bears 
               <br />
               any comparison with the federal union of 
               <br />
               the United States in point of development, 
               <br />
               population and power. The hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               Assiniboia treated us the other night to an ex— 
               <br />
               ceedingly witty speech ; I do not know that I can 
               <br />
               say that the spirit of the speech was quite in 
               <br />
               keeping with the magnitude and importance of 
               <br />
               the question he had under discussion. In the 
               <br />
               course of his speech he said that if you wished to 
               <br />
               make the French language permanent, you had 
               <br />
               but to attempt to restrict it. I do not know that 
               <br />
               the experience of the world would bear that 
               <br />
               assertion out. I do not know that the French 
               <br />
               language has been made permanent in the 
               <br />
               United States. Louisiana soon after was admitted 
               <br />
               into the American Union, the French language 
               <br />
               was not sanctioned as an ofﬁcial language ; 
               <br />
               and the result of that prohibition or restric- 
               <br />
               tion, if the hon. member prefers the latter 
               <br />
               term, has not been to make the language per— 
               <br />
               manent, but, on the contrary, to thoroughly 
               <br />
               diffuse and assimilate with the American element 
               <br />
               the French population near the mouth of the 
               <br />
               Mississippi; and I do not believe that any fair 
               <br />
               or proper attempt to secure the dominance of 
               <br />
               the English tongue in this country will have the 
               <br />
               result of making the French language predominant 
               <br />
               or increasing its use in the country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span>

               My hon. friend from North York (Mr. Mulock) 
               <br />
               gave us a very nice essay on ancient history. He 
               <br />
               went back to the days of Queen Esther, and told 
               <br />
               us how King Ahasuerus sent his letters in 127 
               <br />
               different languages to 127 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> provinces.

               Well, Sir, if the hon. gentleman had gone a little 
               <br />
               further back, which he might ve roperly have 
               <br />
               done, to the time of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Town</span> of l, he would 
               <br />
