               I think that objection in itself is very weak. 
               <br />
               it is, as has been said, one that will always 
               <br />
               exist. There will always be a difference of 
               <br />
               opinion on that subject. There is one thing 
               <br />
               I can tell the hon. member for East Assini— 
               <br />
               bola, and that is, if only one province is 
               <br />
               granted, a great many of his own constitu- 
               <br />
               ents will favour annexation to Manitoba. 
               <br />
               But most people. I think. in the territories 
               <br />
               are favourable to two provinces. However. 
               <br />
               that is a question of detail. as Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               tain said. that could be left in abeyance.
