               French language is to him a foreign tongue, it 
               <br />
               seems to me that the request is a very reasonable 
               <br />
               one. Mr. Speaker, I would be most unwilling 
               <br />
               in any way to do violence to the sentiments of my 
               <br />
               French Canadian friends ; I would be as unwilling 
               <br />
               to do so as I am sure they would be unwilling to 
               <br />
               do violence to my sentiments. I would even be 
               <br />
               willing to go some length in deference to their pre- 
               <br />
               judices, as I believe they would be willing to go 
               <br />
               some length to meet my prejudices. But though 
               <br />
               I am prepared to go a long way for peace and 
               <br />
               friendship, even for the attainment of such objects 
               <br />
               as these, I am not prepared to go as far as to betray 
               <br />
               the people of my own ﬂesh and blood; I am not 
               <br />
               prepared to go so far as to say that I will ignore 
               <br />
               the voice of the Legislature which we ourselves 
               <br />
               have felt it our duty to establish there. I would 
               <br />
               consider that I was doing them a gross injustice, 
               <br />
               and I shall endeavor, for my part, to mete out to 
               <br />
               them the same measure of justice that I would 
               <br />
               hope to have meted out to myself.

               Mr. SUTHERLAND. I do not think I would 
               <br />
               have attempted to address the House upon this 
               <br />
               question, had it not been for the remarks of the 
               <br />
               hon. member who has just taken his seat (Mr. 
               <br />
               McNeill). I think it was a very inopportune time 
               <br />
               for the hon. member to make the attack he did on 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from West Durham (Mr. Blake), 
               <br />
               just after the able, patriotic and broad-minded 
               <br />
               speech that he had made, showing that he was 
               <br />
               able to rise above party and express in a patriotic 
               <br />
               manner the views he held. I regret that the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman should have taken this opportunity to 
               <br />
               make such a Wild charge against the character 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend from West Durham, although he 
               <br />
               requires no defence at my hand, either in this 
               <br />
               House or in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country;</span> Sir, the position that 
               <br />
               my hon. friend took upon the Reil question only 
               <br />
               entitled him, I think, to still greater credit before 
               <br />
               this House and the people of Canada. To my mind 
               <br />
               he had everything to lose from a political point 
               <br />
               of view, and nothing to gain, from the position he 
               <br />
               took on that question ; and although I did not vote 
               <br />
               with him, although he was my leader, whom I 
               <br />
               respected and admired then as I do at the present 
               <br />
               time, I exercised my humble judgment according 
               <br />
               to the best of my ability, nor did that hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man ever complain of the position that I took at 
               <br />
               that time. I think, Sir, that it is to be regretted 
               <br />
               that this question has come before the House at 
               <br />
               all, considering the course the discussion has 
               <br />
               taken. The discussion has taken a wide range, 
               <br />
               and many matters have been referred to that are 
               <br />
               likely to raise bad feeling throughout the country, 
               <br />
               not only between people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> nationalities, 
               <br />
               but between those professing different religious 
               <br />
               creeds ; and this has been attributed to the speeches 
               <br />
               made by my hon. friend from North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) on other occasions outside of the House, 
               <br />
               as well as to the remarks he made on the introduction 
               <br />
               of this Bill. I must also say, Mr. Speaker, that I 
               <br />
               think that the heated and passionate address of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Public Works last night is very much 
               <br />
               to be regretted. I do not think that hon. Minister 
               <br />
               was at all justiﬁed in making the remarks he did 
               <br />
               on this particular question. Had the hon. Minister 
               <br />
               any ound for the attack he made upon the people of 
               <br />
               the rovince of Ontario that they were intolerant 
               <br />
               towards their fellow-countrymen in Quebec, and 
               <br />
               the French—speaking people of this country? The

               to the members on this side, who are proud of him 
               <br />
               as their leader, but I may say to every member on 
               <br />
               the other side of the House as well ; a gentleman 
               <br />
               whose patriotism is well known, who has on several 
               <br />
               occasions taken a broad-minded and liberal view of 
               <br />
               questions, in opposition to what we know to be 
               <br />
               the sentiments, easily aroused, of his race in the 
               <br />
               Province of Quebec, which he represents here. 
               <br />
               That being the case, I think it is to be regretted 
               <br />
               that the Minister of Public Works should have 
               <br />
               made the passionate appeal he did and have 
               <br />
               attacked the people of Ontario, and have appealed 
               <br />
               to his French Canadian friends irrespective of 
               <br />
               party to stand by him on the present occasion. In 
               <br />
               my humble opinion he did not consider that the 
               <br />
               constitutional rights of the people of Quebec were 
               <br />
               being attacked at the present time, or that there 
               <br />
               was any danger whatever to him or to his party or 
               <br />
               his nationality or the creed of the people whom he 
               <br />
               represents. It is only fair, after the attack made 
               <br />
               by the hon. member who has taken his seat, 
               <br />
               giving as his reason why this agitation has been 
               <br />
               carried on throughout Ontario, that I should thus 
               <br />
               express my opinion. In my humble judgment, I 
               <br />
               may say to my French Canadian friends on 
               <br />
               both sides of the House, that I do not think 
               <br />
               there is any particular danger to their constitu- 
               <br />
               tional rights or their civil or religious liberties. 
               <br />
               If I were to express my true feelings on this mat- 
               <br />
               ter I would say that, judging by the articles in the 
               <br />
               press which support the Dominion Government, 
               <br />
               judging by the resolutions passed at party meetings 
               <br />
               throughout Ontario, there is no particular fault 
               <br />
               found with the action of this House or with this 
               <br />
               Government, for the newspapers and the party 
               <br />
               with whom the hon. Minister works in harmony 
               <br />
               do not ﬁnd fault with the leader of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment and hold him and his colleagues responsible 
               <br />
               for this agitation, but all the blame is cast upon 
               <br />
               Mr. Mowat and the Ontario Government. Does 
               <br />
               not the Minister of Public Works know that the 
               <br />
               only charge brought forward in Ontario against 
               <br />
               the Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,of</span> that Province and the only 
               <br />
               charge brought by the Conservative party, with 
               <br />
               whom he works so well, is that Mr. Mowat is 
               <br />
               allowing French to be taught in the public schools 
               <br />
               in some parts of Ontario, and that he has been 
               <br />
               truckling to the Catholic Church ? These are the 
               <br />
               charges made, and I am sure when the elections take 
               <br />
               place a few months hence that will be the last we 
               <br />
               will hear about this, which appears to be at present 
               <br />
               a very important and serious question, so far 
               <br />
               as many of the Conservatives in Ontario are con- 
               <br />
               cerned. No doubt my hon. friend, the Minister 
               <br />
               of Public Works will ﬁnd time, instead of offer- 
               <br />
