               Winnipeg has shut all these up. Mr. Allen, the son of 
               <br />
               a Toronto brewer, had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">810.000</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">812,000</span> invested in a

               this four per cent. beer coming in. Now, whatisto be done ? 
               <br />
               There is a great desire on the part of many ple for a 
               <br />
               plebiscite, but a plebiscite is not known to the ritish con- 
               <br />
               stitution, and it might be a doubtful way of settling this 
               <br />
               matter. Let me tell you that Mr. Bliss, who is at the head 
               <br />
               of one of the temperance organisations, visited the North- 
               <br />
               West last summer, and stop at Medicine Hat, Calgary, 
               <br />
               and other places ; and after returning to Winnipeg he issued 
               <br />
               a pronunciamento in which he said that it was of vital im- 
               <br />
               portance that the liquor question should be settled in the 
               <br />
               N orth-West Territory, and that the morals of the com- 
               <br />
               munity required that it should be settled—how ? By pro- 
               <br />
               hibition ? No, but by high license. This Mr. Bliss will, 
               <br />
               no doubt, beknown to my hon. friend from Norfolk. The 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly proposed themselves to take the 
               <br />
               opinion of the people on the subject, and to pay the cost of 
               <br />
               doing so out of their own funds; but the judges whom they 
               <br />
               consulted told them that would be ultra circa. Then they 
               <br />
               passed this resolution:

               <br />
               Of course, if the power were granted before they could 
               <br />
               legislate, one of two things should be done. They should 
               <br />
               not be allowed to use the power until after their term ex- 
               <br />
               pired and they went to the country, or a dissolution should 
               <br />
               take place, in order that they might go to the country, and 
               <br />
               have the question decided at the polls. That would, no

               Now, I would state this argument to the House. Under 
               <br />
               the Manitoba Act of 1870, 1,400,000 acres of land were set 
               <br />
               apart for half-breed children. These did not extend out- 
               <br />
               side of Manitoba. Therefore, the primitive contract made 
               <br />
               between the Government and the half-breeds did not ex- 
               <br />
               tend outside of Manitoba, or to any other half-breeds or 
               <br />
               bands of half-breeds. We acknowledge the Indian title in 
               <br />
               the half-breed; we acknowledge that he has the Indian title. 
               <br />
               When we come to extinguish the Indian title with a band 
               <br />
               of Indians, what do we do ? We make a treaty with them. 
               <br />
               We do not insist that Treaty six shall do for what we after- 
               <br />
               wards call Treaty seven. We do not insist that a treaty 
               <br />
               with the Blackfeet will do for a treaty with the Grace, but 
               <br />
               we act, as do sensible men in ordinary life; we deal frankly 
               <br />
               with the persons with whom we have to deal, in regard to 
               <br />
               the interests they control. Those half-breeds in the N orth- 
               <br />
               West were not in Manitoba at the time the Manitoba Act 
               <br />
               was , and the arrangement made to extinguish the 
               <br />
               Indian title in Manitoba. As we took no steps—and 
               <br />
               it was our fault that we took none—to extinguish the title 
               <br />
               in 1870 of the halt-breeds in the N orth- West, and did noth- 
               <br />
               ing in 1885, how can we say to the half-breeds in the 
               <br />
               North-West in 1885: Now, we are going to deal with you as 
               <br />
               though on had been dealt with already in 1870 in Mani- 
               <br />
               toba. Iy could never see the reason which would justify 
               <br />
               that position being taken, and I am perfectly certain 
               <br />
               the matter has only to be brought to the attention of Par- 
               <br />
               liament and the Government to lead them to do what is 
               <br />
               etatesmanlike and prOper—to lead them to deal with the 
               <br />
               half-breeds <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> who were not in Manitoba and were not 
               <br />
               dealt with at that time, on the looting of the present, 
               <br />
               and on the same principle on which was based the 
               <br />
               settlement with the half-breeds in Manitoba, and give to the 
               <br />
               children that exist <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> what was given to the children 
               <br />
               in 1870. As a fact, the name of every half- breed child born 
               <br />
               in the country, up to the 20th April, 1885, is on record in 
               <br />
               the Department of the Interior, so that it is not necessary 
               <br />
               to do more than look into the amdavits. Then comes the 
               <br />
               third resolution in regard to the question of scrip :
