               Justice that the North-west Territories did

               <br />

               putation; he says that he has no doubt as 
               <br />
               to the opinion of the Supreme Court in the.

               <br />
               opinion of Mr. Christopher Robinson. I, a 
               <br />
               layman, perhaps, should not speak particul- 
               <br />
               arly of the interpretation of an Act of par- 
               <br />
               liament or statute, but I am clearly of a 
               <br />
               different way of thinking. I understand 
               <br />
               the meaning of the English language, 1 un- 
               <br />
               derstand the meaning of the surroundings 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act. This 
               <br />
               was a bargain between the four provinces 
               <br />
               entering into confederation and the repre- 
               <br />
               sentation either increased or decreased, was 
               <br />

               <br />
               them. The hon. Minister of Justice says 
               <br />
               that on addresses from this House and on 
               <br />
               addresses from the provinces or territories 
               <br />
               coming into confederation, the governing

               contradictory or against the tenor of the

               <br />
               foundland for the purpose of securing her 
               <br />
               admission to the confederation by which 
               <br />
               Newfoundland would have an abnormal re-

               <br />
               be decreased ?—the hon. Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               said ‘yes.’ It becomes, he said, in fact, an 
               <br />
               imperial Act of parliament and if upon an

               <br />

               <br />
               the reason that they did not know when it 
               <br />
               would perhaps occur to themselves. The 
               <br />
               principle I lay down is that although the 
               <br />
               power may be there I doubt very much if 
               <br />
               itcan be exercised except under extraordin— 
               <br />
               ary circumstances, that once they grant a 
               <br />
               constitution to a country they have no power 
               <br />
               to revoke it without cause. I contend that 
               <br />
               the clause in regard to representation has no 
               <br />

               or territory which is admitted into Canada

               perial authorities on an address from this

               parliament giving it representation in the 
               <br />

               Justice contend that they could pass an Act

               ﬂuence in the Dominion, all we have to do 
               <br />
               is to pass an address to the imperial au- 
               <br />
               thorities asking for an Act of parliament 
               <br />
               to reduce the representation of Quebec. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice seems to have set aside

               <br />
               clauses from an Order in Council passed by 
               <br />
               Sir John Macdonald and on which the Im- 
               <br />
               perial Act of 1871 was passed. It says :
