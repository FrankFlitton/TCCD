               heard, after all the abuse that has been heaped 
               <br />
               upon my devoted head, I ask : Do not those words of

               have ﬁrst set up a man of straw and then 
               <br />
               attacked him. The hon. member for Bothwell 
               <br />
               contended that I had not gone far <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough—that</span> 
               <br />
               I ought to have struck at the language here in

               this chamber and in the Province of Quebec— 
               <br />
               that I ought to have prevented its use in the pulpit, 
               <br />
               on the platform, in the schools, and so on. Why, Sir, 
               <br />
               we have nothing to do with these matters ; we have 
               <br />
               no call to meddle with them; butIam glad to be able 
               <br />
               to inform the hon. gentleman that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly are themselves dealing with 
               <br />
               this matter of the schools, which is, perhaps, the 
               <br />
               most important of all. They, discovering as they 
               <br />
               did lately, just as we have discovered lately, what 
               <br />
               was going on in the so-called Separate schools in 
               <br />
               the French settlements, have already, in advance 
               <br />
               of the Province of Ontario, put an end to that, and 
               <br />
               the teaching is now in the English tongue. What 
               <br />
               I have sought for here is that which is in our 
               <br />
               power. We have this enormous territory yet to 
               <br />
               be peopled by millions, and do we want to have 
               <br />
               repeated there the spectacle which is presented on 
               <br />
               the ﬂoor of this House, or the spectacle, still more 
               <br />
               deplorable from a patriotic point of view, which is 
               <br />
               depicted in the Legislative Chamber of the Pro— 
               <br />
               Vince of Quebec? Do you want that, Sir? It 
               <br />
               would be better that we all spoke French than 
               <br />
               that half of us should speak French and half of us 
               <br />
               English.

               that Province ; it has no reference even to this

               Mr. MCCARTHY. There was not one word

               during the argument, which I took part in, which 
               <br />
               would lead to that conclusion. At all events, the 
               <br />
               observation of a judge during an argument is not 
               <br />
               a decision.
