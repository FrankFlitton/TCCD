               <br />
               established throughout the length and breadth of

               <br />
               it is not in his heart, nor is it his intention, to adopt

               <br />

               that such a mode of action would be utterly

               French members who have been alarmed on the 
               <br />
               present occasion. I have spent a good part of my 
               <br />
               life in France, and my boyhood and early manhood 
               <br />
               are associated with the pleasures of that country, 
               <br />
               and I have seized every opportunity I have had 
               <br />
               since manhood to renew my acquaintance with 
               <br />
               France; and, therefore, I enter on a discussion of 
               <br />
               such a subject as this with no sympathy for any 
               <br />
               fanatics, but with a desire to arrive at some result 
               <br />
               which may be satisfactory to all parties, and which 
               <br />
               may be for the ultimate beneﬁt of our common 
               <br />
               country. I regret that religious animosities should 
               <br />
               have been excited, for I can never forget that over 
               <br />
               three hundred years ago, it was the Catholic Lord 
               <br />
               Howard of Efﬁngham who led the ﬂeet of England 
               <br />
               against the Spanish Armada, and that he did so 
               <br />
               after having kissed the hand of the English Queen, 
               <br />
               whom he knew had been declared by the Sovereign 
               <br />
               Pontiﬁ' to be illegitimate, to be a heretic, and to 
               <br />
               have been excommunicated. I cannot help think- 
               <br />
               ing that during the whole of this debate we have 
               <br />
               been moving on too high a plane, and have been 
               <br />
               led away by the preamble of the Bill, to which most 
               <br />
               of the efforts of opponents of the Bill have been 
               <br />
               directed. I might take the ground, following the 
               <br />
               decision of last year arrived at by the authorities on 
               <br />
               constitutional law, on both sides of this House, that 
               <br />
               the preamble has nothing to do with the Bill, that 
               <br />
               we must consider the Bill itself ; that was the doc- 
               <br />
               trine proclaimed last year, and it is one which may 
               <br />
               be applied on the present occasion. But, apart from 
               <br />
               the preamble, when you look at the Bill, what is it ? 
               <br />
               It is a Bill founded simply on the petition of a number 
               <br />
               of gentlemen in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> Territories, called 
               <br />
               the Legislative Council. Those gentlemen, rightly 
               <br />
               or wrongly, wisely or unwisely, have been entrusted 
               <br />
               with the management of the affairs of the North- 
               <br />
               West Territories. They have the conﬁdence, so 
               <br />
               far as we know, of the electors of these Territories, 
               <br />

               <br />
               have asked to be relieved of a disability which was 
               <br />
               imposed upon them, and which they never re-

               <br />

               <br />
               returns of the last census in 1885, and I ﬁnd in the 
               <br />
               North-West Territories the whole population by 
               <br />

               <br />
               savage Indians 20,170, leaving a population of 
               <br />
               28,192 ; and of that number the French population 
               <br />
               amounted to 1,5 ; or only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5,3</span> per cent. of the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immediately.</span> I am kindly reminded by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, that there is another population in the 
               <br />
               North-VVest Territories, a half-breed French popu- 
               <br />
               lation. I am aware of the fact that that popula- 
               <br />
               tion numbers 3,387, but I understand on reliable 
               <br />
               authority that this is not a French-speaking popu- 
               <br />
               lation, but a population which speaks the Cree 
               <br />
               lan uage, and I do not think I am entitled to 
               <br />
               ran them with the 1,520 French in the Territories. 
               <br />
               At all events, I cannot put them on the same foot— 
               <br />
               ing. I will go further, and say, that since that 
               <br />
               census was taken I have no doubt in my own 
               <br />
               mind, and my conviction is strengethened by 
               <br />
               authentic information, that the increase of the 
               <br />
               English-speaking population and the German- 
               <br />
               speaking population and other nationalities has 
               <br />
               been so great, that, instead of the French popula- 
               <br />
               tion being 5 per cent. it is now probably less. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) spoke to us 
               <br />
               the other day of this being an attempt on the part 
               <br />
               of 3,000,000 people to swallow 2,000,000. There is 
               <br />
               no such attempt. He said this reminded him of 
               <br />
               the fact that it was a whale and not a cod that 
               <br />
               swallowed Jonah. I beg to remind the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman, that if he is going to reverse the decision 
               <br />
               of the majority for 5 per cent. of the population, 
               <br />
               he is asking Jonah to swallow the whale. With 
               <br />
               respect to the population in the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, with which a comparison has been made, 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd that there is a total population of 1,350,000, 
               <br />
               the French population numberin upwards of 
               <br />
               1,000,000, the English-speaking num ering 268,000, 
               <br />
               or 19 per cent. of the population. I do not think 
               <br />
               we have a right to institute such comparisons, 
               <br />
               and I only mention them as they have been 
               <br />
               already made, because those rights of the people of 
               <br />
               the Province of Quebec, the rights of the minority 
               <br />
               in Quebec and of the minority in Ontario, and in 
               <br />
               every other Province in the Dominion, will, I trust, 
               <br />
               for ever remain undisturbed ; and I will be no party, 
               <br />
               directly or indirectly, to do anything which, in my 
               <br />
               humble judgment, would amount to an attempt to 
               <br />
               break up one of the most sacred contracts into 
               <br />
               which any two people have ever entered. I mention 
               <br />
               this matter fully in order that my position may be 
               <br />
               clearly understood. The position of the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories has been presented to us as 
               <br />
               resembling very much the position occupied by 
               <br />
               Switzerland. We have been pointed to Switzer- 
               <br />
               land as a guiding star for us. Even the member 
               <br />
               for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) was so careful as to ive 
               <br />
               all the exports and imports of that country, an he 
               <br />
               showed us how it was purely an a icultural coun- 
               <br />
               try, and how it was particularly b essed in having 
               <br />
               a treble language. The analogy was a forced one ,- 
               <br />
               in fact, I know of no two countries so utterly dissi- 
               <br />
               milar in every respect as the North-\Vest Territo-
