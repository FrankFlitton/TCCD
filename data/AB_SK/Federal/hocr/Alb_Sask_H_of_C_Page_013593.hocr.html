               The contention of the hon. gentleman, I 
               <br />
               know, is very plausible. I think there is very 
               <br />
               grave doubt as to whether it is correct, and 
               <br />
               nobody can positively say at the present

               time that the other contention is absolutely 
               <br />
               wrong. But we ﬁnd in the 4th and 5th 
               <br />
               sections of the British North America Act 
               <br />

               <br />
               there is no expression to the contrary 
               <br />
               and no implication to the contrary, and we 
               <br />
               have the word ‘Canada’ here without any 
               <br />
               expression to the contrary, and I contend 
               <br />
               that the only implication of the meaning of 
               <br />
               ‘Canada’ here is the four provinces, be- 
               <br />
               cause it is used in the subsection of the 
               <br />
               main section, which refers only to the ori- 
               <br />
               ginal four provinces called ‘Canada.’ I 
               <br />
               would like to point out that the considera- 
               <br />
               tion we are urging is a reasonable one. The 
               <br />
               four provinces had peculiar reasons for 
               <br />
               maintaining a certain ratio of representation 
               <br />
               as between themselves. The men who were 
               <br />
               settling the terms of confederation were 
               <br />
               not able Within human foresight to see 
               <br />
               what might be necessary for other provin- 
               <br />
               ces. They had had before them the case of 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island, and they were un- 
               <br />
               able to agree upon the terms upon which 
               <br />
               that province should come in. Were they 
               <br />
               likely to settle for one hundred years to 
               <br />
               come upon what terms the balance of the 
               <br />
               provinces would come in ? Surely it was a 
               <br />
               reasonable thing for them to agree upon 
               <br />
               terms and conditions as to representation, 
               <br />
               readjustment, and otherwise, of the four 
               <br />
               provinces, the circumstances of which they 
               <br />
               were fully aware of and to leave the terms 
               <br />
               and conditions upon which the other 
               <br />
               provinces should come in to be settled under 
               <br />
               section 146 at the time when these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces might wish to come in. They 
               <br />
               could, under section 146, make any terms 
               <br />
               they pleased. It was competent for 
               <br />
               the Dominion, when a new province came 
               <br />
               in, to agree that the incoming province 
               <br />
               should have a ﬁxed representation, not mere- 
               <br />
               ly for ten years, but for twenty years or 
               <br />
               ﬁfty years. It was competent for them to 
               <br />
               agree that they should have a representa- 
               <br />

               to agree to any terms they saw ﬁt, subject 
               <br />
               always to one condition expressed in section 
               <br />
               146, that its admission should be ‘ subject

               provisions that were made between the four 
               <br />

               <br />

               that the incoming provinces obtain under 
               <br />
               the addresses or Orders in Council. The 
               <br />
               matter strikes me as a reasonable one. A 
               <br />
               number of delegates met to try and settle 
               <br />
               the differences between the four provinces 
               <br />
               existing and which they represented. They 
               <br />
               had in view the admission of other provin- 
               <br />
               ces and territories. They knew that we 
               <br />
               had a vast territory in which at that time, 
               <br />
               I believe, there were only 12,000 inhabitants. 
               <br />
               How could they foresee the terms upon 
               <br />
               which it would be reasonable for provinces 
               <br />
               as yet unborn to come in ? Would it 
               <br />
               have been sensible for men in their posi- 
               <br />
               tion to attempt to do more than they did, 
               <br />
               which was to settle the terms and conditions 
               <br />
               between the existing provinces that were 
               <br />
               confederating and to leave the incoming 
               <br />
               provinces in the future to make Whatever 
               <br />
               conditions they saw ﬁt to make at the time 
               <br />
               and which the Dominion should see ﬁt 
               <br />
               to grant to them? That is our con— 
               <br />
               tention, and it seems to be a perfectly 
               <br />
               reasonable one. It seems to me to be what 
               <br />
               any business men would agree upon who 
               <br />
               sat down to meet the difﬁculties that pre- 
               <br />
               sented themselves when these provinces at- 
               <br />
               tempted to confederate. There is another 
               <br />
               feature, and I would like to point it out, be- 
               <br />
               cause it shows further why it was reason- 
               <br />
               able that the word ‘Canada’ in the 4th 
               <br />
               subsection should not include the population 
               <br />
               outside of the four provinces. Suppose that 
               <br />
               in 1901, before this census was taken, that 
               <br />
               there had been a proposition for Newfound- 
               <br />
               land to be brought in, What would have 
               <br />
               been the effect of it ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ontazio,</span> New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick and Nova Scotia would immediately 
               <br />
               begin to calculate What the probable popu- 
               <br />
               lations were, and what effect the incoming 
               <br />
               provinces would have upon the proportion 
               <br />
               of representation, and if Ontario, for exam- 
               <br />
               ple, saw that the addition of the proposed 
               <br />
               new province to the aggregate population 
               <br />
               of the Dominion might have the effect of' 
               <br />
               placing her outside the one-twentieth limit 
               <br />
               and subject her to a loss of six members, 
               <br />
               the natural consequence would be that On- 
               <br />
               tario would say: We will vote against 
               <br />
               Newfoundland coming in. That will be the 
               <br />
               result of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contention</span> of the hon. Minister
