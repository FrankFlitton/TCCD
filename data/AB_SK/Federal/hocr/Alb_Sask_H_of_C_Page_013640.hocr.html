               I said that I believed the time had come when

               <br />
               in the territories in genenal are ready to accept 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy. Of course they are not 
               <br />
               unanimous, and I think that it the powers at

               <br />
               is a fact. as has been stated by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               opposite, that the population of the territories 
               <br />
               now is vastly larger than was that of Manitoba 
               <br />
               when that part of the country was formed into

               a province.

               Mr. OLIVER. There seems to be some

               misunderstanding as to what the people Of 
               <br />
               the North-west Territories, through their

               <br />
               Which it has been received by the others. 
               <br />
               One condition is that the per capita allow- 
               <br />
               ance shall be revised on the basis of popula- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               account shall be revised at the end of the 
               <br />
               ten-year census. Now it is an essential prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of provincial organization throughout 
               <br />
               the Dominion that the per capita allowance 
               <br />
               on population remains the same from the 
               <br />
               entrance of the province into confederation, 
               <br />
               and that the debt account remains the same. 
               <br />
               Therefore when the territories ask for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pl'O‘</span> 
               <br />
               vinciul organization they are asking for it

               on radically different terms from those on 
               <br />
               which the other provinces have received it. 
               <br />
               When hon. members are so ready to grant 
               <br />
               provincial organization, it will be interest-

               <br />
               terms upon which it is asked, and the in- 
               <br />
               ference is that it would not be acceptable 
               <br />
               on any other terms, and circumstances be-
