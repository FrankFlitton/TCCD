               Sir John Thompson contended at that 
               <br />
               time that there was no need of an appeal 
               <br />
               to the Privy Council. I think the present 
               <br />
               right hon. leader of the government (Hon. 
               <br />
               Sir Wilfrid Laurier) suggested at that time 
               <br />
               that as it was a legal point and that it 
               <br />
               should be handed over to the Privy Council 
               <br />
               or to some other authority to give ef- 
               <br />
               fect to the intent of the contracting 
               <br />
               parties. Sir John Thompson considered that 
               <br />
               even that was not necessary, that the plain 
               <br />
               intent of the Act was suﬂiciently expressed 
               <br />
               that British Columbia should have her six 
               <br />
               representatives until such time as the num- 
               <br />
               ber might be increased by an inﬂow of 
               <br />
               population. I consider that Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island is in the same position as British 
               <br />
               Columbia was at that day, and I think her 
               <br />
               rights should be safeguarded by this gov- 
               <br />

               Manitoba came in under an imperial Act 
               <br />
               and upon special terms. Her population 
               <br />
               in 1879 was 10,586, and under general terms 
               <br />
               would entitle her to one member, yet she 
               <br />
               came in with four. In 1881 her population 
               <br />
