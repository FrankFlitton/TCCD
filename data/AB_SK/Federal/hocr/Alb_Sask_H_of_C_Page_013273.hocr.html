               <br />
               injustice to the people of that country if they were 
               <br />
               precluded from using the French language in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               use in respect to that contention—leaving aside 
               <br />
               altogether the constitutional argument, with which 
               <br />
               I do not propose to deal, but to speak of the 
               <br />
               injustice which he declared would be perpetrated 
               <br />
               upon the 1,500 French people and upon the 3,000 
               <br />
               odd French half-breeds, a large proportion of 
               <br />
               whom, it has been stated in this debate, are 
               <br />
               incapable of speaking the French language at all, 
               <br />
               and only understand their mother tongue, the 
               <br />
               Indian? I say there would be no greater in- 
               <br />
               justice in not allowing them to have the use of 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing the use of the French or the German language 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               of 100,000 French people. Can it be argued for

               that, perhaps, has been engendered during this 
               <br />

               <br />
               out of respect for the high ofﬁcial position which 
               <br />
               you, Sir, so worthily occupy, not only out of 
               <br />
               respect for our own individual selves, and not only 
               <br />
               out of respect for the French members from the Pro-

               <br />
               orate, but because, Sir, I know full well that a harsh 
               <br />
               or hasty word spoken to-night, however true its text 
               <br />
               may be, is more calculated to repel than to induce 
               <br />
               a calm and dispassionate judgment ; and so I hope, 
               <br />
               when I shall have resumed my seat, that I shall be 
               <br />
               able, on looking back over what I have said, to 
               <br />
               conclude that I have spoken calmly and dispassion- 
               <br />
               ately, although already words have been spoken 
               <br />
               which have grated somewhat harshly on the ears 
               <br />
               of hon. gentlemen who may think as I do, and who 
               <br />
               may vote as I intend to vote on this important ques- 
               <br />
               tion. But if I do give offence to any creed or to any 
               <br />
               person, I hope hon. gentlemen will see it is because I 
               <br />
               am now in the years of enthusiasm, because I be- 
               <br />
               lieve in the assertion of free speech and free thought, 
               <br />
               knowing. as I do, that in past history these two ele- 
               <br />
               ments have led to the highest kind of legislation— 
               <br />
               legislation tending to peace on earth and goodwill to- 
               <br />
               wards men. I have said that words have been 
               <br />
               spoken during this debate which fell unpleasantly 
               <br />
               on the ears of hon. gentlemen in this House. Need 
               <br />
               I say to whose language I refer ? Need I say that 
               <br />
               the hon. the Minister of Public W'orks, more than 
               <br />
               any hon. gentleman in this House, has, during this 
               <br />
               debate, made use of language calculated to do 
               <br />
               serious harm throughout the country at large. 
               <br />
               I say, Sir, that his language was most fanatical, 
               <br />
               most inﬂammatory, and not justiﬁed at all by 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy) ; but, assuming for a moment, 
               <br />
               which I do not now admit, that the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe did say what, perhaps, in 
               <br />
               his calmer judgment, he would not have said, two 
               <br />
               wrongs do not make a right ; and, therefore, the 
               <br />
               hon. the Minister of Public Works ought not to 
               <br />
               have used the language he did, and, coming from 
               <br />
               a gentleman in his exalted position, it was most 
               <br />
               dangerous to the peace and the welfare of the 
               <br />
               community at large. Bad enough would that 
               <br />
               language have been had it come from an ordinary 
               <br />
               member ; bad enough would it have been had 
               <br />
               it come from a member of the Government, sitting 
               <br />
               behind the hon. gentleman, but, inﬁnitely mis- 
               <br />
               chievous was it coming from the Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works, who is second in command to the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman who leads this House. The 
               <br />
               hon. the Minister of Public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“forks</span> spoke of the 
               <br />
               loyalty of the French Canadians. I admit, and I 
               <br />
               rejoice in the fact, that there are no more loyal 
               <br />
               men in the community than the French Canadians, 
               <br />
               but I do not propose to admit, as worthy of our 
               <br />
               admiration—if I may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beiallowed</span> to speak for a 
               <br />
               moment in their behalf—the example set us by the 
               <br />
               hon. the Minister of Public Works in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle-</span>

               man to Whom he referred, for British Cana- 
               <br />
               dians cannot see much loyalty to admire or 
               <br />
               respect in a gentleman, who one moment re-
