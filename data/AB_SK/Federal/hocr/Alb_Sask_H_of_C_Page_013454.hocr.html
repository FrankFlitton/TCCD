               of Quebec and Ontario. \Vell, there may 
               <br />
               be two sides to this question. Looking at 
               <br />

               <br />
               and when it came to be discussed practically 
               <br />
               by practical men. it was found advisable to 
               <br />
               allow matters to remain as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the:</span> are at the

               they must be willing to grant to others. He did 
               <br />
               not believe the separate schools system was a good

               taken from the Roman Catholics in Ontario, the

               majority in Quebec would demand that the Pro-

               testant schools be taken from the minority in that

               province. He did not think the convention could 
               <br />
               demand the abolition of separate schools in this 
               <br />

               Sir, I have no fear, for my part. that 
               <br />
               there should ever arise an agitation in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec for the removal of the 
               <br />
               separate schools of the Protestant minority ; 
               <br />
               but, certainly, it is only fair to ask that 
               <br />
               what is granted in Quebec to the minority 
               <br />
               should also be granted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span> minority else- 
               <br />
               where. It is not unfair to ask that the one 
               <br />
               measure of justice which prevails in one 
               <br />
               province should also prevail in the other pro— 
               <br />
               vinces and territories. And so long as we 
               <br />
               agree to have separate schools anywhere. 
               <br />
               I see no reason why we should not agree 
               <br />
               to have them everywhere as they exist at 
               <br />
               the present time. It may be that the system 
               <br />
               of separate schools is not acceptable to the 
               <br />
               hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman‘mr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">McCarthy).</span> but does he, 
               <br />
               or does anyone, expect that it is possible 
               <br />
               to form this nation it each one of us insists
