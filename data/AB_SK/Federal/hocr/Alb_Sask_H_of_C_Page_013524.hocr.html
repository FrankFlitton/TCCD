               <br />
               it was on the ﬂoor of this House that we 
               <br />
               accomplished the giving to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> 
               <br />
               Territories of what was properly described 
               <br />
               in this House last session by the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Alberta (Mr. Oliver), and as de- 
               <br />
               scribed in this memorial passed by the 
               <br />
               legislative assembly: as practically respon- 
               <br />
               sible government. 
               <br />
               Governor of these Territories was a Czar. 
               <br />
               and the assembly had practically no power 
               <br />
               whatever; but in 1887 the Territories were 
               <br />
               represented in this House, and from that 
               <br />
               n: oment the members of this Parliament 
               <br />
               moved in the direction of giving responsible 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> to the Territories. One of these 
               <br />
               members from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Territories 
               <br />
               had a Bill on the paper providing that full 
               <br />
               responsible government be given to the Ter 
               <br />
               ritories, and thereupon, Sir John Macdonald 
               <br />
               brought down a Bill under which he gave 
               <br />
               us what was called an advisory council. 
               <br />
               That advisory council was found not to 
               <br />
               work well, nor did it give such power as 
               <br />
               should have been given to the Territories. 
               <br />
               and so we subsequently got what was called 
               <br />
               an executive committee. That executive 
               <br />
               committee had most of the powers of the 
               <br />
               government of a province, but the means 
               <br />
               of getting it into existence is awkward, and 
               <br />
               the means of continuing it, if one of its 
               <br />
               members should be destroyed by death or, 
               <br />
               resign, is also awkward. You have not, 
               <br />
               properly speaking, a responsible government 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               do not want full responsible government, 
               <br />
               it would be very improper on the part of

               changed my own opinion. I am not here 
               <br />

               people of the Territories have themselves 
               <br />
               asked for. I shall point out later on the

               fiom their not asking for full responsible

               by the late Government shortly before it
