               vince may be considered, against seven pro-

               vinces, not against the Dominion of Can- 
               <br />
               ada. So, admitting for the purpose of argu- 
               <br />
               ment—'which I do not as a matter of fact—- 
               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman’s argument is cor- 
               <br />
               rect, he has simply proved himself out of 
               <br />
               court, because he begins in the ﬁrst page of 
               <br />
               his report to prove that Canada means Cana— 
               <br />
               da as it exists from the Atlantic to the Paci— 
               <br />
               ﬁc, and he has proved that it means only the 
               <br />
               seven provinces, the territories not being 
               <br />
               included. So, when we seek to ﬁnd against 
               <br />
               what part the representation of Ontario 
               <br />
               should be calculated, we ﬁnd that it is only 
               <br />
               against seven provinces and not against the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada including the terri- 
               <br />
               tories. What the practical effect of that 
               <br />
               would be I am not prepared to say. I do 
               <br />
               not know that it is material, for, in dealing 
               <br />
               with the law it is a question of right and 
               <br />
               wrong. However, I have had two calcula- 
               <br />
               tions made showing the eiTect under each 
               <br />
               contention. Not being a mathematician, I 
               <br />
               cannot say whether they are right. But 
               <br />
               one calculation made by a competent per- 
               <br />
               son shows that, it the territories were ex- 
               <br />
               cluded and Ontario were calculated against 
               <br />
               seven provinces, we should not have any 
               <br />
               reduction. The other made by a depart- 
               <br />
               ment in the city shows that, by a paltry 
               <br />
               decimal of twelve, Ontario would lose six 
               <br />
               seats, if the territories were brought into 
               <br />
               the calculation. While I believe the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               ﬁgures to be correct, I am not going to 
               <br />
               commit myself to them. It is a question of 
               <br />
               the construction of the statute, and, if it 
               <br />
               does not affect us to—day it might affect us 
               <br />
               at some other time. We are entitled to a 
               <br />
               fair rendering of the statutes, and we are 
               <br />
               entitled to know whether the minister bases 
               <br />
               his argument on the ground that seven pro- 
               <br />
               vinces constitute the whole of Canada be- 
               <br />
               fore we are called upon to accept a cal- 
               <br />
               culation based upon such data.

               I notice, also, that on page 6 of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman’s report, it appears that the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces came in with equal rights as com- 
               <br />
               pared with the others. Let us see how that 
               <br />
               would work out with regard to the other 
               <br />
               provinces. I have spoken of the fact that 
               <br />
               it is clear that British Columbia has greater 
               <br />
               rights than Prince Edward Island. See how 
               <br />
               section 51 would work out from the stand— 
               <br />
               point of the old provinces in the light of 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman’s contention. Section 51 
               <br />
               provides what is to be done on the com- 
               <br />
               pletion of the census—that Quebec shall 
               <br />
               have a ﬁxed number of sixty-five repre~ 
               <br />
               sentatives, and we understand how the 
               <br />
               other provinces have proportionate repres- 
               <br />
               tation. If the contention of the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man is right, when we come to read section 
               <br />
               51, it applies not only to the four provinces, 
               <br />
               ‘but to the seven.

               proved to his own satisfaction that Can- 
               <br />

               <br />
               then would you work out this 5lst clause '1 
               <br />
               If he wishes to change his opinion and make . 
               <br />
               the section mean the whole of Canada, how 
               <br />
               would he work out the 51st clause according 
               <br />
               to his contention ? Whatever portions com- 
               <br />
               pose Canada this clause provides for equal 
               <br />
               treatment. But what would you do when 
               <br />
               you come to British Columbia ? Can you 
               <br />
               apply section 5.1 to that province ? In view 
               <br />
               of the fact that its representations is never 
               <br />
               to be decreased below six members, how 
               <br />
               is it possible to apply this section to that 
               <br />
               province '2 Then, how about the territories, 
               <br />
               if, as the hon. minister contends, Canada con- 
               <br />
               sists of the whole country from ocean to 
               <br />
               ocean ? It is settled law that we have the 
               <br />
               power, under the imperial statutes, to give 
               <br />
               the territories as large representations as 
               <br />
               we see ﬁt. We can give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them,</span> ten or ﬁfty 
               <br />
               or an hundred members, as we please. So 
               <br />
               section 51 clearly does not apply to the terri- 
               <br />
               tories. According to the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               though, section 51 applies to the whole of 
               <br />
               Canada, it does not apply to the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories, the largest division of Canada, . 
               <br />
               or to British Columbia, which is the largest 
               <br />
               province. I do not pretend to be very fam- 
               <br />
               iliar with the geographical facts, but, if you 
               <br />
               subtract from the whole area of Canada 
               <br />
               the area of the North-west Territories and 
               <br />
               British Columbia, I am inclined to think 
               <br />
               that you will ﬁnd that the greater part of 
               <br />
               Canadian territory is outside the operation 
               <br />
               of section 51, and we know that the time 
               <br />
               is not far distant when the North—west 
               <br />
               Territories and British Columbia will be, 
               <br />
               in population, the greatest part of the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion. So, the hon. gentleman has led him-
