               comparatively modern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">times-was,</span> as set forth 
               <br />
               in a letter from their pastor to the mayor, 
               <br />
               that the pastor could no longer understand his 
               <br />
               ﬂock, nor the ﬂock the pastor. They did not 
               <br />
               give up their language; they simply ceased to 
               <br />
               attend the schools; they ceased to learn in 
               <br />
               German,which was an unknown tongue to them; 
               <br />
               and nothing was accomplished except to keep them 
               <br />
               in ignorance and to develop a bad feeling. Now, 
               <br />
               does the hon. gentleman suppose that by the 
               <br />
               methods he is advocating, methods of force and 
               <br />
               coercion, he can accomplish what he has in 
               <br />
               view? Let me remind him of the consequences, 
               <br />
               politically, of such attempts. Schleswig-Holstein 
               <br />
               at one time constituted two duchies of 
               <br />
               Denmark. The people spoke German. King 
               <br />
               Christian IX attempted ‘to force upon them a 
               <br />
               change of language. What was the result ? They 
               <br />
               became <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disaffected.</span> They got encouragement from 
               <br />
               a foreign power, Prussia ; they rose in rebellion ; 
               <br />
               they were lost to Denmark and became Prussian. 
               <br />
               Such was the natural consequence of interfering 
               <br />
               with one of the institutions of the people. Let 
               <br />
               me refer to another historical case of modern 
               <br />
               times, within the political life almost of the hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman—the</span> case of Lombardo Venetia. That 
               <br />
               was once a part of Austria, and their language 
               <br />
               Italian. Austria, not proﬁting by the experience 
               <br />
               of Denmark and other experiences, endeavored to 
               <br />
               destroy the Italian language of Lombardo Venetia, 
               <br />
               and to impose upon the people the German 
               <br />
               language. What was the result? The people, 
               <br />
               just as in Schleswig—Holstein, rebelled, and they 
               <br />
               found sympathisers, as all disaffected countries 
               <br />
               can, from Without. Italy and France came to the 
               <br />
               rescue, and the result was, instead of Austria ac~ 
               <br />
               complishing what she was aiming at, destroying 
               <br />
               the Italian language, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> she lost both those two 
               <br />
               great Provinces, which became, in 1859, and still 
               <br />
               are, part of the empire of Italy. Now, what has 
               <br />
               happened in the case of these two great countries 
               <br />
               which, under coercion, transferred their allegiance 
               <br />
               to another ﬂag, will happen wherever the same 
               <br />
               attempt is prosecuted. Does not the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman see that he is proceeding in the 
               <br />
               most direct way possible, in the light of the past— 
               <br />
               which is the only guide to us to-day in these 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matters—40</span> destroy this Confederation by causing

               our French Canadian subjects to become <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disaffect-</span> 
               <br />
               ed and to seek sympathisers outside, and to, 
               <br />
               perhaps, ultimately part company with the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Confederacy. Does he desire that result? 
               <br />
               There can be nothing accomplished by force. 
               <br />
               Acts of Parliament and Orders in Council will 
               <br />
               not make men love one another. We cannot 
               <br />
               change men’s nature by Acts of Parliament or 
               <br />
               Orders in Council. If we could, I should be the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst to vote for an Act of Parliament to change 
               <br />

               hands go in for making him a man of different 
               <br />
               opinions. Suppose, as a matter of experiment, we 
               <br />
               were to do to him What he is seeking to do to the 
               <br />
               French Canadians, only the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">converse—suppose</span> we 
               <br />
               were to pass an Act of Parliament to make him a 
               <br />
               French Canadian Catholic, would we succeed in 
               <br />
               making him one ‘3 He has gone back on his Celtic

               Would accomplish such result ; and if he would be

               <br />
               touched upon by the hon. member for Assiniboia 
               <br />
               (Mr. Davin) last night, the case of Alsace. 
               <br />
               Alsace, at one time, was a part of Germany, but 
               <br />
               became French, Alsace and Lorraine having been 
               <br />
               transferred to France by the Treaty of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W’estphalia.</span> 
               <br />
               Alsace was German in language and race, but by 
               <br />
               being treated with kindness by the French people 
               <br />
               and not persecuted, came to love France which had 
               <br />
               conquered her; and during the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">FranCOvPrussian</span> 
               <br />
               war, when attempts were made to recover Alsace, 
               <br />
               as was stated eloquently last night, she was one of 
               <br />
               the most loyal supporters of France which had 
               <br />
               conquered her two centuries before; and to-day 
               <br />
               the Germans, in endeavoring to do what my hon. 
               <br />
               friend is seeking to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accomplish—to</span> repress the use 
               <br />
               of the French language in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alsacemhave</span> eliminated 
               <br />
               the sympathies of the Alsacians, many of whom 
               <br />
               have left the country, while those who remain are 
               <br />
               so disaffected that they can be only kept in sub— 
               <br />
               jection by the presence of a large standing army. 
               <br />
               Such is the effect of endeavors to change the 
               <br />
               language of a people by coercion. History <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shows.</span> 
               <br />
               that where attempts are made to destroy a lan- 
               <br />
               guage, the people often construe those attempts as 
               <br />
               assaults upon their religion. For example, a move- 
               <br />
               ment is going on at present by which Canada is 
               <br />
               proﬁting. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W’e</span> have coming to Canada the Men- 
               <br />
               nonites and Lutherans from the Baltic. Why 
               <br />
               are they coming here? Because Russia has been en— 
               <br />
               deavoring to cause them to give up their own 
               <br />
               language, the German, and to adopt the Russian, 
               <br />
               and these Mennonites and Lutherans have conceived 
               <br />
               the idea that this is an attempt to coerce them into 
               <br />
               joining the Greek Church. They construe it as an 
               <br />
               assault upon their religion; and there are many 
               <br />
               instances in history where similar attempts have 
               <br />
               been similarly construed. We cannot, therefore, 
               <br />
               blame the French Canadians if they, too, should 
               <br />
               come to the conclusion that this movement is an 
               <br />
               assault on their religion. However much men 
               <br />
               may protest to the contrary, if the French Cana— 
               <br />
               dians get this idea into their heads, we cannot 
               <br />
               blame them, in the light of precedents which justi- 
               <br />
               ﬁed such conclusions in the past. I wonder that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has not discovered that he cannot 
               <br />
               rule the hearts of the people by force. If you 
               <br />
               desire them to abandon any of their institutions. 
               <br />
               you must leave it to them to do so voluntarily, 
               <br />
               Does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Esop’s</span> fable of the traveller and his coat 
               <br />

               Clearly, there can be no more self-evident pro-
