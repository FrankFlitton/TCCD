               we accepted the Bill as so amended. It is most un- 
               <br />
               fortunate, that at this time, when there is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disturb~</span> 
               <br />
               ing element abroad in the land, men with perhaps 
               <br />
               more enthusiasm than judgment, are creating a 
               <br />
               great deal of excitement both in Quebec and 
               <br />
               Ontario, and in the North-West Teritories ; and 
               <br />
               in view of this fact we should deal with this 
               <br />
               question very carefully, and extend as generously 
               <br />
               as we can all the concessions we can reason- 
               <br />
               ably extend to our French compatriots. But, 
               <br />
               While doing that, we would be doing an injus- 
               <br />
               tice to ourselves if we were to allow any encroach- 
               <br />
               ments that, in our honest convictions, we believed 
               <br />
               would be contrary to the interests of the state or 
               <br />
               of our national life. I believe there is a disposition 
               <br />
               on the part of eminent men on both sides of this 
               <br />
               chamber, to, as far as possible, come together in 
               <br />
               a great emergency, and support the state rather 
               <br />
               then support their national sentiment. I think it 
               <br />
               is wise and well that they should do so, and we 
               <br />
               would fall far short of our duty if we were unable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> 
               <br />
               to join with them, in this important crisis of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">}</span> 
               <br />
               history, in trying to stamp out anything which 
               <br />
               partook rather of sentiment than of statesmanship, 
               <br />
               of race rather than of national rights. We 
               <br />
               should stand by one another, and endeavor to re- 
               <br />
               concile those conﬂicting elements we so often ﬁnd 
               <br />
               in this country of ours. I am far from believing 
               <br />
               that we have not a bright future before us. I do 
               <br />
               not believe that, because we may speak the French 
               <br />
               or the German or the Gaelic language, that is anything 
               <br />
               against the glorious future instore forour state; but 
               <br />
               we must endeavor to reconcile those conﬂicting ele- 
               <br />
               ments and to bring together the people who are in a. 
               <br />
               manner under our charge, and who are looking to 
               <br />
               us for advice in important times like this. I think 
               <br />
               we would meet the duty which devolves upon us 
               <br />
               by accepting the amendment of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), because, in that way 
               <br />
               we would be doing no great injustice to anyone; 
               <br />
               we would be following the lines of provincial 
               <br />
               rights; we would be giving into the hands of the 
               <br />
               people the right of saying what they should have 
               <br />
               now and what they should have in the future. At 
               <br />
               the same time, we would do our duty to the state ; 
               <br />
               we would allay for the time one of those exciting 
               <br />
               questions which are becoming more and more 
               <br />
               annoying every day, and we would be doing our 
               <br />
               duty as members of this great country, which must 
               <br />
               in time become one of the most important in the 
               <br />
               history of the world.

               Mr. WRIGHT. As a member who, for twenty— 
               <br />
               ﬁve years, has represented in this House a county 
               <br />
               in the Province of Quebec, 3. county in which a 
               <br />
               large majority are French Canadians, and as a 
               <br />
               Quebec member, I cannot allow this debate to pass 
               <br />
               without saying a few words. Sir, I re et exceed- 
               <br />
               ingly that the hon. member for North imcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) should have brought this matter under 
               <br />
               the notice of the House. It appears to me to be 
               <br />
               one of the most disturbing questions which could 
               <br />
               have been brought under our consideration. Pro- 
               <br />
               vidence has placed us here in this magniﬁcent 
               <br />
               northern home land of ours, men of divers races 
               <br />
               and creeds and languages, but I think animated by 
               <br />
               a common patriotic purpose, to develop our re- 
               <br />
               sources to the utmost, to live in peace and harmony 
               <br />
               together in the enjoyment of equal rights and pri~ 
               <br />
               vileges. I think, take it for all in all, we have the 
               <br />
               best and freest country that ever the sun shone on.

               I think we have every material element of wealth 
               <br />
               within our midst, that we have a hardy, a bold, an 
               <br />
               energetic and a kindly population, and that we have 
               <br />
               the best country that can be found in the world. 
               <br />
               We have a form of government which is free to the 
               <br />
               fullest extent, and every man has the absolute 
               <br />
               right of freedom of conscience and worship. All 
               <br />
               that is wanted to build up this national ediﬁce is a. 
               <br />
               little common sense—a little sense of justice, 8. little 
               <br />
               of that spirit of compromise, which is of the very es- 
               <br />
               sence of the British system, and then the work may 
               <br />
               be said to be accomplished. I must confess that I 
               <br />
               have been very much astonished at the course which 
               <br />
               has been taken by the hon. member who introduced 
               <br />
               this Bill, and his friends who advocate Imperial 
               <br />
               Federation. They profess to endeavor to bring 
               <br />
               about the union of the British Empire ; they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro~</span> 
               <br />
               fess to unite instead of dividing us, but what does 
               <br />
               this course of action mean? Instead of peace and 
               <br />
               harmony, they bring us the faggot and the sword ; 
               <br />
               instead of that spirit of compromise, which, as I 
               <br />
               said, is of the essence of the British system, and 
               <br />
               gives it its magniﬁcent power throughout the world, 
               <br />
               they bring us dissension and disorder. To my 
               <br />
               mind, their course—I regret to say it, for per- 
               <br />
               sonally I have the greatest respect for those hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen—leads me, though I cannot believe 
               <br />
               that they are animated by treasonable urposes, 
               <br />
               to think that they are not animated y patri- 
               <br />
               otic purposes, and I regret exceedingly that 
               <br />
               they have chosen to adopt this course, which 
               <br />
               cannot but be disastrous to the interests of our 
               <br />
               common country. But I believe in the common 
               <br />
               sense of the great body of the people, and while, 
               <br />
               if certain fanatics in the Province of Quebec, and 
               <br />
               certain fanatics in the Province of Ontario had 
               <br />
               their way, the result would be most disastrous, 
               <br />
               still I have faith in the patriotism of the great 
               <br />
               body of that people, and I believe that when this 
               <br />
               storm has swept over us, the result will be beneﬁcial 
               <br />
               and not disastrous. To my mind, the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) has received at the hands 
               <br />
               of the three gentlemen who attacked his position 
               <br />
               with such singular force and power a summary and 
               <br />
               condign punishment. It appeared to me that his 
               <br />
               punishment was almost too great for him to bear. 
               <br />
               He bore it, however, with a bravery and a stoicism 
               <br />
               which was worthy of every admiration. Not the 
               <br />
               Jesuit Breboeuf at the stake, tortured to death by 
               <br />
               savages, not Rowland Taylor in the ﬁres of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Smith-</span> 
               <br />
               ﬁeld, passed the ordeal more gallantly than did the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman. Sir, in a great story told by a great 
               <br />
               master of French literature, he gives us a description 
               <br />
               of the torture. In the “ Notre Dame ” of Victor 
               <br />
               Hugo, he gives us a graphic account of the death 
               <br />
               of the Gitana Esmeralda who was executed by the 
               <br />
               cruel code of a barbarous age. He tells us how her 
               <br />
               limbs were dislocated, her arms and legs were 
               <br />
               broken, and how then she was pressed to death dying 
               <br />
               with the name of her lover and her Saviour on her 
               <br />
               lips. When the member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), 
               <br />
               who was the ﬁrst executioner, proceeded to perform 
               <br />
