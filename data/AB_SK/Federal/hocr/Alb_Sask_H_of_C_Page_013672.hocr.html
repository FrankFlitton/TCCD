               no part of Canada where a taxation is light- 
               <br />
               er at present than in the territories. I have 
               <br />
               had some intimation that Mr. Haultain in— 
               <br />
               tended to introduce the municipal system. 
               <br />
               If he does, he will grant the municipalities 
               <br />
               power to borrow money, because, although 
               <br />
               he cannot borrow money himself .he has 
               <br />
               power to give the municipalities authority to 
               <br />
               borrow. I understand he intends to submit a 
               <br />
               Bill of that kind. I do not know how true 
               <br />
               it is, or how it will be received by the peo- 
               <br />
               ple, but I believe that taking everything into 
               <br />
               consideration, we are doing very well as we 
               <br />
               are and we had better adopt the old say-

               people of the North-west Territories are of 
               <br />

               Mr. W. J. ROCHE (Marquette). I have 
               <br />
               listened to some curiosities in the way of 
               <br />
               speech-making in this House during the past 
               <br />
               seven years, but the member for Alberta 
               <br />
               (Mr. Oliver) has surpassed even himself to- 
               <br />
               night in the matter of exhibiting curiosities 
               <br />
               in the speech-making line. I sympathize 
               <br />
               with him, because his position must be very 
               <br />
               embarrassing in having to make a speech 
               <br />
               for autonomy and against autonomy. He is 
               <br />
               in favour of the details being settled imme- 
               <br />
               diately and he is against the details being 
               <br />
               settled unless they are settled in advance, 
               <br />
               not by the leader of the government, but 
               <br />
               by the leader of the opposition, forsooth. 
               <br />
               He is for an increased subsidy, but he is 
               <br />
               against the motion of the leader of the oppo— 
               <br />
               sition, which asks that this question shall 
               <br />
               be taken up at once, and the details refer— 
               <br />
               red to the representatives of the people be— 
               <br />
               fore autonomy is granted and before it is 
               <br />
               accepted by them. The hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               therefore, ﬁnds himself in a most embar- 
               <br />
               rassing position, and he feels at heart that 
               <br />
               he is speaking against the sentiment of the 
               <br />
               people he represents when he, in a faint- 
               <br />
               hearted manner, I admit, opposes autonomy. 
               <br />
               He told us that he would be in favour of 
               <br />
               autonomy if autonomy were granted on the 
               <br />
               terms asked by Premier Haultain in the 
               <br />
               Bill as submitted, but that without that, 
               <br />
               he would not be in favour of it. Surely 
               <br />
               he has read some speeches made by Pre- 
               <br />
               mier Haultain since that Bill was submitted 
               <br />
               to parliament by the government, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which.</span> 
               <br />
               he stated that while he asked only what he 
               <br />
               considered was right and what the territo- 
               <br />
               ries were entitled to, still he would not re- 
               <br />
               fuse to discuss the question and to accept 
               <br />
               terms less favourable for the sake of getting 
               <br />
               territorial autonomy for his people. He 
               <br />
               does not state in so many words, hard and. 
               <br />
               fast, that unless he can get territorial au-. 
               <br />
               tonomy on those terms he is not willing 
               <br />
               to accept it on any other terms. He says: 
               <br />
               This is what we are entitled to, these terms 
               <br />
               should be complied with; but, as he has 
               <br />
               stated in public speeches delivered since 
               <br />
               that time, he is willing to enter into a con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ference</span> with this government and make the

               The hon. gentleman has directed his re- 
               <br />
               marks largely to the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion. I can understand his position as a 
               <br />
               subservient supporter of the present govern- 
               <br />
               ment. He knows that the government are 
               <br />
               opposed to the granting of autonomy, and 
               <br />
               he did not wish to place them in an em- 
               <br />
               barrassing position. He rather fears that his 
               <br />
               own supporters may rally to the support of 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition, because he has 
               <br />
               struck a responsive chord in the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories ; and instead of directing his re- 
               <br />
               marks to the government of which he is so 
               <br />
               strong a supporter, he has directed them 
               <br />
               wholly to the leader of the opposition, as if 
               <br />
               it were his part to offer a policy on this 
               <br />
               question. He says that this is an old ques- 
               <br />
               tion, that it is .not just of this year’s growth. 
               <br />
               that it was discussed in years gone by when 
               <br />
               he occupied a seat in the territorial assembly. 
               <br />
               Yes, and he forgot to tell this House that 
               <br />
               when be occupied that seat, he himself 
               <br />
               favoured local autonomy ; but to-day he op- 
               <br />
               poses it. The hon. gentleman rather blamed 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition because this 
               <br />
               question was not brought up earlier. But 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition has brought this 
               <br />
               question up, not only this session, in an early 
               <br />
               part of the session, but last year, when he 
               <br />
               urged immediate action on the part of the 
               <br />
               government of the day. So I think the re- 
               <br />
               refence of the hon. member for Alberta to 
               <br />
               the hon. leader of the opposition was ill- 
               <br />
               timed and not at all deserved.

               The hon. gentleman says it is money they
