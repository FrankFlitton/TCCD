               proceedings of the Legislative Assembly. Why, Sir, 
               <br />
               _ I understand that in the whole North-West Council 
               <br />
               there is not a single member to be found who speaks 
               <br />
               the French language ; and why, in the name of 
               <br />
               common sense, should we refuse to grant to these 
               <br />
               men a simple request of this kind ‘3 They are the 
               <br />
               directors and managers of those Territories ; they 
               <br />
               are the men most conversant with all its wants ; 
               <br />
               and they come and tell us that it is a trouble to 
               <br />
               them to be compelled to use that language, that 
               <br />
               they wish to be free from it, that it is not wanted, 
               <br />
               that it is against the sentiment of the people, and 
               <br />
               that no sound public policy demands its continu- 
               <br />
               ance. We have, unfortunately, in the preamble of 
               <br />
               this Bill, a totally different question raised ; but I 
               <br />
               trust that the House will divest itself of the feeling 
               <br />
               that has been aroused by this preamble, and will 
               <br />
               consider solely and exclusively the request 
               <br />
               made by this board of gentlemen to this House and 
               <br />
               will grant it. We have had various countries 
               <br />
               pointed out to us, among them Schleswig-Holstein, 
               <br />
               in which the policy of Great Britain was to give to 
               <br />
               the various sections of the population the use of 
               <br />
               their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">languageswto</span> the Danes, the Danish language, 
               <br />
               and to the Germans, theirs ; and we were told that 
               <br />
               the Russians in 1862 were advised by England and 
               <br />
               other countries on the continent of Europe to grant 
               <br />
               to the Poles the right to speak their own language. 
               <br />
               I quite agree with these recommendations ; but 
               <br />
               surely it is not contended that the Poles for whom 
               <br />
               this petition was made, consisted of only 5 or 10 
               <br />
               per cent. of the population of Poland, or that the 
               <br />
               Danes and Germans for whom a similar request 
               <br />
               was made numbered only 10 per cent. of the total 
               <br />
               population? Why, the arguments brought forward 
               <br />
               in reference to other countries have only tended to 
               <br />
               conﬁrm and strengthen, in my mind, the right of 
               <br />
               those people in the Legislative Assembly of the 
               <br />
               North-VVest to be granted what they ask. Before 
               <br />
               I take my seat, I should like to read, with reference 
               <br />

               to the request of the North-VVest Assembly; but 
               <br />
               while I recognise its wisdom, I am not blind to 
               <br />
               the objections raised in this House or to the sus- 
               <br />
               ceptibilities of our French kindred. I am, there- 
               <br />
               fore, prepared to accept the proposal which has 
               <br />
               been made with reference to ﬁnding some means 
               <br />

               electors themselves in the North-VVest Territories, 
               <br />
               and I can only hope that the brief delay in its settle-

               ment will not give occasion for idle strifes. In view 
               <br />
               of the fact that we desire to give our French friends, 
               <br />
               and all the electors, an opportunity to be fully repre- 
               <br />
               sented after the matter has been fully discussed, and 
               <br />
               in view of the fact that our friends in the North-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">VVest</span> will have before them the debates which 
               <br />
               have taken place in this House on the question, I 
               <br />
               think the wisest policy is to accept the suggestion 
               <br />
               thrown out by the hon. gentleman, and to join all 
               <br />
               our hands together, and see if we cannot settle

               has been dealt with ably, logically, and generally 
               <br />
               reasonably; but I consider it to be the duty of 
               <br />
               every public man, in cases of national emergency, 
               <br />
               when the national life is at stake, to, as far as pos- 
               <br />
               sible, use conciliatory language, to allay the sus- 
               <br />
               picions of some, and the excitement of others, and 
               <br />
               to have regard to the feelings of those classes, 
               <br />
               those religions and those nationalities which are 
               <br />
               always in opposition to each other. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for West Durham (Mr. Blake) made use 
               <br />
               of much more eloquent language in a similar line 
               <br />
               the other night, and I thought it was to be re- 
               <br />
               gretted that that hon. gentleman, with his great 
               <br />
               ability, had not successfully carried out the 
               <br />
               principles which he was then endeavoring to in— 
               <br />
               culcate throughout his previous history. I can 
               <br />
               only say that from my ﬁrst entrance into political 
               <br />
               life to the present time, I have at various times 
               <br />
               recognised that he has been one of the very im- 
               <br />
               portant factors in creating a strong feeling in 
               <br />
               the Province of Ontario against our French fellow- 
               <br />
               subjects in the Province of Quebec. I know 
               <br />
               that it was the case in 1871 and 1872, and I 
               <br />
               thought, when Ithe hon. gentleman was addressing 
               <br />
               us so elequently the other night, it was a great pity 
               <br />
               he had not adopted the same moderation when 
               <br />
               speaking in our local Legislative Assembly in Tor- 
               <br />
               onto, and referringto the murder of ‘ ‘ Brother Scott, ” 
               <br />
               and when among the English-speakin people the 
               <br />
               feeling was almost at fever height, an the excite- 
               <br />
               ment so great that men could scarcely restrain 
               <br />
               themselves, and there was a strong hostility engen- 
               <br />
               dered against our French fellow-citizens, so much so 
               <br />
               that reason did not always hold her sway, and that 
               <br />
               very often excitement of sentiment and national 
               <br />
               prejudice took the place of reason. I think that 
               <br />
               those gentleman who have dealt with this question
