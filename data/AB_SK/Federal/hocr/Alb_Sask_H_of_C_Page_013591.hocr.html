               the ﬁrst draft. It is marked ‘Conﬁdentlal,

               they use the words ‘four provinces ’ ;

               Now, Mr. Speaker, what is the meaning 
               <br />
               of all these changes ? These changes were 
               <br />
               being discussed by statesmen who were 
               <br />
               "sent from Canada as the delegates of four 
               <br />
               provinces to arrange the terms of confeder- 
               <br />
               ation. The delegates were settling these 
               <br />
               provisions with regard to existing difﬁcul- 
               <br />
               ties between the provinces. They were 
               <br />
               negotiating the conditions of confederation. 
               <br />
               We all know the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂficulties</span> that existed at 
               <br />
               that time between Lower Canada and Upper 
               <br />
               Canada. There was the burning question 
               <br />
               of representation by population, and there 
               <br />
               were difﬁculties between the provinces down 
               <br />
               by the sea and ourselves. There was a 
               <br />
               divergence of interests. At the ﬁrst meeting 
               <br />
               two years before, there were six provinces 
               <br />
               represented; Newfoundland and Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island were represented and took 
               <br />
               part in the ﬁrst discussion. Newfoundland 
               <br />
               dropped out, and then the ﬁve provinces 
               <br />
               attempted to settle the difﬁculties. The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst diﬂiculty arose because Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island wanted more than its share of re- 
               <br />
               presentation, and the other provinces would 
               <br />
               not agree. Prince Edward Island candidly 
               <br />
               admitted that they could not argue that 
               <br />
               they were entitled to six members, but they 
               <br />
               said: There is no use talking to us about 
               <br />
               coming into confederation if you insist upon 
               <br />
               our having only our proportion according 
               <br />
               to population : you must give us six or we
