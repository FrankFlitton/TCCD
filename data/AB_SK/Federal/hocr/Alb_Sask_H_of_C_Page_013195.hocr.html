               Nothing can be plainer than this language. The

               done now by legislation, in future it will 
               <br />

               <br />
               and bayonets._ The expression is not mine, but 
               <br />
               that of the hon. gentleman himself. It has been 
               <br />
               repeated, not once or twice, but several times 
               <br />
               in different parts of the Dominion. So this is the 
               <br />
               policy upon which the hon. gentleman is endeavor- 
               <br />
               ing to form a new party, or to re-organise an old 
               <br />
               party. This is the policy the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               offers to his fellow-countrymen of English origin. 
               <br />
               I denounce this policy as anti-Canadian ; I denounce 
               <br />
               it as anti-British; I denounce it as being at 
               <br />
               variance with all the traditions of British Govern- 
               <br />
               ment in this country ; I denounce it as fatal to the 
               <br />
               hope we at one time entertained, and which I, for 
               <br />
               one, am not disposed to give up, of forming a 
               <br />
               nation on this Continent ; I denounce it as 
               <br />
               a crime, the consequences of which are 
               <br />
               simply shocking to contemplate. The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man may mean nothing more than a mere party 
               <br />
               device, but he is opening the ﬂood-gates to 
               <br />
               passions which, once aroused, perhaps no human 
               <br />
               power may be able to restrain. He is appealing to 
               <br />
               national and religious passions, the most inﬂexible 
               <br />
               of all passions, and—whatever may be his motive, 
               <br />
               Whatever his end, whatever his purpose—his 
               <br />
               movement cannot be characterised by any other 
               <br />
               language than that of a national crime. I do not 
               <br />
               know what are the motives which are actu- 
               <br />
               ating the hon. gentleman; I do not know 
               <br />
               them fully. I look only at the consequences. 
               <br />
               But, whatever may be the hon. gentleman’s 
               <br />
               motives, he has more than once felt impelled to 
               <br />
               repudiate the statement that he is actuated by 
               <br />
               hatred of the French race. If he were here, I 
               <br />
               would tell him that I accept his statement abso- 
               <br />
               lutely and entirely. Hatred is so base a senti- 
               <br />
               ment that I would not impute it to him, but, if he 
               <br />
               is not actuated by hatred, it is evident that he has 
               <br />
               a very strange misconception of the character of 
               <br />
               French Canadians, and must have a very low 
               <br />
               estimate of their moral standard. In the speech 
               <br />
               to which I have already alluded, the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman did not hesitate to go consider— 
               <br />
               ably out of his way, in order to refer to 
               <br />
               the agitation which, a few years ago, passed over 
               <br />
               the Province of Quebec, consequent upon the 
               <br />
               rebellion in the North-West and the execution 
               <br />
               of the chief participant in the same. He did not 
               <br />
               hesitate then to attribute the storm of indignation 
               <br />
               which, at that time, convulsed a highly emotional 
               <br />
               race to the lowest sentiments which can actuate 
               <br />

               had been worked up to madness against the Dominion

               man.” I repeat this sentiment in his own words. 
               <br />
               Well, I have simply this to say, that Whoever de- 
               <br />
               clares that the position taken by the people of 
               <br />
               Quebec upon this question was not an honest one 
               <br />
               is guilty of slander, and makes a statement the 
               <br />
               truth of which he cannot prove. The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man has not, however, the odium of having invent- 
               <br />
               ed that charge. It has been a stock phrase of the 
               <br />
               Conservative ministerial press of Ontario for the. 
               <br />
               last three or four years. So long as it was simply 
               <br />
               conﬁned to some obscure scribblers it might be 
               <br />
               passed in silence, but when the hon. gentleman did 
               <br />
               not hesitate to give it the countenance of his name 
               <br />
               and reputation, and when, moreover, such senti- 
               <br />
               ments are re-echoed in this House, I cannot allow 
               <br />
               the charge to pass unrebuked. I will meet the 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen on his own grounds. I will not dis- 
               <br />
               pute his expression that the people of Quebec were 
               <br />
               driven to madness on this question, but as to the 
               <br />
               motives attributed by him I will state that the 
               <br />
               people of Quebec believe in their conscience, 
               <br />
               whether right or wrong, that the execution “of 
               <br />
               that Frenchman” (to use the words of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman) was an unjustiﬁable homicide. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman will not forget that twenty-three 
               <br />
               of his colleagues; twenty-three of those who 
               <br />

               <br />
               of them who, like himself, will not be read out

               of the party, but who will remain Conservatives— 
               <br />
               telegraphed to the Prime Minister that the execu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               than that. The hon. gentleman will not forget 
               <br />
               that the press of the civilised world decided upon 
               <br />
