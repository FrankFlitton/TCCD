               Haultain submitted here last winter and I 
               <br />
               may say that a grant amounting to 85 per 
               <br />
               cent of the North-west government estimate, 
               <br />
               is better treatment than the North-west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories ever got in any former year. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend (Mr. Borden‘, Halifax) read ex-

               tensively from letters, and communications 
               <br />
               and documents, and records, of one kind 
               <br />
               or another, to prove that the Prim-e Minister 
               <br />
               of the North—west Territories was very much 
               <br />
               dissatisﬁed with the treatment meted out 
               <br />
               to him by this government.

               whether it would be proper to say that this 
               <br />
               state of dissatisfaction is chronic with the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of the territories, but it is 
               <br />
               a fact that in former years and under other 
               <br />
               federal governments, his dissatisfaction 
               <br />
               was no less pronounced. Let me read to

               my hon. friend a letter which Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               read in the assembly last spring, to prove 
               <br />
               that he has no more particular complaint to 
               <br />

               In the matter of legislation, too, there see-ms 
               <br />
               to be a similar amount of indifference to our 
               <br />
               wants and our requests. We have for four years 
               <br />
               asked that the amount transferred to the as- 
               <br />
               sembly should be voted as a straight grant, by 
               <br />
               that means obviating the necessity of a double 
               <br />
               audit and account, a double system of books, a. 
               <br />
               largely increased staff in our oﬂices, and an 
               <br />
               amount of extra work altogether out of propor— 
               <br />
               tion to any beneﬁts derivable from the system.

               This request was agreed to by the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance and the Minister of the Interior in 
               <br />
               1892, and has been approved by the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior every year since then. A simple 
               <br />
               clause in the Act would bring about this most 
               <br />
               desirable change, but the clause has not yet 
               <br />
               been proposed.

               <br />
