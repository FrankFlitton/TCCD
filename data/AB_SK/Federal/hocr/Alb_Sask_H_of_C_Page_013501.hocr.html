               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DAYIN.</span> From one point of view. 
               <br />
               My lion. friend may be quite certain that I 
               <br />
               would not disparage the importance of any 
               <br />
               part of Canada to Canada at large. I know 
               <br />
               full well the importance of that magniﬁ- 
               <br />
               cent province of the Paciﬁc. But what I 
               <br />
               say is that there is no part of Canada so 
               <br />
               important at this hour to Canada as the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories, with their boundless 
               <br />
               fertile acres awaiting the plough of the 
               <br />
               immigrant. If provincial government be 
               <br />
               good for the provinces, why should it not 
               <br />
               be good for the North-west Territories ?

               .Columbia. That is shown by the last cen- 
               <br />
               sus. And we have more fertile land than
