               one hon. gentleman says it would be dangerous to 
               <br />
               refer a question of this kind to the people, that it

               would be dangerous to go among them and freely 
               <br />
               discuss whether they should abandon the printing 
               <br />
               of their Journals and their debates in French ; yet, 
               <br />
               in the same breath, that hon. gentleman has told 
               <br />
               us he was willing to refer to them the question of 
               <br />
               separate schools. He holds that it would be quite 
               <br />
               safe to discuss before the people the question of 
               <br />
               taking away their separate schools, but that it 
               <br />
               would be dangerous to go among them and discuss 
               <br />
               a question as simple as this. It is argued by some 
               <br />
               that this is a question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affecting</span> the rights of minori- 
               <br />
               ties, and that, therefore, this House should deal 
               <br />
               with it. \Vell, I think that a very great dis- 
               <br />
               tinction lies as to what are the rights of min- 
               <br />
               orities and what are not. Minorities have rights, 
               <br />
               it is true, but they must be limited, because if 
               <br />
               they are to be co—extensive with the majority, 
               <br />
               then the minorities would in all cases rule. The 
               <br />
               rights of a minority must be those important 
               <br />

               Would any hon. gentleman contend that our statutes, 
               <br />
               which are circulated among our people for the pur-

               pose of educating the people as to what the law is, 
               <br />
               should be placed in the hands of magistrates and 
               <br />
               ofﬁcers throughout the country printed only in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               that in these matters, such as appertain to a

               <br />
               brought in question, it is right that this House 
               <br />
               should retain its protectorate, and in the other 
               <br />
               matters, such as the internal economy of the council 
               <br />
               it is only just that the council should deal with them 
               <br />
               just as soon as the people are consulted in the mat- 
               <br />
               ter. But the hon. member for North Victoria said 
               <br />
               that this amendment amounted to a put off, that
