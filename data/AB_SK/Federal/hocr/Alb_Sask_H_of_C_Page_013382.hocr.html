               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">important</span> question. I humbly submit that we have

               no right whatever, under the present circumstances, 
               <br />
               to pass this clause. I admit that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the1101</span> ermnent, 
               <br />
               in respecting the rights of the minority as to

               education, have made a step in the right direction, 
               <br />
               and I fully endorse their action in that respect. I 
               <br />
               admit also that to pr'eser1 e the right of the minority 
               <br />
               to the use of the French language before the courts, 
               <br />
               is another good featuie of the Bill; but they are 
               <br />
               giving power to a local council to regulate, by 
               <br />
               ordinance or otherwise, what language they will 
               <br />
               be pleased to use in their proceedings and the 
               <br />
               reports of their proceedings. That amounts to 
               <br />
               saying that this Parliament rlefarto abolishes the 
               <br />
               French language, as far as that goes, for, as we 
               <br />
               well know, the majority there will, on the very 
               <br />
               ﬁrst day, declare that the expense and trouble of 
               <br />
               having their proceedings recorded in both languages 
               <br />
               will be too great and the French language will be 
               <br />
               abolished. Moreover, we are admitting a principle 
               <br />
               I cannot endorse, and which I am sure a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro</span> 
               <br />
               portion of the people of this Dominion will not sup- 
               <br />
               port. That is the principle that, at any moment, we 
               <br />
               may grant to the majority of a province the right to 
               <br />
               take away the liberties, the franchise and the privi- 
               <br />
               leges of the minorities, with regard to education or 
               <br />
               religion, which amounts to the same thing, and to 
               <br />
               language. I am opposed to that principie. The 
               <br />
               hon member for Queen’s (Mr. Davies) said he was 
               <br />
               in favour of provincial autonomy, and wanted to 
               <br />
               ~leav e to the provinces full control 111 these matters 
               <br />
               I am also an- autOnOmist but w ill not go so far as 
               <br />
               that. I hold that when interests are common, 
               <br />
               when it is a material question, when the question_ 
               <br />
               is one which relates to commerce 01 eiv il property, 
               <br />
               in which the interests of all are homogeneous,
