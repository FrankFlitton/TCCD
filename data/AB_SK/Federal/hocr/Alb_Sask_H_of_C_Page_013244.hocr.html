               a telegram of regret that I was unable to attend, 
               <br />
               being otherwise engaged in professional duties,

               <br />
               the records, had been stolen through in the dying 
               <br />
               hours of the Session of 1878, under the charge of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Bothwell. Was that an agita— 
               <br />
               tion of which any man need be ashamed? Was 
               <br />
               that pandering to the already aroused passions? 
               <br />
               What followed ? It is said that I have undertaken 
               <br />
               to act for the people of the North-VVest Territories ; 
               <br />
               that no mission has been given me so to act for 
               <br />
               them, and that I am an intruder. Sir, when it 
               <br />
               became known that I purposed to take my holidays 
               <br />
               in the N orth—VVest, I was invited to address

               meetings throughout the Province of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               I had to decline to do so, except at one place,

               those who desire that I should address them 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               next morning that the newspapers abused me for 
               <br />
               passing them by. I refused to address a meeting 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> at Winnipeg, only to ﬁnd that I was subject to 
               <br />
               castigation for passing by the important centre of 
               <br />
               that Province. The hon. member says I spoke at 
               <br />
               a Conservative centre. He knows pretty well, I 
               <br />
               think, he will be honest enough to admit, that 
               <br />
               the choice of place for holding the meeting, which 
               <br />
               happened to be at Portage la Prairie, was not my 
               <br />
               choice; but when I stated, as I did state, that I 
               <br />
               would only deliver one address in the North- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               no choice in the matter, one way or the other. 
               <br />
               I know the charge was made that it was chosen, 
               <br />
               because it was in a constituency represented by the 
               <br />
               hon. member who has just made the interruption, 
               <br />
               but I think that hon. member will do me the 
               <br />
               justice to say that, at all events, that charge was 
               <br />
               not founded so far as I am concerned. The charge 
               <br />
               has also been made that I was playing the game 
               <br />
               of the First Minister, that I was a mere tool in 
               <br />
               his hands, that I was going through this country 
               <br />
               without being sincere in my pledges, that in What 
               <br />
               I stated I was carrying on an agitation in collusion 
               <br />
               with him. Sir, I do not think that charge was

               <br />

               <br />

               other side, a still greater truckling to that which,

               denounce, and, if possible, to overturn. There- 
               <br />
               fore, why should I cross the ﬂoor of the House and 
               <br />
               follow the banner of hon. gentlemen opposite? 
               <br />
               I took an opportunity long ago of stating exactly 
               <br />
               where I stood ; I spoke in the Opera House in this 
               <br />
               city—I do not know Whether the First Minister 
               <br />
               took the trouble of reading it, but it was there for 
               <br />
               him to read—I stated then exactly where I stood. 
               <br />
               I stated that when these questions came up, if my 
               <br />
               party <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differed</span> from the view which ought to be 
               <br />
               taken, I must stand alone, and I must follow these 
               <br />
               011 other questions I 
               <br />
               stated there, as I have stated elsewhere, that as I 
               <br />
               was elected a supporter of the general policy of 
               <br />
               the Government, I was still a supporter of, and 
               <br />
               still a believer in that policy. If my connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the party that I have hitherto sup— 
               <br />
               ported is an injury to that party, as I think 
               <br />
               perhaps it is, if the gentlemen who sit behind 
               <br />
               me do not want me here, I am willing 
               <br />
               to go here or there, I care not where. I think I . 
               <br />
               can ﬁnd a seat in this House, and I can still voice 
               <br />
               the opinions of my own constituency, and a large

               proportion of the people of Ontario, whether I 
               <br />
               am turned out of this party or not, and Whether 
               <br />
               I am accepted in that party or not. Such has been 
               <br />
               my course, and I am not ashamed of it. I de-

               nounce that man as a traitor to his country, I care 
               <br />
               not who he may be, who endeavors to arouse 
               <br />
               political passions and race passions by misrepre~ 
               <br />
               senting my views ; he is the man who is doing the 
               <br />
               wrong, he is the man who is endeavoring in this 
               <br />
               Parliament and in this country to set race against 
               <br />
               race and religion against religion, because if my 
               <br />
               views are fairly looked at, if my statements are 
               <br />
               fairly examined, if my speeches are fairly read, I 
               <br />
               think no taint of bitterness will be found, because 
               <br />
               no taint of bitterness exists, towards my French 
               <br />
