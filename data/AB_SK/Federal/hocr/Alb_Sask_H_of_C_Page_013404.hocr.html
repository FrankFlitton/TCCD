               that religion whether they are compelled by the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iiouse</span> will agree with me, the great vigour, intel-

               the people of Great Britain to-day is largely due to 
               <br />
               the fact that they are a people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> mixed blood. 
               <br />
               Any one who has studied the laws of heredity 
               <br />
               knows that the kingly men and ‘ queenly women 
               <br />
               have in all days been the result of the union of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> but cognateraces. . <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> ﬁnd it has had

               for North Bruce instanccd the case of the high- 
               <br />
               landers of Scotland and the feuds which existed 
               <br />
               betWeen them and the people of the lowlands, and 
               <br />
               he said if they had all spoken the One tongue these 
               <br />
               feuds would not have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existed.</span> N ow, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘I</span> have always

               <br />
               he is thoroughly honest, but I must take the liberty

               I am very doubtful if any such result would have

               followed the speaking of the same language. : W'hy, 
               <br />
               at that time when the bitterest feuds existed and 
               <br />
               the hottest ﬁghting was going on between the two 
               <br />
