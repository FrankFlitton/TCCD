               Not only, Sir, was this petition thus with almost 
               <br />
               practical unanimity resolved upon, but I am 
               <br />
               informed, and I believe the fact to be, although I 
               <br />
               have not examined it, that every newspaper pub- 
               <br />
               lished in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Vest</span> has declared in favor of 
               <br />
               the abolition of the dual <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">languages—every</span> paper 
               <br />
               which has referred to the subject, I mean. One 
               <br />
               distinguished paper, the Regina <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Leader,</span> I believe, 
               <br />
               has not yet thought it a subject worthy of notice ; 
               <br />
               but almost every other paper has pronounced in 
               <br />
               favor of abolition. So that we have practically 
               <br />
               the unanimous opinion of the people of that terri— 
               <br />
               tory. Now, are we going to perpetuate this sys- 
               <br />
               tem of things ‘3 Are we going to permit it to grow 
               <br />
               into what might be called a vested right, so that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by-andhye</span> a French Canadian can urge, and with 
               <br />
               some degree of truth, “I have left my own home 
               <br />
               in the Province of Quebec and have gone and 
               <br />
               settled in the North-W'est Territories, relying on 
               <br />
               the faith of an Act of Parliament by which it was 
               <br />
               said I should be allowed to have my language.” Is 
               <br />
               it, or is it not, a matter which we ought to deal 
               <br />
               With, and deal with promptly ? Sir, I have nothing 
               <br />
               further to add on the general question. I will only 
               <br />
               say, in conclusion, that while I have thought it 
               <br />
               right at this early stage to make a statement of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'reasons</span> which have actuated the course I am

               <br />
               ber throughout the speech which he has just 
               <br />
               delivered ; I shall only animadvert upon certain 
               <br />
               passages. He stated, among other things, that the 
               <br />
               language of a people is the foundation of its nation- 
               <br />
               ality. I ask myself, if this idea is correct, how 
               <br />
               does it happen that in the Islands of Jersey and 
               <br />
               Guernsey, which have been English possessions for 
               <br />
               more than two hundred years, they have preserved 
               <br />
               the French language,——that the French language 
               <br />
               only is spoken,——and that that language is the only 
               <br />
               one recognised <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcially?</span> How comes it that in 
               <br />
               the Island of Saint Lucie and the other islands in 
               <br />
               the Antilles which happen to be British possessions, 
               <br />
               the French language is spoken? Is this merely a 
               <br />
               privilege which the peoples of these places have ar— 
               <br />
               rogated to themselves ; or is it not rather a privi- 
               <br />
               lege granted by the British Crown, by the laws, 
               <br />
               and by the constitution of these countries that the 
               <br />
               mother tongue of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inhabitant!</span> is allowed them. 
               <br />
               So that the power which we possess, we French 
               <br />
               Canadians, of using our mother tongue is no unpre- 
               <br />
               cedented concession ; it is not a right possessed ex- 
               <br />
               clusively by the French Canadian subject, but it is, 
               <br />
               a right which belongs to subjects in other colonies 
               <br />
               of the Empire. The hon. member has observed 
               <br />
               that it is only in Switzerland where the use of two- 
               <br />
               languages is permitted. I think that if he had 
               <br />
               studied history he would have found that in other 
               <br />
               countries likewise the use of two distinct and dif- 
               <br />
               ferent languages is sanctioned. In Belgium, among- 
               <br />
               others, two languages are allowed ; French is the 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial language, even though the public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">docu-1</span> 
               <br />
               ments and papers are printed and published in 
               <br />
               Flemish. So that Canada forms no peculiar ex- 
               <br />
               ception. The strongest position of the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Simcoe rests upon the celebrated report of‘ 
               <br />
               Lord Durham, or supposed to be that of Lord 
               <br />
               Durham. All my fellow countrymen know what. 
               <br />
               this report is worth. It was not pro ared with 
               <br />
               the object of favoring the po ulation 0 this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coun-.</span> 
               <br />
               try ; it was not drafted in t e interests of those 
               <br />
               who then dwelt in Lower Canada ; but it was pro- 
               <br />
               jected with the aim of Anglicising and of being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">able]</span> 
               <br />
               to persecute the population which then dwelt in 
               <br />
               the land, to the beneﬁt of the immigration which 
               <br />
               had come out to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possess</span> it. Under such circum~
