               Mr. OLIVER. I was discussing this ques-

               tion of debt, the condition which has allow- 
               <br />
               ed the territories an advance of $250,000. 1 
               <br />
               point out that this is strictly in accordance 
               <br />
               with the request which has been made by 
               <br />
               the government of the North-west Territor-

               <br />
               troduced in the resolution before the House. 
               <br />
               And, in regard to the expenditure of the 
               <br />
               money, Mr. Haultain says that an advance 
               <br />
               on capital account is nothing more or less 
               <br />
               than a loan on which, eventually they would 
               <br />
               have to pay 5 per cent per annum. Naturally 
               <br />
               he would like to get out of paying ﬁve per

               ‘cent interest, and I think that having got 
               <br />
               out of it—that is the government having 
               <br />
               given a loan without interest—he naturally 
               <br />
               accepts the money and prepares to spend 
               <br />
               it—and it will do the territories that amount 
               <br />
               of good. I refer to this because of the 
               <br />
               way the matter was alluded to by hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite in a recent debate. 
               <br />
               They seemed to think there was an 
               <br />
               intention to take advantage of the ter- 
               <br />

               <br />
               impelling—tbem to take a loan which they 
               <br />
               either did not want or did not require. I 
               <br />
               wish to point out that it was strictly in ac- 
               <br />
               cordance with the wishes expressed by the 
               <br />
               North-west government, that it was placing 
               <br />
               them in the same ﬁnancial position exactly 
               <br />
               as if they were a provincial government, ex- 
               <br />
               cept that they were able to borrow money 
               <br />
               without paying interest, while if the terri- 
               <br />
               tories had provincial autonomy, they would 
               <br />
               have to pay interest on borrowed money.

               Mr. T. 0. DAVIS (Saskatchewan). As 
               <br />
               the hour is late, I do not intend to take up 
               <br />
               much time in discussing this question. The 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, in the long speech 
               <br />
               he delivered and the resolution be read, 
               <br />
               asked this House to vote in favour of grant- 
               <br />
               ing provincial autonomy to the territories. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that in doing so he should 
               <br />
               have put some facts before us on which we 
               <br />
               could vote intelligently. As far as I could 
               <br />
               understand his speech, he seemed simply to 
               <br />
               be reading statements from the letters Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain had written to the government, 
               <br />
               and part of the replies. As representing a 
               <br />
               constituency in the North-west Territories I 
               <br />
               have always been opposed to the proposition 
               <br />
               of Premier Haultain. In this connection, 
               <br />
               I may say that Premier Haultain in one of 
               <br />
               his letters said that the members here do 
               <br />
               not know the public opinion in the territor- 
               <br />
               ies. I say I know as much about public op- . 
               <br />
               inion in the territories as Premier Haultain 
               <br />
               does, and I say a majority of people are op- 
               <br />
               posed to this scheme, and for goo-d and sub- 
               <br />
               stantial reasons, as I can show. The leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition should have informed himself 
               <br />
               as to the revenue the people of the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories at this stage of the proceedings 
               <br />
               would be entitled to draw from the federal 
               <br />
               treasury, and show why it would be better 
               <br />
               for us to have autonomy. The .hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man quoted a great deal from this sessional 
               <br />
               paper, No. 116, and in one case, I notice. 
               <br />
               he read only half a paragraph, and left the 
               <br />
               other half which did not suit 'his purpose. 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain has made certain demands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up</span> 
               <br />
               on this country. My hon. friend from Al- 
               <br />
               berta (Mr. Oliver) has said he laid before 
               <br />
               the House a full statement of what he 
               <br />
               wants. I have taken the liberty of boiling 
               <br />
               down the demands, and. I think I can give 
               <br />
               in brief just what Mr. Haultain asks this 
               <br />
               House to give him, if we are prepared to 
               <br />
               give provincial autonomy. He wants ﬁrst. 
               <br />
               all the public lands. The leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition said he was prepared to support 
               <br />
               that part of the proposition. I am glad to 
               <br />
               see that he has approached the matier in 
               <br />
