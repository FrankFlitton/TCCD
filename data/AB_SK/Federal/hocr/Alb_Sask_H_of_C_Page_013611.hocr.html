               Mr. SPROULE. I thought that the conten-

               <br />

               <br />
               stronger reason why we should ask delay. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that as the Judicial Commit-

               <br />

               <br />
               the case to it before going any further. That,

               <br />
               provinces as well. We would then be sure 
               <br />
               of our ground and we would be going a 
               <br />

               should have its representation reduced in 
               <br />
