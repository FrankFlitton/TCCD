               I shall try and emulate the moderation with

               with which he has approached it. The

               ordinary and unprecedented. I admit at 
               <br />
               once that it is extraordinary. but I do not 
               <br />
               at all admit that it is unprecedented. It is 
               <br />
               certainly extraouiinary. and I agree with

               him in his statement that the subject of 
               <br />

               <br />
               should pertain to the Local Legislatures. This 
               <br />
               was the case at the time Confederation was 
               <br />
               discussed in 1864. and it is equally the case 
               <br />
               in 1894; and we may ask ourselves why 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this‘</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extraordinary</span> legislation adopted 
               <br />
               in 1875. We may well ask ourselves. what

               <br />
               The Legislature was deprived of its supre-

               <br />
