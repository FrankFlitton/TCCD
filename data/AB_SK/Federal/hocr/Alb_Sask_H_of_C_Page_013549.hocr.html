               can speak from experience, having lived in 
               <br />
               that country from 1883 to date. I know

               something about the hardships of the people

               In reference to public works, it is quite 
               <br />
               evident that the sum at the disposal of the 
               <br />
               government of the North—west Territories is 
               <br />
               wholly inadequate. I can speak with 
               <br />
               special knowledge of that part of the 
               <br />
               country that I represent, the eastern part 
               <br />
               of Assiniboia. Take, for instance, the dis- 
               <br />
               trict lying north and south of the Qu’Appelle 
               <br />
               river. It is true, we have some steel 
               <br />
               bridges that are a credit to the territorial 
               <br />
               government that erected them. But even 
               <br />
               they are of little use in the spring season. 
               <br />
               I venture to say that to-day the great ma- 
               <br />
               jority of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people living on the north side 
               <br />
               of the river are not able to cross the valley 
               <br />
               or approach the bridges to reach the market 
               <br />
               with a load of grain. That is a hardship. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               They have grain on their hands that they 
               <br />
               are anxious to get rid of and to settle their 
               <br />
               liabilities. But this they cannot do because 
               <br />
               the approaches to these bridges are in a 
               <br />
               state that altogether forbids their reaching 
               <br />
               the markets. Perhaps they will not be 
               <br />
               able to reach the markets till the end of 
               <br />
               May or the beginning of June. We have 
               <br />
               a local organization for the improvement 
               <br />
               of the roads, and this has been a step in 
               <br />
               the right direction. 11 think the system is 
               <br />
               even superior in point of organization to the 
               <br />
               municipal arrangements of the older pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. The local improvement districts of. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i</span>

               the North-west Territories are doing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goodl</span> 
               <br />
               work and proving that the scheme will be 
               <br />
               a great success. Up to the last three or 
               <br />
               four years it has been largely in the hands 
               <br />
               of the settlers to help themselves in making 
               <br />
               roads to reach their markets, to call upon 
               <br />
               their neighbour, and they collect a num- 
               <br />
               ber of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">individuals</span> who voluntarily gave their 
               <br />
               work to make the road. But the govern- 
               <br />
               ment has organized the local improvement 
               <br />
               districts which entails a direct tax upon 
               <br />
               each quarter section for the improvement 
               <br />
               of the roads. And that certainly, as I have 
               <br />
               said, is a step in the right direction. But 
               <br />
               I have always felt that the sum that was 
               <br />
               given for the government of the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories was entirely inadequate. It is 
               <br />
               quite true that we have a claim upon the 
               <br />
               treasury of this Dominion, in common with 
               <br />
               the other provinces to a certain amount per 
               <br />
               head according to population. But it seems 
               <br />
               to me, in view of the rapid growth of im- 
               <br />
               migration and of the population of that

               to make the provisions which the circum-

               <br />
               we are spending more upon immigration 
               <br />

               <br />
               like to point out to the committee. It may 
               <br />
               not be popular, perhaps, for me to call at- 
               <br />
               tention to it. We would not say that this 
               <br />
               Dominion is paying too much for the wards 
               <br />
               of the country and for our Indian popula- 
               <br />
               tion. I would not for a moment insinuate 
               <br />
               that the government is paying too much for 
               <br />
               the Indian youth of the North-west Terri- 
               <br />

               pared to give the exact ﬁgures on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in‘</span>

               stant, but what I say can be veriﬁed— 
               <br />
               that we are spending more upon the Indian 
               <br />

               <br />
               for the whole government of those terri-

               tories. Now, I would like to emphasize 
               <br />
               what has already been said that under ex-

               isting circumstances something might to be

               Mr. McCREAItY.' I desire to say a very 
               <br />
               few words on this subject, ﬁrst, because 
               <br />
               this affects the prairie country, and I would 
               <br />
               like to endorse the sentiments of my col- 
               <br />
               leagues, and, second, because this is one of 
               <br />
               the most important questions that is to 
               <br />
               come before this House in the near future— 
               <br />
               the subsidy of the territories, or provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy therefor. I have been reading 
               <br />
               what has taken place in the House in Regina 
               <br />
               with regard to territorial autonomy and I 
               <br />
               must say that I was struck with the force 
               <br />
               of the arguments. But my own impression 
               <br />
               is that, at the present time, there are good 
               <br />
               arguments why provincial autonomy should 
               <br />
               not to be given to the territories. I believe 
               <br />
               that within the next three or four years, 
               <br />
               if immigration should continue as at pre- 
               <br />
               sent, the population of the territories will 
               <br />
               have so increased and so tended to certain 
               <br />
               portions of the territories that probably the 
               <br />
               local jealousies that now exist as to whether 
               <br />
               there should be one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> two or three pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, and where the capitals shall be, 
               <br />
               will have disappeared. I sometimes think 
               <br />
               also that they have not considered the ex- 
               <br />
               penditure that would devolve upon them if 
               <br />
               they had to govern themselves. Take, for 
               <br />
               instance, the mounted police. I am not 
               <br />
               sure, but I suppose the number of police 
               <br />
               in the territories must reach from ﬁve hun- 
               <br />
               dred to a thousand. If the duty of policing 
               <br />
               the country devolved upon the local govern- 
               <br />
               ment, what a large percentage of the sub-
