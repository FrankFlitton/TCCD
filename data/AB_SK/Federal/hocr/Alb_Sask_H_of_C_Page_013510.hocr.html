               tion of the House was drawn to the position 
               <br />
               in which the law was up there as to voters' 
               <br />
               lists. and I myself took the ground that the 
               <br />
               voters’ lists was an immaterial matter en- 
               <br />
               tirely in the Territories. on account of the 
               <br />
               existence of this particular clause, which 
               <br />
               practically allowed every voter to vote, whe- 
               <br />
               ther his name was on the lists or not. I re— 
               <br />
               member stating that we might as well save 
               <br />
               the expense of a voters’ lists. under the cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances. But it was claimed by one of 
               <br />
               the members from the Territories that the 
               <br />
               list was necessary because without it it 
               <br />
               would not be possible to poll all the votes 
               <br />
               Within the time limited by the Election Act. 
               <br />
               This very vital change was made in the 
               <br />
               Senate. I think it will be admitted by the 
               <br />
               House that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changes</span> of this kind should not 
               <br />
               be made in the Senate. This is one of the 
               <br />
               matters surely which should originate in this 
               <br />
               House—an alteration in the law with regard 
               <br />
               to the constitution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> this House. It does

               Senate to undertake to make that vital
