               its success is certain ; while where the opportunity 
               <br />
               occurs aggressive action is but too likely to ensue. 
               <br />
               That is the condition of things, Sir, which I believe 
               <br />
               will be accomplished by the efforts that are now 
               <br />
               being made. I regard the prospect of reforms 
               <br />
               which I myself should desire to see accomplished 
               <br />
               in the Province of Quebec, as removed—I will 
               <br />
               not say to an incalculable but to a very long 
               <br />
               distance—by this agitation even so far as it has 
               <br />
               gone. I regard that prospect as absolutely 
               <br />
               vanished, should this agitation receive the sup- 
               <br />
               port and countenance to any considerable extent 
               <br />
               of this House and of the people of the Dominion 
               <br />
               at large. No, Sir, the fullest and the frankest 
               <br />
               recognition of the provincial and covenanted rights ; 
               <br />
               the evidence which we shall give within the domain 
               <br />
               of our power in the various Provinces of Canada, 
               <br />
               of a generous and liberal consideration for those 
               <br />
               minorities which are under our control ; combined 
               <br />
               with a sympathetic interest in the welfare of our 
               <br />
               neighbors give titles—justtitles—to friendly sugges- 
               <br />
               tions to helpful advice, to legitimate inﬂuence. 
               <br />
               Nor have I despaired in the past; nor when this 
               <br />
               cloud passes away shall I despair in the future for 
               <br />
               the recognition of those titles. At any rate I am 
               <br />
               on the side of those who shall stand by those 
               <br />
               minorities who are, as I have pointed out, threat- 
               <br />
               ened and proposed to be coerced (by constitutional 
               <br />
               means I admit, but it is not the less threat and 
               <br />
               coercion, however constitutionally you may do it) 
               <br />

               believe that any other attitude is impotent for 
               <br />

               Mr. BLAKE. Mr. Speaker, we have heard some- 
               <br />
               thing to-day—of what I fear we shall hear more of' 
               <br />
               in Canada for some time—of a union of race and a 
               <br />
               union of creed. This question is not unfamiliar to 
               <br />
               my cars. In days long one by I found myself, as 
               <br />
               my predecessor in the eadership of the Liberal 
               <br />
               party found himself, as my successor in that 
               <br />
               leadership, I dare say, may ﬁnd himself, confronted 
               <br />
               with attempts to unite and consolidate in the ranks 
               <br />
               of one party those of one nationality, and to con- 
               <br />
               solidate in the ranks of one party those of one creed. 
               <br />
               This question is not new in Canada. Those 
               <br />
               attempts I met by no private bargain or 
               <br />
               intrigue ; I met them by frank statements in 
               <br />
               this House and on public platforms of my 
               <br />
               views on the questions of race and creed, and of 
               <br />
               the rights and interests of minorities ; I met them 
               <br />
               by on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effort</span> to convince those most particularly 
               <br />
               concerned that there were no real grounds for 
               <br />
               those attempts—attempts which I deprecated then, 
               <br />
               as I deprecate them now, as public calamities— 
               <br />
               and by the assurance that my fellow countrymen of 
               <br />
               all creeds and all races might differ and agree, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accord</span> 
               <br />
               ing to their opinions on political topics, with abso- 
               <br />
               lute conﬁdence as to the safety of the rights 
               <br />
               peculiar to themselves on questions of race and creed. 
               <br />
               That assurance, I believe I could well give ; that 
               <br />
               assuranCe I hope this debate will enable us in 
               <br />
               Canada still to give ; but largely on the issues of this 
               <br />
               debate does the question of that assurance turn. Sir, 
               <br />
               at all times and in all countries minorities are inclined 
               <br />
               to be susceptible, jealous, apprehensive, exacting— 
               <br />
               such is the condition of human nature. Those 
               <br />
               who are in minorities feel it ; and those who happen 
               <br />
               to be in majorities, though they may complain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> of 
               <br />
               it, ought to understand it too. Minorities are 
               <br />
               apt to believe that they must unite in order to 
               <br />
               protect themselves against aggression ; and such 
               <br />
               union amongst themselves, and such consequent 
               <br />
               isolation from their fellow-countrymen, is, wherever 
               <br />
               it occurs, and just in proportion to the extent of its 
               <br />
               occurrence, a serious danger to the state. But this is 
               <br />
               oftentimes excusable, and sometimes even justiﬁable ; 
               <br />
               and in the face of such attacks as those to which I 
               <br />
               referred this afternoon, I am not able in any strong 
               <br />
               language to condemn, although I do not intend to 
               <br />
               applaud, and although I still most earnestly depre- 
               <br />
               cate, any such attempt at union. I am speaking 
               <br />
               this day mainly in the hope to avert, if by any 
               <br />
               feeble effort of mine I can avert, the continued ex— 
               <br />
               istence of those apprehensions which might be a 
               <br />
               justiﬁcation, or at any rate an excuse, for 
               <br />
               such union. Sir, in times of gloom and depression 
               <br />
               as to the future of my country—perhaps I am 
               <br />
               not an optimist, perhaps I have taken and may 
               <br />
               take now in many aspects a View too gloomy as 
               <br />
               to the condition and prospects of Canada, but in 
               <br />
               times in which I have felt gloom and depression 
               <br />
               as to the prospects and future of my country, as 
               <br />
               to its progress in several of the respects which are 
               <br />
               essential to the making of a nation, I have had in 
               <br />
               these latter years the consolation of believing that, 
               <br />
               in whatever other respects we might be stationary, 
               <br />
               perhaps, even, I am ashamed to say, retrograde, 
               <br />
               in the respect at any rate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.of</span> tolerance and 
               <br />
               re ard to the rights and privileges and suscepti- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bﬁties</span> of minorities, We were moving on— 
               <br />
               slowly, steadily moving on— to a. higher plane.
