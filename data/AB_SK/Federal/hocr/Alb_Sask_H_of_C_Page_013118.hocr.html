               Mr. MCCARTHY. Before the Orders of the 
               <br />
               Day are called, I would ask the leader of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> 
               <br />
               House whether it would not be convenient that a, 
               <br />
               day should be ﬁxed for the second reading of the 
               <br />
               Bill that stands in my name with reference to the 
               <br />
               North-VVest Territories Act. I have suggested <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to.»</span>

               him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vednesday</span> week, if that would be convenient -

               <br />
               would be well that a day should be ﬁxed. The 
               <br />
               day suggested, Wednesday, the 12th February, 
               <br />
