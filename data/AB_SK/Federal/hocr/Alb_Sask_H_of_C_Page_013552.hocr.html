               better in the interests of the. local govern- 
               <br />
               ment that the request should be acceded to 
               <br />
               and that the reasons given by the hon. Min— 
               <br />
               ister ot' the Interior are not sufﬁcient why 
               <br />

               be refused that which they believe to be in 
               <br />
               their own interests. Let as take another 
               <br />
               point : I recognize that there are some very 
               <br />
               ticklish questions that come 11p in the dif- 
               <br />
               ferent provinces. I recognize that the Brit- 
               <br />
               ish North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> Act gives each province 
               <br />
               certain rights as to the administration of 
               <br />
               its own affairs, and we know as a matter of 
               <br />
               fact that. the residents of the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories of all classes and of all creeds 
               <br />
               will be alive to their interests, and that once 
               <br />
               you undertake to organize them into a pro- 
               <br />
               vince and give them rights under the British 
               <br />
               North America Act they will be very jealous 
               <br />
               of these rights and may be. hard to please. 
               <br />
               Is that the chief reason Why the govern- 
               <br />
               ment refuse to organize these people into a 
               <br />
               province? It strikes me. after considering 
               <br />
               the whole question as carefully as I can, 
               <br />
               that there is really more in that objection 
               <br />
               than there is in the reasons given by the 
               <br />
               hon. minister who represents the govern- 
               <br />
               ment in this matter. I do not desire to take 
               <br />
               up more of the time of the committee, nor 
               <br />
               do I wish to advocate an expensive form of 
               <br />
               government. but. taking the vieWS of the 
               <br />
               representatives who come. from the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. who have expressed them- 
               <br />
               selves in favour of the organization of these 
               <br />
               territories into a province. I for one. feel 
               <br />
               that if they can do that without imposing 
               <br />
               any additional burdens on the people of the

               by members of the committee that there was

               There is no question Whatever on that point.

               The North-West territorial government has 
               <br />
               gone so far as to lay a proposed Bill for the

               to in all its provisions. that it would be a 
               <br />
               very satisfactory arrangement. but, of 
               <br />
               course, whether I would agree to the for- 
               <br />
               mation of a province or not would depend 
               <br />
               entirely on the terms of the agreement. I

               <br />
               safe in endorsing the Bill as it is prepared. 
               <br />
               If a province can be secured on those terms 
               <br />
               I think it would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘be</span> a satisfactory arrange-

               <br />
               I wanted to particularly point out was that 
               <br />
               the people of the territories are not respon— 
               <br />
               sible in any shape or manner for coming to 
               <br />
               this parliament and making any indeﬁnite 
               <br />
               demand. They came and made a deﬁnite 
               <br />
               demand and if that definite demand is not 
               <br />
               accepted. then. we say. the only alternative 
               <br />
               you should take is that you should ascer-
