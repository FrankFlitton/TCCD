               lands'in the North- West. It has always been contended by 
               <br />
               me since I have had a seat in this House, that the lands of 
               <br />
               the Dominion should be administered in the interests of 
               <br />
               tha Dominion at large. It is to be regretted that we have 
               <br />
               not a larger population in the North-West and Manitoba 
               <br />
               to-day, and I hold that the land regulations of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment have had much to do with the lack of pepulation 
               <br />
               there. The system pursued by the Government of grant- 
               <br />
               ing large tracts to colonisation companies, and of making 
               <br />
               large reservations that were held exclusively for sale, has 
               <br />
               had a great deal to do with the sparse settlement that 
               <br />
               exists in the North-West today. I am pleased to be able 
               <br />
               to state that the land regulations of to-day are better than 
               <br />
               the regulations that prevailed a few years ago, and I 
               <br />
               was also glad to learn from the Minister of Interior, 
               <br />
               in an interview I had with him this morning. that 
               <br />
               some changes will be introduced during the present Session 
               <br />
               which will considerably improve the land regulations of 
               <br />
               the North-West. In regard to the price of land referred 
               <br />
               to by the member for Saskatchewan (Mr. Macdowall), I 
               <br />
               entirely differ with him in regard to that matter. It is a 
               <br />
               bad policy to place the land at such prices that actual 
               <br />
               settlers cannot afford to buy them and enter into the actual 
               <br />
               work of farming. The price of $250 per acre to the actual 
               <br />
               settler is too high for any man to pay for land in the North- 
               <br />
               West, to be devoted exclusively to farming purposes. As I 
               <br />
               have always contended, having some knowledge of the 
               <br />
               early settlement of that country, I hold that all the lands, 
               <br />
               odd and even sections, in the interest 01 Canada, should 
               <br />
               have been administered for the actual settlers instead of 
               <br />
               holding them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> sale. I know that as regards a consider- 
               <br />
               able portion of the country I represent, the land sales of 
               <br />
               1880-81 proved a curse to the settlers. The odd sections 
               <br />
               were sold by public competition, and the average price 
               <br />
               realised was about $2.60 per acre, the upset price being 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">82.50</span> per acre. Speculators entered into a combinatiou to 
               <br />
               pay as little as possible over the upset price, and the lands 
               <br />
               were sold at that ﬁgure. I know they have been held by 
               <br />
               the speculators who purchased them and who hold them 
               <br />
               today, and they are waiting in order to try and realise the 
               <br />
               amount they paid at that sale.

               <br />

               <br />
               never had an opportunity of realising that price for it 
               <br />

               <br />
               grants for railway companies,I believe it is necessary for 
               <br />
               the Government to give large tracts to encourage railway 
               <br />

               tion of the public domain for their assistance; but instead 
               <br />
               of giving land grants as in the past, I would suggest to the 
               <br />
               House and the Government that a different policy should 
               <br />
               be pursued, and that instead of giving alternate sections 
               <br />
               the Government should give alternate townships. This 
               <br />
               would be in the interest of settlement. Out of a township 
               <br />
               of thirty-six sections there are only sixteen sections avail 
               <br />
               able for homesteading; two sections belong to the Hudson’s 
               <br />
               Bay Company, two sections are public school lands, and all 
               <br />
               the remaining odd sections are reserved for sale or for rail- 
               <br />
               way grants. That being the case, there are only six- 
               <br />
               teen sections in a township of six miles square 
               <br />
               that are available for homesteaders. I submit, from 
               <br />
               what knowledge I have in regard to settlement 
               <br />
               in that country, that it would be much better, 
               <br />
               in the interests of the settler and of settlement, to reserve 
               <br />
               for railway purposes, or for sale, alternate townships 
               <br />
               instead of alternate sections. I have stated that 
               <br />
               I had been informed that some amendments were to

               <br />
               occasion during the past two years, as I have the occasion 
               <br />
               now, to refute the statements made by the hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               and particularly the allegation which he made this after- 
               <br />
               noon that the land laws of the United States were far 
               <br />
               more liberal to the settlers than the land laws of Canada at 
               <br />
               present in operation in Manitoba and the North West. I 
               <br />
               showed the hon. gentleman last year that this was not so. 
               <br />
               1 proved to him the year previous that it was not the fact, 
               <br />
               and my hon. friend the member for Lisgar (Mr. Ross) did 
               <br />
               the same, but, notwithstanding that, he gets up and makes a 
               <br />
               general statement against the land laws without giving us 
               <br />
               any particulars to support it. If, in the opinion of the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, the land laws of the United States are more 
               <br />
               liberal than the land laws of Canada, why does he not 
               <br />
               make some speciﬁc statement to bear out the allegations he 
               <br />
               makes? Are the land laws of the United States more 
               <br />
               liberal than the same laws of Canada? I say that they 
               <br />
               are not as liberal as our laws, and I will prove it. 
               <br />
               All that we require is that if a young man 
               <br />
               comes to Manitoba he should be 18 years of age, 
               <br />
               and that he should have not homesteaded previously. That 
               <br />
               young man goes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the land <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁce,</span> he says that he is eigh- 
               <br />
               teen years of age, that he had not homesteaded previousl y, 
               <br />
               and he is given his entry. He goes out to the land, 
               <br />
               performs six months duty in each year for three years, 
               <br />
