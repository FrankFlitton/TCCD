               <br />
               that ought to be argued, not because I have 
               <br />
               any doubt whatever of the soundness of 
               <br />
               the view I take, but for the simple reason 
               <br />
               that, when you are taking from a province 
               <br />
               a political right, when you are depriving a 
               <br />
               province of a certain number of represen- 
               <br />
               tatives, it is proper that every possible fa- 
               <br />
               cility should be given to make it clear that, 
               <br />
               if they have rights that are being interfered 
               <br />
               with by parliament, those rights will be 
               <br />
               construed by a proper tribunal. We want 
               <br />
               to have a fair redistribution; we do not 
               <br />
               want to take from any province what it has. 
               <br />
               On the contrary, we are of those who be-

               lieve that every constitutional right vested

               propose to occupy the time of the House in 
               <br />
               following the legal arguments that have been

               to adopt the words of Sir Henry Strong,

               ings (Mr. Northrup), in which he said we 
               <br />
               were entitled, in such a case as this, to refer 
               <br />
               to the history of the matter, to look at the 
               <br />
               circumstances of the time and see What was 
               <br />
               intended by those who, as delegates from 
               <br />
               the various provinces, sought to frame con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Minister of Justice, not for the purpose 
               <br />
               of following legal argument, but to show 
               <br />
               the House wherein our position differs from 
               <br />
               the argument he has advanced. The hon.

               the readjustment of representation comes in 
               <br />
               question that readjustment must take place 
               <br />
               before you can redistribute; and it is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques‘</span>

               tion of the law as to the readjustment of

               <br />
               the redistribution of the constituencies. Now, 
               <br />
               with regard to that, the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               has referred to the Manitoba Act as if that 
               <br />
               was inconsistent with the position taken by 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition (Mr. Borden, 
               <br />
               Halifax), and by my hon. friend from East

               ister of Justice has overlooked the excep—
