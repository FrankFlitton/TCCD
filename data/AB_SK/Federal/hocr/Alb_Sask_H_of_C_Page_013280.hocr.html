               country and to the antecedents of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from North Simcoe. I have said that I was con- 
               <br />
               siderably surprised to see my hon. friend moving 
               <br />
               in this direction; for I well remember the time 
               <br />
               when he was bowing the knee to the French people 
               <br />
               of his constituency, and professed to be as true 
               <br />
               and loyal a supporter of theirs as any man in this 
               <br />
               House or out of it. I well remember the time when 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman, instead of being in line with 
               <br />
               this crusade against race and religion, which has 
               <br />
               been mapped out by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">111m?</span> newspaper, and is sup- 
               <br />
               ported by a few of his friends throughout the coun- 
               <br />
               try, took the opposite course ; for I well remember 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘when</span> that hon. gentleman, one Saturday night in 
               <br />
               his constituency, when he found he could not reach 
               <br />
               Toronto the next day, Sunday, engaged a special 
               <br />
               train to go to that city, and arrived there in the 
               <br />
               morning, in order to interview Archbishop Lynch 
               <br />
               -on Sunday, to obtain His Grace’s support in that 
               <br />
               county. I well remember then how loyal the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman was to a paternal ancestor of his 
               <br />
               -of a more remote date than his immediate paternal 
               <br />
               ancestor, who supported a different religion from 
               <br />
               the one the hon. member for North Simcoe does, 
               <br />
               or the one his father did. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               was then holding out his hand to a certain class ; 
               <br />
               or it might be said that he was bowing the knee to 
               <br />
               Rome, and at the same time, on the other hand, 
               <br />
               bowing the knee to Ulster. In each case he was 
               <br />
               true to his blood. In the one he was true to his 
               <br />
               paternal ancestor of a more remote date, and in the 
               <br />
               other to his father. Therefore he could, with some 
               <br />
               show of fairness, say that he was true to both of 
               <br />
               his paternal ancestors. I do not know how far the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman went himself in both directions ; 
               <br />
               but I know that in the contests in which I had 
               <br />
               the honor of being his opponent in North Simcoe, 
               <br />
               my hon. friend did receive the support of a large 
               <br />
               number of the Roman Catholics and of the French 
               <br />
               people in that riding. But the gerrymander has 
               <br />
               removed a certain portion of these people from his 
               <br />
               riding, and he is not now quite so dependent on 
               <br />
               them as he was on that occasion.

               friend in a safe Tory constituency, but I warn my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from North Simcoe to look out for his 
               <br />
               political hide at the next election. Formerly 
               <br />
               he had the support, as I have said, of the French, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               proceed, that he had a member of his family lead- 
               <br />
               ing the singing in a Roman Catholic church at mass 
               <br />
               every Sunday. Then we have the hon. gentleman’s 
               <br />
               exempliﬁcation of the way in which he did things. 
               <br />
               You all remember the way in which he acted in 
               <br />
               reference to the dismissal of Mr. Letellier from the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant Governorship of the Province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               At that time the hon. gentleman’s heart was still 
               <br />
               “ true to Poll.” He stood by his friends, he stood 
               <br />
               ,by the Ultramontanes, and assisted to dislodge the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant Governor of that Province. Now, what 
               <br />
               is the meaning of this crusade? There are a great

               do not pretend to say which opinion is the correct 
               <br />
               one. It is stated that a certain newspaper would 
               <br />
               like to have some assistance from places in high 
               <br />
               quarters, the newspaper which, within a few 
               <br />
               years, has been feeding pretty liberally at the Tory 
               <br />
               crib, since the hon. gentlemen have been in power, 
               <br />

               <br />
               order to show that they had the two organs. Now, 
               <br />
               they have the two organs. The hon. the leader of 
               <br />
               the Government is backed up by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Empire</span> ; the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) has 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">AIM]</span> at his back ; and it is said that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">AIM?</span> 
               <br />
               demands that a new party should be formed to 
               <br />
               force matters upon the attention of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment ; that is, that they should have the balance 
               <br />
               of power in this House. We know what use 
               <br />
               would be made of it by some gentlemen 
               <br />
               in this House. I am sure my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from North Victoria (Mr. Barron) would not be 
               <br />
               a party to that, though he criticised very freely 
               <br />
               the speeches of some of the members in this House. 
               <br />
               They were principally on the Liberal side, because 
               <br />
               he did not ﬁnd anything in the speeches on the other 
               <br />
               side worth criticising, and he wanted to make a 
               <br />
               speech. Then there is another theory. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁlm]</span> 
               <br />
               newspaper had an agent at Washington not long 
               <br />
               since, and it appears that he was giving some extra- 
               <br />
               ordinary views and statements to the Congressional 
               <br />
               Commission who were sitting there at that time. 
               <br />
               This gentleman, who is the editor of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iliad</span> news- 
               <br />
               paper, declared that there was a strong annexation 
               <br />
               feeling in this country, and even went so far as to say 
               <br />
               that it would be found in this House. When the 
               <br />
               loyal motion of my hon. friend from North York 
               <br />
               (Mr. Mulock) was voted upon and unanimously 
               <br />
               adopted here, I think that Commission would come 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that the statements of that man 
               <br />
               were fallacious. I must say that I would have 
               <br />
               preferred if that loyal resolution had contained a 
               <br />
               clause showing that we were to be more loyal to 
               <br />
               Canada. I think some hon. gentlemen need a little 
               <br />
               training on the score of loyalty to Canada. I 
               <br />
               think a little advice on that subject would not hurt 
               <br />
               the leader of the Government.

               Mr. COOK. I think the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               who supported that resolution, would do better to 
               <br />
               show a little more of that loyalty to his own country 
               <br />
               which he expressed in his speech. I regret 
               <br />
               exceedingly that I have to refer to one matter 
               <br />
               which I dislike very much to refer to. I have to 
               <br />
               refer to my hon. friend from North Norfolk 
               <br />
               (Mr. Charlton), a gentleman who, I admit, stands 
               <br />
               high in this country, a man of great intellectual 
               <br />
               ability, a man who made a very strong and well 
               <br />
               reasoned speech from his point of view. It was 
               <br />
               not such an inﬂammatory speech as that made by 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) in introducing his Bill. That was a 
               <br />
               speech which was intended to set the people bv
