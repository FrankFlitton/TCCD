               timber, a race agitation, and take that agitation 
               <br />
               as a means to achieve success ; but I must say that 
               <br />
               if there is a glow for the ambition of a public man, 
               <br />
               it should not be a glow coming from the ﬁres of 
               <br />
               prejudice and passion which he himself has kindled. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman has taken charge of a measure 
               <br />
               which the people of the North-West would have 
               <br />
               conﬁded to any of the members representing them 
               <br />
               here if a real grievance had existed. Who has 
               <br />
               moved him to introduce this Bill? Has he done 
               <br />
               it of his own motion or had he a mandate for doing 
               <br />
               it ? He went up to the North-West on a mission, 
               <br />
               and he has accomplished it ; but I hope and believe 
               <br />
               that he will accomplish nothing by his measure. 
               <br />
               This question should have been settled quietly 
               <br />
               among the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> as a local ques- 
               <br />
               tion, to be determined between them and the Federal 
               <br />
               Government, from whom the legislative power of 
               <br />
               the territories emanates. But the promoters of this 
               <br />
               measure do not think of making it a local question. 
               <br />
               Leave the question to the people to settle, and you 
               <br />
               may be sure that probably in two years hence there 
               <br />
               will be nothing left of the little ﬁre which has been 
               <br />
               raised by the hon. member for North Simcoe. Has 
               <br />
               not the N orth—West disinterested members enough 
               <br />
               in this House to take charge of such a measure? Is 
               <br />
               it not an insult to them that a member from an 
               <br />
               eastern Province should take upon himself to put it 
               <br />
               forward and advocate it? It shall not pass here, 
               <br />
               because on every side of the House people are 
               <br />
               alarmed, if not disgusted, by the way in which 
               <br />
               it has been taken up and agitated. We might very 
               <br />
               well agree among ourselves to leave to the North~ 
               <br />
               West Legislature the settlement of this question. 
               <br />
               We would say to them : You have not been 
               <br />
               elected in the North—West to settle that question ; 
               <br />
               it relates to one of the organic articles of the con- 
               <br />
               stitution of those Territories, which only the 
               <br />
               Parliament of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Canada</span> has a right to change ; 
               <br />
               but we will be a paternal Parliament to you, and 
               <br />
               we will say to you, consult the people, and let the 
               <br />
               people of the. North-West say whether there is 
               <br />
               any use of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">your</span> speaking French when you sit 
               <br />
               around the table of the Legislature. The elections 
               <br />
               would come, and after those elections they may come 
               <br />
               back and say : If we are to have a useful repre- 
               <br />
               sentation in that assembly, if we are to have a pupu- 
               <br />
               lation in those Territories, who will live harmoni- 
               <br />
               ously with their neighbors. we must not repeat the 
               <br />
               mistake of hurting the feelings of those with Whom 
               <br />
               we are in partnership for the building up of this 
               <br />
               country. I say that to try to prevent those people 
               <br />
               publishing their laws in the language of the popu- 
               <br />
               ation, either in the French language or the English, 
               <br />
               would be an atrocity, a cruel measure, and a measure 
               <br />
               which would not induce immigrants or settlers to 
               <br />
               go into that country. There is one thing which I 
               <br />
               eel bound to say to correct a wrong impression, 
               <br />
               unjust to the hon. gentleman. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               from North Simcoe has been taken to task as being 
               <br />
               a Tory. I do not attach much importance to that 
               <br />
               little digression of my hon. friend, the leader of the 
               <br />
               Opposition. That is an eye—catching color which 
               <br />
               he puts in his political paintings when before an 
               <br />
               election audience; the “ Tory ” is always brought 
               <br />
               into the back ground so as to br’ out in greater 
               <br />
               contrast the great displa of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liberal</span> principles 
               <br />
               which it is the hon. gent eman’s wont to icture to 
               <br />
               his hearers. But in the subject under ' ussion 
               <br />
               there should be no question of party politics. The

               <br />
               of my hon. friend that brought it out. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend wished to give a political meaning to this 
               <br />

               <br />
               just to those who, on other occasions, have voted 
               <br />
               with the hon. member for North Simcoe, to say 
               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman himself had the courage 
               <br />
               —~and it is not courage he wants — to say that 
               <br />
               on this occasion he had separated himself entirely 
               <br />
               from the Conservative party. My hon. friend, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               leader of the Opposition, calls all the Conservatives 
               <br />
               Tories ; and I know that whatever denial we may 
               <br />
               give to the expressibn, he is bound to call us Tories. 
               <br />
               If he enjoys in calling us by that name, let him be 
               <br />
               happy. The hon. member for North Simcoe has in 
               <br />
               this question completely disassociated himself 
               <br />
               from his party ; he has declared that on this 
               <br />
               question he is not in harmony with his party, but 
               <br />
               he declared, and had a right to do so, that upon other 
               <br />
               questions he would follow those whom he had always 
               <br />
               followed, and would continue to vote as a conserva— 
               <br />
               tive on such matters as, for instance, the National 
               <br />
               Policy. It would not be right to close the Con- 
               <br />
               servative party against the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe and those who hold his views. This Bill 
               <br />
               which he has introduced has nothing to do with 
               <br />
               that party ; it is a Bill of his own, and I hope, be— 
               <br />
               fore the debate is over, he will see that it is greatly 
               <br />
               restricted in his following. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               West Durham argued that the Federal Government 
               <br />
               should keep, in a certain measure at least, aportion 
               <br />
               of the power over the Territories. True, we have 
               <br />
               granted to the Territories a constitution ; we have 
               <br />
               given them legislative power to some extent ; but 
               <br />
               as we still have the administration of the Territories 
               <br />
               in our hands and to protect those whom we are 
               <br />
               inviting to come and settle there, this Government 
               <br />
               should keep a certain control over these Territories. 
               <br />
               We are bound to do that, as we are bound to give to 
               <br />
               the French population a free and easy access to the 
               <br />
               judicial tribunals we have established there. I do 
               <br />
               not believe that there are many in this House dis- 
               <br />
               posed to say that they are at heart in favor of the 
               <br />
               measure proposed. Its preamble is a provocation and 
               <br />
               a just cause of irritation to a lar c section of our 
               <br />
               people, and the principle of the Bil and its practical 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect,</span> if carried into a conclusion, Would work in- 
               <br />
               justice and bad feeling in the old Provinces as well as 
               <br />
               in the N orth-West Territories. There are amen st

               alists. Many of them pose as the advocates of what 
               <br />
               they deem to be the grand and the loyal policy of 
               <br />
               Imperial Federation. Let me ask them how they 
               <br />
               expect to help on their cause by this unfair, un-

               seemly, this persecuting agitation. The British
