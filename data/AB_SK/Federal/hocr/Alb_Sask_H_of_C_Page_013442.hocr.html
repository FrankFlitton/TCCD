               one shows a cost of $55.75 per pupil. The

               school at Saskatchewan costs $46.76 per

               doubt that the average cost of the Roman

               about that, but I do not think that is a mat-

               which I have given the House, and that

               difference is enormously in favour of the

               public school system, and we can easily con- 
               <br />
               clude that if there were but one school

               <br />
