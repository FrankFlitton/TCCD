               not altogether to blame for the statement I made. 
               <br />
               Now, Sir, as to the new zeal that I am displaying 
               <br />
               in regard to the North-West. In admitting it is 
               <br />
               new, I hope it will be permanent, and I hope it 
               <br />
               will not be imprudent either, as the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man seems to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imagine.~</span> But I was astonished at 
               <br />
               the proposition that the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> 
               <br />
               were not able to govern themselves ; perhaps I 
               <br />
               had judged the North-\Vest too much by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elite</span> 
               <br />
               of the e’lite they had sent to this House, and not 
               <br />
               enough by what was left behind. When I visited 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lNorth-VVest,</span> from what I saw of the people up 
               <br />
               there, I am satisﬁed that this House would be 
               <br />
               making a very great mistake indeed if they do not 
               <br />
               realise that they are quite competent to manage 
               <br />
               their own affairs, and that we ought to give them 
               <br />
               the power to do it, instead of keeping them in 
               <br />
               leading strings, and dealing out authority piece by 
               <br />

               Mr. DAVIN. I do not condemn them for doing 
               <br />
               so; but let me point out my meaning by facts. 
               <br />
               What did one gentleman do ?——and he is not the 
               <br />
               least intelligent member of that Assembly, not the 
               <br />
               least energetic, not the man with the least ambi- 
               <br />
               tion. When he got his quotient of the sum 
               <br />
               divided by twenty-two, he had such difﬁculty in 
               <br />
               knowing how to spend that money that he took a 
               <br />
               legal opinion as to whether he could not spend it 
               <br />
               on sidewalks for his own town, and he spent it on 
               <br />
               sidewalks. Another gentleman, a member of that 
               <br />
               Assembly, told me frankly that as the roads and 
               <br />
               bridges had all been made in his district, he did not 
               <br />
               know what to do with the money. As the hon. 
               <br />
               member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'West</span> Durham (Mr. Blake) pointed out, 
               <br />
               when you have money administered by an Assembly 
               <br />
               like that, you will have it expended in one quarter 
               <br />
               where it is not needed, whereas the money of an- 
               <br />
               other man will be expended in another quarter 
               <br />
               where it is direly needed. As the hon. member 
               <br />
               pointed out, it would sometime be the proper way 
               <br />
               to govern the country, and best for the whole of 
               <br />
               it, that the great portion of the sum should be ex- 
               <br />
               pended in one district. Suppose in one district 
               <br />
               there is absolute need of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrstclass</span> bridge, 
               <br />
               the road of which would serve not merely that dis- 
               <br />
               trict, but half a dozen districts; is it not clear that 
               <br />
               the half a dozen districts would be better served if 
               <br />
               all the money that is given to the most of them, or 
               <br />
               the greater portion of that money, were to be spent 
               <br />
               in the one district where the work that related to 
               <br />
               the Whole of them belongs? Now, I was not 
               <br />
               ignorant of the fact that the hon. member for 
               <br />
               West Durham and his collea es have taken in the

               brief speeches on that subject ; I have listened to

               <br />
               gentleman is fond, that when I came forward in 
               <br />
               1887 and proposed a motion to give the North- 
               <br />

               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). 
               <br />
               At that time he was not enlightened, at that time 
               <br />
               his eyes were not open, at that time he was in the

               <br />
               ing our great western country; but now his eyes 
               <br />
               are open, and he thoroughly understands the

               well.

               Mr. WATSON. We are all gratiﬁed to listen 
               <br />
               to the hon. gentleman. He says the hon. member 
               <br />
               for \Vest Durham (Mr. Blake) is cream of tartar ; 
               <br />
               probably it is because he makes a ﬁzz when united 
               <br />
               with another mixture. The hon. member for West 
               <br />
               Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) is a kind of mixture, and it 
               <br />
               is very difﬁcult for the House to understand what 
               <br />
               he wants and what were the requirements of the 
               <br />
               North-VVest from the hon. gentleman’s speeches. 
               <br />
               He delivers himself on every occasion on any 
               <br />
               matter connected with the North-VVest that comes 
               <br />
               up for discussion. Only a short time ago, he told 
               <br />
               us that he had in 1887 and 1888, advocated a full 
               <br />
               measure of responsible government for the North- 
               <br />
               VVest, but that, after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goingl</span> home and visiting his 
               <br />
               constituents, he found out 6 had made a mistake, 
               <br />
               and he found only one man in his constituency in 
               <br />
               favor of such a step. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span>
