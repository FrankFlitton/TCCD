               you have given to the people of that country a 
               <br />
               representative Assembly, but that you should 
               <br />
               withhold from them executive responsibility. The 
               <br />
               hon. the First Minister has referred to the Lieute- 
               <br />
               nant Governor as a party who is responsible for 
               <br />
               the executive government in those Territories. 
               <br />
               Well, he is only responsible in the same way that 
               <br />
               the Governor appointed by the Imperial Ministry

               Street before responsible government was con- 
               <br />
               ceded. The Lieutenant Governor of the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories is responsible to the Adminis- 
               <br />
               tration here ; he is not responsible at all in the 
               <br />
               sense in which we understand the expression. It is 
               <br />
               an Administration, or an Executive, that is respon- 
               <br />
               sible to the representatives of the people Within 
               <br />
               the Territoriesfor the purposes for which that repre- 
               <br />
               sentative Assembly is constituted. Now, there has 
               <br />
               been a good deal of discussion in the House, not on 
               <br />
               this question but on another question' that pre- 
               <br />
               ceded it this Session, which shows that to some 
               <br />
               extent there is confusion in the minds, I think, of 
               <br />
               the members of this House, and also perhaps, in 
               <br />
               public estimation, with regard to the differences 
               <br />
               that exist between a Territorial Government and a 
               <br />
               Provincial Government. We recognise this differ- 
               <br />
               ence in every Bill that we introduce to this House, 
               <br />
               and we have recognised it in the measure that is 
               <br />
               now before us. But whether we give to the Terri— 
               <br />
               torial Legislature large power, or whether we give 
               <br />
               to it little power, whatever power is conferred 
               <br />
               upon it should be exercised, it seems to me, under 
               <br />
               the control of a responsible Administration. I do 
               <br />
               not see how it is possible that you can have any- 
               <br />
               thing like permanency in public policy in regard to 
               <br />
               measures which may be brought before that Legis— 
               <br />
               lature for consideration, unless you have an Admi- 
               <br />
               nistration controlling the legislation and respon- 
               <br />
               sible for its due execution. You may have measures 
               <br />
               carried through the Territorial Legislature to-day, 
               <br />
               which will be repealed next Session, because there 
               <br />
               is no Administration existing which will, in any 
               <br />
               proper sense, be responsible for the conduct of 
               <br />
               public affairs. N ow, I admit that in a new country 
               <br />
               people must be content with narrower powers than 
               <br />
               we have in an older country, which is more densely 
               <br />
               settled,- where the population has grown more 
               <br />
               wealthy, where their wants are more varied. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> 
               <br />
               recognise this difference in the growth of Provincial 
               <br />
               establishments under responsible governments. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“7e</span> are not content to-day with the amount of 
               <br />
               power that was possessed by the old Legislature of 
               <br />
               the Provinces aft-er responsible government was 
               <br />
               ﬁrst introduced. Our population has become more 
               <br />
               dense, their interests have become more varied, 
               <br />
               they have external as well as domestic relations, 
               <br />
               and so they require and ask for a voice in con- 
               <br />
               trolling their external as well as their domestic 
               <br />
               affairs. This may make a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between the 
               <br />
               extent of power which we confer upon a Local 
               <br />
               Legislature under a territorial system, and upon a 
               <br />
               Local Legislature that is constituted under a Provin— 
               <br />
               cial organisation. But all these matters are matters 
               <br />
               that require very careful consideration. I was 
               <br />
               astonished at the change of sentiment indicated by 
               <br />
               the speech of the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               here to-day, in discussing the subject of the dual 
               <br />
               language. The hon. gentleman expressed sentiments 
               <br />
               to-day with which I, in a great measure, cordially 
               <br />
               agree ; they were those which I enunciated in dis- 
               <br />
               cussing this Bill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">atan</span> earlier period of the Session.

               The hon. gentleman has had new light, and I am 
               <br />
               glad to see that the views <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whicthe</span> expressed to— 
               <br />
               day are more nearly in consonance with those 
               <br />
               entertained by the majority of this House. Now, 
               <br />
               I am sure that some of the parties outside of the 
               <br />
               House will be disappointed. Let me tell the hon, 
               <br />
               gentleman this : A Frenchman and a countryman 
               <br />
               of his, in this city, were discussing this question of 
               <br />
               the dual language yesterday, and his countryman 
               <br />
               said to his French friend : “ Ah, ye may use your 
               <br />
               French lingo to-day, but wait till the Great 
               <br />
               McCarthy has done wid ye, and ye will only be 
               <br />
               able to make signs then.” I am sure if the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman’s countryman had heard his speech here 
               <br />
               to-day, he would be satisﬁed that the Frenchman, 
               <br />
               after all, might be able to do something more than 
               <br />
               make signs after the hon. gentleman had done with 
               <br />
               him. The hon. gentleman has recognised to-day 
               <br />
               theprinciple that language used for public purposes, 
               <br />
               like language used for private purposes, is a 
               <br />
               matter of convenience. The hon. gentleman said 
               <br />
               that we ought not to force two languages upon a 
               <br />
               population. Well, I do not think we are doing 
               <br />
               that. I was opposed to that in the ﬁrst instance, 
               <br />
               but I never supposed for one moment that if 
               <br />
               the members of the Council were Frenchmen and 
               <br />
               could not speak English, they would be debarred 
               <br />
               from speaking French. That was their privilege. 
               <br />
               When that Council was ﬁrst created the Crown 
               <br />
               appointed to the Council, upon our advice, a 
               <br />
               half-breed who could not speak a word of English, 
               <br />
               and we appointed him because he was a man of 
               <br />
               immense inﬂuence over the hall-breed population 
               <br />
               and one in whom they had the utmost conﬁdence ; 
               <br />
               and I am perfectly sure that we carried on the 
               <br />
               government of that country during the remaining 
               <br />
               period of our administration, with very much 
               <br />
               smaller police force to maintain peace in that 
               <br />
               country, than if we had appointed a member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.to</span> 
               <br />
               the Council in whom the people of the Territorles 
               <br />
               had not the utmost conﬁdence. I observe that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has by this Bill, in section 3, 
               <br />
               provided that the “ territories formerly known <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.as</span> 
               <br />
               Rupert’s Land and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorterVest</span> Territories 
               <br />
               shall be ” so and so. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vell,</span> the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               will see, frOm looking at any old work on the sub- 
               <br />
               ject of Hudson’s Bay, or any old map representing 
               <br />
               that territory, that Rupert’s Land embraced the 
               <br />
               territory east of Hudson’s Bay as well as the 
               <br />
               territories on the west, and that the designatlon 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories applied rather to the 
               <br />
               territories extending eastward from the Bay, and 
               <br />
               that Rupert’s Land was, on most old maps, marked 
               <br />
               as the territory laying on the east and south-east 
               <br />
               of that Bay. The hon. gentleman will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remember</span> 
               <br />
               that the territory is not embraced in any Provmce 
               <br />
               at the present time; it is not embraced in the 
               <br />
               Territory of Keewatin, and so there ought to be 
               <br />
               some phraseology used to show what precise terri- 
               <br />
               tories are intended to be embraced under the 
               <br />
               provisions of this Bill. I notice there are some 
               <br />
               provisions providing for the appointment of 
               <br />
