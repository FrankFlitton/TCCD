               I, at all events, was not seeking to force myself upon 
               <br />
               the public, but my attendance was demanded by the 
               <br />
               great city of .Montreal and by the city of Ottawa, 
               <br />
               and it was only in answer to repeated calls that I 
               <br />
               went to those different cities. So much with 
               <br />
               respect to what has been said in regard to this 
               <br />
               agitation. If hon. gentlemen will deal with the 
               <br />
               matter fairly, they will see that there was no other 
               <br />
               course open to me, feeling as I feel, and realising 
               <br />
               my responsibility as a member of this House, but 
               <br />
               to take the action I have pursued. But exception 
               <br />
               has been taken to some of my language. I had the 
               <br />
               misfortune to miss the speech of the hon. leader 
               <br />
               of the Opposition, and I have not yet had time, 
               <br />
               having only received H <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">award</span> this evening, to 
               <br />
               peruse his speech throughout; but I am told the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman assailed my speech on the ground 
               <br />
               that I had used harsh expressions with regard 
               <br />
               to his nationality. If the hon. gentleman under- 
               <br />
               stood my remarks were with respect to his 
               <br />
               nationality and his race, then I do not wonder 
               <br />
               at the hon. gentleman’s indignation. If the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman supposes that I was capable of speak— 
               <br />
               ing of any people of this Dominion, or any sec- 
               <br />
               tion of the people of this Dominion in these 
               <br />
               terms, he was perfectly within his duty in calling 
               <br />
               attention to the language and denouncing it in the 
               <br />
               most vigorous terms. But that wa‘s not the mean- 
               <br />
               ing of my words, and I think my hon. friend, a 
               <br />
               master as he is of our own tongue, perfectly well 
               <br />
               realised that was not the meaning. I spoke of the 
               <br />
               national cry and the national party that he among 
               <br />
               others has been establishing and fomenting in one 
               <br />
               of the Provinces of this Dominion, and I denounced 
               <br />
               that nationality, or rather that pretending nation- 
               <br />
               ality as a bastard nationality. I again denounce 
               <br />
               it here on the ﬂoor of Parliament as such. I say 
               <br />
               that the legitimate nationality, and there is but 
               <br />
               one, is the nationality common to us all, the 
               <br />
               nationality that spreads from ocean to ocean and 
               <br />
               embraces all races and peoples within this great 
               <br />
               Dominion. I say that if any one in any portion or 
               <br />
               corner of this Dominion gathers a party together, 
               <br />
               whether English, Irish, Scotch or French, and en- 
               <br />
               deavors to rise a cry on the nationality of that 
               <br />
               particular race, there is no word that describes it 
               <br />
               other than the word that I used, and to which the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman called attention. Although the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman thought I dare not, I have no 
               <br />
               hesitation of repeating that statement on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this House, and there is no hon. member under- 
               <br />
               standing the sense in which I stated it before, and 
               <br />
               in which I repeat it now, who can deny that the 
               <br />
               expression used was applicable.

               on its merits, not to deal with this question, as it 
               <br />
               ought to be dealt with, as to wether it should or 
               <br />
               not become law, but by abusing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plaintiff’s</span> attor- 
               <br />
               ney—the unfortunate promoter of the Bill—and by 
               <br />
               raising clouds of race prejudices and religious 
               <br />
               prejudices as well, to have this Bill rejectedbecause 
               <br />
               of matters which ought not to have been mentioned 
               <br />
               in connection with it. What is the proposition we 
               <br />
               are dealing with here? It is a simple one. It is 
               <br />
               said that it is the entering of the thin end of 
               <br />
               the wedge ; it is said that I have commenced a 
               <br />
               crusade, and that this is the ﬁrst thing I have 
               <br />
               attempted and that my success in this will mean 
               <br />
               success later on in other matters. Even if that were 
               <br />
               so, and if the continuance of the present condition 
               <br />
               of things is an injury to the people of the North- 
               <br />
               West—if this is calculated to do that great portion 
               <br />
               of our Dominion an injustice, are the people of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Vest</span> to suffer under this grievance because 
               <br />
               of the unfortunate language—if it be unfortunate— 
               <br />
               because of the unfortunate terms—if they be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unfortunate—4n</span> which the Bill was presented to 
               <br />
               the House of Commons. I do not think the prac- 
               <br />
               tical people of this country will accept any such 
               <br />
               excuse. I will just add as a rider to the advice of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for South Oxford (Sir Richard Cart- 
               <br />
               wright): “ Do not I beseech you hon. members who 
               <br />
               sit behind him allow yourselves to be carried away 
               <br />
               with such ill advice as that.” This Bill and this 
               <br />
               only must be dealt with on its merits. It is not 
               <br />
               for the speech of the member who introduced it 
               <br />
               you are going to vote, it is not for his speech in 
               <br />
               the Opera House at Ottawa you are going to vote, 
               <br />
               but you must vote “ yea ” or “ nay ” upon the Bill 
               <br />
               itself which is now before you. If that Bill is one 
               <br />
               which in the interests of our common country should 
               <br />
               be passed, I do not think that excuses such as are 
               <br />
               presented here will save hon. gentlemen from the 
               <br />
               just indignation of their constituents. Again, 
               <br />
               there has been a very great misrepresentation of 
               <br />
               what I stated in my speech. My argument upon 
               <br />
               the question of language is to be found in these 
               <br />
