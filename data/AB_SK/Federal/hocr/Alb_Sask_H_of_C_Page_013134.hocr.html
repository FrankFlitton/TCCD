               <br />
               great cry on the part of the French in the North- 
               <br />
               VVest for a dual language. If it is a good thing for 
               <br />
               the French race to have the French language used in 
               <br />
               the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth-X‘Vest</span> Territories, it must also be a good 
               <br />
               thing for the German race that their language be 
               <br />
               spoken there also, because they are growing and 
               <br />
               increasing very rapidly. On my return I came 
               <br />
               back by the Northern Paciﬁc road, and I am glad to 
               <br />
               say that our road is in every respect superior to it, 
               <br />
               and is indeed a most magniﬁcent road, and it passes 
               <br />
               through a far better country in every respect. In 
               <br />
               fact the whole of the Northern Paciﬁc country seems 
               <br />
               to be altogether barren, except on the Paciﬁc slope, 
               <br />
               where there is some good land. I could see that 
               <br />
               the land was all occupied ;' I could see that our 
               <br />
               neighbors have settled pretty nearly all that 
               <br />
               country except, perhaps, a small portion on the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc slope. They have occupied all the mountain 
               <br />
               lands for pasture, they have occupied all the valleys 
               <br />
               good for tillage. As you will remember, not very 
               <br />
               long ago when the Oklahoma district was opened for 
               <br />
               settlement, it was surrounded on all sides by people 
               <br />
               who rushed in so as to be able to get land. That is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conclusive</span> proof, to my mind, that our neighbors to 
               <br />
               the south have pretty well overrun all the land 
               <br />
               they have, and I think that they are not likely to 
               <br />
               have any new territory to throw open unless 
               <br />
               they seize more Indian reserves and open them for 
               <br />
               settlement. That being the case I have every 
               <br />
               ground for saying that there will be a very 
               <br />
               large immigration into our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> 
               <br />
               Territoreis within the next few years. We have 
               <br />
               there a great lone land, a land, I suppose, as big 
               <br />
               as Europe, without any inhabitants to speak of. 
               <br />
               There are very few or no inhabitants in a vast 
               <br />
               extent of territory which will be opened for future 
               <br />
               settlement. When we think of the large immigra~ 
               <br />
               tion that is increasing every year, when we know 
               <br />
               that immigration has been pouriﬁg into the United 
               <br />
               States for years, when we know that that country is 
               <br />
               already about ﬁlled up, we must become convinced 
               <br />
               that the tide of population is sure to turn towards 
               <br />
               our own Territories. Now, is this House to say 
               <br />
               that we are going to allow these foreign settlers 
               <br />
               who come in there, to say What language they shall 
               <br />
               speak? I hope not. I think that we should let all 
               <br />
               these foreigners who reach our shores under— 
               <br />
               stand that when they set their foot in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Territories they have got to become 
               <br />
               Canadians and speak the language of this conti~ 
               <br />
               nent. It has been said that Switzerland is a parallel 
               <br />
               case to this Canada of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ours,</span> Now, mark you, I am 
               <br />
               not referring to Quebec, it is out of the question to 
               <br />
               speak about Quebec ; I have devoted myself entirely 
               <br />
               to the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth-‘West</span> Territories and it has been 
               <br />
               suggested that Switzerland is a parallel case. 
               <br />
               It is not a parallel case for this reason : In Switzer- 
               <br />
               land they had a dual language from the very 
               <br />
               beginning, whereas we have a great lone land empty 
               <br />
               now and waiting for settlement. As you know, 
               <br />
               Switzerland was peopled from the south by 
               <br />
               Italians, from the east by French, from the north 
               <br />
               by Germans. They were livin in secluded valleys 
               <br />
               where they were left undistur d for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3.</span> Ion time, 
               <br />
               and when they found they were attacke by a 
               <br />
               foreign enemy they combined for common defence. 
               <br />
               When I read the history of Switzerland for the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst time, I was surprised to learn what great 
               <br />
               dissensions they have had in that country during 
               <br />
               several generations, and it has only been when

               majorities of other Provinces and to the Protestant min-

               <br />
               To be frank, I must say that I intended and I do intend 
               <br />
               to—day to state that equal rights must apply to the min- 
               <br />
               orities in every Province, and if theFederal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> is to be 
               <br />
               applied in some other Province against the rights of the 
               <br />
               minorities and to the abolition of their Separate schools 
               <br />
               where they exist by law, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">donotsee</span> why the same rule 
               <br />
               should not appl to the minority <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> of the Proyince of 
               <br />
               Quebec. I state that the minorities had no rights be' 
               <br />
               cause they were French or English, Catholic or Protes- 
               <br />
               tant, but that they had rights because they were the min— 
               <br />
               orities entitled to be protected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">copy</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> same 
               <br />
               rights as the majorities. This being the principle I do 
               <br />
               not see Why the minority of the Provmce of Quebec should 
               <br />
               have more rights than the minorities 1D the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other</span> Provm-

               <br />
               that if the Catholics or the French of the other Provmces 
               <br />
               are not treated as they ought to be, I do not see why the

               Protestants and English in the Provmce of Quebec should 
               <br />

               will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁcient</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prevent</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majorities</span> of otherPrO'
