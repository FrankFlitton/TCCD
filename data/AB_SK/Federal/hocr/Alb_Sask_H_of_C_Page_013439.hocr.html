               power which is conferred by the British 
               <br />
               North America Act is “ taxation within the

               ferred upon the Legislative Assembly of

               <br />

               had occasion to say with respect to amend-

               reasonably and very properly withheld.

               no longer to remain in force in the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. It is compulsory as to separate 
               <br />
               schools. It enacts that there shall be separate 
               <br />
               schools. Substantially, its provision is that 
               <br />
               whatever the majority may be in any local- 
               <br />
               ity, it may establish a school known as a 
               <br />
               public school, and the minority in that 
               <br />
               locality may establish a separate school. 
               <br />
               So that there may be in every locality where 
               <br />
               there are Protestants and Catholics the two 
               <br />
               school systems. The majority have the right 
               <br />
               to call theirs a public school. the minority 
               <br />
               have the right to establish what is called a 
               <br />
               separate school, and it becomes a separate 
               <br />
               school in that locality. although it may not
