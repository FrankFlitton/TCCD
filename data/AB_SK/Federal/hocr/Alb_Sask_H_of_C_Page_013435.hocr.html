               pass the resolution submitted, or continue

               change in the law in order that the senior

               judge should be acting chief justice. and 
               <br />

               <br />
               true that the law as originally passed by

               in the city of Montreal when the chief justice 
               <br />

               <br />
               and it did not suit him to travel on the

               highway that had been travelled by the 
               <br />
               previous Legislature, and it was Mr. Mercier, 
               <br />

               friends. thought it was not best that the 
               <br />
               senior judge should exercise the functions 
               <br />
               of acting chief justice, and it was he who 
               <br />
               introduced and carried through the Legis-

               law is to give the Legislative Assembly

               have not that power.
