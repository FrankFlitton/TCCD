               not let us exaggerate, I have no desire at all to ex-

               aggerate the importance of this question of 
               <br />
               language. I admit as freely as it can be admitted 
               <br />
               that there are cases—and the case of Switzerland 
               <br />
               is one—Where, under peculiar circumstances, people 
               <br />
               speaking different languages, those languages 
               <br />
               being ofﬁcially there three instead of two, have 
               <br />
               enjoyed a certain amount of prosperity, or 
               <br />
               very great prosperity if you like. But do hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen see any analogy between Switzer- 
               <br />
               land and Canada? The cantons of Switzer— 
               <br />
               land <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">came'together</span> as independent bodies under 
               <br />
               bargains and terms and conditions to which every- 
               <br />
               one of them had to agree, and that possesses nothing 
               <br />
               of an analogy to the case of our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-V’Vest.</span> 
               <br />
               But, if we look at the history of the Swiss Con- 
               <br />
               federation, what do we ﬁnd? I hardly expected 
               <br />
               from the historian of the House, the hon. member 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vest</span> Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), that so much stress 
               <br />
               would be laid upon the case of Switzerland. Let 
               <br />
               us look at this case of Switzerland for a few mo- 
               <br />
               ments, while I give a short statement of its history. 
               <br />
               It is quite true that Switzerland is composed of ‘22 
               <br />
               cantons, it is quite true that there are three ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               languages there, it is equally true that there is a 
               <br />
               fourth language which is not recognised. But the 
               <br />
               history of the Swiss constitution may brieﬂy be 
               <br />
               summarised thus : Between 1291 and 1874, the 
               <br />
               confederation has passed through no less than seven 
               <br />
               phases, of which, since 1798, there have been four 
               <br />
               —one in 1798, one in 1803, another in 1815, another 
               <br />
               1848, and a revision in 1874. Is that the evidence 
               <br />
               of a stable constitution? Is that the kind of con- 
               <br />
               stitution that the hon. member would like to have 
               <br />
               fastened upon the people of his beloved North-

               I do not think that any of us would like to plant 
               <br />
               in the virgin soil of the North-West, a constitution

               <br />
               formed an independent republic on its borders? 
               <br />
               Have not, within recent times, the British arms 
               <br />
               suffered a defeat at their hands, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> is

               there not very great trouble between the Dutch

               who remain in the English colony? Certainly, it 
               <br />
               is the last example I wOuld expect to be given by 
               <br />

               forbear quoting to the House the striking example

               the Diet is informally divided into two Curiae, one 
               <br />
               German and the other Zech, which sit and debate 
               <br />
               together, although each possesses the full power of 
               <br />
               a separate and co-ordinate House. That is the only 
               <br />
               solution for a duality of language which could be 
               <br />
               found in Bohemia, and it was found necessary to 
               <br />
               resort to that in order to prevent these people 
               <br />
               from ﬂying at one another’s throats, it was found 
               <br />
               necessary to resort to that to prevent the Germans 
               <br />
               from deserting to Bismark. Now, what is the 
               <br />
               position here ?——because, it is useless for us to go 
               <br />
               further than our own country. If this language is 
               <br />
               not designedly perpetuated with the view of keep-

               <br />
               leader of the Opposition has been the only French

               <br />
