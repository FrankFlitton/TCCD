               Mr. AMYOT. Owing to the fact that this

               <br />
               sists in saying that the treaties never insured to the 
               <br />
               French Canadians, or to those speaking the French 
               <br />
               language in this country, the use of that language. 
               <br />
               He has repeatedly said that the language is the 
               <br />
               essence of a people’s existence, so it must be the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst privilege of a people. I will call the attention

               <br />
               You must not lose sight of the events of that time. 
               <br />
               There had been a ﬁght ; both armies had behaved 
               <br />
               most gloriously ; we had about 12,000 men against 
               <br />
               60,000 on the other side, and sometimes the fortune 
               <br />
               was for us and sometimes against us. The last 
               <br />
               battle, which was fought on the ﬁeld of St. Foye, 
               <br />
               was in favor of our arms. But then the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor de Vaudreuil, one of the most miserable crea- 
               <br />
               tures that ever came to this country, gave us up. 
               <br />
               After that our troops went to Montreal ; our brave 
               <br />
               generals were discouraged at seeing such cowardice 
               <br />
               and such treason on the part of the Governor. But 
               <br />
               the Governor went up to Montreal and there 
               <br />
               again capitulated. Then our troops went back 
               <br />
               to France, and afterwards there was signed in 
               <br />
               France, a treaty between England, France and 
               <br />
               Portugal, which was a treaty of peace. The 
               <br />
               diﬁ'erent countries that had been the subject of 
               <br />
               dispute were divided between these kingdoms, 
               <br />
               and it was a cession of peace and nothing else. 
               <br />
               That is the reason why, the other day, when the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman spoke of the conquest, I said it 
               <br />
               was a cession, and not a conquest. I will now 
               <br />
               draw the special attention of the hon. member to 
               <br />
               chapter 18 of 14 George III, 1774, which is “An 
               <br />
               Act to make more eﬁ'ectual provisions for the Gov- 
               <br />

               <br />
