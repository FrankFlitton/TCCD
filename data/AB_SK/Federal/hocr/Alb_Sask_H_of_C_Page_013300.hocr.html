               <br />
               I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that the Bill of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe is going to meet 
               <br />
               with the same fate as the proposition made by this 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\VllltWOl‘tll</span> in the House of Commons of Eng— 
               <br />
               land. It was in 1774, that this destroyer of French 
               <br />
               made his speech in the English House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons. In the speech delivered by the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mem-</span> 
               <br />
               her for North Simcoe, when introducing the meas- 
               <br />
               ure now under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration,</span> he quoted a portion 
               <br />
               of Lord Durham's report on the affairs of Canada ; 
               <br />
               he has only quoted that portion which applied to 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. He spoke of the troubles and 
               <br />
               difﬁculties which existed in Quebec in 1837 and in 
               <br />
               1838. \Ve know that at this period the people of 
               <br />
               the Province fought in order to obtain those liber- 
               <br />
               ties of which we are so proud to-day. Several of 
               <br />
               them ascended the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scaffold</span> ; others were exiled, 
               <br />
               and the constitutional liberties acquired with the 
               <br />
               price of the blood of our ancestors, are to-day 
               <br />
               shared in by the English who live in Canada. 
               <br />
               After listening to the speech of the hon. member, 
               <br />
               one would be led to believe that difﬁculties existed 
               <br />
               only in Lower Canada. Nevertheless, We ﬁnd in 
               <br />
               Lord Durham’s report that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> existed also 
               <br />
               in Upper Canada. This is what he says :

               <br />
               other side of the question, because a man possessmg

               the settlement of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> respecting the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Jesuit</span> 
               <br />
               Estates, to excite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prejudices</span> against the majority in this

               Provmce, by accusing them of being unjust towards the 
               <br />
               Protestant minority; and it is alleged very falsely that 
               <br />
               this minority was ill-treated, and that it had not the 
               <br />
               complete exercise of its rights. The rights of a minority 
               <br />
               may be looked upon from four pomts of View: 1. From 
               <br />
               the religious point of view; 2. From the civil point of 
               <br />
               View; 3._Fr0m the educational pornt of view; 4. From 
               <br />
               the political point of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">view:</span> Sure y it will not be alleged 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestant</span> minority does not exercise, and does 
               <br />
               not claim with success, _all its rights in our Province, 
               <br />
               from the religious, political, and civil points of view, 
               <br />
               Nobody Wlll dare to say that Roman Catholics prevent 
               <br />
               Protestants from practising their religion in as free a 
               <br />
               manner as they practise it themselves. There are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pro«</span> 
               <br />
               testant churches everywhere, even in centres which I 
               <br />
               might call excluSively Roman Catholic; and we have it 
               <br />
               vet to learn of the smallest insult having been offered to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestant</span> congregations, when they judge ﬁt to assemble 
               <br />
               together. As to political and civil righ ts,they are recorded 
               <br />
               in ourcodes and our constitutiOn; and it has never entered 
               <br />
               the mind of anyone to say that the Protestants had any 
               <br />
               reason .to complain, in this res cat. As to the rights 
               <br />
               respectingeducation, it is but rig t to state exactly what 
               <br />
               they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are,</span> in order <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.to</span> make to disappear any ambiguity 
               <br />
               which might <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exist</span> in this respect. But, before doing this, 
               <br />
               let us state plainlythat the law declares the two languages 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”French</span> and English—to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">official:</span> that in practice all 
               <br />
               our public documents are printed in these two Ian- 
               <br />
               guages: that in the Legislature both are spoken- and 
               <br />
               very often we French Canadians answer in English the 
               <br />
               speeches made in English by our colleagues of another 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">origin;</span> and that we Lake special pains to render to them, 
               <br />
               in this connection, all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posmblenssistance,</span> in order to 
               <br />
               remove any pretext for complaint. The same thing is 
               <br />
               done in our courts of justice, where, very often, French 
               <br />
               Canadian advocates plead in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">English,</span> out of courtesy to 
               <br />
               their brethren of foreign origin; and, although we are not 
               <br />
               bound to do so, each time when in our public departments 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> have to write to a person speaking the English language,

               <br />
               which I believe has no exception, or at least if there are 
               <br />
               exce tions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theyare</span> so rare that it would not be reasonable 
               <br />
               to ta c any notice of them. _
