               <br />
               I need say on this question now. I think I am

               making a reasonable request ; I am making a re- 
               <br />
               quest which I am very certain will be supported

               <br />
               members from the Province of Ontario. I think 
               <br />
               that a similar expression of opinion would be 
               <br />
               given also by the electors in many other portions 
               <br />
               of the Dominion. The subject, of course, is one 
               <br />
               that is comparatively new, for all our dealings 
               <br />
               with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'l'erritories</span> have been 
               <br />
               so far tentative, and experimental rather than

               absolute. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\\’e</span> are now, however, going a step fur- 
               <br />
               ther. We are now giving to this Assembly powers 
               <br />
               which it has not hitherto possessed : and there is 
               <br />
               one thing which may be taken for. granted, that 
               <br />
               with the acquisition of the new powers given under 
               <br />
               this Act the people of these territories will enquire 
               <br />
               why they should be restricted in this great and im- 
               <br />
               portant particular. It is because I think such is 
               <br />
               the case, and because I do not wish on a future 
               <br />
               occasion, when this subject comes again before the 
               <br />
               House for further legislation, that those who think 
               <br />
               as Ido on this system of education should be met- 
               <br />
               with the objection that so many years ago this 
               <br />
               system was established by law and that, therefore, 
               <br />
               a vested right iscreat-ed which the Legislature should 
               <br />
               not now interfere with. \Yhy, Sir, it would be 
               <br />
               almost fair to argue that this would come within 
               <br />
               the provisions of the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> America Act. 
               <br />
               If not in reality it would by analogy, because 
               <br />
               the British North America Act secured to the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces which came into Confederation whatever 
               <br />
               rights were enjoyed by the supporters of separate 
               <br />
               schools at the time of Confederation, and if we 
               <br />
               create new provinces out of these territories it may 
               <br />
               fairly be argued that the analogy of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act will apply. and that in creating 
               <br />
               new provinces and bringing them into Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion there will be something like the same rights 
               <br />
               guaranteed to the supporters of separate schools 
               <br />
               which were guaranteed to the provinces having 
               <br />
               sepa 'ate schools before coming in under the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. Sir, under all these circum- 
               <br />
               stances, I think I am taking a reasonable course in 
               <br />
               calling the attention of the Government to this 
               <br />
               matter, and in telling them that unless they are 
               <br />
               prepared either to remove this restriction now 
               <br />
               when the Bill is before the House, or unless before 
               <br />
               next session they will make up their minds to re- 
               <br />
               move it, the subject will again be brorwht up, and 
               <br />
               brought up with perhaps not, as I 
               <br />
               the studied moderation with which I have-brought 
               <br />
               it forward on this occasion. I can tell the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment that the whole subject of separate Schools 
               <br />
               will come up, and possibly a demand will be made 
               <br />
               in this House and supported by public opinion in 
               <br />
               this country which will go a great deal further 
               <br />
               than the moderate proposal I now submit. Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, I am not going to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> any opposition to 
               <br />
               the second reading of the Bill. I am not going, as I 
               <br />
               said, to bring forward myself a resolution on this 
               <br />
               subject when the Bill is in Committee ; but I hope 
               <br />
               the Government will take the course I sug rested, 
               <br />
               and if they do not take it, then they must e pre-

               perhaps carve out one or two provinces. I think. 
               <br />
               as the territories exist just now, it would be a

               the same time that there isa very strong hope amongst 
               <br />
               the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North~\\'est</span> Territories that the

               nothing very detrimental to religion in learning

               reading, and writing, and arithmetic. and other 
               <br />
               teachings such as that, in the common schools of the

               country. But they recognize that. as long as there 
               <br />
               is a strong prejudice on the part of a large section 
               <br />
               of the people throughout the country, arising simply 
               <br />
