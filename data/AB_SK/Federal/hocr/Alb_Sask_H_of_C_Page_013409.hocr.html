               Mr. SCRIVER. Mr. Speaker, I desire to say

               first, Sir, that you were in error in naming me as 
               <br />
               the seconder of the motion now before the House. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> I did not consent to second the motion, but I did 
               <br />
               not dissent from your connecting my name with it 
               <br />
               because of my desire to be courteous to my neighbour, 
               <br />
               the hon. member for South Middlesex (Mr. Artn~ 
               <br />
               strong). I am not in favour of this motion in all 
               <br />
               its details. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">So</span> far as the part relating to the dual 
               <br />
               language is concerned it expresses my views ; views 
               <br />
               which I took the liberty of giving to the House 
               <br />
               when the motion relating to that question was before 
               <br />
               us at a previous session of this House. I then 
               <br />
               expressed my sympathy with the motion of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), which 
               <br />
               was tothe effect that the question of languages 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> should be left. to the decision of the people of the 
               <br />
               Territories ; , but so far as the question of separate 
               <br />
               schools is concerned I take a somewhat different 
               <br />
               view. Allusion has been made by several hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen to the position held by the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority in the Province of Quebec in relation to 
               <br />
               their school system. I am one of that Protestant 
               <br />
               minority, and I am here to express my concurrence 
               <br />
               in the statement already made, that the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority in that province has been treated since 
               <br />
               Confederation, with perfect fairness and with full 
               <br />
               liberality <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by.</span> the Roman Catholic majority. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> ,Protestantsof that province could not live there were 
               <br />
               they not accorded theprivileges in regard to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eduo</span> 
               <br />
               cation of theirchildren which they nowenjoy. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hold;</span> 
               <br />
               ing the views which Roman Catholics do conscienti- 
               <br />
               ously hold, and they being largely in the majority, 
               <br />
               if we had a common school system there, and but 
               <br />
               one school where all religious tenets would be 
               <br />
               taught, the Protestants would not and could not 
               <br />
               possibly accept it. This being the case, and it 
               <br />
               being the fact that we have been, as I have said, 
               <br />
               treated with perfect fairness and perfect liberality 
               <br />
               in the Province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> of Quebec, I do not see how 
               <br />
               Protestants, taking a proper view of this question, 
               <br />
               can fail to consent to extend to their Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic fellow-citizens the same privileges which 
               <br />
               they enjoy themselves. I cannot give my support 
               <br />
               to ‘a propositionwhich would deprive the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic population of the North-\Vest from the 
               <br />
               enjoyment of theprivileges which the Protestants 
               <br />
               of the Province of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Quelmc</span> have enjoyed and do 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> enjoy, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘I</span> believe will continue to enjoy in the 
               <br />
               future. I canno: consent to give my support to a 
               <br />
               motion which at sometime or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other—if</span> it would 
               <br />
               not have that inunediate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect—would</span> compel the 
               <br />
               Roman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> Catholics of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorthJVest</span> to either 
               <br />
               allow their children to grow up in i norance, or to 
               <br />
               send them to schools which it wOuh be a violation

               <br />
               Therefore, I am opposed to a. portion of the motion 
               <br />
               of my hon. friehd from South Middlesex, and I am 
               <br />

               which I called a compromising amendment, and 
               <br />
               against which I voted, and the Bill was not reached 
               <br />
               to vote on. I said then, as I say now, that this is a 
               <br />
               question which the Parliament of Canada must 
               <br />

               the face, and decide now what is best to be done. 
               <br />
               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-West</span> Territories will soon be a province. 
               <br />
               They have now very largely the powers of a pro-

               <br />
               one there for the purpose of working out their 
               <br />
               uture destiny, and making the very best they can

               of the circumstances in which they are placed ; 
               <br />
               and I think we would be derelict in our duty if we 
               <br />
               did not give them control over their own affairs, 
               <br />
               and say to them : You can have separate schools if 
               <br />
               you please, or a national school system if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> 
               <br />
               please, and you can have both languages if you

               is a question which this Parliament must face; 
               <br />
               and I cannot, for the life of me, understand how 
               <br />
               those who have been for years talking of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights, and declaring that the provinces 
               <br />
               should have full and complete control over'matters 
               <br />
               of a local character, can vote against giving the 
               <br />
               people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W</span> est power to say what 
               <br />
               form of language or what kind of schools they 
               <br />
               will have. If their future is to be in their own 
               <br />
               hands, they must have power to work out that 
               <br />
               future ; but if "we place burdens upon them. I 
               <br />
               think there will be in the future a great deal more 
               <br />
               trouble excited by these questions than there is at 
               <br />
               the present time. Therefore the sooner we put. the 
               <br />
               question right the better. At present the country 
               <br />
               is new, there are not a rreat- many people there, 
               <br />
               and the majOrity will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disposed</span> to be fair to the 
               <br />
               minority. They might consider it in their interest 
               <br />
               to continue the present condition of affairs ; but if 
               <br />
               the majority should decide against separate schools 
               <br />
               or the dual languages, then the res )onsibility will 
               <br />
               rest- upon that majority, and will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">)e</span> taken from 
               <br />
               our shoulders ; and these sectarian questions, which 
               <br />
               cause <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so,“</span> much irritation and unpleasant feeling, 
               <br />
               will be removed from this Parliament. I am 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that the Roman Catholics in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-</span> 
               <br />
               West will have nothing to complain of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">j</span> if we 
               <br />
               take this course, for I believe that the majority 
               <br />
               there will be just as favourable to giving them their 
               <br />
               rights as the majority in‘this Parliament. That is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">g</span> 
               <br />
               the reason which leads me to favour the amendment 
               <br />
               which has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">turned:</span> and while I support that 
               <br />
               amendment, I say to the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NortholVest-</span> : 
               <br />
               This is a question entirely of a local character which 
               <br />
               you have to settle ; on your shoulders rests the re- 
               <br />
               sponsibility of working out your own destiny, and 
               <br />
               you have the right to say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Whether</span> you will have 
               <br />
               separateschools and the dual langua es or not. I 
               <br />
               hold that that is the fair way to ( ispose of this 
               <br />
               question, and I feel assured, though I am not a 
               <br />
               prophet nor the son of one, that the members of 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> will have to come to that conclusion 
               <br />
               before they are five years older.
