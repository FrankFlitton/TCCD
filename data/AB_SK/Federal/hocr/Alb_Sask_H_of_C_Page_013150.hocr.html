               Frenchmen at that time who had passed under the

               <br />
               they had debts to collect. They said to themselves:

               ‘ ‘ We cannot go before the judicial tribunals ; we are 
               <br />

               case and decide between them. The case would 
               <br />
               then be argued before the priest, and he would 
               <br />
               give judgment, and they submitted to that judg-

               <br />
               that it was an injustice to them to treat them as

               they had been treated under the English regime,

               the capitulation of the country to show this, but 
               <br />
               he ought to have remembered that when the cap-

               itulation took place, we had no Parliament and no 
               <br />
               Legislature, and, therefore, the question of lan- 
               <br />
               guage in the Legislature could not come to the 
               <br />
               minds of the French Generals who made these cap-

               the question at the time and nobody thought of it.

               But, let us consider what is granted in these cap-

               the people themselves did not think so, and they 
               <br />

               and we intend speaking the French language

               <br />
               him that we would speak that language even if this 
               <br />
               Parliament refused us the use of the French langu- 
               <br />
               age in our courts or in the Legislature. We would 
               <br />
               speak it as we spoke it notwithstanding the pro- 
               <br />
               hibitory law which the hon. gentleman invoked in 
               <br />
               showing that up to 1841 there was no legislation 
               <br />
               on that question. He told us that in 1841 when 
               <br />
               the Union of the Canadas took place the French 
               <br />
               language was prohibited, and when he told us this 
               <br />
               he was smiling and rejoicing and would have 
               <br />
               laughed had he dared. He rejoiced to see that the 
               <br />
               Parliament of England, after the rebellion in 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada, declared that English 
               <br />
               should be the only language. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               passed very lightly on the rebellion in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, and he spoke only of the rebellion of the 
               <br />
               French Canadians in the Province of Quebec. I 
               <br />
               will deal with that later on. He points out to us 
               <br />
               that in the Act passed at that time we find the 
               <br />
               language mentioned, and that the Act provided 
               <br />
               that the English language only should be used in 
               <br />
               Parliament. Well, the Union of the Canadas 
               <br />
               took place. The ﬁrst Parliament was called 
               <br />
               together and it met under that law which 
               <br />
               said that the English language was the only 
               <br />
               language to be used. What was the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               Act of that Parliament? It was’ to elect a 
               <br />
               French Canadian, the Hon. Mr. Cuvillier, as 
               <br />
               Speaker of that House, and why did they elect a 
               <br />
               French Canadian to be the Speaker? It was be- 
               <br />
               cause they saw on the benches all around a large 
               <br />
               number of French Canadians returned as their 
               <br />
               representatives by the people of Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada~</span> 
               <br />
               French Canadians, some of them not speaking a 
               <br />
               word of English, elected by the people, although 
               <br />
               the people knew that that law was on the statute 
               <br />
