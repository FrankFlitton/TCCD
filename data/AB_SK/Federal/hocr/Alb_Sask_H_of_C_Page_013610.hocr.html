               the Commons will be found, if we divide

               <br />

               the prospective population of the maritime

               <br />
               ﬁnd the maritime provinces would; then be 
               <br />
               entitled to but 30 members at the most in- 
               <br />
               stead of the 43 we had when Prince Ed- 
               <br />
               ward Island entered the union. And where 
               <br />
               will Prince Edward Island be in the matter 
               <br />
               of representation after 1931, if our ratio of 
               <br />
               increase should be no better in the thirty 
               <br />
               years to come than it has been in the thirty 
               <br />
               years past? This is a simple matter of 
               <br />
               calculation. Our increase has been less 
               <br />
               than 10 per cent in the thirty years since 
               <br />
               1871. Add a full 10 per cent of gain in the 
               <br />
               thirty years forward and in 1931 we may 
               <br />
               count at most on a population of 113,585. 
               <br />
               Divide this by the unit of representation as 
               <br />
               it will then be, that is by 35,170 and it 
               <br />
               will be seen that we shall then be entitled 
               <br />
               to but three members—that is, if the terms 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act are ap- 
               <br />
               plied to us as is at present proposed by 
               <br />
               those in authority at Ottawa. Half our re- 
               <br />
               presentation as it was in 1873 would thus 
               <br />
               be swept away. It may be seen in the fact 
               <br />
               that just as soon as the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               becomes as densely populated as Prince Ed- 
               <br />
               ward Island, we would not be entitled to 
               <br />
               any representation at all, which would be an 
               <br />
               absurdity, for the 22nd clause of the report 
               <br />
               of the Quebec conference declares that ‘no 
               <br />
               fractional part of the unit of representation 
               <br />
               shall- be considered, unless when exceeding 
               <br />
               one—half the number entitling to a member.’ 
               <br />
               Quebec being 152 times our area, and the 
               <br />
               number of representatives limited to 65, we 
               <br />
               must need be more than twice as thickly 
               <br />
               populated as that province in order to have 
               <br />
               even one member. But Prince Edward Is- 
               <br />
               land has not during the last decade nor is it 
               <br />
               likely to increase to the same extent as in 
               <br />
               the thirty years past. We came in with a 
               <br />
               population of 47 to the square mile and now 
               <br />
               have 51. Where will the representation of 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island be when Quebec pop- 
               <br />
               ulation is even <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40</span> to the square mile. Our 
               <br />
               province will be politically obliterated. 
               <br />
               Now, Mr. Speaker, these are well defined 
               <br />
               reasons why our representation should be 
               <br />
               the same as when we entered confederation.

               province of British Columbia in 1892 the 
               <br />
               right hon. the leader of the House said: 
               <br />
               That the intention of the parties should be 
               <br />

               is still of that opinion I would ask him that 
               <br />
               the intention of the contracting parties be

               be given its six representatives in this

               Mr. SPROULE. I presume they are, but 
               <br />
               they have exhibited a careless indifference 
               <br />
               in this matter sadly in contrast with the 
               <br />
               energy of the governments of New Bruns- 
               <br />

               <br />
               but we see here ministers of the Crown 
               <br />
               from Ontario and Ontario members sup-
