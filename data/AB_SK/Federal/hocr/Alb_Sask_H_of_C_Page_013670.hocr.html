               are drawing at the present time over :1 mil- 
               <br />
               lion dollars, showing that we are fairly 
               <br />
               well-off at the present time. There was a 
               <br />
               time in the history of the North-west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories, as my hon. friend from Alberta has 
               <br />
               pointed out when we were not so well-off, 
               <br />
               and when we did not get as much as we 
               <br />
               were entitled to for the purpose of building 
               <br />
               roads and bridges. Yet the hon. leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition talks about what Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               t-ain did a couple of years ago, when serious 
               <br />
               storms swept away the bridges. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Haul&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               tain went around to the people and told them 
               <br />
               that he had no money, but that if they had 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy they could have the 
               <br />
               bridges rebuilt. If the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west are in a position to get $250,000, and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$250000</span> more without being called upon to 
               <br />
               pay interest on capital account, they are in 
               <br />
               a better position than if they had to pay in- 
               <br />
               terest on that money. Another advantage 
               <br />
               of the present position of the North—west 
               <br />
               Territories is that they have not to main- 
               <br />
               tain the extravagant form of government 
               <br />
               which is kept up in all the other provinces. 
               <br />
               I would like to call the attention of the 
               <br />
               House to some of the services that we would 
               <br />
               have to maintain ourselves if the territories 
               <br />
               were put upon a. provincial basis that are 
               <br />
               now performed by the Dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment. There is. in the ﬁrst place, the police 
               <br />
               force. If the North-west Territories were 
               <br />
               formed into a province, I suppose the hon. 
               <br />
               leader opposite would admit that the pro— 
               <br />
               vince would have to pay for the mainten- 
               <br />
               ance of the police force. The mounted police 
               <br />
               is paid for at the present time out of the 
               <br />
               federal treasury and it performs police duty 
               <br />
               in the territories. The territories would 
               <br />
               have to assume this expense. I do not know 
               <br />
               What the force costs, but I am satisﬁed that 
               <br />
               for the territories that Mr. Haultain pro- 
               <br />
               poses to bring in Assiniboia, Saskatche- 
               <br />
               Wan, Alberta and a portion of Athabasca, 
               <br />
               it would not cost less than $200,000 a year. 
               <br />
               The registry ofﬁces are self-supporting, so 
               <br />
               that it is not necessary to say anything about 
               <br />
               them. But, in addition to the mounted po- 
               <br />
               lice, they would have to pay for the ad-

               the public works that are constructed by

               the people there would have a grievance. In

               many persons are thirsting for this change- 
               <br />
               I think the trouble lies more with the 
               <br />
               politicians than with the people. If you 
               <br />
               give us enough money so that we can build 
               <br />

               <br />
