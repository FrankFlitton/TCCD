               <br />
               relate to matters that I think have been already

               <br />
               there is one resolution in regard to immigration 
               <br />
               that I wish specially to press upon the attention 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> and upon the attention

               Government that preceded it, will, I think, come 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that they have not erred in over- 
               <br />
               zeal for the promotion of immigration. Several 
               <br />
               things have undoubtedly combined to that effect ; 
               <br />
               the principal of which is, that there has been in 
               <br />
               the cities a strong and inﬂuential party inﬂuencing 
               <br />
               elections, who were opposed to assisted immi ra- 
               <br />
               tion. Well, Sir, the time came when a wisepo icy 
               <br />
               was adopted by the Government of Canada, and 
               <br />
               that policy was this : Only to pay for results ;but, 
               <br />
               in my opinion, that policy has fallen short of what 
               <br />
               was needed by the Dominion of Canada because of 
               <br />
               unwillingness on the part of both sides of this 
               <br />

               <br />
               gration moved on froni one basis : a basis 
               <br />
               along the Paciﬁc coast, a basis stretching 
               <br />
               down the whole length of the original states 
               <br />
               that broke away from England. Herein Canada 
               <br />
               we have had to proceed upon a different basis. 
               <br />
               First you had a short territory in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what.</span> were called the 
               <br />
               Lower Provinces ; then you had Quebec, then you 
               <br />
               had Ontario, and there you had the great lakes 
               <br />
               stretching between Ontario and the territories, 
               <br />
               and that has necessitated that in Manitoba and the 
               <br />
               territories we should proceed upon a perfectly new 
               <br />
               basis. That has made. migration ditiicult for us as 
               <br />
               compared with what it was in the States. The 
               <br />
               point,therefore, I make is this : that if you are going 
               <br />
               to people Manitoba and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Yest</span> Territories 
               <br />
               as you ought to do. and as rapidly as you ought to 
               <br />
               do, you must make you basis there and act from 
               <br />
               there; and the little Parliament in Regina has ask- 
               <br />
               ed that a smn of money should be devoted to their 
               <br />
               use to deal specially with immigration. Now, Sir, 
               <br />
               what is done by the other provinces? Ontario, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba, has each its 
               <br />
               agent or agents who are all active in promoting im- 
               <br />
               migration into these provinces, and as a fact we can 
               <br />
               state the amount of work that has been done in 
               <br />
               promoting immigration into Manitoba by the very

               <br />

               ber of agents in various parts of Ontario for instance, 
               <br />
               and theyare doing work that he himself can measure. 
               <br />
               He can tell exactly the amount of work they have. 
               <br />
               done, and show the money value which that province 
               <br />
               has got from those agents. Now, what we in the 
               <br />
               North-\Vest say is this : Give us the means of doing 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               recisely the same thing for the North-\Vest as has

               <br />
               is something large in the way of promoting immi-

               that that money is far more fruitfully expended
