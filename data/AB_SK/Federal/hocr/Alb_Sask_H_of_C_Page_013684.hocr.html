               propositions of this draft Bill, propositions 
               <br />
               that, I believe, are supported by all the 
               <br />
               people of the North-west. For I do not 
               <br />
               agree with all my colleagues from the North- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Haultain’s proposals are approved with 
               <br />
               practical unanimity by the people of the 
               <br />
               North—west. Until the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Borden, Halifax) is willing to say that he 
               <br />
               will stand by these propositions, until he 
               <br />
               is prepared to say that if we are granted 
               <br />
               autonomy it will be by the assistance of his 
               <br />
               vote for these terms, he can hardly com-

               mand the support of those of us from the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories, and he can hardly 
               <br />
               command the support of the voters of the 
               <br />
               North-west who approve the details of Mr.

               Now, I made reference a few minutes 
               <br />
               ago to a condition which had arisen and 
               <br />
               which made it wise, in my opinion to delay 
               <br />
               for this year,_granting autonomy to the 
               <br />
               North-west. That new condition is the judg- 
               <br />
               ment given by the Supreme Court of Maui- 
               <br />

               cerning the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway land 
               <br />
               tax exemption. And, in my view this is a 
               <br />
               very important consideration. Even in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               Bill prepared less than two years ago he 
               <br />

               The effect of these exemptions is to prohibit

               <br />

               <br />

               This exemption falls hardly upon the people

               Further down in the same document he
