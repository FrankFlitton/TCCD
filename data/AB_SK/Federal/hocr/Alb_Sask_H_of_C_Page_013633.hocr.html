               The MINISTER OF FINANCE. It is

               the great boast of our English system of 
               <br />
               government that it is a growth of time, 
               <br />
               and that consequently it is not well to do 
               <br />
               things too rapidly. Our development should 
               <br />
               be like that of British freedom, that ‘ broad-

               <br />
               with a hop, step and a jump. There has 
               <br />
               been some development of the principle of 
               <br />
               local self-government in the Territories dur- 
               <br />
               ing recent years. Under this present gov- 
               <br />
               ernment amendments have been made to 
               <br />
               the legislation respecting the North-west 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories,</span> which broadened the powers of 
               <br />
               the legislature and gave the people a large 
               <br />
               measure of responsible government. I 
               <br />
               think the time is close at hand when this 
               <br />
               government which is always looking after 
               <br />
               these things wisely and well, will have to 
               <br />
               go further, and still further broaden these 
               <br />
               powers and give to that section of the 0011]- 
               <br />
               munity the larger measure of self-govern- 
               <br />
               ment which the other provinces enjoy. The 
               <br />
               conditions in the North-west Territories have 
               <br />
               not been the same as those in the older 
               <br />
               provinces in past years. But through the 
               <br />
               growth of population and the increase of 
               <br />

               conditions, and I am quite sure it will be

               the pleasure of both sides of this House at

               with regard to the North-west Territories, 
               <br />
               when we come to adjust accounts with them 
               <br />
               we will have to place to their credit a cer- 
               <br />
               tain amount of money in the debt account. 
               <br />
               It may not be a debt in the sense that they 
               <br />
               will have to pay it. The probability is 
               <br />
               that we will have to pay them interest upon 
               <br />
               it. My hon. friend is mistaken when he 
               <br />
               says that this is all we are doing for the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories, because we largely 
               <br />
               increase their general grant. We are g0- 
               <br />
               ing to give them a million dollars, as com- 
               <br />

               lion seven years ago.

               Mr. GILMOUR. I did not say that you 
               <br />
               were giving them nothing. I understood 
               <br />
               quite well what the hon. Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               said, but in view of the fact that you are 
               <br />
               establishing what I would consider a debt, 
               <br />
