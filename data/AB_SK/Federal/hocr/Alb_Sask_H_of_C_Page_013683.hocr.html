               <br />
               My hon. friend wants to know why these 
               <br />
               lands were alienated. Surely it is a little 
               <br />
               late for my hon friend to be asking that 
               <br />
               question. Some of the new settlers in the 
               <br />
               west might ask this question Without creat- 
               <br />
               ing any surprise, but surely it is a late 
               <br />
               date for the leader of the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive’ party, the party which alienated 
               <br />
               the lands contrary to the interests and well-

               whole of Canada, to be asking in this year 
               <br />
               of grace why these lands in the west were 
               <br />
               alienated and given away to railway com- 
               <br />
               panies. We may differ as to the wisdom and 
               <br />
               policy pursued by the Conservative party, 
               <br />
               but the thing is done, there is no need to ask 
               <br />
               any questions about the lands being alien- 
               <br />
               ated, and is not my hon. friend able to say 
               <br />
               now whether he thinks they were alienated 
               <br />
               for federal purposes or for some other pur- 
               <br />
               pose? Surely the building of railways is a 
               <br />
               federal undertaking ; these railways were au— 
               <br />
               thorized to be built by parliament and the 
               <br />
               aid was voted by parliament, so that 
               <br />
               surely they are federal undertakings. The 
               <br />
               people in the west had the idea that my hon. 
               <br />
               friend was simply evading the question by 
               <br />
               a quibble. Let me explain to my hon. friend 
               <br />
               how serious this question is and why it is 
               <br />
               viewed so seriously by the people of the 
               <br />
               west. The total areas of lands which were 
               <br />
               voted away by the Conservative party 
               <br />
               to railway companies was 56,082,072 
               <br />
               acres. Now the roads constructed with 
               <br />
               this in the North-west amounted to 1,606 
               <br />
               miles and in Manitoba 1,217 miles. North- 
               <br />
               west land was taken to construct roads in 
               <br />
               Ontario and the mileage in Ontario is 650 
               <br />
               miles and in British Columbia it is 253 miles. 
               <br />
               By these various items railway companies 
               <br />
               in the North-west Territories, Manitoba, On- 
               <br />
               tario and British Columbia have earned 29,‘ 
               <br />
               986,826 acres of land mostly in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. Part of this area of land 
               <br />
               is in Manitoba, but the North-west Territor- 
               <br />
               ies furnish all the lands earned by the roads 
               <br />
               in the North-west Territories, British Co- 
               <br />
               lumbia and Ontario and a portion of the 
               <br />
               land for the roads constructed in Manitoba. 
               <br />
               In Manitoba 2,699,230 acres are patented 
               <br />
               and perhaps another million of acres will be 
               <br />
               selected there, so that the Territories will 
               <br />
               have furnished more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">26.000000</span> of the 
               <br />
               total 30,000,000 acres of land furnished by 
               <br />
               the public to these companies. The terri- 
               <br />
               tories therefore furnish about 86 per cent 
               <br />
               of the land earned by railway companies, 
               <br />
               yet only 43 per cent of the land aided rail- 
               <br />
               ways were built in the territories, 1,606 
               <br />
               miles out of a total of 3,741 miles which 
               <br />
               were aided by land grants. The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man (Mr. Borden) at Regina said:
