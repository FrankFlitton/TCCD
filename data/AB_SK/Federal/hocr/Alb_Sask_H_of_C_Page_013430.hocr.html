               The original section inmosed duality in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lan-</span> 
               <br />
               guage in four matters: ﬁrst. with respect to 
               <br />
               publication of the laws ; second, with respect 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proceedings</span> in the courts; third, with 
               <br />
               respect to proceedings in the Council : 
               <br />
               and fourth, with respect to the printing and 
               <br />
               publishing of those proceedings. As to the 
               <br />
               proceedings in the Council, this power was 
               <br />
               given by the Act of 1891, in pursuance of 
               <br />
               the arrangement made across the ﬂoor in 
               <br />
               the preceding session; provided, however. 
               <br />
               that after the next general election for the 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly such Assembly may, 
               <br />
               by ordinance or otherwise, regulate its pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings in the matter of recording and 
               <br />
               publishing the same. and the said regula— 
               <br />
               tion shall be embodied in the proceedings 
               <br />
               which shall be forthwith published by the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant Governor, in conformity with the 
               <br />
               law, and shall afterward have full force and 
               <br />
               etfect. The House will observe that the 
               <br />
               power given to the Legislative Assembly 
               <br />
               was merely with respect to its own pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings. and the other portion of the law 
               <br />
               still remained in force: ﬁrst, that proceed- 
               <br />
               ings in the courts might be conducted in 
               <br />
               either language, and, second. that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ordino'</span> 
               <br />
               ances, passed under this provision. shall be 
               <br />
               published in both languages. As I have 
               <br />
               often said before in making this motion, or 
               <br />
               in bringing in a bill to repeal this clause. 1 
               <br />
               do not do it with any feeling of hostility to 
               <br />
               my French-Canadian fellow-subjects. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve, Sir, that the interests of this country 
               <br />
               will be best served, when the distinction be- 
               <br />
               tween thesc nationalities is done away with : 
               <br />
               at all events, that so far as the North-west 
               <br />
               is concerned, we certainly should not intro- 
               <br />
