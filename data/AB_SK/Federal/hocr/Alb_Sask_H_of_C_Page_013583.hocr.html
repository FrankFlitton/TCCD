               <br />
               judges of the Supreme Court to say that we 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               can be shed by them on the legislation that 
               <br />
               has been passed. In the debates before the 
               <br />
               imperial parliament, when Lord Carnarvon 
               <br />
               was introducing the British North America 
               <br />
               Act, he spoke very clearly as to the lan— 
               <br />
               guage of the enactment, and laid down that 
               <br />
               the British North America Act was the re- 
               <br />
               sult of a treaty made between the various 
               <br />
               powers every clause of which was a com- 
               <br />
               promise; and because every clause of that 
               <br />
               treaty was a compromise he refused to 
               <br />
               allow the House of Lords to amend any 
               <br />
               clause of it in any respect. Now then if 
               <br />
               every clause of that treaty was a compro- 
               <br />
               mise, perhaps it would not be out of place 
               <br />
               to inquire into the circumstances under 
               <br />
               which this particular clause 51, in which 
               <br />
               we are so deeply interested, came to be put 
               <br />
               in the statute. On reference to Pope’s Con- 
               <br />
               federation Documents, page 67, we ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               debate on the clause giving the number of 
               <br />
               representatives that the various provinces 
               <br />
               should be given. We ﬁnd Mr. Gait saying : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supposed</span> that the population of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada being tolerably equable in its 
               <br />
               character, would afford the best basis. But hav- 
               <br />
               ing respect to the rapid increase of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, we think the lower provinces should 
               <br />
               not be reduced if they do not increase in the 
               <br />
               same ratio. Therefore, the lower provinces 
               <br />
               would have the same as they have now unless 
               <br />
               in the very improbable case of any one falling 
               <br />
               off ﬁve per cent or m6re,—that is a decrease 
               <br />
               relatively to the whole federation.

               The practical result will be that while Lower 
               <br />
               Canada certainly will not be less and the lower 
               <br />
               provrnces may increase in population, they can- 
               <br />
               not decrease in the number of representatives. 
               <br />
               It keeps the House within a reasonable limit. 
               <br />
               It is now to start with one in 17,000. It will 
               <br />
               afterwards vary.

               <br />
               would afford what they considered a fair

               basis for the representation of each pro- 
               <br />
               vince, and it was evidently understood by

               the representatives at that time when they 
               <br />
               so provided that unless there was a falling 
               <br />
               off of one-twentieth in the population of a 
               <br />
               province there should be no decrease, that 
               <br />
               practically they were insured against any 
               <br />
               decrease. Now the provinces have gone in- 
               <br />
               to the Dominion on that basis, and the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish North America Act being an imperial 
               <br />
               Act, I submit it is beyond question that the 
               <br />
               terms of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               every clause of it being, as Lord Carnar- 
               <br />
               von said, a compromise, must stand pre- 
               <br />
               cisely to-day as they were then, except 
               <br />
               insofar as those clauses have been modiﬁed 
               <br />
               by imperial legislation. We must not forget 
               <br />
               that no matter what legislation this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment might profess to pass or attempt to 
               <br />
               pass in derogation of imperial legislation, 
               <br />
               we would be exceeding our powers and our 
               <br />
               legislation would be utterly void. Now, I 
               <br />
               would ask the Minister of Justice what legis- 
               <br />
               lation has ever passed the imperial parlia- 
               <br />
               ment that in any way aﬂects clause 51. 
               <br />
               Probably the answer will be: The other 
               <br />
               provinces came in under Orders in Council. 
               <br />
               True, they did come in under Orders in 
               <br />
               Council, and if the Minister of Justice will 
               <br />
               read the imperial Orders in Council under 
               <br />
               which Prince Edward Island, British Colum- 
               <br />
               bia and other provinces came in, he will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that in each case the Order in Council 
               <br />
               provided that in pursuance of the 146th 
               <br />
               section of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               they came in subject to the proviSions of 
               <br />
               this Act, for in fact an Order in Council 
               <br />
               would have no power to vary the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, it would be as invalid 
               <br />
               as an Act of this House, except for clause 
               <br />
               146 which provided that on an address from 
               <br />
               a province, with a similar address and on 
               <br />
               similar terms, from this House, the Queen
