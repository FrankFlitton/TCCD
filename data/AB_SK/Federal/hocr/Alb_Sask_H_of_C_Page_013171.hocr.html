               The hon. gentleman objects, also, to the preamble 
               <br />
               of this Bill. I think last year, my hon. friend, 
               <br />
               . the Minister of Justice, in the debate on the 
               <br />
               .Jesuits’ Estates Bill, said that the preamble had 
               <br />
               very little to do with the Bill, that the character 
               <br />
               of the measure was best shown by the provisions 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'the</span> Bill itself. However, I see nothing objection- 
               <br />
               able in this preamble, which reads as follows :— 
               <br />
               “Whereas it is expedient in the interest of the 
               <br />
               national comit of the Dominion that there should be 
               <br />
               a community 0 language amongst the people of Canada, 
               <br />
               and that the enactment in the North-West Territories 
               <br />
               Act allowing the use of the French should be expunged 
               <br />
               therefrom : Therefore Her Majesty, &amp;c.” 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 210 1193 1212 3488">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               'That simply asserts that, in the interests of this 
               <br />
               Dominion, it would be well if we could have a com- 
               <br />
               munity of language. I believe that statement, and I 
               <br />
               will support the Bill upon that assertion. The Bill 
               <br />
               itself asserts that the French language should not 
               <br />
               be used in the North-West as an ofﬁcial language. 
               <br />
               I believe that, and I shall vote that it shall not be 
               <br />
               used there. Those who think otherwise can vote 
               <br />
               the other way. Each of us is entitled to his own 
               <br />
               opinion, and probably each may entertain their 
               <br />
               opinion honestly. Then, the hon. gentleman says 
               <br />
               that the French Canadians want only fair play and 
               <br />
               justice. I should be ashamed to take the position 
               <br />
               that I intended to deny fair play and justice to the 
               <br />
               French Canadians; on the contrary, they should 
               <br />
               have the fullest justice and the utmost limit of 
               <br />
               fair play ; but this is an English colony, we live 
               <br />
               under British laws and institutions, and there is a 
               <br />
               vast country in the North-West where all the in- 
               <br />
               stitutions are plastic and unformed, and, because 
               <br />
               there are a few hundred or a few thousand 
               <br />
               children of French traders and French half- 
               <br />
               breeds in that territory, it is not necessary for 
               <br />
               the future welfare of this country that the 
               <br />
               dual language should be preserved there as oﬂicial, 
               <br />
               with all the evils which we believe would ﬂow 
               <br />
               from it to the general interests of the country. 
               <br />
               The North-West is likely to become the seat of 
               <br />
               power in this Dominion; it is likely to have the 
               <br />
               great majority of the people of this Dominion ; it 
               <br />
               it is likely to become the most productive part of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, and therefore it is of the utmost 
               <br />
               importance, at this time, that this change should 
               <br />
               be made, when it can be done without any great 
               <br />
               trouble. When that country is young and in a 
               <br />
               formative state, we should put it on the right 
               <br />
               track. The North-West ought not to be saddled with 
               <br />
               such a provision as the use of two ofﬁcial languages. 
               <br />
               I believe, in the interests of this country, that it 
               <br />
               should not be, and I shall so vote. My sense of 
               <br />
               duty impels me to do so. Then the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               says, that Parliament is the proper place in which 
               <br />
               to deal with this. I thoroughly agree with him 
               <br />
               in that. The North-West Territories, have not yet 
               <br />
               Provincial institutions. This clause 110 emanated 
               <br />
               from us. With this Parliament rests the exclu- 
               <br />
               sive jurisdiction <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tldk</span> to this moment, and, if this 
               <br />
               Parliament has en a step which is not in the 
               <br />
               interest of the country, or has done any wrong, let 
               <br />
               us undo that wrong and retrace the step. I shall 
               <br />
               vote to retrace the step and undo thewrong. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman will vote that this provision shall 
               <br />
               not be repealed. He has a perfect right to do so, 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_9" title="bbox 1241 419 2241 3314">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               and so have all his fellow-countrymen, but I shall 
               <br />
               vote that it be repealed, because I think it is not in 
               <br />
               the interest of the country. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Then we come 'to our friend from Algoma (Mr. 
               <br />
               Dawson), who tells us there were French in the 
               <br />
               North-West before there were English. So there 
               <br />
               Were, and so there were in Ontario, and they had 
               <br />
               stations in Detroit before there were any English 
               <br />
               there at all, and they had other stations in Michigan, 
               <br />
               Illinois and Wisconsin, and yet the French lang- 
               <br />
               uage has not been retained in those places. The 
               <br />
               English have acquired rights there by possession or 
               <br />
               purchase, and I believe that we may follow their 
               <br />
               example in the case of the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest.</span> 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I come next to the speech of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the Minister of Public Works. I am bound to 
               <br />
               say that I considered that speech last night a 
               <br />
               bitter one. The hon. gentleman possesses tact 
               <br />
               and diplomatic ability, but last night he did not 
               <br />
               succeed in concealing the bitterness of his feel- 
               <br />
               ing on this topic, a feeling amounting almost to a 
               <br />
               sense of hatred of those who were opposed to him. 
               <br />
               He paraded before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Housewas,</span> of course, he had 
               <br />
               a right to do so—his devotion to his Church and 
               <br />
               his loyalty to French Canadian institutions. He is 
               <br />
               undoubtedly loyal to them. Referring to the French 
               <br />
               settlers of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“fest,</span> he asked “ when have 
               <br />
               these men spoken treason?” I have not accused 
               <br />
               them of speaking treason but it is not long since 
               <br />
               they were in rebellion; and whether they were 
               <br />
               more in fault for that than my hon. friend and 
               <br />
               his colleagues, I am not now to say; but as to 
               <br />
               their loyalty to this country and its institutions, 
               <br />
               I doubt if they are entitled to any degree of 
               <br />
               consideration on that score. As to this question 
               <br />
               of loyalty and 0f the use of treasonable expressions, 
               <br />
               I must be permitted, I think, to refer to some 
               <br />
               of the circumstances which are indicative of the 
               <br />
               feeling amongst our French fellow-citizens, and 
               <br />
               I do this With a feeling of reluctance I did 
               <br />
               not propose to do so; and, perhaps, it is not 
               <br />
               necessary to do so; but, I think, the Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works challenged this reference by the 
               <br />
               allusion which he made in the course of his speech 
               <br />
               last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">night.‘</span> In the city of Quebec, not many 
               <br />
               months ago, there was a great public demon- 
               <br />
               stration on the occasion of the unveiling of a 
               <br />
               couple of statues, and speeches were then made 
               <br />
               by French Canadians of eminence, who may be 
               <br />
               supposed to give utterance to the feeling in French 
               <br />
               Canada, which, I think, possess a great deal of 
               <br />
               signiﬁcance. I think there may be some here 
               <br />
               now who were present on that occasion. I have 
               <br />
               understood that the Tri-color was there displayed 
               <br />
               abundantly, and that the Union Jack was not so 
               <br />
               abundantly displayed; that the outward appear- 
               <br />
               ances would not impress any one with the idea 
               <br />
