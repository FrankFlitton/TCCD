               arose in 1896, or in 1897, or in 1900. Having 
               <br />
               been a member of the North-west Assembly 
               <br />
               myself, I am perhaps more familiar with the 
               <br />
               matter than he is, and I can assure him that 
               <br />
               the question is of much more ancient date; 
               <br />
               that it has been claiming the attention of 
               <br />
               the people of the territories for many years, 
               <br />
               and that the position has remained substan- 
               <br />
               tially the same all these years. That is to 
               <br />
               say, there has been a demand, either for 
               <br />
               terms which would go with provincial or- 
               <br />
               ganization, or equally good terms without 
               <br />
               provincial organization. For the people of 
               <br />
               the North—west Territories the question has 
               <br />
               been one of ﬁnance and not of authority; 
               <br />
               it has been a material question and not a 
               <br />
               theoretical question. The question in 1896, 
               <br />
               in 1897, and in 1900, was with them how to 
               <br />
               best govern the territories, how to meet the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial requirements of that government. 
               <br />
               and how best to bring to the notice and 
               <br />
               favourable attention of this government the 
               <br />
               requirements of that country. The ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cial needs of the territories are the same 
               <br />
               to-day as they have always been, except that 
               <br />
               they are greater to-day than they have 
               <br />
               ever been. Although my hon. friend has 
               <br />
               said that he did not have in his possession 
               <br />
               the particular correspondence that has been 
               <br />
