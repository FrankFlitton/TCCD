               Mr. WILSON (Elgin). I must congratulate the 
               <br />
               Minister of Agriculture, who possibly may feel a 
               <br />
               disposition before long to be exalted to a position 
               <br />
               more agreeable to his tastes than his present one, 
               <br />
               upon the assistance which he has received from 
               <br />
               the two aspirants to his present ofﬁce. I warn him 
               <br />
               that they are dangerous characters, as they say 
               <br />
               doctors always are, and I would advise him to be 
               <br />
               cautious in accepting the advice of these two aspir- 
               <br />
               ants to the position of Minister of Agriculture. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) got 
               <br />
               to his feet first, and defended this item, as he 
               <br />
               always has done. He conveyed the idea to the 
               <br />
               House that I did not fully understand the question, 
               <br />
               or I would know that no other Provinces had a 
               <br />
               health board except Ontario, and that, therefore 
               <br />
               they could not be expected to adopt means by 
               <br />
               which the health of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> localities could be 
               <br />
               ascertained. He went further and stated that it 
               <br />
               was very desirable to know how many people die 
               <br />
               in a particular locality in order to judge of the con- 
               <br />
               dition of health in that locality. I certainly did 
               <br />
               not know that that was the way in which to ascer- 
               <br />
               tain the state of health in a locality. I thought 
               <br />
               there must be something else reported in order to 
               <br />
               ascertain that, but my hon. friend, in his zeal to 
               <br />
               show his ability to conduct the Department of 
               <br />
               Agriculture, did not think it necessary to obtain 
               <br />
               any other information. I may inform my hon. 
               <br />
               friend that there are other Provinces which have 
               <br />
               health boards.

               <br />
               tell my hon. friend that I did know that there Were 
               <br />
               other Provinces in which boards of health were 
               <br />
               constituted very much on the principles of the boards 
               <br />
               of health in Ontario. In regard to the suggestion 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for West Middlesex (Mr. 
               <br />
               Roome), that we should have a central board here, 
               <br />
               to which all information should be sent, so that the 
               <br />
               whole of these health statistics should be arranged 
               <br />
               from Ottawa, I do not think that could be efﬁ- 
               <br />
               ciently worked. I think this matter can be very 
               <br />
               much better conducted under the supervision of 
               <br />
               the Provinces, that they understand how to con- 
               <br />
               trol these matters better than the Dominion could, 
               <br />
               and that, if we would attempt to make this service 
               <br />
               eﬂicient, we should adopt the principle suggested by 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Prince Edward (Mr. Platt). I 
               <br />
               do not think we would derive any beneﬁ t from having 
               <br />
               all the reports of the different ofﬁcers throughout the 
               <br />
               Dominion sent here and examined in regard to the 
               <br />
               health or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">longevity</span> in each locality. As a rule, 
               <br />
               these oﬂicers make no attempt to ascertain the con- 
               <br />
               dition of affairs. There may be a physician in a 
               <br />
               town who tries to make a report of that kind, but 
               <br />
               from the rural constituencies, we get practically no 
               <br />
               information. The statement of the health of 
               <br />
               Ontario, for example, when it is limited to the 
               <br />
               towns and cities, without the rural municipalities 
               <br />
               making any returns, is of no value whatever, or 
               <br />
               rather it is worse than useless, because it is mis- 
               <br />
               leading. I think it would be better to drop this
