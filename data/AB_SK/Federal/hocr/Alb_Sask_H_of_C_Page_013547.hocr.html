               comers who are arriving daily in that coun- 
               <br />
               try. The Winnipeg ‘h‘ree Press,’ which 
               <br />
               came to hand to-night, states that on Wed- 
               <br />
               nesday of this week no less than 1,000 set- 
               <br />
               tlers arrived in Winnipeg, and a very con- 
               <br />
               siderable proportion of all the settlers who 
               <br />
               arrive at Winnipeg go to some point in the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories. This is a very en- 
               <br />
               couraging feature of the times, and I thor— 
               <br />
               oughly agree with what was said by my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the Minister of the Interior last 
               <br />
               night, that we appear to be at the dawn of 
               <br />
               a new day. The present prospect is more 
               <br />
               encouraging than it has been at any time 
               <br />
               at least in my lifetime, and I think the 
               <br />
               committee will agree that it would be too 
               <br />
               bad if any check were given to the ten- 
               <br />
               dency of the people towards that country, 
               <br />
               by parsimony on the part of this House in 
               <br />
               dealing with the local needs of the people. 
               <br />
               As has often been said, any effort that may 
               <br />
               be put forth by this government to promote 
               <br />
               immigration must be secondary in effect to 
               <br />
               the work which will be done by satisﬁed 
               <br />
               settlers in the country, who, as is often said, 
               <br />
               are the best immigration agents. For my 
               <br />
               part, I think one of the most important 
               <br />
               duties coming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">within</span> the purview of the 
               <br />
               Department of the Interior with regard to 
               <br />
               immigration is to see that the local needs, 
               <br />
               in the way of public works, education, and 
               <br />
               other things, are properly and adequately 
               <br />
               met. For these reasons, for my part—and 
               <br />
               I believe I speak for every member from 
               <br />
               the North-west Territories, and I believe as 
               <br />
               well that our friends from British Columbia 
               <br />
               and Manitoba will support us unanimously 
               <br />
               in this—I think the House should very 
               <br />
               largely increase the grant to the local gov- 
               <br />

               calculation this sum was arrived at. If 
               <br />

               increase of those requirements. Now, this 
               <br />
               whole country is ringing with a knowledge 
               <br />
               of the increase of population and therefore 
               <br />
               increase of requirements in the North-west, 
               <br />
               and that knowledge has produced no result 
               <br />
               in the way of meeting the requirements 
               <br />
               which necessarily arise. It may be said 
               <br />
               that the amount required for the purposes 
               <br />

               <br />
               tories is an uncertain amount. So it is. 
               <br />
               It is an amount which depends from time 
               <br />
               to time upon the requirements as they arise. 
               <br />
               With the increase of population, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,those</span> re-

               quirements have increased‘ from year to

               year. By reason of climatic conditions dur- 
               <br />
               ing the past year, those needs have been 
               <br />
               tremendously emphasized. By reason of 
               <br />
               heavy rains, bridges have been washed out 
               <br />
               by the dozen, and a very large part of the 
               <br />
               revenues of the territorial government which 
               <br />
               should have gone to extend the facilities of 
               <br />
               travel throughout new settlements in the 
               <br />
               country, has been used up in replacing the 
               <br />
               damage done by the ﬂoods in older settle- 
               <br />
               ments. It may not be altogether plain to 
               <br />
               membersof the House why an increase of 
               <br />
               population means an increase of require— 
               <br />
               ments. The reason is that the territories 
               <br />
               have immense areas, compared to popula- 
               <br />
               tion. They are not at all on the same 
               <br />
               footing as the province of Manitoba, where 
               <br />
               the population is contained in less than 
               <br />
               one—third of the total area of the province, 
               <br />
               and the total area of Manitoba is not over 
               <br />
               one—fourth of the area over which settle- 
               <br />
               ment is scattered in the North-west. An 
               <br />
               increase of settlement in the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba means simply a thickening up of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">populationuand</span> does not require the 
               <br />

               of new school districts, and does not increase 
               <br />
               materially the expenses of government; 
               <br />
               While an increase of population in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories means that people have 
               <br />
               spread out into new country, necessitating 
               <br />
               new roads and new schools and an increase
