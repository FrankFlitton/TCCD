               custody. If C. D. be a saloon keeper, as he often is, 
               <br />
               he may have a permit for every letter of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               is to oblige the person who has the liquor to show 
               <br />
               a permit to himself. It is to make the law as to 
               <br />
               permits more stringent. ‘

               Mr. DAVIS (Alberta). I would like to explain

               a case which I have seen happen with my own eyes. 
               <br />
               Suppose a man has a bottle of brandy, and another

               extreme.
