               question calmly and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically.</span> I may tell 
               <br />
               the hon. and learned member, who threw out 
               <br />
               the sneer, that it was a very good thing for 
               <br />
               newspapers, and the more French published 
               <br />
               the better, that most of the ordinances which 
               <br />
               were printed in French were not printed in the 
               <br />
               North-VVest, and that the company which pu- 
               <br />
               blishes the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Leader</span> had no advantage from 
               <br />
               most of them. A few were printed there, but 
               <br />
               the great bulk were printed somewhere else. 
               <br />
               So the hon. and learned member, who occupies a 
               <br />
               high position in his profession, a profession to 
               <br />
               which gentlemen of the highest honor have been 
               <br />
               proud to belong, comes here and at the close of his 
               <br />
               speech throws out a sneer without the slightest 
               <br />
               foundation, and it was a vulgar sneer, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">even</span> if there 
               <br />
               had been any foundation for it. I do not intend

               to make any reply to the hon. gentleman’s speech, 
               <br />
               and I merely rose in regard to these matters 
               <br />
               to which I have alluded, but I want to point out that 
               <br />

               <br />
               came before the House and laid down two 
               <br />
               propositions that were utterly false. Switzerland 
               <br />
               has been referred to by one hon. gentleman after 
               <br />
               another. Hon. gentlemen do not seem to have 
               <br />
               seen the point of my reference to Switzerland. My 
               <br />
               sole object was to show that the two propositions 
               <br />
               which the hon. and learned gentleman was dis- 
               <br />

               sity of languages you could not have a nation ; for, 
               <br />
               of course, if these two propositions were true, then 
               <br />
               we never could have a nation here in Canada. I 
               <br />
               showed those propositions were untrue. I showed 
               <br />
               that his authorities instead of supporting his case 
               <br />
               proved the contrary, and the statements I made

               <br />
               hon. gentleman has not attempted to reply to 
               <br />
               them. The only thing he did in the way of 
               <br />
               attempting to reply to my speech was to descend 
               <br />
               to sneers without foundation, to innuendoes 
               <br />
               that in an Assembly far inferior to this would be 
               <br />
               held to be unworthy, and he fell back on a ﬂippant 
               <br />
               reference what was without any cogency Whatever. 
               <br />
               The hon. and learned gentleman told us, and 
               <br />
               I heard it with some astonishment, that he had no 
               <br />
               desire to create bitterness, that he had no ill-feeling 
               <br />
               to the French race. This reminds me of what 
               <br />
               Thackeray said of an Englishman : that if an 
               <br />
               Englishman sees a stranger come into the country 
               <br />
               he looks at him as who should say: “ Damn you, 
               <br />
               who are you ? ” Yet that Englishman might no doubt 
               <br />
               feel an universal benevolence. The hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) talks here as 
               <br />
               if he felt universal benevolence towards every 
               <br />
               citizen of this country, whether he talks French or 
               <br />
               not ; but you have to observe the general tenor of 
               <br />
               his conduct and of this agitation, and the face may 
               <br />
               be Jacob’s but the hands are the hands of Esau.
