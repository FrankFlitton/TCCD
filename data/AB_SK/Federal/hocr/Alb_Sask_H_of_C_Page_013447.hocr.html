               of our Roman Catholic fellow-citizens who 
               <br />
               might object to the absence of the teaching

               <br />
               what a very eminent writer says on the

               The ethics of Christianity are not, as Mr. John 
               <br />
               Morley somewhere calls them, “ a. mere appendage 
               <br />

               <br />
               pendent of those mysteries, and would subsist to

               “indicates what is in itself good or bad for men ;” 
               <br />
               or, as elsewhere in the same work, he expresses it : 
               <br />
               “ Natural reason indicates what is good or bad for 
               <br />
               a rational creature.” The great fundamental truths 
               <br />
               of ethics are necessary, like the great fundamental 
               <br />
               truths of mathematics. They do not proceed from 
               <br />

               precepts of Christianity do not derive their validity

               the last 200 years, since the overthrow of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               They have their various meetings every day 
               <br />
               during the week. and they have the Sunday

               <br />
               yet we ﬁnd they are not satisﬁed with that,

               not fear intelligent public criticism. if their

               one other reason why we should not have this

               is the question of vested rights. The record

               and by the time we come to establish these
