               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> Mr. LANCASTER. The argument of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice, as I understand it, was 
               <br />
               that this could be done. I may point out 
               <br />
               that these new provinces were not allowed 
               <br />
               by the imperial government to come into 
               <br />
               confederation except on address from the 
               <br />
               legislature of the province as well as of the 
               <br />
               Dominion. But the logical result of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice’s argument is that you 
               <br />
               could- interfere with the existing arrange- 
               <br />
               ment of the four provinces without an ad- 
               <br />
               dress from the legislature of those four 
               <br />
               provinces or consulting them in any way. 
               <br />
               I think the conclusion that we must 
               <br />
               come to with regard to the whole mat- 
               <br />
               ter is that, interpreting the British North 
               <br />
               America Act as we must interpret it. it is 
               <br />
               not only doubtful, but I am constrained to 
               <br />
               say that it is clear to me that you have no 
               <br />
               right to interfere with the arrangement un- 
               <br />
               der section 4, you must apply that propor— 
               <br />
               tion of one-twentieth to the four provinces. 
               <br />
               That being so, then, on the merits, this Bill 
               <br />
               should not be read a second time. but the 
               <br />
               order should be discharged. the existing ar- 
               <br />
               rangement should be left undisturbed and, 
               <br />
               applying properly this proportion of one- 
               <br />

               <br />

               representation of the province of Quebec 
               <br />

               entire accord in his remarks, when he said

               The province of Quebec agreed that she 
               <br />
               should have a ﬁxed representation of sixty-

               does not cover that union, it means Canada

               Section 146 enacts that the provinces, 
               <br />
               which have later on joined confederation, 
               <br />

               it was under section 4 that they came in.

               True, there was a special treaty entered into 
               <br />
               between those provinces, but apart altogether 
               <br />
               from such treaty, supposing, for instance, 
               <br />
               that the entry of Manitoba only had been 
               <br />
               provided for. section 4 says that that pro-

               <br />
