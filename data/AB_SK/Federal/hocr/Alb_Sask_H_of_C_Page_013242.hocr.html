               quite prepared, on proper opportunity being given 
               <br />
               me, to advocate provincial rights to the fullest

               extent ; I am quite prepared to lay down the 
               <br />
               principle that the people of the North-VVest, when 
               <br />
               this matter has been fairly submitted to them, 
               <br />
               when they have passed upon it—if in two or three

               years hence they continue in the same mind——

               <br />
               was best for all parties that a decision should be 
               <br />
               come to on this subject ; it will serve no good 
               <br />
               purpose that I can see to allow this matter to be 
               <br />
               kept open for debate and to continue to be made a 
               <br />
               cause of agitation between the conﬂicting races. I 
               <br />
               cannot however quite agree with the doctrine laid 
               <br />
               down by the hon. member for Berthier (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bean.</span> 
               <br />
               soleil) thata sort of vested right has been established 
               <br />
               by the mere fact of the concession which was made 
               <br />
               some ten or twelve years ago. I am prepared, as fully 
               <br />
               as any man, to maintain treaty rights formerly 
               <br />
               granted to our French brethren in the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, but I think that in all reason we ought to 
               <br />
               stop there. If the French settlers should become 
               <br />
               numerous in any Province of this Dominion, either 
               <br />
               near us or in the far <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\l’est,</span> and if they persuaded 
               <br />
               the Legislature, or the Legislature saw ﬁt, for 
               <br />
               mutual convenience, for good felloWship or 
               <br />
               courtesy, to decree that the French language 
               <br />
               should be used in such Province, so let it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be.</span> 
               <br />
               No one on this side, I believe, would raise his 
               <br />
               voice or give his vote to prevent that extension of 
               <br />
               privileges ; but, I say, in all conscience, that ought 
               <br />
               to be enough. I have no possible ground or pre- 
               <br />
               tence to dictate to my friends from Ontario 
               <br />
               what they should do in this matter. It is a matter 
               <br />
               in which they must judge for themselves, and no 
               <br />
               doubt they will be able to do that. But if they will 
               <br />
               allow me to make a suggestion to them, it will be 
               <br />
               this: I think they ought to oppose to the utter- 
               <br />
               most the passage of the Act introduced by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc 
               <br />
               Carthy)—and on these grounds : that the Act 
               <br />
               itself is mischievous, the language is offensive, 
               <br />
               and it deals with no real substantial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">griev«</span> 
               <br />
               ance. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Thy,</span> I am told that the whole cost of the 
               <br />
               evil which the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               designs to remedy amounted in thirteen years to 
               <br />
               something like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$20,000,</span> about one-tenth or about 
               <br />
               one-twentieth of the cost which the blundering at- 
               <br />
               tempt to usurp the property and the rights of the 
               <br />
               Province of Ontario, made partly under the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman’s auspices, has already cost this country. 
               <br />
               Looking at this matterfromapractical point of view, 
               <br />
               I think after the hon. gentleman’s exhibition, after 
               <br />
               the speech he made, which showed his animus, 
               <br />
               which showed his design to make mischief, my 
               <br />
               hon. friends from Ontario need have no fear that 
               <br />
               any but a few bigots will condemn them for refus- 
               <br />
               ing to vote against this Bill. I may tell them they 
               <br />
               have lost those bigots’ votes already. While that 
               <br />
               is true, it is equally true—and my hon. friends 
               <br />
               will pardon me for reminding them of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iii—that,</span> be-

               <br />
               the hon. gentleman desires to initiate it) besides

               It would be a grave political mistake which

               I am bound to admit—and I make him a present

               and cut me out, I would probably have made a

               beside me know right well what my feelings have 
               <br />
               been on this subject since it was broached. What

               I would advise—speaking entirely from a non-party 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">point—my</span> French friends to do would be to drop 
               <br />
               this motion of my hon. friend from Berthier 
               <br />
               (Mr. Beausoleil), or, if it cannot be dropped, not 
               <br />
               to vote for it, but to consent to an amendment on 
               <br />
               the lines suggested by the hon. gentleman. That 
               <br />
               is to say, disclaiming, as we ought to disclaim, all 
               <br />
               intention or desire to interfere with the rights 
               <br />
               guaranteed to our French friends in Quebec, and 
               <br />
               in the Dominion, and we should disclaim that, and 
               <br />
               should disavow all complicity or agreement 
               <br />
               with the anti—French crusade which the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has been preaching ; but, at the 
               <br />
               same time, and on the same ground as we 
               <br />
               defended the rights of Quebec last year, We must 
               <br />
               now feel it our duty to record our conviction that, 
               <br />
               when this matter has been put fairly and clearly 
               <br />

               that nine-tenths or nineteen-twentieths of this

               they think, would accept the suggestion I have

               allow <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves</span> to be bulldozed into acting
