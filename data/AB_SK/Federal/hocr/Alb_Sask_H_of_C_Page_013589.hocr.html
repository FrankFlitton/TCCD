               tish parliament can undoubtedly amend the 
               <br />
               Act at any time. As to whether they would 
               <br />
               or could constitutionally exercise the 
               <br />
               right is another question; it is extremely 
               <br />
               doubtful. I am replying simply to an 
               <br />
               abstract legal question. If the parliament 
               <br />
               that has power to pass an Act con- 
               <br />
               tinues to exist, it must necessarily have 
               <br />
               power to amend or repeal it. That is an ele- 
               <br />
               mentary principle in constitutional law. And 
               <br />
               as the result of the subsequent action of the 
               <br />
               imperial parliament, section 51 was amended 
               <br />
               so as to make the ﬁrst clause read ‘seven ’ 
               <br />
               provinces instead of four. That, I submit 
               <br />
               respectfully, concludes the matter, because 
               <br />
               if the representation of the seven provinces 
               <br />
               is to be readjusted, it must be readjusted by 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada. What is the 
               <br />
               parliament of Canada ? It is the parlia- 
               <br />
               ment which has control over the seven pro- 
               <br />
               vinces to be readjusted, and in which those 
               <br />
               provinces are represented? 
               <br />
               of necessity mean the whole of the provinces 
               <br />
               as they exist at the time. What is the re— 
               <br />
               sult? The result is that, section 51 being 
               <br />
               applicable, you have, When you proceed 
               <br />

               <br />
               a ﬁxed number of 65 members. That pro- 
               <br />
               vince is of course out of court, but it is 
               <br />
               the pivotal province. It is by the popula-

               The question naturally arises, how do you 
               <br />
               justify the decrease in the representation of 
               <br />

               <br />
               Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. I 
               <br />
               may say at once that with respect to Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island, there is no necessity for any 
               <br />
               argument, because whatever View you take, 
               <br />
               Whether or not you construe the term ‘ Can- 
               <br />
               ada’ in subsection 4 of section 51 to in- 
               <br />
               clude only the four original provinces or to 
               <br />
               mean Canada as it is to-day, the island is, 
               <br />
               in either case, out of court. But with re- 
               <br />
               spect to the provinces of Ontario, Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and New Brunswick, if you construe 
               <br />
               the term ‘Canada’ to mean only the four 
               <br />
               original provinces, then their representation 
               <br />
               would not be reduced, but if you take it to 
               <br />
               cover all the provinces then their represen- 
               <br />
               tation will be reduced to the ﬁgures I have 
               <br />
               given. The only question to be determined 
               <br />
               therefore is What is the meaning of the 
               <br />
               word ‘Canada ’ in that subsection 4. I say 
               <br />
               it must of necessity mean Canada as it is 
               <br />
               at present and not merely the four original 
               <br />
               provinces. I shall not attempt to argue that 
               <br />
               question out now, because it seems to me 
               <br />
               that it would be to some extent unseemly 
               <br />
               that I should present here a legal argument

               which should be more properly submitted to 
               <br />
               the Supreme Court. I wish merely to state 
               <br />
               the position I take. But I should state to 
               <br />
               the House that this question is, of course, one 
               <br />
               that the House is free to discuss—I am not 
               <br />
               arguing that the House is not free; it is 
               <br />
               a matter of taste. But I say that this ques- 
               <br />
               tion is one to which I have given considerable 
               <br />
               thought. At the same time, as I had oc- 
               <br />
               casion to say once or twice before, I am 
               <br />
               not absolutely infallible; and I thought it 
               <br />
               was proper for me to get the opinion of some 
               <br />
               outside counsel on the question, and I did 
               <br />
               do so. I thought I could not do better than 
               <br />
               get the opinion of so eminent an authority 
               <br />
               as Mr. Christopher Robinson, who entirely 
               <br />
               agrees with the views I take. He says: 
               <br />

               In my opinion, ‘ Canada.’ in section 51, sub-

               I do not agree with what I understand to be
