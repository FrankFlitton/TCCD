               country would not be British as it is to-day. I 
               <br />
               have stated, and I repeat the statement, that the 
               <br />
               French Canadians having claimed and received 
               <br />
               from England the privileges of British subjects, it 
               <br />
               would be the blackest ingratitude on their part if, 
               <br />
               to-day, they were to reject the obli ations which 
               <br />
               British citizenship entails; but I a so say to the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman that it would be ungrateful, un- 
               <br />
               manly, and ungenerous to repeal at this moment, 
               <br />
               or to attempt to take from the French Canadians, 
               <br />
               the concessions made tothem towin their aﬁ'ections 
               <br />
               and to secure their support in the day of England’s 
               <br />
               danger. The hon. member for North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">horfolk</span> 
               <br />
               (Mr. Charlton) stated, a few evenings ago, that he 
               <br />
               had his doubts as to whether the loyalty of French 
               <br />
               Canadians upon that occasion had been altogether 
               <br />
               unmixed ; he had his doubts as to whether, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instead</span> 
               <br />
               of being loyal, they did not only look to their 
               <br />
               language, their laws, their institutions and their 
               <br />
               church. I do not understand the doubts of the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman. I do not doubt at all. I am 
               <br />
               quite sure these were the motives which impelled 
               <br />
               my countrymen to be loyal. They had to choose 
               <br />
               between the action of the British Crown and that 
               <br />
               of the Philadelphia Congress. The British Crown 
               <br />
               had just granted them the Act of 1774, which 
               <br />
               secured to them everythin they held <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dearmtheir</span> 
               <br />
               language, their laws and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tIieir</span> religion—and they 
               <br />
               had to choose between that and the Act of the 
               <br />
               Philadelphia Congress, which will always remain a 
               <br />
               blot on a noble page of American history,. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman shows that in the proclamation 
               <br />
               which the Congress of Philadelphia issued to the 
               <br />
               English people that very concession was declared to 
               <br />
               be one of the grievances of which the colonies 
               <br />
               had to complain. These were the motives that 
               <br />
               induced my countrymen to take the stand they 
               <br />
               did. Does the hon. gentleman ﬁnd fault with 
               <br />
               them for being guided by motives? Do not men 
               <br />
               generally act on motives? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'As</span> Mr. Lincoln said, 
               <br />
               in 1862, in the darkest period of the war : Negroes 
               <br />
               themselves will act upon motives. I would like 
               <br />
               to know What objection my hon. friend has to 
               <br />
               that? What are his views of loyalty? Does loyalty 
               <br />
               consist only in kissing the smiting hand? Is it 
               <br />
               meritorious when submissive and slavish? No ; 
               <br />
               loyalty is meritorious when it proceeds from favors 
               <br />
               granted and from justice done. And this has been 
               <br />
               the invariable tradition of the race to which my 
               <br />
               hon. friend has the honor to belong, and of which 
               <br />
               he is justly proud. But there were before to- 
               <br />
               day men whose memory was short and whose 
               <br />
               sense of atitude was limited. In the ﬁrst Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, w ich sat in 1791 under the Constitution 
               <br />
               then granted, there were men like the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) and the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton), who 
               <br />
               Wished to have the use of the French language 
               <br />
               abolished in the legislative hall. Their attempts 
               <br />
               were frustrated, chieﬂy by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efforts</span> of one man, 
               <br />
               who, upon that subject, could speak with authority. 
               <br />
               That man was Joseph Papineau, the illustrious 
               <br />
               father of a still more illustrious son; and his whole 
               <br />
               life was the repudiation of the theory advanced 
               <br />
               here in the last four days. He was an example of 
               <br />
               the fact that a man can speak in the language of 
               <br />
               his ancestors, and still remain a true subject 
               <br />

               <br />
               manded the English forces in Canada. The des- 
               <br />
               patches reached Montreal. Sir Guy Carleton had 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               great perils and hardships; but two young men 
               <br />
               undertook to carry them through. Joseph Papineau,

               <br />
               of the two who volunteered for this service. The 
               <br />
               country was in the hands of the enemy ; it was un- 
               <br />
               settled, and there were great rivers to be crossed, 
               <br />
               without bridges, and it was in the fall of the year. 
               <br />
               Mr. Papineau and his friend tramped the whole dis- 
               <br />
               tance. They reached Quebec and delivered their 
               <br />
               despatches. Then, what did they do? They 
               <br />
               enlisted as volunteers and served in the defence of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               Papineau had been elected member for Montreal, 
               <br />
               and when the attempt was made to banish the

               <br />
               Legislature has, however, been criticised by my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). He 
               <br />
               found nothing in it great, generous or statesman

               weak concession from politicians in order to 
               <br />
               capture French votes. I would not do justice to

               the hon. gentleman if I did not here quote his
