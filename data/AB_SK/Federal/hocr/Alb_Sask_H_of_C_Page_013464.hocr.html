               <br />
               by a great many speakers that if this were

               done. separate schools in the Territories 
               <br />
               would be abolished. Of that I know nothing 
               <br />
               at all: but it does seem to me that if the 
               <br />
               memlwrs of that Legislature are competent 
               <br />

               petent to deal with the subject of educa-

               tion : and. for my part. I would vote to 
               <br />
               give them that authority. Now. why should 
               <br />
               this Parliament interfere in this matter at 
               <br />
               all ‘3 I think there is one very good rea- 
               <br />
               son, and that is that Parliament has inter- 
               <br />
               fered already. Parliament has imposed on 
               <br />
               those Territories. separate schools, and I 
               <br />
               think Parliament is the body to remove 
               <br />
               them. But it is said by some. and this is 
               <br />
               supposed to be a very strong argument: 
               <br />
               wait until a province is created. It has 
               <br />
               been replied to that by those who favour this 
               <br />
               amendment that if separate schools are 
               <br />
               allowed until that time. they will be for- 
               <br />
               ever fastened on that province by the con- 
               <br />
               stitution. That point I do not pretend to 
               <br />
               know anything about: but it did occur to 
               <br />
               me, in thinking on this question. that if 
               <br />
               separate schools were allowed by the con— 
               <br />
               stitution to remain in the Territories until 
               <br />
               that time, then the queStion of vested rights 
               <br />
               would be set up. I am satisﬁed of that in 
               <br />
               my own mind. Those who favoured separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools. while they might have no legal 
               <br />
               right to set up that contention. would. no 
               <br />
               doubt. set it up. and I would not blame 
               <br />
               them for doing so. If I were in their posi- 
               <br />
               tion, I would do the same thing; and if 
               <br />
               the separate schools were allowed to remain 
               <br />
               until that time, their case would be a strong 
               <br />
               one. So that. apart from the question of 
               <br />
               law or the question of the constitution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alto-v</span> 
               <br />
               gether. it appears to me that that is one 
               <br />
               strong argument why Parliament should 
               <br />
               act now. Then. it is said by some that. 
               <br />
               after all. everything that is wanted has. in 
               <br />
               effect. been accomplished by the Ordinances 
               <br />
               passed a year or two ago by the Legislature 
               <br />
               of the Territories. But I would point out 
               <br />
               that the right of that Legislation to do even 
               <br />
               that was questioned by those who are in 
               <br />
               favour of separate schools. A strong posi- 
               <br />
               tion was taken against the power of the 
               <br />
               North-west Legislature to enact those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ordin.</span> 
               <br />
               ances, and the Government have been appeal- 
               <br />
               ed to to veto them. And right here I want 
               <br />
               to say this: I give the Government great 
               <br />
               credit for the position they have taken on 
               <br />
               that question, and on the question of separ-

               the passage of this amendment. I am not

               prompted by any hostility to the Roman
