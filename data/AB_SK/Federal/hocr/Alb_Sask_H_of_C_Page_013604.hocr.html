               It is true that by special arrangement with

               <br />
               entrance into the Dominion was that in no 
               <br />

               a basis of confederation was adopted by the 
               <br />
               Quebec conference, in which the principle of 
               <br />
               representation was laid down, that principle 
               <br />
               was accepted after a time by the provinces of 
               <br />
               Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Sco- 
               <br />
               tla, but it was not accepted by us. We stood 
               <br />
               out for another standard and after a. long ﬁght 
               <br />
               we succeeded in securing a representation of 
               <br />
               six members for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">95,090</span> of a population; this, Sir, 
               <br />
               is quite another rule, and it is a rule or prin-

               One of the greatest obstacles to the scheme of 
               <br />
               confederation with this Island was the insist-

               ation by population should be part of the terms, 
               <br />

               In the ﬁrst place, I do not believe that the

               principle of representation by population is 
               <br />
