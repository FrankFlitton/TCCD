               election was annulled, and another election took 
               <br />
               place, when Mr. Mercier put another candidate in 
               <br />
               the ﬁeld, and that majority of 280 against him was 
               <br />
               turned into a minority of about 150. Take the 
               <br />
               County of Ottawa, which may surely be considered 
               <br />
               an English county. Mr. Cormier, in the general 
               <br />
               election, was returned by a fair majority, but the 
               <br />
               election was annulled, and in the election that 
               <br />
               followed Mr. Mercier’s candidate was returned 
               <br />
               by a majority of 1,200. In Brome, the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Lynch, in the general election, was returned 
               <br />
               by a majority of about 300. Mr. Lynch was 
               <br />
               appointed a judge, and an election was held last 
               <br />
               fall. Mr. Mercier put into the ﬁeld a candidate 
               <br />
               who had many disadvantages. He was not a resid- 
               <br />
               ent of the county while his opponent was ; he had 
               <br />
               also the disadvantage that, although a prohibition- 
               <br />
               ist, he had against him the Dominion Alliance, who 
               <br />
               chose to support the other candidate, in which, I 
               <br />
               may say by the way, I think they acted very un- 
               <br />
               fairly. What was the result of that election ? 
               <br />
               Notwithstanding those disadvantages, the majority 
               <br />
               of 300 against Mr. Mercier was reduced to 116. I 
               <br />
               will take a still more recent election to show that 
               <br />
               the policy of Mr. Mercier has been supported by 
               <br />
               the English minority of the Province of Quebec— 
               <br />
               the election in Quebec <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“lest.</span> Mr. Murphy was 
               <br />
               elected in the general election of 1886 by a majority 
               <br />
               of 5, and this winter he came before the people 
               <br />
               once more, when he was returned by a majority of 
               <br />
               nearly 200 ; and if we consult the returns we shall 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that in the three English polling sub-divisions 
               <br />
               he polled a very much larger majority than he had 
               <br />
               done in 1886. . Now, Sir, that is the expression of 
               <br />
               the sentiment of the English minority in the Pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec, and it is no argument to say that 
               <br />
               Mr. Mercier has been aggressive towards the Eng- 
               <br />
               lish people; but we have a right to deduce from 
               <br />
               these facts the conclusion that once more the 
               <br />
               argument of the hon. member turns against 
               <br />
               himself. Now, Sir, I will not enter into a dis- 
               <br />
               cussion of the arguments based on phrenology 
               <br />
               or on the formation of the French skull or the 
               <br />
               Saxon skull ; I think the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) did entire justice to that 
               <br />
               part of the subject. I must say that I regret very 
               <br />
               much that this question has come before the 
               <br />
               House, for two reasons : As was said by the hon. 
               <br />
               member from the North-VVest, who spoke yester- 
               <br />
               day, this measure should not have come from the 
               <br />
               quarter from which it has come. It comes before 
               <br />
               us under bad auspices. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,VVe</span> know, Sir, what are 
               <br />
               the aims of the hon. gentleman Who has brought 
               <br />
               it forward, and if I may judge from the facts and 
               <br />
               the arguments brought before us, I do not think 
               <br />
               he ever expected to carry the legislation he is pre- 
               <br />
               senting to this Parliament. We know that he has 
               <br />
               been more cautious in his expressions in this 
               <br />
               House than he has been elsewhere, but we have a 
               <br />
               right to go beyond this House. The speech which 
               <br />
               he has made in this House is very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> from 
               <br />
               what he said in this city before the Equal Rights 
               <br />

               <br />
               speech. In the beginning he says :

               <br />
               It has been pretended that the use of the French

               language in the North-VVest Territories practically 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               should say that it would die out of itself through 
               <br />
               not being used ; and later on, if the proportion of 
               <br />
               French in the population of the Territories goes on 
               <br />
               decreasing, and the French language is practically 
               <br />
               of no use, it might then be the time to ask for 
               <br />
               legislation; there would then be no protest from 
               <br />
               any quarter against it, and these disagreeable 
               <br />
               discussions and ﬁctions would be avoided. We are 
               <br />
               now asked to pass this legislation. I am convinced 
               <br />
               now, after hearing the hon. gentleman’s speech on 
               <br />
               that question, that to do so is perfectly impossible.

               It might, and I do not say that it will not,

               ultimately result in becoming a question of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights or a question of autonomy ; but I 
               <br />

               Mr. MILLS (Bothwell). We have heard so 
               <br />
               many criticisms on the Bill and the speech of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), 
               <br />
               that I confess I feel some reluctance in rising to 
               <br />
               discuss or criticise the speech which that hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman addressed to the House. I may say at the 
               <br />
               outset that the preamble to the Bill and the speech 
               <br />
               which was delivered in its support are of 
               <br />
               far greater consequence than the Bill itself. I re- 
               <br />
               gret the speech of the hon. member in introducing 
               <br />
               the Bill which we are now called upon to consider. 
               <br />
               That speech points, not simply to the disuse of the 
               <br />
               French language in the North—VVest Territories, 
               <br />
               but to its total disuse throughout the Dominion for 
               <br />
               social and literary as well as for ofﬁcial purposes. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman declared that we can only be- 
               <br />
               come politically united in one State by having but 
               <br />
               one language. The Bill of the hon. member, though 
               <br />
               but of little practical importance, is accompanied by 
               <br />
               a speech that the House cannot at all ignore. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has evinced the most bitter hostili 
               <br />
               to all his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fellow-countrymen</span> who speak the Frenc 
               <br />
               language, and who are of French origin. He, it 
               <br />
               seemed tome, in that speech, was far more anxious 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> wound the susceptibilities of his friends and 
               <br />
