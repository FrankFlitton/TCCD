               <br />
               general view of the situation as regards sheriffs and 
               <br />
               clerks. Dealing first with the remarks of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Yarmouth (Mr. Flint), I may say that 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sheriffs</span> are a. little better off in the territories 
               <br />
               than in some parts of the Dominion, for in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> 
               <br />
               territories, in addition to the fees, which are very 
               <br />
               liberal, they each receive a salary of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SM!)</span> a year. 
               <br />
               During a visit I paid to the North-\Vest I had 
               <br />
               the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">experience.</span> as was encountered by every 
               <br />
               Minister, namely, that at nearly every settlement I 
               <br />
               heard complaints of delay, of expense and inconve- 
               <br />
               nience inlitigatiou arising from the absence of de- 
               <br />
               puty sheriffs and deputy clerks. They all said: 
               <br />
               “ We wanta sheriff : we want a clerk." I explained 
               <br />
               that the policy was to havea sheriff for each <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span> 
               <br />
               trict ; but I saw no reason why a deputy sheriff 
               <br />
               should not be appointed at each place. The North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vest~</span> Assembly has to enact the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sheriﬂ‘s’</span> fees and 
               <br />
               to pass an Act regulating the number of deputy 
               <br />
               sheriffs and deputy clerks, and to provide a scale 
               <br />
               of remuneration for the officers, and the whole

               came for the creditor in Edmonton to get

               forced by the deputy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sherifl‘.</span> But in order to carry 
               <br />
               out that system we must give the Local Assembly

               power not. only to say what. they shallbe paid, but 
               <br />
               to prescribe their duties, and unless this isdone the

               deputy clerk would have no power to issue a writ

               Mr. MILLS (Bothwell). These provisions of the

               North-West Territories Act were inserted at a 
               <br />

               ture.were very much more limited than they are

               at present. When we. propose to confer upon them 
               <br />
               the power for the zulministration of justice in the

               North-West Territories, as an incident of that 
               <br />

               section 80 ought to be considered, and that our

               legislation shouid be of a temporary character, and
