               Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I feel that on 
               <br />
               an occasion like this even an old Politician like my- 
               <br />
               self might rise with a good deal of hesitation to 
               <br />
               address this House, and through this House, the 
               <br />
               country, upon, perhaps, one of the most important 
               <br />
               questions we have had before us since 1867. It 
               <br />
               is no ordinary matter that has been brought before 
               <br />
               our attention in this country, in which the popu- 
               <br />
               lation is composed of various races, and especially 
               <br />
               of two leading races, the French and the English, 
               <br />
               comprising, also, a population of different religious 
               <br />
               convictions, and having various interests in respect 
               <br />
               to education and language, and in respect to other 
               <br />
               matters which many large sections of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">popu-</span> 
               <br />
               lation consider of the most vital importance. 
               <br />
               Under these circumstances, it is natural that a 
               <br />
               member getting up to address this House should 
               <br />
               feel under considerable reserve and restraint in 
               <br />
               the expression of his opinions. Sir, I have felt 
               <br />
               that during the course of this debate a good 
               <br />
               deal of unnecessarily strong language has been 
               <br />
               used, and I will take this opportunity of saying in 
               <br />
               the beginning—as my remarks will not be long on 
               <br />
               this occasion—that I think a good deal of unneces- 
               <br />
               sary severity has been shown in regard both to the 
               <br />
               motives and the language of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). I do not sym- 
               <br />
               pathise with those who ﬁnd fault with that hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, if he has acted on his convictions, in 
               <br />
               taking the course he has done ; and while I dissent 
               <br />
               from the Bill which he has introduced, and shall 
               <br />
               vote against it if an opportunity is offered, I am 
               <br />
               .not one of those who would blame that hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man for taking the course that his convictions im- 
               <br />
               pel him to pursue; I am not one of those who 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd fault with his having the courage of his 
               <br />
               convictions and bringing this matter before the 
               <br />
               House. Sir, if there is one thing that recommends 
               <br />
               the onduct of a statesman to myself it is when he 
               <br />
               has he courage of his convictions, no matter 
               <br />
               whether it results in his unpopularity, no matter 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span> it results, as has been the case with that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, in his having had to sit under the 
               <br />
               most scathing denunciations and the most brilliant 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sarcasm,</span> such as have been directed against the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman from both sides of the House for 
               <br />
               the ﬁve days that this debate has lasted. I must 
               <br />
               say that I admire the courage and pluck which 
               <br />
               be displayed, and I admire the ability which he 
               <br />
               showed in ﬁghting the matter out to the bitter end. 
               <br />
               .I entirely dissent from the spirit and intention of 
               <br />
               this Bill, and, while I agree with those who believe 
               <br />
               that its introduction at the present time is calcu- 
               <br />
               lated to do harm in the country and raise strife,I can 
               <br />
               .ﬁnd no fault with the hon. gentleman—if he believes, 
               <br />
               .as he has stated to this House he does believe, that 
               <br />
               this course should be adopted and this Bill intro- 
               <br />
               duced—in regard to the course he has followed, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> it was his duty to bring the matter before

               considerable difﬁculty many years ago, in dealing 
               <br />
               with the questions of language and schools. One 
               <br />
               of the great difﬁculties we experienced in London, 
               <br />
               when we were preparing the Constitution of this 
               <br />
               Dominion to submit to the British Parliament for 
               <br />

               leader of the Government will agree that I do not 
               <br />
               exaggerate the facts when I say that these questions 
               <br />
               almost broke <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up,</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conference~and</span> those diﬁicul— 
               <br />
               ties arose out of these questions of language and 
               <br />
               schools. We felt the importance of conciliation 
               <br />
               and concession, the importance of conceding to the 
               <br />
               minority certain rights which they should enjoy, 
               <br />
               and the difﬁculty connected with this subject very 
               <br />
               nearly, as I have stated, broke up the conference 
               <br />
               in London. I realised then, that the people of 
               <br />
               Canada were composed mainly of two races, and, I 
               <br />
               admit, that I was not so liberal-minded then as now, 
               <br />
               and did not realise the difﬁculties as strongly as I 
               <br />
               do to-day. With respect to the amendment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub</span> 
               <br />
               mitted by the Minister of Justice, I have come to 
               <br />
               the conclusion, that, while I do not entirely con- 
               <br />
               cur with it, I am prepared to adopt a similar 
               <br />
               course to that which I followed in 1867 in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eng-</span> 
               <br />
               land—to accept it as probably the best solution pre- 
               <br />
               sented of the question under consideration. I 
               <br />
               have, myself, given this matter some little consider- 
               <br />
               ation, and several days ago I prepared a resolution 
               <br />
               which I thought would meet the wishes of the House. 
               <br />
               I may state, that I should prefer this resolution 
               <br />
               to be adopted rather than that of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, but I do not see any chance of this being 
               <br />
               done, and, therefore, I am prepared to give my 
               <br />
               approval to the motion of the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, not as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affording</span> a perfect solution, but as 
               <br />
               one affording a temporary solution of these diﬂicul- 
               <br />
               ties which now stare us in the face in this Canada 
               <br />
               of ours. If the amendment of the hon. Minister 
               <br />
               should fail, and I should have an opportunity to 
               <br />
               submit my resolution to the House, I will do so. 
               <br />
               It is in the following terms :——— 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That at. present it is inex edient to further amend 
               <br />
               the Act relating to the Nort <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'West</span> Territories, but the

               I do not suppose I will obtain an opportunity to 
               <br />
               present my motion, for I believe there is sufﬁcient

               <br />
               moved by the Minister of Justice. What I am 
               <br />
