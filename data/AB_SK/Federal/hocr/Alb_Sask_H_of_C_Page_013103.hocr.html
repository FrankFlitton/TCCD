               <br />
               were not settled with until <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">18%;</span> and, as my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) very wisely and very well 
               <br />
               pointed out, the half-breeds in the N orth-West were a dif- 
               <br />
               ferent class, in a way, from the half-breeds in Manitoba, 
               <br />
               they were in the same position with regard to the half- 
               <br />
               breeds in Manitoba as the Blackfeet Indians would hear to 
               <br />
               the Cree Indians; consequently, when a settlement was 
               <br />
               made with the half-breeds in Manitoba, it did not 
               <br />
               follow that a settlement was made with the half- 
               <br />
               breeds in the North-West—in fact, it rather follows 
               <br />
               that a settlement was not made with them, as no 
               <br />
               steps were taken to settle their claims. I should like, 
               <br />
               therefore, to hear the hon. Minister express himself in a 
               <br />
               manner that will enable me to say to my half-breed friends 
               <br />
               in the North-West that they are likely to get scrip; 
               <br />
               because no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settle</span> ment has been made with them, they had 
               <br />
               no word in making the treaty as to surrendering their 
               <br />
               rights ; they accepted What was given them, but with this 
               <br />
               protest, they demanded that this scrip should be issued to 
               <br />
               all children who were born at the time of settlement. 
               <br />
               The next question I wish to come to is the liquor question. 
               <br />
               Ever since <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span> was granted to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maple</span> of the 
               <br />
               N orth-West in the local assembly, this has been a question 
               <br />
               of more or less interest. I was a member of that assembly 
               <br />
               some years ago, in the earlier days of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative</span> govei n- 
               <br />
               ment in the North-West, and memorials were forward- 
               <br />
               ed to Ottawa every year on this question. I think it is 
               <br />
               only natural that this shou'd bethe case, when you consider 
               <br />
               the relative position of' the people in the North West and 
               <br />
               the people in the rest of Canada. On this question there 
               <br />
               is an arbitrary Act which applies to the people of the North- 
               <br />
               West, and to them only, affecting their comforts and their 
               <br />
               every day life; and this arbitrary Act was passed by a 
               <br />
               Parliament in which the people to whom alone it applies 
               <br />
               had no voice. Consequently, I maintain that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">became</span> an 
               <br />
               unconstitutional Act as soon as representation was 
               <br />
               given to the North-West in this House. The hon. mem 
               <br />
               here who, with me, have represented the N orth- West in 
               <br />
               this House, for the last three Sessions, have always been 
               <br />
               directing attention to this matter, and the N orth-West 
               <br />
               Assembly has now placed itself on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">record</span> with regard to 
               <br />
               it. What <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> y demand is that either this question be sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to a popular vote, so that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maple</span> themselves may 
               <br />
               decide it, or that the N orth-West Territories be placed in 
               <br />
               the same position as the older Provinces in respect to the 
               <br />
               license question, and the admission of liquor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span> the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. I, myself, would go even a little further, and say 
               <br />
               that there is a third alternative which, I think, would be 
               <br />
               better still, and that is, to refer the liquor question to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{North-West</span> Assembly, and give them power to deal with 
               <br />
               It. My reason is that I believe that the people of the 
               <br />
               North-West are sumciently intelligent to know themselves 
               <br />
               a great deal better than anyoue else what would be best fer 
               <br />
               them in this respect. At the same time, if a license system 
               <br />
               is established in the North- West, it would be necessary, I 
               <br />
               presume, to follow the rule that applies to other Provinces, 
               <br />
               and to grant the fees, &amp;c., collected for licenses within the 
               <br />
               Territory to the North-West Government ; so, I think that, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Perhaps</span> the fairest way of settling this question would be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">119</span> give the North-West Assembly power to deal with the 
               <br />
               liquor question. While I am on this subject I would point 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out.</span> that there is a great diﬂ‘erence between the way in 
               <br />
               which the liquor question stands in the older Provinces, and 
               <br />
               the way in which it stands in the North-West. In the older 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               them. In older Provinces you can manufacture liquor and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{on</span> can export it, but in the North-West you are allowed 
               <br />
               y a permit from the Lieutenant Governor, to import it, 
               <br />
               but you are not allowed to manufacture it, and that is a 
               <br />
               very remarkable diﬂ‘erence. Now, we who live in the 
               <br />
               North-West think that we ought to be allowed to manu- 
               <br />
               facture the liquor that we are now allowed to import. We 
               <br />
               think that long ago we might have been allowed to manu- 
               <br />
               facture the beer that was imported into the country, and I 
               <br />
               believe that if we had been allowed to manufacture beer 
               <br />
               and sell it, it would have been a very admirable thing, and 
               <br />
               probably would have prevented, in a great measure, the 
               <br />
               agitation that has now arisen throughout the North-West 
               <br />
               for an alteration in the liquor laws. Now, I just want to 
               <br />
               return to the question of the land board. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               from West Assiniboia thought it would be better if the land 
               <br />
               board were transferred further west, and located at Regina. 
               <br />
               For my part, I think it would be a very admirable thing to 
               <br />
               have the land board in a central place in the Territory, 
               <br />
               but if we want to makeit convenient to the pe0ple I am sure 
               <br />
               that the present location of the land board in Winnipeg 
               <br />
               is a great deal better, because at present Winnipeg is most 
               <br />
               accessible to the people in all parts of the Territory. Peo- 
               <br />
               ple coming from the northern districts, such as Touchwood 
               <br />
               Hills, Prince Albert, Batoche, and along the line of the 
               <br />
               Manitoba and N orth-Western Railway, when they come 
               <br />
               from their homes and reach a railway, would have to 
               <br />
               go back to Regina. The usual tendency is to go east to do 
               <br />
               their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">business,</span> but in that case they would have to go west 
               <br />
               to Regina, and then resume their journey again, retracing 
               <br />
               the distance they had already travelled. The land board 
               <br />
               is a great deal more accessible in Winnipeg, because it does 
               <br />
               away with this extra travel. I also wish to say a few 
               <br />
               words with reference to scrip <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l‘eing</span> granted to the 
               <br />
               North-West <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mounted</span> Police. During last Session of 
               <br />
               Parliament this matter came up on a motion of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend for West Assiniboia, and it was promised 
               <br />
               at that time that this question should be reconsidered. 
               <br />
               I urged at that time, very strongly, that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rcrip</span> should 
               <br />
               be given to the police, because I believed they deserved it. 
               <br />
               l‘hey are, as everybody knows, a very fine body of‘ men. 
               <br />
               They did their duty at the time of the rebellion, but before 
               <br />
               the rebellion occurred they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">d.d</span> a greater duty than they did 
               <br />
               even then, for they did a great Work for Canada. It is Well 
               <br />
               known that before the Indian Department was organised 
               <br />
               throughout the North West, the mounted police were station- 
               <br />
               ed at posts throughout that vast territory, and I believe 
               <br />
               the credit, in a great measure, is due to the police for 
               <br />
               having handled the Indians so well as to control the country 
               <br />
               without shedding a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">single</span> drop of blood. This is a matter of 
               <br />
               very great importance, although notice has not often been 
               <br />
               called to it, and therefore it may appear to be a very small 
               <br />
               matter. I believe the mounted police, from the very ﬁrst 
               <br />
               day they entered the country up to the present time, have 
               <br />
               done their duty thoroughly, and are as much entitled to 
               <br />
               scrip for services rendered during the rebellion as were 
               <br />
               the provisional corps sent up there from Kingston, Quebec, 
               <br />
               Toronto and other places which received <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scrip.</span> They are 
               <br />
               all alike enrolled to serve the interests of the Dominion at 
               <br />
               large, and whether they serve in the North-West or in the 
               <br />
               older Provinces, still they are doing their duty by their 
               <br />
               country, and if’ rewards are going I think it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">isonlya</span> matter 
               <br />
               of justice that all the corps should be rewarded alike.
