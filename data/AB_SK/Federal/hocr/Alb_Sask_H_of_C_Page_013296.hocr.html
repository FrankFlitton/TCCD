               to the sentiment of justice in this House whose

               most noble prerogative is the protection of the 
               <br />
               weak. Now, Mr. Speaker, I wish to answer some 
               <br />
               of the assertions made by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) in the last speech he 
               <br />
               has made in support of the Bill. This hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber looks as if he believed that the Protestants are 
               <br />
               frightfully maltreated in the Province of Quebec— 
               <br />
               that we render their existence very bitter. Let 
               <br />
               us settle at once this point. There are in our 
               <br />
               Province 188,309 Protestants and 1,170,718 Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics according to the census of 1881. The 
               <br />
               Protestants, therefore, only represent 13per cent. , or 
               <br />
               one-seventh of the total population of our Pro- 
               <br />
               vince. They are only in the majority in the Coun- 
               <br />
               ties of Compton, Stanstead, Brome, Missisquoi, 
               <br />
               Huntingdon and Argenteuil. Nevertheless, they 
               <br />
               have ten representatives. In these six counties the 
               <br />
               Protestants have only a majority of 2,136 and are 
               <br />
               in the minority in Sherbrooke, Montreal West, 
               <br />
               Pontiac and Megantic, so that they would have a 
               <br />
               right only to six members instead of ten, if they 
               <br />
               were excluded from representation in those coun- 
               <br />
               ties where they are in the minority. I may also 
               <br />
               add that, since Confederation, several counties, 
               <br />
               whose population is wholly Catholic, have elected 
               <br />
               English Protestant members. I can mention the 
               <br />
               following names : Mr. Clarence Hamilton was 
               <br />
               elected in the County of Bonaventure; Mr. W. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Price,</span> for Chicoutimi and Saguenay; the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Joly for Lotbiniere; Mr. Heinming and Mr. 
               <br />
               Watts, for Drummond and Arthabaska ; the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Church for the County of Ottawa ; the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W'urtele</span> for the County of Yamaska; the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ron.</span> D. A. Boss for the County of Quebec ; and 
               <br />
               Mr. Pozer for Beauce. This shows that the French- 
               <br />
               Canadians are not prejudiced in the matter of their 
               <br />
               representatives. It is the same thing in the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council, which is composed of 24 
               <br />
               members. According to population, the Protes- 
               <br />
               tants, only forming one~seventh of the Province, 
               <br />
               would only have a right to but three Legislative 
               <br />

               <br />
               But there is more to say. In the ﬁve divisions repre- 
               <br />
               sented by Protestants the majority is Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic. The Protestants are only as 34 to 1000f the

               population. In 1878, we had, in the person of Mr. 
               <br />
               J oly,a Protestant, as FirstMinister. The Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Joly is a man among the Protestants who occupies 
               <br />
               the best position in the Province of Quebec. Was 
               <br />
               there ever complaint made that a Protestant was at 
               <br />
               the head of affairs in the Province of Quebec ? No, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker; but the English Tories endeavored 
               <br />
               to excite the national prejudices of the French 
               <br />
               Canadians, by throwing into their teeth the sneer 
               <br />
               that they had a Protestant at the head of the 
               <br />
               Government. Now, turning to the school question, 
               <br />
               let us see in what manner Protestants are treated 
               <br />
               in the Province of Quebec. I Will not give my own 
               <br />
               opinion, but I am going to quote an opinion which 
               <br />
               will not be gainsaid by any one. It is that of the 
               <br />
               Rev. Mr. Rexford, the secretary of the Pro- 
               <br />
               testant section of the Council of. Public Instruction 
               <br />
               in the Province of Quebec. In the course of last 
               <br />
               summer in the Province of Ontario they carried on 
               <br />
               an anti-French and an anti—Catholic campaign. At 
               <br />
               this juncture, they represented the Government of 
               <br />
               the Province of Quebec as a Government which 
               <br />
               Wished to drive out all the Englishmen from the 
               <br />
               country. The leader of the Government addressed 
               <br />
               a letter to the Rev. Mr. Rexford, in which he 
               <br />
               asked him for certain imformation respecting Pro- 
               <br />
               testant public education in the Province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               Mr. Rexford answered by the following .letter dated
