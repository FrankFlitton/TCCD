               had no other object than that. I cannot believe

               <br />
               ible for the rebellion. I remember when that hon.

               gentleman stood up in this House, and made a

               bringing about the rebellion. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               should not attempt to remove so important a

               Mr. COOK. I read the hon. gentleman’s speech,

               and thought I was correct, but of course I accept 
               <br />
               his statement. I regret also to have to refer 
               <br />
               to the speech of the hon. the Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> have been supporting the cause 
               <br />
               which he supports. I believe it is the proper and

               just course to take in this House ; but I am afraid 
               <br />
               that, notwithstanding the usual calmness of the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, he was too inﬂammatory on that 
               <br />
               occasion. It was not the words so much as the 
               <br />
               manner, and the manner was very bad. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman should be a little more cautious, and if he 
               <br />
               had only read carefully and pondered over the 
               <br />
               speech made by the Governor General at Quebec, 
               <br />
               when he received the committee of Equal Righters 
               <br />
               there, and told them to be tolerant and go home 
               <br />
               and be good boys and not to do it again—if he 
               <br />
               had only used a little tolerance in his language, I 
               <br />
               think it would have been better for his cause in 
               <br />
               this House. I am very sorry to say that I believe 
               <br />
               that it was the means of diverting from the cause 
               <br />
               he has at heart some members on both sides of 
               <br />
               this House—although I will not say so, because, 
               <br />
               probably, I am not entitled to say much on that 
               <br />
               point. Sir, I would just refer, while we are upon 
               <br />
               this French question, to the fact that a 
               <br />
               great many members in this House and 
               <br />
               people throughout the country who read the 
               <br />

               <br />
               slighting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms-MI</span> will not say the members of 
               <br />
               this House, but I know that many people in this 
               <br />
               country speak of the French in such terms. Now, 
               <br />
               I have been associated with the French more or 
               <br />
               less all my life, and it is not necessary for me to 
               <br />
               vindicate their habits and course of life, or any- 
               <br />
               thing of that sort, or their motives. But there is 
               <br />
               one thing that we owe to the French people of this 
               <br />
               country, and it is a debt of gratitude, after passing 
               <br />
               the loyal resolution to Her Majesty that we had 
               <br />
               the privilege of doing here a short time ago. If it 
               <br />
               had not been for the United Empire loyalists, of

               <br />
               blood, rebellion and civil war. As the Premier said

               to-night, supposing anything of that sort should 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               The Secretary of State has passed an Act to pro- 
               <br />
               hibit the Chinese ; perhaps he had better include 
               <br />
               gentlemen of this class, gentlemen who are agita- 
               <br />
               tors; but my hon. friend, when he was imported, 
               <br />
               was so small that we could not have told whether 
               <br />
               he was an agitator or not. Now, Sir, it has been 
               <br />
               said that the Premier of this country is very de- 
               <br />
               sirous that the Local Government of Ontario 
               <br />
               should not be sustained. It has been stated that 
               <br />
               “ Mowat must go.” That is an old saying, an old 
               <br />
               by-word, but as yet he has not gone. Now, 
               <br />
               some people are wicked enough to say that even Mr. 
               <br />
               Meredith is included in this controversy. We know 
               <br />
               he made a speech on this very line in the city of 
               <br />
               London ; but, if he takes that ground, I will guar-

               antee that he will not be successful at the next 
               <br />
               general election. Sir, it has been stated by some of 
               <br />
               our friends—and I differ with the greater number 
               <br />
               of my friends in that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respectwthat</span> we, as a party,

               we know from his organs, and from his speeches all 
               <br />
               along the line, that unless his words belie his 
               <br />
               meaning, he proposes to exterminate the French 
               <br />
               language throughout the length and breadth of 
               <br />
               this Dominion. Now, suppose that provincial rights 
               <br />
               were extended to cover this question of race. In 
               <br />
               Lower Canada the English language might be 
               <br />
               expunged, and What would be the result? The 
               <br />
               result would be that the English people of Ontario 
               <br />
               would not submit to that, and civil war would 
               <br />
               he sure to take place, and the result would be 
               <br />
               disastrous. Why, Sir, this is a wicked thing, 
               <br />
               when you come to look at it. When you come to 
               <br />
               look at it in all its phases, when you see that the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman intends to set race against race, 
               <br />
               and religion against religion, and when all men 
               <br />
               will have hold of each other’s throats, you see that 
               <br />
               it is a wicked thing. Now, I do not like the motion 
               <br />
