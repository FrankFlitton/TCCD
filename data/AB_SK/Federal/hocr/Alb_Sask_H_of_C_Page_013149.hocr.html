               hon. gentleman, with his Equal Rights principles, 
               <br />
               says : “ You shall not say a word, unless you utter

               political career will last very long. Fanaticism has 
               <br />

               <br />
               all its force. What has that population in the North—

               they have to obey? The only thing that they have 
               <br />
               done to the hon. gentleman is this, that their blood 
               <br />
               is not his blood. It is not their fault if they have 
               <br />
               not the blue blood of the hon. gentleman. Their 
               <br />
               blood is the blood that their good mothers gave 
               <br />
               them, and that blood is French. They were born 
               <br />

               <br />
               different parts of this continent, especially from 
               <br />
               Quebec. They went up there knowing that the 
               <br />
               subjects of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen 
               <br />
               had the right, under the laws of the Kingdom, 
               <br />
               to speak in French, provided they did not 
               <br />
               speak treason. These men have not spoken 
               <br />
               treason. The hon. gentleman has never stated 
               <br />
               that in his Bill, or in his speech. He 
               <br />
               dare not say so; because these men, I may tell 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman, from ﬁrst to last, up there, 
               <br />
               and in all the Provinces of the Dominion, are as 
               <br />
               loyal subjects of the Queen as the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               is, or his children, or his ancestors. We do not 
               <br />
               boast of our loyalty as French Canadians; because 
               <br />
               it is in our hearts ; it is in our veins. It is a duty 
               <br />
               on our part; because we are well governed and 
               <br />
               well protected by the laws of England, and by our 
               <br />
               Most Gracioiis Queen. It is a question of love with 
               <br />
               us, and we love our Queen, and we love our 
               <br />
               country; we are loyal to our Queen and loyal to 
               <br />
               our country. Why should we be treated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ-</span> 
               <br />
               ently from you, Englishmen; from you, Scotch- 
               <br />
               men; from you, Irishmen; from you, Scandina- 
               <br />
               vians ; from you, Germans? Is your blood better

               <br />
               your ancestorsbetterthan ours? Mr. Speaker, Ihope 
               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman Will excuse me if I say, 
               <br />
               no. They are as good as ours; but ours are as 
               <br />
               good as theirs. Sir, I feel keenly on this question ; 
               <br />
               because my race is a sensitive race; it is a proud 
               <br />
               race. I do not speak of the others. I have no 
               <br />
               doubt that they are as proud and as sensitive as 
               <br />
               mine. But we do not like to be attacked ; we do 
               <br />
               not like to be sneered at and to be humiliated, 
               <br />
               especially by the hon. gentleman, who has no 
               <br />
               right to speak in that way, or to sneer at us. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman tries to ﬁnd standing ground, 
               <br />
               and the position he takes is this: that the use of 
               <br />
               the two languages is expensive. That is one of the 
               <br />
               reasons he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offers</span> for his action. Expensive in what 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manner“?</span> At this time there is no French Cana- 
               <br />
               dian who speaks his language in the North-West 
               <br />
               Assembly, but a French Canadian spoke it in the 
               <br />
               last Legislative Assembly, and others will speak it 
               <br />
               in the Assembly after the next election, because 
               <br />
               there must be some, the hon. gentleman may depend 
               <br />
               on that ; for although he may choke some French 
               <br />

               Canadians, he cannot choke enough to have the 
               <br />

               <br />

               the sake of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400</span> a year, need not be called upon

               to pay this amount, and, if the hon. gentleman is

               afraid it will not be paid, I am ready to enter into

               January each year. But that is all a sham. It is 
               <br />
               not for that purpose the hon. gentleman has taken 
               <br />
               action-—he has another purpose in view. He 
               <br />
               wants to tyrannise over the French Canadians of 
               <br />
               this country, he does not like them, he hates them 
               <br />
               —-he hated them from the moment he came into 
               <br />
               Parliament. He showed it once—he must remem— 
               <br />
               ber it—ina certain place where we were all congre- 
               <br />
               gated, and from that moment he saw that having 
               <br />
               shown his hatred to our race he could never recover 
               <br />
               the good graces of that race, unless he made the 
               <br />
               amende honorable. He did not Wish to do that, he 
               <br />
               would not apologise; but he said: “ I will be an 
               <br />
               enemy to that race so long as I sit in this House.” 
               <br />
               But others have adopted the same course, and they 
               <br />
               have not succeeded any more than the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man will succeed on this occasion. The object, 
               <br />
               however, of the hon. gentleman is disclosed in the 
               <br />
               preamble of his Bill. He seeks to introduce the 
               <br />
               thin end of the wedge, and, if he succeeds in that, 
               <br />
               then he will go a little further and seek to destroy 
               <br />
               the race from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-West</span> to the Atlantic. I

               defy the hon. gentleman to do it ; that is more

               than his strength can accomplish, and he will not 
               <br />
               succeed. He may destroy a few French Canadians 
               <br />
               in the far-away N orth-West, but he may be sure of 
               <br />
               this, that, if he closes the mouths of our people in
