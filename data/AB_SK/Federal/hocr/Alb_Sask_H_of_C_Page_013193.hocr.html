               <br />
               importance to us. It is also stated that the United

               <br />
               declaration often made by the mover of this Bill, 
               <br />
               not only while introducing it, but on several oc-

               casions before, protesting that to the course which 
               <br />
               he had adopted for himself, and of which this is only 
               <br />
               the preliminary step, he was impelled by no other 
               <br />
               motive than a desire, a lofty desire, of securing 
               <br />
               the future of this country from dissension, and of 
               <br />
               ensuring peace and harmony by removing all causes

               of contention, I would be sorry that the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, harboring in his heart aims so high, 
               <br />
               should have endeavored to accomplish them by 
               <br />
               means so selﬁsh, and so ungenerous, as those which 
               <br />
               underlie the measure which he has brought before 
               <br />
               the House. When, however, the hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               in order to ﬁnd a motive for the measure to which 
               <br />
               he called the attention of the House, invokes con- 
               <br />
               siderations of such far-reaching prudence, he is 
               <br />
               simply deluding himself. The hon. gentleman, no 
               <br />
               doubt, may persuade himself, but he will with 
               <br />
               difﬁculty convince those to whom he has been ad- 
               <br />
               dressing himself, that his ultimate object in this 
               <br />
               matter is simply to secure the future peace and 
               <br />
               harmony of this country, while his present action 
               <br />
               must tend to endanger the peace and harmony 
               <br />
               which happily prevail. I can ﬁnd nothing in 
               <br />
               this Bill, I must say, but the old, old spirit of 
               <br />
               domination and intolerance which, in this land, 
               <br />
               and in other lands, has always characterised the 
               <br />
               course of pure, unadulterated Toryism. This 
               <br />
               measure, taken by itself, disconnected from the 
               <br />

               <br />
               servative party. And yet in those days, and as long 
               <br />
               as that race gave his party nearly the whole weight 
               <br />
               of their inﬂuence, we never heard of any danger to 
               <br />
               Canada from this French national cry. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those.</span> 
               <br />
               days the sensitiveness of the hon. gentleman, now 
               <br />
               so easily alarmed, did not seem to be in the least 
               <br />
               concerned. Nay, more, my fellow-countrymen of 
               <br />
               French origin, on the same side of the House to 
               <br />
               which he belongs, could appeal, and did appeal, to 
               <br />
               all the prejudices of my own race ; but that was a 
               <br />
               legitimate warfare, because the national cry was 
               <br />
               made to do service in behalf of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conservative:</span> 
               <br />
               party, to give them ofﬁce, and to procure for them 
               <br />
               the direct and indirect proﬁts of oﬂice. The speech 
               <br />
               delivered the other night by my hon. friend, the 
               <br />
               Minister of Public Works, and to which, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must;</span>

               <br />
               friend rom North Oxford (Mr. Sutherland), was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">simply,</span> in condensed form, the food which, for 
               <br />
               the last twenty-ﬁve years, has been served up 
               <br />
               ev day by the Conservative ministerial press <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of‘</span>

               <br />
               one word was ever heard as to any danger to Can- 
               <br />
               ada from this national cry. But matters are altered 
               <br />
               to-day. To-day the French Canadians are no longer 
               <br />
               a unit in their support of the Conservative party ; 
               <br />
               and what was commendable, or at least unobjec-
