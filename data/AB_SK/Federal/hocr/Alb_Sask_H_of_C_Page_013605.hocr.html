               this idea. To follow the unit of representa-

               tion as in Quebec with 65 members would 
               <br />
               render the whole scheme with regard to 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island absurd. Because, if 
               <br />
               Quebec were as thickly populated as Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island, we should have 65—152 of a 
               <br />
               unit of representation, because Quebec is 152 
               <br />
               times as large as Prince Edward Island. 
               <br />
               We would not have half the population to 
               <br />
               make up one unit of representation, and so 
               <br />
               we should be deprived of representation alto- 
               <br />
               gether. It is absurd to suppose that such a 
               <br />
               thing could have been intended when Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island entered confederation. Then, 
               <br />
               there are the reports of the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               ference and the speeches in the local legis- 
               <br />
               lature repudiating representation by popu- 
               <br />
               lation; and, finally, we have a telegram, just 
               <br />

               confirming a representation of six members 
               <br />
               as its representatives had been asking for. It 
               <br />
               was ﬁve years after the formation of the

               I think this will be very clearly seen upon

               Now, to go back to the Quebec conference

               <br />
               Edward Island entering the union was the 
               <br />
               matter of representation. The position 
               <br />
               which our delegates took at that convention 
               <br />
               was ﬁrm and decided. They realized what 
               <br />
               that union might mean in the matter of re- 
               <br />
               presentation to a small province and one 
               <br />

               <br />
               rest of the Dominion, as Prince Edward Is- 
               <br />
               land was at that time. They insisted that 
               <br />
               the system of representation by population 
               <br />
               should not be applied to so small a province 
               <br />
               with no territory to enlarge her borders, no 
               <br />
               mines, and cut off from the mainland by a 
               <br />
               barrier of ice which would interfere with 
               <br />
               the development of manufacturing indus- 
               <br />
               tries on the island. They insisted on six 
               <br />
               members as a status before Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island should enter the union. They fur- 
               <br />
               ther contended that Prince Edward Island, 
               <br />
               having three counties should have two 
               <br />
               members for each county. These counties 
               <br />
               had been established for many years, and 
               <br />
               each had its own institutions and should have 
               <br />
               equal representation in the House, two 
               <br />
               members for each. In proof of what I 
               <br />
               am saying I shall take the liberty of reading 
               <br />
